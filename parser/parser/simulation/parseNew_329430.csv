												If you are new to ""State of Decay"" then buy it.If you want mods then DON'T BUY IT, cause only the first release-version will work with mods!If you already have the first release, this is just a bug-fix... a patch which they let you pay for it.--> If you are a real fan of this game and want a graphics engine that works smoother and gives you much less motion sicknes... than the old release... then buy it!--> I had the first release, and yes this is a bug fixed better version... better and smoother playable on PC, and the light is finally what it should have been from the start.Is it greed to let people pay for a bug-fix.... YES IT IS.Great Game, but greedy developer.Addendum: November-2015Well it seem all the negative reviews made the dev work on their product, finally there is many bug-fixes (as the second release had still so many bugs from the original), and improvements, maybe telling the devs ""NO WAY!"" does work, and has some impact... fine :) Is there hope?!

												I'll start by saying I loved the original State of Decay and the two DLC's, I loved them to death so much I bought them twice.  Once for the Xbox 360 and once for the PC.  Now I can say I purchased them a third time, because this one is esstentially the same as the original and the DLC.When I started to hear news of a newer updated version of the game my heart skipped a beat.  Maybe we'd finally get a version of the game that wasn't handicapped by the outdated consoles they were created for.   Did I get that.. well the answer is a yes, and a no.  While the game looks far better than the previous version, it just isn't worth recommending for a full price purchase if you already own the original game.If you don't own the original already, this is a good deal, you get the base game and all the DLC and the patches and bug fixes which were never brought to the original game.  Excuses are just that excuses, saying the patches and bugs weren't possible to fix because the game was restricted by the console release... WHY?  This isn't a console, it's the PC.  Those excuses don't work on this format..Bottom line remains, if you own State of Decay.. save your money, if you don't own the game, the YOSE is the way to go.  Great value for your money, but this HD upgrade was totally  unnecessary and the bugs/glitches should have been fixed in the previous version.			"

												Don't buy it. Nothing is remastered here, its all a lie.There is only 3 little changes in the game that arent worth it if you alredy own the first one.They increased shadow resolution, added few more particles in some areas and adjusted contrast and bright for better view. All of which could have been done with a simple update. In fact, some of those settings can be changed with ENB series.If you never bough the original game, go for it, it still a good game.If you already have it, nothing new to see here, dont waste your money.And for the devs, I would feel really ashamed of selling the same game to the users that helped you to grow and gain popularity buying your product. I dont think that your userbase deserves such bad behavior and scam from you all.Too bad I couldnt play the game till few days ago even tho I had preordered it, otherwise I would surely asked for the Steam refund without doubt.

												Remastered? More like Slap in your face pay for a major patch that should have been what we call PC GAME VERSION of the game.If you don't have this game, you will surely enjoy it this game is amazing. HOWEVER, for those veterans who do own it along with every other dlc before...I am not easily impressed, and this so-called version carries minor updates that should have been. THE PC VERSION of the game IN THE FIRST PLACE. Do you really want to support ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ports of games and then having it rerelease on you with some major updates and fixes as ""Remasters""? Do you want more game devs doing this more in the future? Are you going to give in?Sorry No! I will not, and I'll stand against it as I will not be adding anymore hours to this game, and that is how  I'll show my defiance. You can have My 20 dollars smeared with crap for free. For you have no strings on me.(When the update goes for the reasonable price I'll play this with the rest of you but until then I suggest holding for it, Won't change my review or what transpired however.)


Not playing this game in my defiance. Deleted.

YouTube™ Video: State of Decay Year one Survival Edition PC REVIEW 

			Views: 4,423		

			My thoughts on State of Decay Year One survival Edition? No. My steam review is listed on the bottom, the top is actual gameplay from the game The remaster was not at all impressive to me and hence...		

Pros + Looks better than the original, supporting 1080p, Lighting and texture looks better, and it runs better at 60 fps.+ New animations and rework, but you wouldn't notice them much+ New missions added in order to entice you to play again+ All dlcs in one pack read to go!+ The game itself has fantastic game play, mechanics, etc. we know this because we've played it. We know this game is great, a year ago or so. Cons - Doesn't feel like a remaster as they claim, a remaster is a perfection of their game and does more than just blow the game 1080p and adding some side missions, bells and whistles here and there.- My titan X is sitting here cold at 1080p because it doesn't support 4k? WTF! The textures are also horrible!.- Some of the bugs in the original carried over insanely laughable, I caught them while starting the game and added it to my video. Zombie glitching around is some examples.- Remastering applies to certain things such as music, some voices, etc.- No multiplayer can ever be implemented in this game (Saw that video)- Charging players for this Update of the game and cutting away the original support ( The main game is gone from the store you can only get the dlcs for the original, but it will be no longer supported in any way or form you have to upgrade to this version for that) You can, however, purchase the original from HUMBLE BUNDLE and add key to steam.- Promises that was told and unkept. They never came to be.- Calling it and emphasizing remaster to insult those that own and know what remasters are in their collections. (Homeworld, Tombraider anniversary collections, etc.)- Veteran players who own the game, do the math on how much you are paying for this game along with having the original+dlc already (This was posted on the forums, 50+$)Game is targeted for new audience.That's all I'll have to say. At least unlike the other reviewers with thumbs up and positive.  I am honest because I have cash to waste on being honest about the game than sucking one for a review copy or  just defending my purchase like a fanboy and sheeps who have absolutely almost no class in what pc gaming quality is about.I am sincerely disappointed and I rarely am since I love video games, and I truly love playing games to review them for fun, however, I do have morals and ethics. I do have hours and hours in the original (Xbox Version), and I love the game but sorry I will not be supporting these types of re-release as legitimate remasters as I have many that do so in the category.By all means if you are a huge fan, love the game or never played it, then enjoy the product and do what you have to do and go ahead and play the game. Don't let my review stop you from what you are doing because it is my opinion, which is more important to me as yours is to you.I'll 100% support you guys again on your next game if you bring us a quality game, especially for the pc versions. Sorry dev do not take this personally, but I will be skipping on this art piece.			"

30+ hours inInitially, I liked Year One, but I cannot recommend it now that I've seen the bugs and how little content there was.tl;dr - almost every old bug still exists in the game. I paid good money to improve the game experience and all I got was this reskin (and some NEW bugs!).The base gameI enjoyed the base game with the upgraded visuals. There were also some mechanical tweaks (mainly the vehicles now handle according to Earth gravity) and lovely additions to the soundtrack; it wasn't a new experience, but an improved one. The Freaks got balanced, you didn't get as overwhelmed with tasks, the CLEO drops and reskins brought a little spice into things - it was quite nice revisiting the game I love, warts and all.The new content ran out a bit too quickly, however, and the endgame was boring with the last stretch of missions and looting a little flat as usual, but I felt it was okay value for 24 hours of gameplay. After all, I was getting 2 refreshed DLCs too, right?Dealbreaker DLCBut then there's Lifeline. My first three playthroughs had major game-breaking bugs, and the whole 'refreshed' DLC is riddled with old bugs that have been reported to UD Labs time and again. NOTHING has been fixed, and there is very little additional content for Lifeline - the reskins are lame and there are no new weapons (the CLEO ones suck compared to army stuff).I felt utterly cheated, still do after 8+ hours of gameplay.When Fighting 7/Bladed 7 Kung-Fu Vince falls through a bridge after exiting your vehicle and gets killed by a solo Feral under said bridge, you know your game is ♥♥♥♥ed. Never mind the CLEO missions that don't spawn, zombies that spawn inside the ground, disappearing items, worthless AI, Journal glitching out, wrong voice clips playing for your player character etc.This really put the base game into perspective for me, too. In the end, the improvements were marginal at best and left a lot to be desired.The bottom lineThis remake is way overpriced for what it is - reskins and some extra tunes. The mechanical tuning should have been done for the original, it was borderline bugfixing! I paid good money thinking I would get actual content and bugfixes/polish too, but NOPE. I still love the base game for what it is (it's complicated with Lifeline...), but if you're an old player, don't buy this for the full price, about 70% off would be fair.If you still want to play the same old game and can stand the bugs, that is.New players? Buyer beware. The base game is still one of the better zombie survival games and has unique mechanics that are quite enjoyable, but the devs don't seem to be interested in fixing and expanding the game - and that is a bad, bad sign.

												I have extremely mixed feelings about this game. I put a good amount of time in the ""original"" version and then went on to get this one while I had major discounts on YOSE. Yeah, you read that right - major discounts. Here is why I'm conflicted, but ended up not recommending it.The original state of decay (no longer being sold as of YOSE release) was a game that was quite unique. A third person survival game with base defence, the need to gather resources which are actively used each ""day"", perma-death, social problems (such as people becoming suicidal or overly problematic anger problems), cars, and rpg elements such as the ability to specialize in certain weapons such as: blunt, edged, pistols, shotguns, etc. I honestly cannot find another game like it, though I wish I could. (This is NOT like Dead State). All in all, quite the good game!However, with all good things there are bad. In this case, it's the company itself. When they released YOSE, I supported them due to their explainations. They (undead labs) partnered up with Microsoft and, instead of releasing patches to fix and add things, they decided to re-release the game which was a year old. People who owned the original had to purchase the new version. This sparked a lot of controversy, but I was willing to overlook the issues and even defended them on massive thread wars. But, the more I played it, the more I realized what was wrong.They claimed to have fixed the bugs. They claimed that they would support this version. They claimed a lot, but delivered very, very little. The only difference between YOSE and the original is a combat knife (if you are unarmed) which is useless, a few new weapons, all the car models do not look the same and that's.... pretty much it. Those bugs they squished? Nope. Still there - pretty much all of them. This includes such wonderful bugs as: getting stuck on curbs, having cars randomly twist spin into the air and land on their roofs causing them to explode, fps spike jitters (fps drops down really, really low), characters not responding to commands and continuing to do their last command such as run forward instead of turning around (not fun when you threw an explosive and your character auto runs into it while you're holding the back button), and more. They. Were. Not. Fixed. They even said that they fixed the keyboard and mouse controls - my friend got motion sick from the speed differences as it moves choppy one second and smooth the next. Speaking of keyboard controls, if you use a mouse and keyboard one of the ""specializations"" is completely, utterly and totally useless!!!!!!! If you put points into Rifles (as in hunting rifles) and you use a mouse and keyboard, you have wasted your specialization and you cannot unspec. What the specialization does is that it increases the ""snap headshot"" area and range. It has no effect on damage, recoil, range or anything else. It doesn't tell you what the ""snap"" is, so I looked it up and found out that it literally only works if you use a controller. The reason for this is because it is literally aim assist that auto-snaps to zeds heads. It does not work with M&K, nor are there any other perks for using it.To make matters worse, this version was hardly supported as well. Instead, they decided to work on their next money maker - State of Decay 2, which I will most likely only purchase on an extreme sale, if at all. Even their leadboards, which sparked controversy as well in a different way, were (I don't actually know if they are still) messed up. Example: My score got reset 3 times when I was going to get into first place. I was on level 13 breakdown (the endless mode, before it was ""updated"") and it claimed I had killed literally 0 zombies. Zero's acrossed the board, while on the lifeline dlc ""Undead Chris"" had saved over 10,000 civilians with the next person down (in 2nd place) being approximately 30.To close this somewhat confusing review, I guess I would summerize it as this. Is it a fun game? Yeah, I'm still putting time into it on and off as I already own it. Would I say that it was well made? The concept of the game and even it's playability (if you ignore the bugs) is quite good and enjoyable for someone like me. However, would I recommend the game to people? No, not unless it's on a mega-sale such as the Christmas or Summer sales. Do NOT purchase this game at full price if you intend to get it, and keep in mind that it will not get any more support.Oh, that leaderboard controversy I mentioned? The store page for State of Decay (the original version) stated something along the lines of ""Play with your friends!"" so people purchased the game thinking there was co-op. There is not, there never was intention and it was mistaken. This was before you could apply for refunds on steam, and people didn't want it if there was no co-op as it stated there was. Turns out, according to one of their people, that it meant with the LEADERBOARDS, NOT other players. So you could play AGAINST THEIR SCORE, but NOT with them. That was the controversy.			"

 Make a note First of all, if you already own the original game and every available DLC then don't bother buying this unless you are looking for slightly better graphics, a few new weapons and vehicle skins and bug fixes (and new bugs). The game is still pretty much the same experience. And here we go If you are  new  to this game and interested, then I'd most likely recommend buying it. Don't mind the negative reviews on this edition of the game. Instead read the ones on the original one (which is no longer available for purchase at the moment) since they tell more about the experience than these on YOSE. Why? Because most of these tell about how this edition was released only to make money out of small updates and about the bugs that make the game worse. The worst thing is that the original game is not receiving any of the new content and updates that are included in this edition. I can understand the pain and I agree that it's a horrible move, but I'd like to direct this short review specifically towards everyone who has no experience with the original game.I'll let you know about the game's basics and the good and the bad in short. State of Decay  The base game Survival in zombie apocalypse3rd person viewMelee weapons and gunsCarsCollecting loot (from food and medicine to weapons and building materials)Base managementExpanding your communityHelping your neighbors with problemsDoing missions that eventually lead to the end of the game YOSE Day One Edition 2x DLCs: Breakdown and Lifeline Improved graphicsAn exclusive characterTwo new gunsA new car and already existing vehicles with custom skinsNew missions (looting supply crates) The Good and The Bad  Pros +Looting and managing inventory is easy+Combat is alright+Base management is simple and clear+Vehicles are easy to control (most of the time)+Moving alone can actually be really dangerous (it's good to have someone with you)+Graphics are nice... Cons -...but they can get a bit ugly (for ex. in the woods)-Fighting with melee weapons gets repetitive-Missions also get repetitive-Simplicity is a minor impact-Voice acting is propably the most repetitive thing in the game and needs a bigger variety  (same sentences are repeated alot)-Vehicles feel a bit too fragile sometimes-The game is still screaming for co-op-Minor bugs that are close to breaking missions-Performance needs tweaking (fps drops) Nutshell Gameplay: 7.5/10Graphics: 8/10Sounds: 7.5/10 (Including voice acting)Performance: 7/10Story: 6/10 Conclusion Yes, State of Decay: YOSE Day One Edition was propably made only with money in mind and so it should propably be avoided by veterans unless you need this new content and bug fixes + the upcoming fixes for the new and old bugs. In the other hand, this is something that fans of survival games should look into. You can spend alot of time while playing this game. Even I spent over 12 hours on the base game and tried out one of the DLCs (Lifeline) that I have not played before (I did play the original game and the Breakdown DLC back in the day). The other DLC (Breakdown) will leave you with even more hours on your counter. All in all I had alot of fun playing this game. There were quite a few intense moments that are something I've never encountered in other survival games. I played this with a controller and I recommend you doing the same if you happen to have one.Newcomers 8/10 Veterans 5-6/10  ""The polished yet dirty version/edition of a fun game"" Please let me know if I missed anything. You are also free to give me your own opinions! :) Thank you  "

Posted: May 1, 2015
												As a returning player who loved the original State of Decay, let me be honest here, this is a completely unnecessary, controversial re-release that brings nothing of real value that would be so significant compared to the original that it would deserve its own release and the price, even with 33% discount is still way TOO much in terms of value for returning players.YOSE keeps crashing to desktop and overall feels as a slower, less optimized and just more bugged version compared to the original. People who purchase this game as newcomers to SoD ""franchise"" as well as the returning players deserve smooth and flawless gameplay for the money these developers ask for this game, unfortunately if you think that you're getting flawless game for your hard earned money, I have to disappoint you by saying you better forget it.As for the ""remaster"" aspect of this re-release, promise of the high quality textures is one of the biggest lies and not only you can see it for yourself in the parts of the game where textures are just ugly and you can't quite recognize what are you even looking at, but also according to developers themselves, PC release is smaller than Xbox One release because in PC release they didn't need to upgrade as many textures to higher quality as they needed to upgrade for Xbox One. This is interesting. Now I don't really own Xbox One, but I wonder if the Xbox One players really have the same ugly textures that show here in my PC version and while the fact that they did not upgrade as many textures for PC as they upgraded for Xbox One should naturally mean significantly lower price on PC, the price is the same even though the value added compared to original is clearly not that significant at all.Smaller difference in the quality compared to original equals smaller reason for anyone on PC to upgrade to YOSE, but wait. Can you really stay away of this re-release and just enjoy the original? According to some players, the original game won't launch for them anymore and as a matter of fact, the original game and its dlcs are replaced with YOSE, so there is no way to purchase the original anymore and no way for original owners to get the support unless they purchase YOSE! So much for optional purchase for the original owners...Let us put that aside and let me say what most of us think anyway, but nobody had the guts to say it out loud:Real fans of SoD expected more from the SoD ""franchise"" than just a re-release of the same thing they already have and losing the support for the original is a legitimate reason for fans of the original SoD to be mad as they are basically forced to upgrade to YOSE and pay for the same thing again if they don't want to lose support.In other words, for original fans it feels like being stabbed in our backs and I'm pretty sure that we all will remember this and keep it in mind from now on every time these developers bring a new game of any name.EDIT:To be completely fair, I love the little things they added exclusively for original owners and those who pre-order this game (new character who is already one leveled-up badass with unique weapons for original owners and special prepper pack for those who pre-ordered the game) and I also love CLEO items, but it still isn't that significant change that would justify the re-release and especially the price and just like many already said, not only bugs aren't fixed at all, but they somehow managed to introduce new bugs and crashes to desktop that basically render this overpriced re-release unplayable, isn't a ""definitive edition"" supposed to be clean of all the bugs present in the standard one?Speaking of bugs, here is a little peek...

												Don't buy this if you have the first game.Basically all that is changed is that the interface is a bit smoother, which should've been a nice patch to the first game and a texture upgrade, which they could've better sold as DLC for 5 euros on the first game.Very obvious behaviour from Undead Labs, when I saw this I already thought what I stated above, but I loved the game with mods so I figured having it with better textures and an improved game with enhanced mechanics would be even better, but I feel like it was just a dirty cash grab again.

												This edition is the second paid version the developer put on steam. While it pretty annoying by itself for having to pay for what is essentially a (performance?) update, it is rather unforgivable that this game still, in its present state, is extremely buggy; character floating in the air, running through solid walls, teleporting, etc. The sheer amount of this types of bugs I encountered is mind boggling. Arguable, there is a graphical update in this version, which makes everything a lot brighter, which in my opinion does not help the game. Let's not talk about game design, while it could have been a lot better, at least it does not totally ruin the game like the bugs do. With the exception of course, by the fact that your companions tend to run away or leave you while heading out. This is especially no fun when you try to clear out an infestation, raising the chances considerably to be overrun and die. The more so because you often don't notice that you're  left to your own!I would avoid this game, whether you played the original version or not.In comparison, I give Darksiders II Deathinitive Edition a thumbs up.

												The Reason why I don't recommend this game is because of its price, and the fact that it has little content added to the new one.Why I think this game is better than the original.                     - A few new Survivors.- New Weapons.- New Cars.- Many old bugs fixed (but new content creates more bugs)- Textures polished.- 1 extra mission.Why I dislike this one over the original.- Price is too high, 32 dollars for this, when I got the exact same just older for 20 dollars in 2013- There are still some bugs from the original game that plague this one- The survivors are still quite stupid, getting stuck on small objects on ground, and being unable to get into the car with me at certain times,What I think should have happened.- This should have been a update, or free for those who bought the original State of Decay - Could have charged the same original 20 dollars i paid in 2013 for those who are newOverall the game isn't bad, Its just why should you charge so much for the same game but with a few more items			"

												While I support everyone's cause to end developers with the $$ in their eyes, this is clearly not the right title to be doing it on and the people doing so are misinformed. TL;DR - Developers (who made the game) have no control over the business practice as this still is a Microsoft-published/controlled title. It's a stretch that Microsoft even let this game go on Steam, so don't expect any official support beyond what was already offered. Undead Labs aren't accountable here. This is the remaster of a previously 2-gig sized game, and you are getting out of it what you are willing to pay for it.I'm sitting here reading these ""most helpful"" reviews from people with much, much less than even 5 hours in the game (a lot of them ironically saying they 'haven't seen anything different or new content-wise yet'), while reviews that are simply people saying they can't start the game (likely because their graphics setup doesn't support Dx11/isn't updated) somehow got upvoted to the most helpful page. Meanwhile, it doesn't take much to see the shameless squad of review-skewers operating out of the vow to upvote every single negative post no matter how meaningless it is and downvote the opposite, so right now it's pretty hard to view an actual, thought-out review of this game (Obviously, don't pretend I'm somehow 'unbiased' or 'more correct' in this situation). I'm going to predict that the amount of people who downvote this post within the next several hours will prove those previous statements (update - accumulation of 247/1053 as of Oct. 5th 2016). For further thought material: For a brisk while post-release, critic reviews on Metacritic for this game were definitely positive, and the problems those reviews mainly have with the game are more about a lack of polish and the fact that it wasn't a complete 'overhaul' like they hoped for, rather than it being a bad purchase or a bad game. Of course, by now, even some of those are under the impression that those ""darn corrupt devs"" made this to rob us thanks to the keyboard-activism.The issue with the talk of business practice is how obvious it is that nobody is actually looking into the validity of what they are saying - Undead Labs is not in control of the business practice. They are the dev team, it is their concept and ideas that built it, but ultimately, they signed it away to Microsoft for publishing with the XBLA system back in the 360's development stage. Before you assume that it's their fault anyways - remember that the XBLA program exists for small dev teams to have a place to release their game to the console market, and rules must be followed and UL would not have had any choice in the matter (being as small as they were with no resources at the time). Nobody knew the game was going to succeed how it did.What does this mean? Well, it certainly doesn't mean that Undead Labs even had the authority to ""screw the customers"" if they wanted to (which anyone with half a brain for PR can assume that they didn't). Rather that this is the PC port for the Xbox One version of the game, which sold for the simple reason that SOD otherwise did not exist on current (XB1) gen consoles at the time. Undead Labs has also stated that they cannot update the port without the go-ahead from Microsoft, which does not care about the PC port in terms of promoting their console-heavy exclusive title State of Decay.Now, if you actually care about what's in the game and how it compares to the last version, here is actually new content-wise in YOSE:-New knife-combat (which comes with a bunch of nice badass moves) (One of the bigger changes in the game)-New difficulty arch for Breakdown that extends far beyond the previous 12 levels.-30 minutes of new music-The amount of cars has more than doubled (although most of these come from new variants of already-existing vehicles. There is a classic 80's sedan, SUV, a non-customized version of the modern muscle car, some new tuners, a new classic muscle car and a bunch of new colors and variants for all of them.)-Some balance and physics tweaks-Fleshed out car repair features-New facility options (you can now do stuff like make coffee and convert ammo and stuff like that)-A bunch of new guns-A new type of mission (which is acts as a really nice reward occasionally in breakdown)-New Breakdown Heroes/survivors (including a returning-player bonus)(Milo Eldrige is an example of a new generic survivor for those misinformed souls that think Gurubani is the only change).-Slightly sharper graphics and frame rate (Not even close to a big change)-New visual ground effects, actual fog, etcKNOW WHAT YOU ARE BUYING. THIS IS PROBABLY NOT WORTH 30$ FOR PEOPLE WHO ALREADY HAVE THE GAME.ON THE CONTRARY, IF YOU DO NOT OWN THE ORIGINAL STATE OF DECAY, YOU AREN'T EVEN PART OF THE DEMOGRAPHIC THAT COULD CLAIM TO BE CHEATED. DON'T EXPECT THE REMASTER OF A 2GB GAME TO OPERATE LIKE A 30GB AAA GAME.If you are a new buyer to the series, then yah, buy this. State of Decay is a great game, and this is definitely the better version to get. There is more content, a bunch of smaller features the previous did not have, more community support for it.Despite the generic review claiming the game is 'broken' with 'broken features', the game is far from unplayable. The majority of bugs are physics flaws and bugs are definitely not something the game is bad with.Aside from that, if you are angry about the game not getting enough attention, you can blame MS for trying to make this a cash grab. The developers - who are very attentive to the community on the website - can't even do a DLC until the publishers ask for it. I'm not trying to baselessly shift blame, that is literally what one of the developers said when answering a community suggestion ( https://forums.undeadlabs.com/threads/the-guns.27815/page-281 ). Keep in mind that in that same thread the developer can be quoted as saying that something new might just be in the works as well for the game.			"

												WARNING TO OWNERS OF THE PREVIOUS VERSION!This ""HD remastered"" edition of State of Decay on PC does not include updated textures, contains the exact same bugs (except the one useful bug for getting your whole community on the RV in breakdown, that was fixed) and does not contain any noticeable animation improvements. The store page is clearly ripped from the XBONE store page as none of these are present in this version. The lighting effects are also not improved, the game is simply brighter which can make it look ""better"" to some people, but far flatter and washed out. As a game (if you are new) this is the best zombie survival game I've played ever. Or at least the original was. The game is unpolished, despite this being the ""remastered version"" it fails to fix any bugs, but hey you're new so forget about the old version. If you're okay with having bugs, choppy framerates and a horrible traitorous publisher, then this is for you, as it IS fun.I don't recommend this game despite that, however, as this is what is essentially a paid for patch that doesn't actually patch ANYTHING. Owners of the original are also screwed into buying this version if they want continued support, which would be less unacceptable if this version carried out half of what it promised.One finally note, the store page say ""glorious 1080p at 30 fps"" like its a good thing. Yeah you should probably fix that, Microshit, or did you stop caring about PC after Halo 2?			"

												As of writing this only about 2 weeks after release I will have to sadly not recommend this game, at least not if you already own the original. If you don't then yes i highly recommend it, State of Decay is an amazing game that came out of nowhere and pulls you into a really cool survival type game, has an ok story nothing too amazing and it does have bugs but you will find yourself not being able to put it down. Now as for this re-release no it is not worth it in the slightest, I bought it of course clamoring to replay this game because it is that enjoyable, to find that they simply put flames on some trucks added some loot crates and added vehicle storage into the base game. Other than that nothing is different, no noticeable bug fixes, things are still wonky here and there, which believe is fine, but in a re-release that wants you to rebuy the game at basically what was almost full price I expect polish and upgrades which are not present here. If you are a returning fan, don't spend the money unless you truly just want to regain achievements and replayIf you are new to the series I highly recommend this, (mainly because it's just State of Decay with a different name)9/10 for State of Decay     5/10 for this ""Remaster""			"

												At the moment this version is not worth it for newcomers or returning players.Original owner bonus items seems like they could easily been made by modders or even imported to the original game. Screenshot make this game look more polished than it is. They don't show the crappy shadows or noticeable tiled textures. tl;dr: Save your money and get orginal bundle. -Still no proper graphics options.-Texture and shadow filtering and lighting is pretty bad.-Textures don't seem upgraded. -Stuttering is probably worse, especially when driving. In State of Decay i was able to get a pretty smooth 60fps at 1080p,In YOSE i'd have to lower resolution to 720p to get a stable framerate.Animations seem even worse and buggier than before. Looting seems more glitchy than the original also (sometimes the Y promt shows up and sometimes it does not )I really hope the developers get there scat together and patch these aweful bugs. I really do feel let down by them because i supported them by pre-ordering this and expected a more polished game than the original but got a more buggier, uglier one instead. Atleast one thing they got right, you can import game saves from the orginal.			"

												I was a huge State of Decay fan back when it first came to Xbox 360, and when I heard this version was coming to PC with better textures, better fps and some extra content, I couldn't have been more excited.But seriously, this game was a huge let down, everything I was promised was a lie.- Textures look nothing like the screenshots, hardly a difference between 360 version and this one- Lighting is poor- Same glitches as before, none have been fixed- Awful performence with low fps and stuttering, changing graphics settings does nothing for performence either (R9 280x, FX-6300 OC'd 4GHZ, 8GB DDR3 1600 ram)- A £22.99 price tag.Honestly, I am so dissapointed with this 'remaster' - stay away "

Posted: April 16, 2016
												One of the saddest stories in video game development.TL;DR - While there is a great game buried under here, it's buried beneath an entirely unplayable mess. Don't buy this game until the devs make it very public that they've fixed it, should they ever actually do that. Until then, try and find a way to get the original.*I loved this game when it came out. I remember watching the trailers and having my hopes raised so high at the prospect of an open world zombie survival game of this calibre. And when it came out, it actually lived up to the hype. Somewhere in the outdated graphics, the lack of co-op, the awful sound design, and the disjointed voice acting, was a fantastic game with amazing mechanics. Hours were spent glued to my xbox fighting off waves of zombies, scrounging for supplies, searching every container looking for new weapons (and there must be hundreds of different weapons), building up bases, rescuing survivors and expanding my group.And then Breakdown came out, and I was ecstatic. It's like they realized their weaknesses and limitations, and decided to devote their attention to building their strengths. While the story of State of Decay was decent enough to push you around the map and through events in the game, they now gave us the world as our playground and challeneged us to survive for as long as possible in whatever way we chose. Once again, many hours were lost.And then came Lifeline, and in my opinion, the cracks started to show. It was still every bit as fun as the original, but what I'd hoped would be an entire urban centre to explore, turned out to be almost entirely inaccessible. The map consists of a large city area of which the entirety is inaccessible. The only areas you can explore are the suburban-esque areas of the outer limits of the city, which contain little more than the same houses and buildings you saw in the original. But despite all that, the fun was still there. The story was interesting enough, and being given a pile of new, military grade weapons to mow down zombies with was a blast. So even though the fun was shorter lived than the original, it still held up to its own.And then...this. This terrible, awful, wretched money grab they shamelessly put out. The base game is still there somewhere, but it has been completely buried in a buggy, laggy, entirely unplayable experience. They boast about being remastered in 1080p, as well as improved textures and animations, but the game looks almost no different than the original. The menus are a little sharper, the icons look a little crisper, but the player models, zombies, vehicles, the world itself is unnoticeably different. The only thing that's really changed is that the game can't keep up with itself anymore. Frame skips are constant, even in low texture density areas. Bugs are rampant, with your characters floating in the air or falling through the world, zombies pop in and out of existence all around you, the game crashes to desktop. And just to add insult to injury, the devs are charging more than the base game for this, and have made the original, playable version unpurchaseable. Coming up on a year after its release, the devs have seemingly made no moves to acknowlege that their product is broken, nevermind actually fix this game and make it playable again. One can only hope that day is coming.			"

												I do not recommend this game because it is so ridiculously glitchy.  Being new to the game, I read the reviews, and despite the negative recommendations because this edition should have been a patch instead of a remastered version, I got it anyways.  The indications of poor graphics performance and poor physics were fairly slight in the reviews, while predominant complaints were the former, so I thought, how bad could it be?  Let me tell you new comers, it's that bad.  Let  me break down the problems this game faces.-sluggish controls;  The action you try to perform may or may not be done on the first button press.  This leads to over zealous and useless button mashing.  -Zombies literally spawn right in front of you and are attacking you before they are visibly spawned in.  This is most notable when the game decides to mess you up, you'll see a few zombies, go whale on them, the music will kick into more serious tones, then you are swarmed with zombies that were nowhere around 2 seconds ago.  You'll start seeing them spawn in right behind a zombie you are executing.-team npcs are obviously programmed to be more of a nuciance than a help. They are notorious about standing in doorways, not attacking enemies until the last second.  They will NOT help you carry stuff, such as supplies you find, which really makes them pretty useless.  You cannot direct them to move, attack or anything otherwise useful.-The camera is not your friend.  Half the battle is keeping up with the camera.  Especially while driving.  Nothing says pain in the @$$ like driving with the WASD scheme and rotating the camera manually.  90% of all car accidents in this game is due to blind spots from the camera nemesis.  When fighting, sometimes all you can see is the back side of a zombie or your head.-Aiming can be a real pain in the nether region.  Scoped weapons aren't truely scoped, as you only zoom in ever so slightly, but the sight is still over the shoulder, and it leads to frustratingly difficult long shots.  Against all survival guide recommendations, spray and pray will end up being the order of the day when you inevitably get swarmed, hopefully you brought enough snacks, painkillers and a backup melee weapon because it's gonna turn into melee when you run out of ammo.-Vehicle physics seem to have been written by a toddler, because the physics are either as stiff as a board or as bouncy as a rubber ball.  Run over a zombie, you may dent your hood, or you may take your vehicle for a tour of the solar system, you're at the whim of random physics.  On that note, if walking everywhere wasn't a sure recipe for disaster because of materializing zombies, it would be easier to walk.-Walls and doors may or may not stop a zombie attack or the flames from a molotov.-Street curb can be an invisible barrier.  Make sure you take a running leap to get up on that sidewalk.-To search containers, you have to position yourself perfectly in front of it, you can't open that cooler lid standing beside it, because that's IMPOSSIBLE, the same goes for entering and exiting vehicles as well as putting items in the storage compartment.-Climbing down a ladder can be a perilous endeavor.  Sometimes you'll climb down normally, othertimes you'll swan dive off the platform.  Oh, did I mention how the useless NPCs like to stand in front of doors?  Yeah, they do that with ladders too.  Feel free to push them off, not that you'll teach them any kind of lesson but you'll feel better...-Last but not least;  the missions are so repetitive, and absolutely pointless...  ""<insert name> is in a tough spot."" blah blah blah...  The idle NPCs constantly go out, need help, and never bring anything back for the trouble, just a time sink.  You can ignore them, but you'll start having morale problems unless you bring back supplies constantly.  You also run the risk of losing members, especially before you have all your outposts.Oh, and, whoever decided how much items weigh really needs to spend some time figuring out how much stuff really weighs.  If a person struggles to carry an assault pack filled with a hatchet, 30 rounds of 5.56, a rifle, 3 bottles of asprin, 3 MRE, and 3 grenades, I don't think they would be much use in the military, let alone the apocolypse.  And military trained personel who takes 20-30 seconds' to change a magazine?  I'm looking at you Lifeline.  The game has promise, but I think between the dev's ADD and the DRM (i.e.  lack of any community fixes) it's going to be a broken promise.  Graphically and functionally this game is on par with Xbox1 and the PS2 era, though the concept is there for a great modern game.  Very sad, and I wanted to like this game so badly.  My recommendation, if you absolutely must get it, wait for a sale, but I bet you'll still be disappointed.			"

												I like this game very much and it is fun, don't get me wrong on this. There is afaik not one other game out there which combines Zombies, Basebulding, RPG-Mechanics, Open-World and 3rd-Person-Action in a way worth mentioning. Although the game doesn't play it's potential to the fullest and there was definitely room for improvement, but sadly that wasn't used for this ""remastered"" version. Honestly I almost see almost no difference graphic-wise, it certainly doesn't look that much better. But that wasn't something I had hoped for anyways. What I had hoped for was an improvement gameplay-wise, but alas they didn't deliver. The same long known bugs that plagued the old game, are also present in this version, the extra Mission type   is nothing to write home about, the Bonus Survivor is bugged, I couldn't even add him/her to my community, the Bonus Gear I can't even recall if it worked. Also they stated that they had reworked the UI, but I really can't tell, because it is still the same unresponsive, lackluster console conversion i had to put up with in the orginal game. It is definitely not tweaked for PC, at least not worth mentioning. Performance-wise I had no problems at all, I ran the game at ""Ultra""(haha)-Specs and it ran fluid, almost all of the time (oc'ed nvidia gtx 760). Also many community suggested improvements were neglected, actually I can't tell if any was implemented at all. So the conclusion is that I cannot recommend this game? No. I do recommend it, at least to those who haven't played the original, although I am somewhat disappointed by the developers for releasing this cash-grab. If you never played this game and you like open-world zombie-action with some strategic value, pick it up. It can nerveracking at times, but all in all it is a good game and also worth 28€ imo, but stay away if you already own the orginal!			"

												Foreword: Genrally, for anyone who never played State of Decay or YOSE and is a huge Zombie Games Fan and needs a fix without touching any of the other ""Zombie Survival"" Games out there, like DayZ or H1Z1 (which basically are not Zombie Survival Games, but PvP with some...Things ""derping"" around to sometimes annoy you), then I can say:Try it. (and use Steam Refunds if you are disappointed!)Personally tho:I had a lot of fun with the original State of Decay (mostly with Mods installed!)It had its quirks, small minor bugs and performance issues on my PC, which is strange, since my Specs are good enough. (and this is not limited to my pc...)AMD A8-5600K Black Edition 3.6 GhzEVGA GeForce GTX 9708 GB MemoryWindows 8.1 Pro NState of Decay (not YOSE) ran acceptable with some stuttering and slowdowns here and there, especially while driving around.YOSE, on the other hand, has serious performance issues. Whenever I walk around, run around or drive around, the FPS dips down to 20 or less in a lot of areas. Micro-Stuttering is not even a word for that anymore.I posted about this on the official Forums from Undead Labs, twice.First time, the Community Manager and a Dev ""wanted to take a look at it"" but suddenly stopped responding or caring about it.Second time, only the Community Manager replied a couple times and then stopped responding.Not only is YOSE a slight cash-grab (you can get most of all the new YOSE features with SoD Mods), the Developers are not the most responsive and caring type...One way to ruin a franchise and scare off existing and potential new customers.I hope Undead Labs learns from their mistakes and their MMO Zombie Survival Game actually will work and run properly...

												I once loved State of decay and played the first version of this game an endless amount of time.As a big fan of the game and with great love for the company i bought the YOS-Edition without doubts, simply by trusting that guys for bringing me my favorite zombie-game ever.But the sad truth is, that the game is not only almost exact the same, without new buildings and 99% similar content, no, the big, the really big problem is, that there are so many new bugs in it the SoD-Version never had!Gamebreaking bugs like endless sieges which cannot be finished, alot of glitches, suddenly appearing Zombies out of thin air right next to you and an A.I. that is so stupid its getting lost in a one-way corridor of 2 meters! (what actually really happened. i plundered a truck and when I went out of it, all companions were unable to find the exit, resulting in getting killed inside there...)As long this game has no new contents which deserves the meaning and as long this game is so horrible buggy, i definetely won't recommend it. So sad, so sorry for a game I once really loved and played in almost every free minute! :)			"

After 2 hours of struggling to get the game to even launch a second time due to a major screen resolution bug, I put a few playing sessions into the game before... *poof*  -- my save disappears.  Not a cloud save issue, not an ""oops, we saved this to the wrong profile number"" issue.  Just flat out gone.  I loved this game on the Xbox, and I was really enjoying the idea of getting to revisit it here.  But the game is so horribly bugged it would be a disservice to you to describe the gameplay as enjoyable.  I'm sure it would be if it were the same game made by a competent developer.  Even with the YOSE release, they couldn't fix this and get it right.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one.			"

Update 1 on November 19, 2015:Almost 7 months after release, UL has finally released a big content patch. Out of curiosity, I will be reinstalling to see if it addresses some of the bugs I mentioned.Update 2 on November 27, 2015:Everything seems to work fine now. Only took them 7 months to actually patch the damn thing.I really want to recommend this game, but I can't in good conscience tell people to go out and get YOSE given the state it's in. On paper, it sounds great: HD re-release of 2013's State of Decay, all DLC included, bonus missions and new characters for the Breakdown DLC. I got the original State of Decay around the time it came out of Early Access back in late 2013 and it was plagued by bugs that eventually got patched out. So, imagine my surprise when playing the re-release only to discover they brought back the same bugs. To list a few:- Opening up the journal will running or driving will lock your character in that direction infinitely until you press the same direction key again.- Incorrect character voices. A female character will use her own voice to say one line, then switch to another female voice, and then cheer in a deep male voice.- Issues with map geometry, i.e. with a horde right on your butt, you'll sprint across the street only to hit what the game thinks is an invisible wall because the curb is like half a foot above the street.- Wonky car physics, meaning that driving over what you think is a small rock will rocket your vehicle into the stratosphere and kill your character.- Worst of all, the infinite loading screen glitch is back. Anyone who played the original SoD at launch will remember this, where if you switch between characters, the game will load in as the new character, but the loading screen will float in place forever. It's easily fixed by exiting to the menu and loading back in, but this shouldn't be an issue in the first place.It's almost been a month since launch with no patch (other than one to fix the import save function). Until YOSE gets fixed or falls to a price you think is reasonable, I say skip it. If you've not played the original, you can get that and all the DLC for less than $10 or $15 during a sale.			"

												one of the worst developer you can find on Steamnot only do they left original State of Deacy with many bugs and glitches, they released an update and owners of original SOD with all DLC must buy it if they want it. I cannot say without being censored about how low this type of devs areYou can see on Steam how proper developer treat their customers, just look at Darksiders 2, if someone owns game with all DLC they receive Definitive Edition for free. Owners of Van Helsing trilogy receive Final Cut for free. Owners of Dead Island can buy Definitive Editions with 85% discountOwners of Deus Ex 3 and DLC receive 80% discount for Directors Cut.Witcher 1 and 2 had a free update to the Enchanted Edition. Dying Light customers received the Enchanted Edition for free. Even Legends Of Dawn (as garbage as that game is) people received the Reborn version for free. Divinity Original Sin owners received the Enchated Edition for free. Owners of Darksiders 1 received Remastered Edition for FREEOwners of Hard Reset received 85% discount on Redux EditionWasteland 2 owners receive Directors Cut for FREEAND WHAT IS MORE, THEY CHARGE YOU LIKE FOR A NEW GAME, YOU WOULD EXPECT THEN SOME GOOD WORK BEING DONE LIKE COMPLETE OVERHAUL OF GAME ENGINE FOR EXAMPLE...BUT NO...AND NOT ONLY THAT, THIS NEW EDITION IS STILL FULL OF BUGS AND GLITCHES THAT PEOPLE REPORT BUT DEVELOPER ONCE AGAIN TOOK OFF... I GUESS WE CAN WAIT FOR STATE OF DECAY YEAR TWO SURVIAL EDITION, OF COURSE OWNERS OF YOSE WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR IT			"

												Whether you own the original edition or not, stay away from this game. You would naturally expect this newer edition to be more polished and have less glitches and stutters compared to the previous edition, but sadly this is not the case. And I did not noticed any graphical improvements either, it looked exactly the same as the original, with some gamma adjustments. To say that I'm disappointed with this game is an understatement.

												Bad rip off.A little face life, that's it. All old bugs are still there plus some new ones.If you don't own the game, buy it, as long as you are okay with bugs. If you already have the ""non-remastered"" version, don't bother. Save the money for some bacon, or whatever makes you happy.			"

												I really wish I could recommend this, because I really really loved the original one. I bought this game on a whim when I found out that I could import my save. To save time for others:TL;DR: Save your money if you already have the original game, because the new content does not validate the price. If however you havent got the game at all, it is worth paying for as the old one is no longer available on steam.Positive aspects:-returning players from SoD get access to an exclusive player with the Nimble trait (reflexes) -new type of car added that has an increased trunk space (6 spaces) with a bit less handling than a modern pickup, but more readily available and just as sturdy.-like original SoD has intergrated controller support available-returning players can import their save from SoD, breakdown and Lifeline-Actions like creating more snacks and coffee are now available at the kitchen-new mission type included in story type and breakdown, gives new lease of life to objects such as timers and talking dolls-new map icons make it easier to see at a glance what kind of missions are available to youNegative aspects:-The game is really badly optimized. This particular game lags even on minimum specs-Some zombies are not rendered correctly, and sometimes the buildings have the same problem. For machines (like mine) that ran original SoD perfectly fine, it seems like this is an issue that shouldn't have been one.-the map looks less smooth and more boxy and cartoonish-for the content that has been added ontop of the old version, it really is not worth the money even with the discount. The added features included in this pack, i would only realistcally pay around £8 at most.-No new voice actors have been commissioned. For when playing breakdown and the like, it can get tiresome to hear the same 6 voice actors over and over in different pitches.-at times, attacks do not connect to the zombies, leading you to waste your stamina swinging wildly while they still come and wreck you.-it is commonplace for your character to glitch into the foundations of the building. Whereas in the original SoD this glitch was only really common for zombies, the glitch has now expanded to affecting player characters-the graphics as a whole just look sharp and horrible as if no edge smoothing has been used at all. in all honesty, I prefer the graphics of the old game.Conclusion:I will probably continue to play this game as i have already spent money on it, but looking back I wish I saw a review like this instead of the generic ""This is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cash grab"" so i could have just happily stayed with the original. However, if you've never played State of Decay at all, it is a brilliant game, and will recommend you buy this copy as the old one is now not available.			"

												Decided to make this more coherent aswell as more thorough.Pros:-Same good gameplay from the previous, aborted child, with solid combat.-Good, though run of the mill 'special zombies' (Freaks), the Screamer (Killing Floor Siren though this one disables character while screaming), the Bloater (basically a Left 4 Dead Smoker/Killing Floor Bloatbile hybrid since it doesn't tongue but it doesn't vomit), the Feral (Left 4 Dead Hunter) and the Juggernaut (Killing Floor Fleshpound)Cons:-The tiny inventory started to get on my nerves though I suppose its more realistic, can't expect everyone to take 999 bullets with them every time.-Being bombarded by silly requests when you're trying to do something gets REALLY frustrating.-Only minor but unskippable intros (Microsoft Studios and Undead Labs thingies) are 800x600 regardless of resolution settings-More minor stuff, when coming out of a menu if you try to move characters too fast they will only walk in a straight line regardless of other directional buttons pressed, and the fact changing character even if they are right next to you needs a loading screen, I can understand characters that are outside of base though.-Drops in frame rates, specially while driving and getting to full speed even with graphical settings at minimum, I have 2xR9 270X, since its a mid ranged AMD product I'm not expecting it to rain gold and diamonds but jebus, the bloody framerate drops!!!-No mouse support in menus, I hate these friggin ports that ignore the existance of this excellent creation which would make inventory management so much easier, BUT NO you MAY NOT make our job easier we NEED to make menus confusing.The added content, I've noticed some of it like pallet swap cars, but to me it just seems like a ""Turtle Rock did it with Left 4 Dead!!"" cash grab though I may be mistaken the further I get in. The game itself looks to me like a lot was put into it like the devs themselves cared for it so I don't really regret buying it, I just hate bad ports which is the problem when they take the easy road of console games, I do appretiate that they spent the time to giving us PC people the game though.

YouTube™ Video: State of Decay: YOSE Day One Edition (PC): Impressions (Graphics comparison, gameplay and review) 

			Views: 6,646		

			State of Decay: YOSE Day One Edition (PC): Impressions (Graphics comparison, gameplay and review) The original State of Decay was one of my favorite open world sandbox survival game out there, though...		

State of Decay was a fantastic open world zombie survival game when it was originally released on Xbox Live, but when it was ported to the PC it suffered from multiple problems. Bugs, and poor resolution were some of the most notable issues. Fortunately the core game was so good, many people including myself were willing to forgo any problems that it had, and enjoyed it any ways. What a great idea it is to ""remaster"" the original! The question though, is Year One remastered enough to justify a $30USD price tag?If you've already played or own the original game is it worth $30? Short answer: NO.Yes, the lighting have been improved significantly, and the texture quality is better, but other than that, there's not much new here. Sure, there are also some extra minor characters added, and now cars have decal (whoopie...), but every thing else about the game is exactly the same. The game advertises improved animations, and combat mechanics, yet I notice little changed about these 2 things. If there have been any changes, they're so tiny, it's barely noticeable. The two biggest improvements are the lighting and texture quality, both could of easily been added as a patch. There are no other notable additions, the model quality is exactly the same, there are no new modes to play, no new areas, no new quests, nothing for returning players. If this was advertised as the definitive State of Decay collection, I would be fine with it. Lots of games like Boarderlands repackage old games into compilations for the benefit for new players, but this was advertised as a remastering. Even the description of the game mislead old fans to believe that there are a ton of new stuff here, when there aren't. Worst off, the most noticeable improvements, lighting, texture quality, and true 1080p, are things that should of been in place when they launched their original port! But instead they decided to charge it to us, as a lazy excuse of a remaster. If you're a returning player to the game, Year One is nothing more than a glorified update patch.Luckily for us, the original is absolutely a stellar survival game, and since they changed nearly nothing about it, it remains a stellar survival game. If you are new to State of Decay, this might be a good time to get into the game, and perhaps Year One is suitable for the new comers. For old time fans who have already played, or own State of Decay, don't bother. It's not worth your money unless you have enough disposable income to justify it. But even then, the practice of selling what amounts to a patch for $30 and misleading old players to think that there are a ton of new stuff when there's not, is not a practice that I can condone.Pros:- Still the same, great State of Decay game- Suitable for any one NEW to the gameCons:- For returning players, there isn't much new- $30 for what amount to a patch is unconscionable- Neither combat or animation have been improved enough to justify it being in the description- The original was a lazy port, Year One is a lazy remastering			"

												I will start by saying i LOVED SoD and both of the DLCs. it was a fair price, amazing gameplay even though it has its problems (Xbox port - bad performance, bugs ect).This ""patch"" is still from an Xbox port and suffers all the same problems the original did.Simple breakdown:Never played the original SoD or dont own it? - YOSE is the way to go, by all means buy it. As a first time customer you will be happy with the product! (expects some issues and bugs but excellent gameplay)Already own the original SoD and DLCs? - DO NOT BUY, YOSE is nothing more than a patch that should have been free to existing and loyal supports of SoD and its DLCs; this ""patch"" is not worth paying for.PROs:Looks...5% betterstill good gameplayCONS:still has bugs and issuesruns bad, still... (i own an i7 and R9 295x2)Should be free, its a patch			"

												Feel tempted to buy but negative reviews are keeping you in doubt?If you are new to this game, its a great game to have. Don't mind the negative reviews, they are mostly by guys who had the original game and went for a redux maybe to experience something better or something new but were disappointed to have the same game. In your case it shouldn't matter coz it will still be a new game for you.It might not concern you but yes, Its performing slightly less than the original but thats because of better graphics. On the other hand, this deal is sweeter as you get base game + dlcs for lesser price and better graphics and some new missions and characters. About the game, story is good, gameplay as well, tough at times, hint of roleplay elements and a neat ui makes it a benchmark for a lot of other zombie survival games. It doesnt have multiplayer but thats fine by me.Rating it 9/10			"

												Pros:A little better graphics (Almost no difference) & smoother frame rate.Cons:1. Aside from some graphic improvements & some pre-purchase bonuses, not much has changed in terms of gameplay & features. 2. Bugs are WORSE than the original version. Zombies pass through walls more frequently, cars flying, zombies flying, and still no one is manning the watch tower most of the time. I can overlook the bugs in the original game, but the larger number of bugs in YOSE edition is pathetic.I don't know if it's caused by bugs, or the way the zombie AI is programmed, but zombies seem to know where you are from as far as 3 blocks away. I keep having my survivors killed due to being horded by dozens of zombies who just always know where I am sneaking around. I destroyed a bunch of zombies, and the other groups keep endlessly coming, until my survivors ran out of stamina and get killed. This is truly frustrating. I am unable to search items in the house without being surrounded by zombies from across the road who somehow know I am inside the house. Even worse, the survivors who accompany me are dumb and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pathetic. They just stand there getting mauled by zombies without fighting back. Seriously, what the F**k did the developers do to the AI ???I have played the original SoD, and I will still go back to the original. The zombie AI is more balanced in the original game. The YOSE edition zombies somehow have human detector radar and you can never hide pass them. I keep losing my survivors and desperately look for new ones and train them, only to see them get killed as well. This totally ruins the gameplay. It's garbage.			"

												Loved vanilla state of decay on xbox 360. At the time of release it was not released on pc and really wanted to check the game out. For all the technical problems and bugs, it was an AMAZING game. Really nailed the survival horror walking dead type vibe I was looking for. Devs promised to work on bugs over time and they did for the most part, albeit at a slow pace. I held out for a game of the year edition for pc due to wanting all the dlc and better frame rates, draw distance etc. When I saw they were releasing a ""game of the year"" edition I was pretty happy to wait for it to support these guys.Well....I regret my purchase. They released this with some new animations and fetch missions...and with all the bugs the base game had. Been out for a few weeks and I don't think we have had a patch addressing any of them. CS people on the undead lab forums site are trying to help folks but, honestly this whole situation with this game so far has been a♥♥♥♥♥♥show. Wait for a dirt cheap sale, bugs should be ironed out by then.			"

												It's basically the same as the original one.Different car reskins, different cars altogether. Some of the interface graphics have been improved. The icons on the map have been made a little bit bigger.When you start Breakdown, you get five hordes right off the bat. With no outposts to fend them off, you have to find a couple of cars to get rid of them.  Then you're down a couple of vehicles because they've been ruined.The same thing with Lifeline. You get rushed early in the game and you get overwhelmed. You're not given enough time to set up to fend them off properly.The original campaign is the same, you go through the camp site and go on from there.The zombie and the horde spawning can be a little bit too much at times. Everytime you try to search for something, they'll spawn outside the house. If you're in a field, they appear right in front of you. If you get out of a car to look for something, they'll be there next to the vehicle.I'm all for killing the damn things, but it gets to be annoying after a while. It's still a good game, but it's still rough around the edges.			"

												I have bought every SOD & DLC released on the 360, PC, and now PC againomg, I am so disappointed at the quality of this release... I do know my PC GFX maxed out (GeForce 960 2GB) don't look near as nice as the previews, and sure don't look much better than the original SOD :-|I decided to get the PC version instead of the Xbox One version because Undead said that the PC will get updated quicker than consoles, and are NOT against modding. On Windows SOD YOSE is only 3.1 GB, but is a little more than 5 GB on the Xbox One version... That could explain why the PC version looks as crappy as the original releases :-| Shouldn't the PC version be BIGGER if it was truly upgraded? Especially with the GFX... I mean, did the PC not get the texture & visual upgrades ?! Someone please explain the differences between the PC and One versions if you canWish I could get refunded...			"

												NO 1440P, NO 4K....only Full HD and same as the original Game, even more worse. They have improved shadow quality. But if you go into shadow.cfg from the original game, you can adjust shadow quality much better than the remastered edition have. And the lightning in the new version is more ugly, because of its low shadow contrast. So in the forest at the beginning you dont see any lightning, because of the low contrast. They also didnt improve textures. Best example is, when you look at the streets. Next thing, I have a WQHD Monitor, the native resolution is 1440P, but you only get 1080P ingame. For a FullHD Monitor, its okay, but every resolution lower than nativ looks terrible. When you have a Full HD Monitor, try to set 1600*900 and you see not only the difference from 1080P to 900P, also what its like, when you cant play in the native resolution of the Monitor. And the best thing is, NOW i cant get 1440P in the original Game. Here also only 1080P.  I think they patched it, so that the original game dont have 1440P any more and doesnt look better than the remastered. My shadow cfg and Draw Distance in the original Game is also bugged after latest patch in original game. So i only have the remastered Edition in 1080P with ugly contrast, ugly shadows and so on. And I was naiv to think, they could include tesselation, Parallax Occlusion Mapping, High Res Textures, best performance and so on.....haha...the performance in this new edition is bad too and i have a GTX Titan X :D:D I wasted my Money...Dont do this mistake...totally Fail!! ...sry for my bad english.....

												Okay so this is my first review on Steam. I loved SOD since I first heard the idea back in the day. I bought it on my Xbox (before I converted to the master race). It was innocent, a small company making the game everyone dreamed of. The concept was there, it made me feel for the characters when they were torn to shreds because I was too careless. It was an amazing game. The shoddy graphics and buggy gameplay were the only things hindering this beast of an idea. Everyday that I played this game I wanted to know what undead Labs was going to do to fix it. After a while I grew tired of waiting.3 days ago I logged onto Steam wondering if they had one of my favorite games. State of Decay. There it was $19.99 in all its glory just as I'd left it. Then I saw that Undead Labs HAD been working on it after all! So I bought the game a day before it released. I started the game and was immediately filled with disappointment. The didn't launch properly at first. Then the load times seemed to take forever and day. Finally I spawned in the Breakdown mode as Summer and BAM! Undead Labs told me ,""hey, we made the game better sorta.""I play on a surface pro 2. This thing is a monster of a tablet. It can handle skyrim and GTA5 on almost full settings and is amazing. Sure it runs a little warm on those games but who's rig wouldn't?Anyway, there I was on Minimum resolution, minimum graphics and a Small as hell 4:3 display. Black borders all around. V sync on then off. IT ALL RAN THE SAME. Laggy, buggy and zombies jumping through walls. Forget driving. Hordes of zombies were complete chaos. My surface pro through all that was still running ice cold. Like I wasn't even playing a game. To summarize: If you bought the original with expansions don't waste more money on something that is subpar. It doesn't live up to my expectations and frankly I don't know if it ever will. Undead Labs needs to do something about these issues because they're destroying a dream game. All the while♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥a ton of people off. -The Gamer that waited			"

												The  original State of Decay was a combination of everything i wanted from a zombie survival game. Building a community, scavenging resources and improving your living conditions during an apocalypse. It had it's own charm and all the annoying things about it (especially the bugs) were tolerable when you considered how small a developer Undead Labs was.Yet i can not recommend this version of the game to anyone, not even people who haven't played the ""non-remastered"" version.The original version got rid of a lot of bugs through patching but most of those are back in the YOSE edition with the addition of way more annoying new ones (car hit detection where you drive through a whole zombie horde without hurting a single one). A lot of obvious design flaws were not corrected (like adding a simple sorting function to your base inventory) and the visual improvements are nice in comparison but not that noticeable. And for a ""polished"" version, the framerate is horrendous, even on a decent system.I ended up reinstalling the original SoD, since it has fewer bugs and a lot of awesome mods available, that make the game more enjoyable (and from which the developers should have drawn inspiration on how to improve their game).If Undead Labs will patch it to a playable state and add a little mod support, i'll give it another whirl. Until then, this prime example of a money grab stays off my hard drive.#Update 31.10.2015Apart from a small hotfix right after release, the developer did not address any issues for a full six months.Thankfully modders have not been idle and there are some nice additions and fixes out there that makes it feel like i didn't totally waste my money on this purchase.Now only recommended if you don't own the original and don't mind searching for and installing mods and community made fixes by yourself.

												So I'll start off by saying I loved the original State of Decay game, I wrote a review on it a while back highly recommending it.  However, I can't recommend this game due to the fact that I feel it should have been an update rather than its own seperate game.  If you own State of Decay, Breakdown, and Lifeline, you have no reason to get this game.  The extra mission and character are not worth the $20 price tag.  The items it adds are basically the same items that already exist with a different skin making them worthless to the package.If you don't have the original State of Decay game but were thinking of picking it up, this is a great value and, in that situation, I could recommend the game.  Otherwise, if you already own the games, steer clear of this game.			"

												If you have the original State of Decay do not buy this.  I feel ripped off. Lots of frame rate drop.  The wall issues are not fixed, if anything it is worse.  20 bucks down the drain so far.   I love the original.  Played it for hours but this blows.  Better textures, not much of a difference in my opinion.    Maybe it needs patched to run smoother.  If I can fix my jerkyness in play.  Thew original is fairly smooth on my pc, but this version jerks around and makes it hard to control your play.I ignored reviews that said this but I guess I just don't listenDon't waste 20 bucks, can not recommend.

If you're thinking of upgrading and you've already played this game........don't.  The ""upgraded features"" are really nothing worth spending any amount of money over.  It's disappointing in that nothing is different other than a few features that don't really matter.			"

												Don't get me wrong, state of decay is one of my all time favorite games, but if you already own the origional version, do not buy this. It runs no better, has more bugs and is just an all around meh upgrade. If they fixed some of the bugs (LIKE DOC HANSONS DUAL PERSONALITIES WHICH HAS BUGGED ME SINCE BREAKDOWN WAS RELEASED) Then I'd say buy this game and never look back.			"

												I have to recommend this game. I cannot in good conscience not do so. You see, I came late to the party, and so bypassed the controversy that followed the release of this 'Year One Edition', which includes the dlcs Breakdown and Lifeline.If you have not played State of Decay, then pay no attention to SOME of the reviews for this game, they are very much biased and tainted by that controversy that happened long ago which you can read more about in one of the other reviews I am sure.This game has a lot going for it. It is very close to the type of zombie-game I was looking for for many years. An actionpacked 3rd person game, much in the style of some earlier 'GTAs', with a focus on base- and resource management.Gather your group of survivors,  recruit new people, complete missions and interact with other survivor-groups. Scavenge for resources to use in upgrading and protecting your base and people; or move your entire base elsewhere on the map! All in a semi-open world yours to explore. Just be careful! Cars may break down, and if you get caught alone during the night by a horde be prepared to run!A word about the dlc Lifeline. To some extent, I found this campaign to almost more enjoyable than the base game. Maybe it was just the setting, which is more urban in Lifeline. The mechanics are the same, although you cannot move your base around in Lifeline. This doesnt matter, as the base you start with in this dlc has a lot of potential and is scene to some great defensive action. Call in snipers and air support as you try to defend your base of operations when the hordes get alerted to your presence, before gathering up your most experienced soldiers and go on a supply run, or try to rescue VIPs. Also. State of Decay has permadeath for your survivors, and actions may have consequences. I lost one of my earliest party members because I didn't get his medicine in time... I didn't know there was an actual time-limit. Be prepared to deal with it!I experienced no bugs, crashes or any other technical issues worth mentioning with the game as of early 2016. No worries.There arent many of these types of games in the 'zombie-genre', which I think is a shame. If you think the same, then I highly recommend Year One Edition to any newcomers.All the best.

												Another money-sucking game which is a previous state of decay with built in dlc and lightly moded. Dev probably used notepad’s to add more zombies here, less supplies add some textures and paint variations for cars ( which look horrible and some spots),3 new cars, few new weapons and 1 new mission. That’s all, yup. There is 1080p which you won’t see because everything still awfully made, thou they make it all shinny and brighter , textures are so bad in some places that you won’t believe that this game was made in 2015. By the remastered edition they prolly meant SoD with full pack of old bugs( and new one), optimization problem whith frame rate drops while steam overlay is enable or boarder bug. Also note at 5th screenshot of steam store where zombies hand is clipping, even on advertisement pictures it has problems. Also if you go on official deadlab forums you will see how they mock people who says how bad it is and mostly same accounts ( some even new) tell how great this game is. So if you new to this game get ready for full pack of bugs, if you are returning player only new what you will see is ONE new character IF you buy it before offer end and 1 new mission. If you really want make SoD look better just get original one and go to nexusmod site and get better stuff then this ""new rubbish"".10/10 for greed of developers and advertisement to make it worth of purchase, 0/10 for effort to fix bugs and really improve it.

												I played the first  State of Decay and the expansions for over 400 hours because I really liked the game. I admit that much can be improved and I was hoping YOSE would be a step in the right direction so I bought it even though they only gave a 33% reduction for a game that was only marginally improved.  However I can't play YOSE because the game crashes my pc.  I play for a random timespan then the screen goes black and poof the pc reboots.  I tweaked settings, updated the drivers and checked everything. No matter what: my pc crashes. My pc is 3 years old and made for rendering movies, which is a pretty intensive process but even when rendering, playing a game, running you tube and various programs at the same time my pc won't crash. I also played a wide range of games  such as Skyrim but only State of Decay causes my pc to crash. As this takes the fun out of the game and  I don't like my pc crashing to the point of no longer functioning I can't continue to tweak and play this game in the hope it won't happen again. And since most reviews confirm that the changes are superficial I can not recommend YOSE based on my experiences.I would also remark that selling a game with almost no viable changes for almost the same price is tantamount to a rip off. But we are now doggy trained to the anything-for-a-profit argument so I guess this signifies the normal pattern in game development. You can see this with the early access  games that never get into full release. At first the idea was to give players the chance to help develop the game, but people quickly saw another way to make a profit: selling unfinished software that does not get into finished state because ""it is still under development"". Examples are such games as  DayZ and Take on Mars from Bohemia Interactive Simulations, both almost 2 years in early access without a release date. I would advise people not to join the early access release racket. It gives bad companies methods to rip people off,  it makes good companies lazy: they use you for what they should do themselves: properly develop software. And then  finallly they charge you again when the game is released in full.  Yes, people, the game you helped develop, for which you did not get a dime but for which you are charged twice. Come on, people.			"

												I paid another thirty USD for THIS? A mild graphical update but still with all the glitches intact? $30?? I was expecting SOME kind of reduction on the game price considering I already owned the game plus all the DLC. Nope. If you have the first one with DLC intact then you don't need this. The shadows from the trees look like barcodes stretching out in front of you as you drive along. Some of it looks great, some of it looks crap. And all the other things that used to go wrong like frame rate drops in certain areas are all still there.			"

												It was fun at the beginning, gathering stuff and survivors, building shelters, shooting Zeds, meeting new friends(NPCs). But after a while it all gets bored.This is what I've been feeling so far:（1）'Oh the construction is down, you gotta do something!' （2）'Oh one of our guys is SAD/ANGER/FEAR/TRAPPED, you gotta do something!'（3）‘Oh we found a survivor out there, you gotta do something!'（4）’Oh hey, I have something I need to deliver to next door, I am a lazy F*ck, so.......... you gotta do something!'（5）'OH could you please take 5 minute drive to the next town to pick up an NPC, then another 5 minute  drive back home to pick up some bullets which you already have on you but we just want you to take more. And at last drive back to the next town so this NPC can get off this dumb car and disppear into a wall. No big deal, we just wanna f*ck things up. So.................you gotta do something!'（6）'Oh you are 6000M away from home? Well, we've heard a survivor got trapped by zombies next door, even if you don't show up, he/she would still survive any way. But if you don't show up in 1 minute, your fame would decrease, well you know, not for a particular reason, just because we can. So.........you gotta do something!'（7）'Oh thanks for inviting me to join your zombie hunt. It's been awhile since I got outside...... OMG!!! Zombies up ahead!! I am gonna stand here and do nothing. But if you start shooting, I am gonna stand in front of your gun and eat all your bullets, so I can destroy our relationship, and I will blame you because you shot me!'  *scumbag NPCsWHY I bother finding all the survivors any way, I gotta do everything myself.And BTW, the building instruction is not clear, I upgraded one of the rooms to level two, and.....................'Oh! looks like we need a library to continue' ......yep just when I ran out of space to build something new. F*CK it.The game concept is nice, I think it works even better on Multi-player mode or Co-op mode(if you guys would make this happen, just saying), but so far, NAH!(*with a sad face)OH , almost forgot......I think I have found a bug, the zombies often spawn inside a house which I just cleared 10 seconds ago. I mean they f*cking came out of nowhere. I spent 30 bullets and some intense melee fight against some wired looking zombies in a house, and 10 seconds later, BAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM, 5 new spawn zombies standing in front of me. WTF?!CONTINUING MY GAME PLAY AND COMMENTS:(01/08/2016)Well I spent 88RMB ( roughly around 13.3USD) on this game, so............gotta dig deep.PS: all your upvotes and subscribes are awsome!!!Spent some more time digging into the game, well, as above the missions are boring ( mostly), and the building part is kinda out of date.This time, let's talk about AI.The AI in the game is, well, I have been looking on google to find the proper word, but....well, let's just use 'BAD' this time. Yep, it's bad. Here are some exsamples:(1) Always walk in front of your car, you hit one of them? DECREASE FAME!!!!(2) Sometimes they rush into a group of zombies instead of taking them out one by one, they get too much injury, they die, and consequences？DECREASE FAME!!!! This gets worse during missions, especially rescue mission. You got your a*s in danger to get ONE/SOME of the NPC(s) out, when you just want them to get in the car so you can go home and end this sh*t. If a zombie approaches, well, they gonna fight to death. I mean, hey! WTF? Just get in the f*cking car!!!(3) I don't know if it's my fault or AI on this one, if you are driving a pickup truck, the NPCs would mostly choose to sit on the trunk ( I am not sure if it's called 'trunk', if I am wrong, pls tell me ) where they can be attacked by zombies. Why? Because it's Murica???(4) This happen quite often. One of your neighbours ask you to kill a special zombie. When you finish the mission, your neighbour would just walk home, and would be attacked by Zs on the way. That sounds dumb.(5) I gave guns and bullets to everyone in camp, but if I ask one of them to go on a mission with me, they would prefer using knives and pipes, which is more dangerous, because they gotta get closer to the Zs. ( This of corse could be fixed by installing AI MODS to make them choose guns as priority, and I did. But if you guys can fix it 'officially', that would be great )THAT'S ALL FOR NOW.I WILL SHOW YOU MORE NEXT TIME.AND AS ALWAYS.................................STAY ALIVE!!!			"

												New stuff:-New cars and car skins-New survivors and lifeline characters can be played in breakdown -New Incindiary shotgun-All weapons in this game can be played in all game modes (breakdown,vanilla and lifeline)-New mission named Cleo There are still bugs and issues from SOD that still exist in this game:-No one is in the watch tower even though someone is assigned this happen often especially in Snyder Warehouse-Survivors ignore the zombies even though they are already inside the base!-Zombies getting stucked for some reason-Random crashes and now more crashes than vanilla version -Survivors nagging about there is not enough materials but actually there is more than enough to build a structure or two-Zombies that were burned to death only shows animation but no fire effect sometimes when using incindiary rounds -Zombie claw attacks penetrate doors-Zombies and players still pass through walled objects and bounce back to their original place like an elastic effect (this happens especially in melee combat inside structures) -Ai still blocks doors when idle -Ai still attacks bloaters in melee -Zombies can climb though barbed fence (this happens in kirkman residence)-Animation issues when you roll over a group of zombies-Zombies pass through walls -Invisble flashlight (like the flash light is on yet survivors are not equipped with one and reminds me of old school CS)-Unfixed exploit where in you get exp on guns when aiming on a zombie who is dying/died because of throwable items (grenade, petrol bomb and a like) -Racksack becomes invisble when dropped and left for a certain duration however it can be still seen because of the marker of its contents and not the racksack itself-History:Ran Away trait is persist and can be only fixed after getting sick-Your progress in breakdown still progress even when you are not playing the game (the game is close/offline progress)and sometimes can cause death to your community if you did'nt finish some quest like locating a missing community member. There is no way you can disable this so far.-If you have tons of weapons in your locker there is no way to sort things out (everything is unorganized and you need to find stuff  that you need manually which is a total eyesore) And even new issues like:-The game starts at windowed mode and solved by using alt+enter-Alt tab will not really tab your window instead it will resize/restore the game-You cannot adjust the graphics in an advance manner in such away that you can only adjust the gamma, resolution and video settings (low-ultra) and not things like shadow, anti-aliasing and so on -Random FPS drop for some reason -Undead labs claim that ""Facilities from Lifeline will be available in all versions of the game"" however when I try to play breakdown I dont see this facilities as buildable structures like generator for example. Source: https://forums.undeadlabs.com/threads/everything-we-know-about-state-of-decay-year-one-survival-edition.47074/-Zombies teleport when in focus aim-Character change now has loading time for some reason-Animation Issues when in combat at an elevated terrain (stairs for example) that causes animation issues sometimes-Incindiary shotgun shells kills without flame effect does not count for phoenix achievement this happens when managed to kill a zombie at medium range or sometimes at a short distance-Chemical Incindiary damage does not damage zombies immidiately and only triggers when you aggro them (this happens sometimes especially when undetected) -Fires penetrate wallsFixed issues from SOD version:-Unresponsive ai combat system-Pixelated blood/gore-Not so dark when its evening compared to vanilla version making things more easier to see at night-Improved effects like dust particles, oil spill has now better texture and so many others -Juggernauts are nerfed-Ferals are now more dodgy -Improved handling for old school muscle car-Fixed issue on messed up shadows where the bomb is located at lifeline Conclusion:This game is meant to attract new players and as a returning player this is an epic face palm in my face because I am expecting a lot of bug fixes and less issues but instead its the other way around and the devs laziness shows in the game itself like you cant sort out weapons in the stoage, most issues/bugs unfixed and cant even adjust the advance video settings of this game. P.S. If the devs are reading this please don't take this personally but instead a wake up call to fix things up!			"

												First of all, please allow me to say this: purchasing this game is kinda wast of money.They did remaster the graphic and everything. The journal and radio menus looks different, but just the look is different. You can get the new character and more new items from the gameplay which is very interesting. But that's about it.I feel like they rebalanced the game difficulty but they did that in a horribly wrong way. When I first openned this game and played for 1 hour I deleted it on the spot then I went back to play the first one, I really like the first one better. To be honest I love the Lifeline DLC better from all the chapters, and the reason is that you can start a base with basic amount of resourse and gain influence in a certain ways. But in YOSE you can't get the influence in the old ways. I can't say it's not that easy anymore, I'd rather say its confusing. I think the producer didn't know what players are actually looking for. Instead of making this new edition, they should have just release a new DLC, OR, release a patch for everyone to download. The price on this thing is not that reasonable. I wouldn't suggest anyone other than zombie games collectors to buy this game.			"

												I love State of Decay... but hell with this edition I feel horribly cheated. new content?  new skins?  ..sorry to say.. even if I want to look at with pink glasses of fan...(maybe I am too old and blind). I dont see much difference compared to original (/except: horrible problems to even make game to work.. like shaking desktop and unexpected crashes, related to memory leaks etc) ..so what we have here? > one new car.. one new person..  car from lifle-lines in whole game & one new mode ""die yipping on random army crate drop""  ..+ primaeval bugs like > zombies entering building ""half underground"" or through closed door , or simply jumping from nowhere  + ""few"" new bugs  are introduced (maybe that is you are paying for) .such.like disapearing cars in area of mission interest..Soo dissapointed ConclusionIf you dont own original serie... buy it ,  its teh same as original.. with minor adds and some flaws which will be hopefully patched. and game be worth every invested penny..If you own original serie.. avoid it.. othervise you will feel like me... cheated ..this YOSE edition entirely broke my trust as customer. cause I simply bought same game twice.

												I was already unhappy with the fact I had to pay 20 bucks for a game with minorly improved features but I like the first State of decay so I was like ""eh welll worth it"" Yeah I was wrong.First to the bugs, I never had much of a problem with them to speak of really and even now I still don't really, maybe a minor thing here and there but nothing that really makes it game breaking.However this game will freeze on me once I start playing maybe 15 minutes in, and i have around 5k worth of hardware on my rig so my PC is more then capable of playing this game, however the game freezes no matter what I do. The gamne also refuses to render to my srceen size properly, I never had these problems with the first state of decay never.I haven't gotten into lifeline yet so I have no comments there breakdown seems to run fine the only two major issuses i am having is what I stated. It also seems to slow down down at times on me.I thought I was buying a better optimizted state of decay with minor improvements thats fine, I never expected a whole new game they did not advertise it has such. However The dam game will not run properly, between crashes, freezes, resolution not working properly I could not recomend this game period. If you are new to the game, its worth 30 bucks once they fix these issueses however old vets like me with state of decay are not happy and we have a dam good reason to be unhappy, until they fix this♥♥♥♥♥♥ do not buy it period.

												I still cannot even give this game a ""maybe"" on principle. Undead Labs are finished updating this game and busy working on their new State of Decay MMO. Bugs from the original SoD are still mostly untouched.Whether it was Microsoft forcing the developers or the developers pushing out this insult matters not, what matters is that this launched as a $30 re-release of a game with hardly any new content, new technical issues and that the original version that worked somewhat consistently was removed from the Steam storefront.Do not reward this behavior.

												They took 2 steps foward and 10 steps backwards.  Game is really not worth the time or the money.  The main issues are horrible load screens that take forever to load up the game when started.  For some reason, the game loads every time you change survivors.  Survivors tend to wander off and constantly become missing and gain the stat of ""ran away,"" which is annoying.  The major nerfs on skills.  For example, Mighty weapons ability ""sweep,"" no longer knocks legs off of zombies like it used to.  It however does knock one zombie's legs at a time, which makes it pretty useless.  I do not reccomend getting this game, which should have been a DLC from the start.  If you plan on getting this game, I would reccomend getting the original State of Decay, the only difference would be combat and I guess that it is now in 1080p, which I really do not see a difference and a bunch of nerfs to your favorite abilities.

												The developer said that the publisher required this for new gen consoles. All the bad reviews that say ""charging for a dlc"" are to be ignored. The publisher said it was intended for new audiences and they gave a discount to previous owners as much as they could. Most of the negative reviews are just uninformed people complaining.My bad review is because the textures don't seem to be upgraded much if at all. The ""1080p"" gives a massive fps loss. I can play Skyrim with 200 mods and all 2k textures with enb yet this game I have to play on lowest graphics setting. Horribly optimized.Also has a boat load of bugs.			"

												Buy this give if you are new to ""State of Decay"". But I liked first version much more. Game play was better. The most disturbing thing is extra ordinary spawnings of zombies. There is no logical spawns. I dont care easy win but I just want to play realistic. When I clean a house or a street, I want to know that house is cleaned at least a minute.. But on this version its not like that, just turn around and see another spawned zombies behind you and that sux.			"

												so i bought this game thinking it would be better than the one already made and i am dissapointed. I am even more dissapointed in myself for trusting this game title i did enjoy my time on the one on the xbox 360. But this is rediculous i have never bought a game before and thought to myself how can i refund this? and i have bought some crappy games thinking that these games were what their producers said they were. It just seems like no matter how much i tell myself to wait and see i end up buying it and being dissapointed especially by this title. and it is a bit sad that there are only 2 positive reviews that i have seen (altho its saying 82 i only see 2 so im calling ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t) there are 45 negative and exactly that number so really 2 good and 45 bad that is just sad. I hope to either see a refund or this company crash and burn for this			"

												Stick to the original State of decay.CONSNo improved textures same old models with a few random wall texture updates /skins for cars.Same old laggy game engine constant stutters when driving.Terrible controller sensitivity.Same glitches game bugs from original.A few new animations for combat sliding down ladders and new walk animation for zeds.One new mission type basicly find the transmitter for loot.Still suffers complete randomness even when you follow the specific events to stop an event happen:ie the vicar andalan dying from the black fever even with 2 doctors and fully upgraded medical area.DLC character with a perk that is supposed to stop people dying when sick that doesnt work.Dlc weapons that are crap well rifle excepted the knife and sword are worthless made from tin foil.PROS if your stil reading Still probably the best game of its type bugs and all.

												I played the game long enough and enjoyed it (at least as much as it allowed me to enjoy it), but I do not recommend anyone to buy it.Here are the reasons:- Buggy as hell. There are bugs everywhere is this game. Physics system is really bad. Characters clipping through doors and solid objects... Oh the vehicle physics are disastrous. And UI has some serious issues.- Performance is really bad. I mean really really bad for this kind of game. The performance is garbage really. I can't find anything else to say about it.- Story is meh (for original game) but God, things are so SO SO repetitive. Every day, one of your survivors has an anger or fear problem where you need to take them somewhere and kill some zombies, and bring 'em back to base. These kind of events are really poorly executed. Game throws tons of this kind of missions (like a neighbour needing help or one of people getting stuck scavanging etc..) It is impossible to keep up with it without frustration. But after a while you realize that these missions are not that critical to complete, as punishments for not completing them are not that severe. - AI is really crappy. Good for zombies but not for human characters. They walk on recently molotoved area, then start screaming, burning and running around like crazy. (You also loose trust points for this) In melee combat, they rarely finish downed infected, instead they swing and swing and swing until they run of stamina or get overrun by infected.Breakdown DLC is a total waste of time (and money). You play in same city layout level after level, only getting an increase in difficulty. And there is no story there, just randomly generated events and stuff, nothing interesting.Lifeline is a good DLC for its story and action packed nature of it but even it will frustrate you until you figure out what is what and learn how to deal with incoming horde attacks (Tip: Make good friends with grenade launcher and base vantage point).

												To be honest, I've never expected that much from MMORPG developers trying to make single player sandbox community-building zombie survival game. Endlessly respawning zombies, poor AI, shallow story and primitive gameplay were inevitable, but there's more to it that could've been done right.In the end, there are two points of view: as an xbox console game, even with all of it's flaws and drawbacks, it's a masterpiece not because it's good, but because there is no better alternative. As a PC gaming product, however, it can be described with a single word: mess. Literally none of the game's systems are working good enough. It's been nearly 2 years since original release and it didn't get any better.You can build yourself a base of your liking but there are facilities that are essential to build and those that have completely negligible effects so there is never a choice. On a first glance your people seem to be a community but after a few days you realise that they're just a bunch of drones: they don't establish friend/enemy/couple relationships, events about fights, jealousy or interpersonal dislike are completely random and random community members are 'picked' to participate, when a community member dies two random members will get a morale hit etc so both base and community building aspects are a mess too.What there remains? Hoarding? Your base stash has only 255 slots, so eventually you'll have to waste your time clearing it out every game day or two. Spent two hours gathering supplies to train your characters next day? Too bad, they got overwritten by your facilities' daily output and you have 5 items instead of 105. Character progression? Your favourites will get killed through a wall, when all floor two zombies fall through the ceiling while you're clearing first floor and tear you apart or your car turns over near two zombie hordes because someone inside farted.In the end I can only recommend it as a cheap and glitchy Dead Rising substitute. However you probably should play Dead Rising itself instead.P.S. Imagine yourself a grown up person that claims to be a skilled game developer. This person spends half an hour trying to get inside a blue public restroom and finally pisses oneself just because of being unable to realise that door opens outwards, not inwards. Pathetic? Definitely. Funny? Perhaps, but not so when you realise that it's your employee that you've sent half an hour ago to deliver some very urgent documents which had to be driven across town within 15 minutes or you'd lose a 1 million $ contract.

												You might as well just stick with the original if you already have it. Nothing in this release justifies a new release of the game.

												Love State of Decay.  Hate YOSE.  They charge their loyal fanbase full price for an 'updated' version... guess what?  Graphic options are STILL NON-EXISTENT.  They only updated the textures and lighting, you still cannot customize anything and it actually runs even worse than when the first one came out.  It's still very buggy and now it's laggy on ultra.  This game set the bar for the zombie genre but poor business practice and a deal with the devil (Micro$oft) gets a thumbs down from me.			"

												THIS IS A SCAM!If you have got the original version of this game, DO NOT buy this one. It is EXACTLY the same, absolutely NOTHING has changed.Pirates. The only addition is one character, and a ""special"" SUV, which is, yup, you guessed it, identicle to all the rest. Yeah, sure its got a Camo paint job, but when its covered in zombie blood its the same. Same loot space, same health, the lot.As for the character? Meh, they are all the same any way pretty much, just looks a bit different. Sound familiar?Pirates.Also, as of now, there are no mods that work on this version as far as I'm aware, so yeah sure, its not a bad game, but the first one is better, as it can be modded. And it needs modded. The first game wasnt finished, in my opinion, and neither is this one. PiratesDont even buy this if you have money to burn, you'd be better off doing just that. This is exactly what is wrong with game development companys, and Gaming in general, They seem to think that they can do whatever they please, charge you a ridiculus price for it, and get away with it. Imagine it was something like a new car, which claimed it was overhauled, and better than the previous version, but when you buy it, all they have done is change the colour of the seat-covers. Would you be satisfied? I think not.			"

												I'm reviewing this game as someone who  DID NOT  play the original title. I understand people are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that they have to pay for this having already bought the original.The best way of describing this game is that it's a mixture of Theme hospital(lol), gta, dead rising and DayZ. The gameplay mechanics are massively rewarding and the base upgrading and scavenging/looting system are really well done.I've noticed quite a bit of clipping, lackluster textures for a PC title. and pretty shameful graphic options. On the Ultra preset it looks OKAY. you can expect to run it maxed out @ 60fps on the 6 series of Nvidia cards and above.Driving feels pretty horrible after playing straight from GTA5 also.The gameplay, progression system and rewarding base upgrading together with pretty satisfying combat makes the graphic niggles and driving not such of a big deal, though. Great game so far.			"

												This is a hard one. I really really REALLY want to like this game. Its got all the elements for what should basically among the best zombie survival games ever. Usable cars, scavaging for loot and supplies, hundreds of weapons, base creation. But the massive set backs completely ruin this game. I'm not talking about the fact is basically the same game as the standard version. But instead things more key to the gameplay. The main thing that ruins this game for me is just how ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and useless the player controlled characters are. They usually cant do their automatically assigned jobs, most of them have no skills at all when you recuit them (apart from special heros), they wont use guns most of time, depending on what gun they have they usually cant effectively use it (seriously what the hell is wrong with ai and shotguns in this game), and none of them seem to understand the importance of always having someone on the watchtower (which as the main/only real defence your actual base has)  leaving you contantly open to attack. It doesnt sound like much but its just so frustrating when all your high level characters permadeath after spending hours training them up, just because they dicided to try to hit the massive boss zombie with a stick, rather than fire an assault rifle at it.The scavenging on this game also feels like a waste of time, in most of my playthroughs i dont bother taking a lot of the supplies as the most common items are way to common, all my bases have enough food to open a supermarket after about 2 hours of playing, whereas materials are almost impossible to find. Along with other low level weapons, melee weapons and pistols are never usually worth picking up, and in most cases even bullets aren't even that worth encumbering yourself with as you typically only use rifle rounds, and after a few hours of play you can just make them yourself. With no console command or no weapons dealer the very rare guns are basically impossible to get. It really needs balancing and the supplies need to be better distributed.Breakdown. The main DLC to play is a nice idea in theory but rapidly becomes boring. All that changed are the zombies slowly level up as you go. I cant believe theres 100 levels of breakdown, My personal best is 6, then i get bored and play something else. With no variation in levels you always start a level, loot the army bases looking for the rare guns, then build up which ever base is your favourite. Theres no side missions or random events to keep the levels fresh, its just a rinse and repeat affair. The only thing that keeps you going is the hope you stumfble along a new weapon, but its not really enough to base a game around. All in all its a game that shows lots of promise but gets let down by a few massive issues that just sap the fun from the game. "

												I really want to love this game.  I had 50 hours on the previous version and I have logged 5 hours of what was supposed to be a really awesome SOD weekend for me.  There are a few perks to buying this game:  -The graphics are an improvement.-There are a few bonuses for buying the YOSE edition.-The game is based on one of my favorite games for the PC. The problems that will make me not recommend this game:-There are buggy zombies that appear to morph between/on top of/and around walls.-I have had to restart my computer 15 times in the five hours that I have played!-I have followed every direction on the dev's forum, on their own website, and on recommendation pages that I found on Google, and the longest I have been able to play without a restart is 30 minutes!When I bought the original version of SOD I lived with the glitches because they, at worst, caused the game to crash and there was a fairly forgiving autosave, but this is ridiculous!  This project seems not to have addressed the most infuriating aspect of the original game.  How am I supposed to enjoy a game when I have to reset my PC every 20 minutes?  Then I get the joy of finding that one of the developer's solutions is to reduce the resolution of my monitor to 1280X720!  If one of the selling points of this patch was the resolution upgrade, why wasn't it taken into account that PC gamers would have high quality monitors?  Overall I will say that I am having a great time with this game, and if the dev offers a substantial update to help with stability issues, I will change my review, but I can't recommend that anyone buys this game without taking into consideration that you will have moments of mad fury when you are driving back to your home base and your screen suddenly jerks to a stop... try to remember where you were at your last autosave, because your truck (that was probably full of supplies) is probably still all the way out there.For me, I will not play this game again until a patch comes through.  I regret spending the money on a studio that sold me a broken product.			"

												If you already own and are happy with SoD (and DLC's) in it's current form, then I would say no don't get YOSE. I don't feel that the improvements are worth $20. If I did better research and known what I know now, I wouldn't have bought it (yeah that's my fault)I honestly think UL took advantage of their loyal fanbase. People that have the original and DLC's shouldn't have to pay extra to get the same game with improvements that should have been patched into the game. I was playing for a few hours and the improvements are barely noticable.I wouldn't mind paying a reasonable amount of money for some new content like a map, melee weapons and different dialogue. Yes Lily you can get annoying. Anyway, it is partially my fault for not doing my research, but I still feel cheated.I would recommend SoD to NEW players because it is pretty awesome.I see people saying that UL didn't have much choice and the publisher's made them push out the ""remastered"" version. I don't know whether that's true or not. But let's not sugarcoat it, it's clearly a $20 patch.			"

												I wanted to like this game…I really did…but this game needs some more patching and tweaking to be fully enjoyable. I DO NOT PLAY ANY console games so I had NO idea that this game was originally developed for that market. I think that in the description of the game it should be stated that the game is a port from crap consoles and it shows. I do not understand, do devs not play PC games? Do they not know what standard PC control scheme is? Or do they not simply care? This game is a perfect example that there needs to be a return policy, period.  Anyway, this game has promise but unless you enjoy finger gymnastics (since you cannot reconfigure control) I would stay away from it. Also the camera control and aiming sucks, no level progress indicators, and did I say 1080p i.e. 1920 x 1080 resolution is all you get in this “HD” remaster…and forget about NVidia surround or AMD eyefinity…THIS IS A BED PORT ABSOLUTELY NOT optimized for PC land, it has “consolelides” all over it . Just maybe if it was on sale for $10 I would recommend but as it stands it needs a BIG patch to make it PC worthy title, sucks wasted $30.			"

												I beat the original and decided after a year of letting this ferment, I'd see if Undead Labs fixed the glaring bugs or just let it rot...( I didn't actually play recently, I was watching a live feed of someone else-For the record)I loved the initial game. The concept was amazing!  It was something no one had dared to do , and it was FUN.Story was kinda shoddy, but eh all zombie movie plots are so I digress.So as I dust off the canister or Trioxin, and see where we are...I warn you...It's not pretty...It's still rotting...sadly. *cough cough*Still have zombies spawing inside established bases, cars still go airborne if hitting the fat f&^ks, same useless survivors unable to♥♥♥♥♥♥without my assistance, BUT we added new bugs...oh boy...like on horde clearing waves, there are twice as many as before, your awesome car takes double the damage so running them over like before, which is the smart play, is not always the option. Oh and the bomb activated locations on your map that you stragetically build to prevent such a thing, yeah...no longer effective. it blows a horde apart but somehow a few survive the blast. Petty? Um no...it was a f#$king bomb. They should ALL have been eliminated. They set the RNG to place survivors who untie their shoes and get stuck in a garage simultaneously with another one who lost their flashlight and now is also trapped in a workshop 20 minutes apart so you have to pick who you make it to, oh and the one you don't pick who would have joined your posse of ineptitude and made it not suck so bad, is always the one who was awesome. Played both versions of this game and have yet to come across a survivor to join who didn't suck. Evidently there are those who have abilities like medic,mechanic,marksman, therapist etc however, I have never come across ONE. I find the drunk,angry,sad,emotionally unstable, unable to get along in any group setting, who need constant supervision or they randomly wander off and I have to save A-F%^KING-GAIN useless ones. *sigh* And I am refering to the ones you randomly aquire who somehow have a radio to talk to us to save them but have no F#$King idea about anything else when you actually get there, and NOT the one where its all sandbox...so the main game and not the DLC is what this refers to...before I get the hate mail. I actually had more fun killing them off and trying to recruit/find/win the RNG lottery ones who didn't suck...Seriously...I was like...*welp, you have anger management issues, have run off 4 times in an hour and a half and I can't take you out on your own to help you because you got hurt while running away...oh you're healed? Used up my infirmary and meds to save your useless♥♥♥♥♥ NOW you want to whine again?? Ok lets go.....and you won't need any weapons, this will be quick. Why are we getting out of this car in front of that horde, oh you'll see you whining B&^ch...*Never found a one with super human abilities like how to open a can of food, turn a screw with an actual screwdriver and not a pencil, could handle a gun without it going off within the base p!ss!ng everyone off...etc, So let this game be a lesson to us all, in the event of a zombie apocalypse, your neighbors are going to get you killed unless you fed them to the hordes...And after year 2 they have not addressed a single complaint/bug/issue-nada. But they took our money tho as quick as possible.I hate you undead labs for breaking my heart again...and since I inhaled that gas earlier...why am I starting to think brains are yummy...ItchyScratchy			"

												Here is a quick and simple review of 'State of Decay Year 1 Survival Edition'Pro's-----The Frame rate has been raised to 60FPS so the gameplay is alot smoother.The Resolution has been raised to 1080p so the gameplay is alot clearer.The game bugs out alot less then the previous State of Decay game which for me crashed and stutered alot.There are more vehicles and since the frama rate is higher you can appreciate them on the road alot more.The game is cheaper starting today 11/06/2015 (Steam sale) then it was on day of launch even for the poeple who got the deal since they brouht the prviouse State of Decay Game. Con's------Your having to pay £22.99 for a updated version of a game you may have already played (Like myself)The exclusive new charecter, car and weapons are only avalible to those who pre-ordered the game originally (bit silly you can't get them now)Overall I did enjoy this new version of State of Decay, however I did feel the fact I had to pre-order to get the exclusive charcter (Which is a good charecter to use) was a little irritating and unfair. If I was ever to buy and Edition of State of Decay it would be this edition and I would recommend this edition to any new players over the original, espeshilly if there looking at getting any DLC at a same or later date. I hope this short yet sweet review helped your with an understanding for this game.  "

												I love and hate this game. The ""upgrades"" are minimal and not worth what they ask for. Hate may be a strong word, but this game fell way short of what if could of been, and the enjoyment is broken up frequently by bugs and other short comings, like the horrible seemingly forgotten ending of the campaign. There are a lot of other things that seem to have been left out or forgotten that could've helped the game a lot. The bugs are very very noticeable and plenty. Probably noticeable due to that fact that it has some great potential. All the old bugs are still there and now some new ones with this ""upgraded"" version. As much fun as it is, and I do keep playing it a lot, I just can't bring myself to recommend it to others. Save your money especially if you already have the original. Hopefully the developers read these reviews and see that there is a lot of interest in this game and will make an all new one that doesn't fall so short like these ones have.			"

												I pre-ordered this game thinking hey I loved the game itself why not go ahead and buy the remastered version. Then I started playing the game off the bat my mouse was no where near where it was really pointing. So at the home screen trying to choose the DLC/gamemode I had to put my mouse in the top right corner to get the regular version. Along with that it took much much longer to load and I was just think well they did give it better textures it could just be that. When it finally loaded it looked excatly the same nothing had changed at all it is the same exact game. The only real difference is that half of the mods of the game either don't work right or they just crash the game. As far as this game is right now all they did was repost their game and do a few tweaks that messed up the game. It is such a waste of money just go and buy the original it is a whole lot better then this piece of junk. Come on creators get your stuff together.			"

												For new players:If you want to play state of decay well you should probably get this because this is much better version compared to the first one. (negative reviews come from returning players who were disappointed because of the glitches that were not fixed from the original one)For returning players:The game is still enjoyable if you really like the game because they changed the combat mechanics and it looks better. Not to mention the more agile feral who can't be bumped by a car easily.My personal comments:- I thought this so called ""remastered"" would fix the weird zombie pathfinding. --' - Barely even noticed the graphical changes, but the changes are sweet.- improved combat mechanics but there are some things that needs to be fixed.- more GAMMA yey. --,5/10Please save your money or atleast think twice. Not recommended for now.			"

												ORIGINAL REVIEW / TL;DR:Best zombie game on the market. All it needs is co-op, and we're getting that with State of Decay 2.NEW REVIEW:I didn't expect this to become the top review, so I'm rewriting this review...First off, many of the negative reviews for this game are those who bought SoD before YOSE came out. I agree with these negative reviewers that this is a sham deal on the publisher's part making people pay for a repackaging of the game. YOSE is essentially SoD with all the DLCs and improved graphics, so if I had bought SoD before YOSE came out, I'd be upset too.State of Decay is certainly a different type of zombie game, as it is one that you can play at your own pace and unlike many other zombie games you actually work to try to form a civilization out of the apocalypse. I haven't played every single zombie game, but I've played ones like L4D, CoD Zombies, The Walking Dead, DayZ, 7 Days to Die. SoD is definitely my favorite out of these because it couples an open world with characters that have personalities that can grow onto you. So I guess you could call this game a cross between the Walking Dead and DayZ.Another thing that makes this game more interesting is character death. Once a character dies in a playthrough, they stay dead for good. This has resulted in me deleting my save at one point because my best character got killed in an attack. It certainly changes the dynamic of the game, and even the characters who remain alive address the death of a character.The game is very well developed mechanically. I never ran into any game breaking glitches during my first playthrough, if any glitches at all, honestly. The game is good on this aspect, although the game still has a bit to be desired in the graphics department. I don't mind that seeing as this game is about two years old and never saw a physical release until YOSE released on Xbox One. Now for actual gameplay:In short, the game is fun to play. Melee combat (which is the majority of what you'll be doing in SoD) flows very smoothly, with fluid hacking, slashing, and swinging animations. It doesn't look like you're swinging at air when you're trying to fight off zombies. Shooting is also a lot of fun. The reload times are pretty realistic (meaning they're not very fast). This can make or break the game for you, depending on who you are, but I personally love it. You also can't spray everywhere with automatic weapons and hit your targets like you can in other shooters. I think the devs did a great job overall with combat.Driving is okay, I wish the vehicles were a bit faster/more durable than they are. Also on vehicles, they can't be modded with things like bullbars, armor, etc. Although the driving in game isn't great, it isn't unbearable either. It works well for what it is, and running over a horde of zombies is always a blast. Scavenging is also a lot of fun. Essentially, you comb through buildings, landmarks, etc. for supplies to bring back to your settlement. The types of supplies vary (food, medicine, ammo, etc.) When you find supplies, you can only carry one rucksack-full at a time, so it's always best to bring a vehicle with you and possible other people from your settlement to scavenge with you. Supplies also don't respawn in the buildings you scavenge as far as I know, so you can play at your own pace as long as you can find supplies. I'm sure anyone can finish the game before they run out of places to loot so this isn't really a problem.The single complaint I have about this game is that there's no multiplayer, but that doesn't really stop me from having a lot of fun with this game. It has so much replay value. Co-op will be coming in SoD 2, though.I barely scratched the surface of this game while writing this, there is so much more to this game than what I went over. It is certainly worth full price in my mind, so give it a go. Definitely buy it if you see it on sale, though. You won't regret it. 9.5/10.			"

												Now, I love state of decay, don't get me wrong. I have it on my 360 and I loved it and thought ""Hey, base game, tad better graphics, all the dlc, and some extra vehicles. What could go wrong? Now I do like this game but whether it is just mine or all of the copies in general, I suffer from awkward controls with this game. I kind of awkwardly navigate my way through the menu trying to figure out what key does what.Do not get me wrong, I love this game but compared to what I found on the xbox, it's not quite there. I think this game needs a bit more work because in the screens it has in the corners ""LB"" and ""RB"". I realize, that might just be there for controllers, but why must they be there when there are no controllers present? I mean, it took me a few seconds to figure out what tab was and that I can't use my mouse on the main menu. All these things, though minor agitated me.I enjoy state of decay, and right now I am redownloading it because I love this game. How ever with these few pestering features I see no reason to really buy this. On top of that, the games creators, undead labs, has removed, to my knowledge, state of decay, the original one from the store. This agitates me and it really bothers me. I really do suggest others play this game, but not for $32.99 CAD. This is a poor excuse for an updated version and I think that if you are going to purchase it, don't get this version. Try your best to find the base version because hopefully you won't suffer those pestering mess of controls.5/10			"

												This is just the old State of Decay but including the 1920 x 1080 resolution patch and all DLCs, the game is great but for its price i'd suggest you to buy Miscreated which is a brand new game still under development, running on cryengine 3 and it is a multiplayer game while SoD does not have one, and Miscreated costs less than SoD, and the devs are an independent company and they're working hard, SoD is from Microsoft robbers			"

												Consider this a first impressions. This review will be updated as I play more of it, yes despite this being a negative review I will be playing more of it.So, how do I feel after playing the 'beautifully remastered' version of one of my favourite games? Rather disheartened and more than a little disappointed. Even within just over 30 minutes of gameplay I can see that not much has changed and by no means is this remastered.If you already own the previous version then keep playing that. This so far offers not much in the way of improvement never mind anything new in the way of gameplay.What I will say is that the trees look so much smoother and lighting is simply amazing compared to the original. Most textures are that bit smoother but where it really starts to fall apart is the people. I don't know if they look worse or if it is because the background looks better that the flaws/faults of their rather... clunky features just seems to shine through. Oh and for those who have played the previous version remember what a delight it was to have zombies clipping halfway through walls/windows and such? Yep. Still happening.I realise I do not have that much time in this game but as somebody who has put in close to 100 hours into the original game and owns the DLCs for the original after half an hour I just feel rather disappointed and wished to warn those who have the game, do not pick this version of the game! For those of you who do not have the original and want to pick this game up, wait. Wait for half price or some decent patches because this 'remastered' game in its current state is not worth it.			"

												So all in all I enjoy this game. It has an interesting take and decent game mechanics. The game itself hits the zombie killing itch really well. There are some glitches here and there, but nothing I found to be game breaking. However, I've pretty much called it quits over one flaw. It randomly crashes. Not even gracefully. When it crashes randomly from what appears to be some graphical coding issue it gets trapped at a black screen. It is in full screen so it gets annoying trying to break it loose and kill the process. Not very difficult, but it really tries my patience. On principle I'm going to not recommend this game. Code hygiene is a basic. I understand crashing in mod-able games like with the TES series since things are more malleable by design. Even if a game has a crashing glitch it should at least redeem itself by way of a graceful CTD, and provide a crash dump to aid in troubleshooting.			"

If anyone wants to buy this game you need to check everything out not like I did and purchase a game that dosn't says one thing on one page then says another thing on the other.			"

												It's a slightly shinier version of the exact same game that we waited a long time for fixes for. Now the game I bought and paid for will not be fixed, instead I bought the game again. This is an unacceptable practice to me. I spent many hours helping with bug reports and testing in the last version to try and fix many of the glaring issues. Re-releasing the game in order to get these fixes is garbage. I accept that the updates in this new version could not simply be applied, but should the original not still be patched? At the very least there should be a very large discount for those who originally bought the first version of the game.			"

												I love State of Decay, I've sunk over 200 hours into State of Decay, State of Decay is one of my favourite games ever. This? This is not State of Decay, at least not like I remembered. You might think that a Remaster, the so-called ""perfect version"" of this game would have less bugs or at least not add any new ones, right? Wrong. This version is BUGGIER than the original! I've seen zombies phase through walls like they are ghosts, zombie spawning seems off especially with regards to the specials (why the heck are there 3 ♥♥♥♥ING BIG UN'S spawning right next to each other on a street?) mission starts are off, its slower, I have to put the graphics to the lowest setting just to have a BARELY PLAYABLE experience. Why did I pay all this money for what basically amounts to a re-paint? There seems to be NO new content, I just do not see the value.Long story short, I do not think this game is worth the asking price if you have the original version. Other than some cosmetic changes there really isnt that much here. If you dont have the original, sure, buy it, it is a good game still. If you do, dont. Stick with the original. Like I said, I've sunk over 200 hours into that version. I doubt I'd do the same for this one.			"

												I had fun with this game, but I can't recommend it due to a number of issues.The story:The storyline is extremely bland and forgettable. The story takes place in a cookie-cutter American zombie apocalypse universe. No suprises here. The characters and dialogue are just as bland as the setting. In all fairness, the storyline in Lifeline is actually somewhat interesting. It's still not great, but it actually has some suspense and drama to carry it forward.The voice acting:It seems like the minor survivors are voiced by 2, maybe 3 actors in total. I was regularly saving survivors with the same voice as Marcus. You'll hear the same lines of dialogue over and over again. Many of the character models are recycled too, it seems. The gameplay:The combat is pretty fun. Popping zombie skulls open with a well-placed bullet is always fun - can't really go wrong with that. The melee combat isn't too bad either. It's all pretty simple, but I don't really have any big complaints.Mechanics:Base management is simple and boring. There's no real strategy or depth to it. It feels really lazy, and it's a big missed opportunity to add some much-needed depth to the game. Base defense is buggy and obnoxious. My biggest complaint about the game is inventory management. There are several different types of painkillers that do the exact same thing but take up separate precious inventory slots. Weapons occupy backpack slots, whether or not you're holding them in your hands. The trunks and truckbeds in this game are the size of a suitcase apparently. A small pistol takes up the same amount of space as a grenade launcher. There's a weight system, but it only really exists to punish you for carrying the wrong combinations of items - it's not something you really care about, it's just an annoyance. You'll find yourself making constant trips back to base to drop off loot. I feel like I spent most of the game tediously managing my inventory and running loot back to my base.Summary:Driving around running over zombies is pretty fun. And there are lots of different guns to shoot zombies with, which is fun. But unfortunately the game suffers from a depressing lack of depth and polish.			"

												Since I absolutely loved the original game I wanted really badly to play this version of the game.However, the performance is insanely unbearable. Stutters and fps drops are consistent.I have waited months for some sort of noticable performance update or simply some better GFX settings beyond Low, Medium, High, and Maximum settings. But nothing.This is the first game that I am actually considering trying to request a refund for. Compared to other games I play, there is just no excuse for this from State of Decay. If I can put countless hours into ports made by Ubisoft than Undead Labs and Microsoft Studios should be able to make something remotely playable.And this whole rant was without even mentioning the fact that this version of the game holds nearly any difference to the original. The gameplay changes and visual improvements were incredibly minor. The greatest improvements were the integration of items and facilities between game modes/DLC. Something that should have been done originally from the contents release.I've resorted to playing the original game again. Albeit with some spite. "

												I wouldn't recommend this steaming pile to anybody, when I first played this game I thought it was money well spent I couldn't even fathom how the game got a single bad review, but the more I played the more I realised why the game got bad reviews. The combat was one of the clunkiest i had ever seen for a third-person shooter I'd never be able to count the amount of times I had swung my weapon (like a barn door) without connecting with anything only to have the zombie jump on to me. And if the combat wasn't bad enough you would always be graced by some glitch such as entering cars and getting stuck inside and then watching zombies try to pull you out of the car but failing each time. All in all, I think the game had a great idea behind it but next time try and release a complete game. It's because of people not putting the effort in to finish anything, and that's why we're headed for a depression.(Edit: Buggier than any Bethesda game)			"

												ONLY BUY THIS IF YOU DON'T ALREADY OWN THE ORIGINAL GAME. I bought this in a mad frenzy that ensues when every anything State of Decay shows up on my radar. My fault, I blame nobody for this impulsive mistake (except myself). Yes, they improved the graphics a little.. and.. um.. made the zombie's eyes glow.Kind of feels more like a paid beta test for the improved engine they're hypothetically using for the forthcoming MMO (another greed move, they couldn't just put in a freakin' co-op mode in State of Decay first, could they?)So, instead of patching the myriad bugs and issues in this otherwise excellent game.. they release a ""special edition"" and make us pay for what should have been patches on a normal release schedule. A dirty, money-grabbing way to do business. Buy this only if you like supporting greed.THUMBS DOWN, GUYS.			"

												I played the first game, I enjoyed it but Year One offers nothing.  Lifeline is made for you to loose the game. I  enjoy the process of building a good defense and this offers no chance as survival, scavaging, rescuing or anything. The constant feel of rush rush rush in everything is not enjoyable at all. I understand and like having to make decisions that can affect the game but Lifeline is x1000 of what it should be.The game has been out for awhile now and there are major bugs still in the game.7/28/15     DO NOT BUY			"

												I will start off by saying: DO NOT waste your money on this version of the guy, you are better off buying the original version, and even that isn't worth $20.  The developers were lazy and the PC port is utter crap, literally.  It doesn't matter how good your computer is, you will get sporadic FPS for the smallest things.  I got a lag spike that brought me down to around like 15 fps just from turning around.   Yes, turning around.  The graphics settings are sad, you have no control of anything.The only way you can turn off shadows to run this vomit infested garbage is to download a mod, yes, a mod, to turn shadows off, it's downright ridiculous.  I don't buy games to spend hours fixing it's issues.  When I download a game, I'd like to just quickly fix my settings and play it....and with this game, it's not that simple.If you feel like modding this game for it to function at an acceptable rate.  Acceptable because even with mods, it still is a broken game.  DO NOT buy this game.  Unless the price is knocked down to 9.99, dont even bother wasting your money on this game.The game is great, it's fun BUT the FPS issues are a game breaking draw back.  The preformance price you have to pay to play this game is not worth it at all.  You're better off spending your money elsewhere.			"

												This is the closest thing to a proper single player zombie game that's ever been invented.  I recommend this game hesitently knowing how scummy the devs are that made the game (they released a very buggy game and then re-released it with bug fixes and charged full price rebranding it as a new game).  That being said, the game is actually so good I'm willing to put aside my morals and say if you are looking for a proper single player zombie game, this is the best that you will find.It still has some bugs, and there are many things I wish they would change, but overall the game kicks♥♥♥♥♥  Things I wish were changed:-I wish they made the game mod-able so we could see awesome community driven content-I wish there was a proper element of human vs. human combat and politics.  As it stands the game is really just humans vs. zombies-I wish there were more maps for the sandbox mode, or better yet randomly generated maps-Along the same lines I wish you could make your base in any structure on the map-I wish that the ""management"" aspects of the games allowed you to pause the game.  I'd like to review my characters while back at home base and make plans for my base without half a day worth of gametime passingThings I love about this game:-The combat is very well done.  When you are overwhelmed by zombies there is always a chance to beat the odds and survive, which feels absolutely epic when you pull it off, but at the same time the brutal death scenes and permadeath make the death sting that much more. This entire portion of the game is beautifully executed.  A+-The base building and managment aspects of the game are far better than I expected.  It is so fun having a base and a community of survivors you have to care for.  This is one of the coolest aspects of the game and something I haven't seen properly done in any other zombie games (they usually just focus on you as a sole survivor).  There's room for improvement here but as it stands it is the best you'll get from this genre of games.-If you are a fan of The Walking Dead, this is the closest game you will find to emulating that experience.-The map is very well designed and the main storyline was actually pretty decent.Overall it's the best Zombie game out there and I don't foresee any others surpassing it any time soon unless some amazing Fallout 4 zombie mod gets made.  If you can look past your morals and just buy this version of the game you'll have a good time.			"

												Walking dead meets GTA:---THE PROS---- Great graphics, the day-night cycle is just right and when the night comes you will be scared- Fun to build bases, outposts, drive around, collect stuff - Good performance on my GTX Graphics card, doesn't lagg at ultra- Plenty to do, you will care for the people you play with, you will build them the way you want to, play them the way you want to- Good story indeed, its not linear in any way, you arrive at your first base and you are free to do what ever you want but if you ignore some things ,some quests, your base's moral will slowly fall down what could lead to a guy or girl leaving or even killing themself so you really immerse yourself into the game- As previously said its immersive, you will really feel like you are in a zombie outbreak town- Small detail but you can climb stuff like for example in the witcher 3, it feels really good to do so- Has trading cards and achievements---THE BAD---- It's really hard to headshot zombies due to them moving very zombie like, yeah it is realistic but no need for that much of real life - Would be so cool if we could make our own guy in the game and dress him up, that would be much more awesome but thats a small detail- No multiplayer, I would be so happy if a game like this would be coop or online mp---OVERALL---It's an absolutely amazing game, you will play for hours just exploring and building up bases, listening to the soundtrack and feeling isolated from the real world.Score: 9/10			"

												Very dissapointing! The gameplay is fairly good but definatley not wort it if you played the original SOD. But gameplay aside, this has been very poorly optimized which has me subject to many random lag spikes. If you haven't played the original state of decay and have a VERY good computer you should but it. If you've played the original and/or have an average computer then I would recommend waiting for them to fix the perfomance issues and/or for Undead Labs to add new content.			"

												To all of the grouchy Squidwards who are poised to strike and dislike, you can gripe and complain about the way I wrote something very informed and to-the-point, but make it be known that I honestly couldn't care less. That goes ditto for doing it on other peoples' reviews. It's just pointless. But anyways...State of Decay, in my opinion, comes with three games. The base game and its two expansion packs, but the thing is that all three each share their own style of play, which I'll break down. If any of these are to your liking, I insist you buy this game. Once I've finished covering the three different games, I'll explain the similarities. Sound good?State of Decay; base game, is my least-played mode despite how story-oriented it is. I can't put my finger on what the hell I don't find attractive in it, but bottom line, I don't put much time in it. Still, it gives you the tutorial of everything SoD-related, and has a strong emphasis on the caretaking of NPC's, and trying to escape certain doom. If you want a zombie game with a plot, and one that is more focused on keeping yourself and your community in this apocalypse alive, this should be a steal for you.Breakdown; my favorite, goes for a neverending, open-world experience that was highly requested of the developers. Breakdown has no end - unlike State of Decay and Lifeline, which both end once you finish all of the quests, Breakdown has no plot-oriented quests or ultimate ending. It's entirely focused on gathering loot, building a community, slaying zombies, and just seeing how far you can get before you ultimately lose everybody you love. Breakdown is the best part of State of Decay: YOSE, because of how limitless it is. If you want a zombie game that stresses open-world, limitless zombie survival with a sole focus on PVE, Breakdown was brought down from heaven and into the Steam Store, just for you.Lifeline is a considerable challenge. It turns the difficulty up to the highest mark, and makes the gathering of resources much harder, so as a result, my Army FOB started out healthy and strong, and is now looking like my local Pizza Hut (the one with the bullet hole in the window). To add further insult to injury, unlike Breakdown and State of Decay, which have zombie ""assaults"" as mere skirmishes with hordes that pass by your settlement, this one has zombies that mass up and slam you in overwhelming waves. It's actually kind of frightening. If you want a serious challenge, Lifeline provides.All three games share the same mechanics and controls - one big thing about State of Decay is permadeath. Each character has one life. Nobody (except for one character in Breakdown) has plot armor; everybody is highly susceptible to being torn in half (the zombies seem to favor that execution over all others), and as a result should be treated with extreme caution. What puts great stress on this point is that each character has different skills and talents, which can be leveled and improved, so that makes them even more precious.In stiff contrast to Dead Island, for example, there is an equal focus on melee and firearms, which I do like since I adore guns. Just as well, since, like Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare, Zeds only go down with a bullet or a baseball bat to the cranium (headshots), with the exception of any .50 caliber weapons, which can kill zombies with one shot anywhere, fire, and explosives/explosions. Guns are especially useful when you consider that these zombies are actually quite sharp - they move fast and attack fast. As a developer said in an interview, if you're dealing with say, two zombies in close proximity; no sweat if you know what you're doing. More than two, and things get problematic. Melee encounters with hordes are desperate pleas for death.So ultimately what this game offers is three different variants of the same game, but they all share the same focus on building a community and rescuing other survivors. I highly recommend this game.			"

												In spite of the glitches and diamond-in-the-rough quality, I am a big fan of the original State of Decay on Steam. To play it with fewer glitches, a few new moves, and a few new cars was completely worth the $20 (for a previous owner) cost of admission. However, I regret it now. It refuses to play properly on my system no matter how I tweek the resolution and other graph settings. It chugs and sticks and isn't even as smooth as the first edition. For me, it's been unplayable.  From the start, at the ranger station, I lost voices before Ed was attacked. There were times when I couldn't gather the duffle of supplies.There were some other changes to expect that were not present previously, and they that are debatable changes. There are many more zombies. It is difficult to accomplish missions because of the additional hordes. Driving a car creates zombie pride day every moment. They swarm at the sound of a vehicle. Stealth walking is the only way to travel in peace. Infestations are much bigger.They could have fixed the glitches. They could have added just a little new dialog and a few new voices. They could have made it playable without the chugs and lack of control from the frame rate slow downs (Saving Maya a gruesome death stating right next to a car door). Instead, they took my $20 and gave me an unplayable game.Thanks Undead Labs.  "

												Overall the game is not worth $30 yet.. The game has just come out a few days ago and it has a billion bugs. some break the game and some are just annoying. such as ill bring home a brand new mustang car and I go out to scavange ina  different car and the mustang is teleported across the map somewhere for some reason. (happens frequently) also sometimes my cars will randomly flip on there sides and i have to hit it with another car to get it on wheels and i get points takn off for recless driving. simply walking to a ladder off the top of a building sometimes it wont register and you end up ""running"" over the ladder and falling to your death. There was a time i even picked up a weapon and equipted it and there was nothign in my hand but I was swinging my fists around like there was this giant heavy hammar in my hands. I could go on with the list of bugs but I dont want to waste your time. Just wait till there are a few good patches to fix a majority of these bugs. Because after you get past all these bugs this game is perfect. Its like a GTA Zombie survival shootem up. the possibilities are endless. Me personally I horde cars I got like 20 cars shoved into the second home you come across in the game.			"

												Now that the original version of State of Decay is not available on Steam Store any more, it no longer makes sense to me to compare the two versions and try to make your point pro or against upgrading to YOSE. So, I deleted my previous review and wrote a new and more general one instead, mainly for those who are not yet familiar with State of Decay at all. EDIT: The DLCs are still available for the original version, but the main game is not.In my opinion, this is quite an underrated game in general, and to me the best zombie game I have purchased so far. I can't say that I'm a huge fan of the genre and have tried even nearly them all, but I have seen my share of gameplay for quite a few of them. Anyway, I feel that the user review aggregate doesn't do State of Decay itself as a game any justice, because of the controversy the YOSE edition caused with it's pricing weighed against it's added content which many felt was next to nonexistent.First of all, I really like the combat system that actually has more depth to it than at first meets the eye. The variety of different melee and ranged weapons and the personal skills and abilities of different individuals make many different character builds viable and add to the replay value. The range of weapons is nicely complemented by the crafting possibilities of different explosive and incendiary weapons for horde control. Not to mention the use of different vehicles not only as a means of transport, but also as a quick and relatively safe way of  thinning out the densest ranks of zombies. Yet the most compelling point to me is the importance of scavenging and resource management, which with different home base upgrades adds a strategic aspect to the game. Where to build your outposts, what resources to stack and how to best put them to use are questions you have to constantly ponder to best suit your preferred way of surviving. Chance also plays a role here as the composition of your group of survivors, their traits and proficiencies have an effect on which may be the most beneficial way to go on each playthrough.I highly recommend this one to anyone who doesn't mind a bit of thinking and planning in addition of the merciless slaughter of the undead.

												This is well worth buying, as you get three games in one. The Story is fun, as you gain more characters and equipment, allowing you to move to better home bases.Breakdown allows you to increase the 'hardness' of the game as you move up levels. Each level has the same map, which is shame, but vehicles and items you find does decrease.LifeLine well for me is the hardest of the three games, as it is more 'time based' You are only given a short period of time to search or complete tasks, before you have to return to your Home Base to defend againsts Hordes.

												The idea, setting and beginning of the game ist just great - but after some time it starts to become more something like a day at work - so much to do, a lot of things do not work out, time is always of the essence, and the people in your ""staff"" start to do a lot of crap when youre not looking. That said, the game could still be cool - but the tasks you have to fulfill are very, very repetitive and become boring instead of exciting (very much like work, also). I'd really like to play a remake of this game that ""smoothes"" out all its annoying little flaws - it would be a relly great game. All in all, no recommendation (but its close).			"

												First off, this is a zombie game. Nothing like taking a pipe and whailing on an undead until your arm is tired.That being said this game is horrible in every other regard. Asside from being dull as dish water its basically GTA/SR style games with zombies as cops. Seems fine except zombies spawn out of nowhere in an unending flood. You never feel a sense of accomplishment when you clear a building and 10 new ones spawn outside and come running in that werent anywhere nearby before. Houses seem to be zombie magnets, stay ouside in the fresh air and open fields where they cant get you. Clearly these where gamers before they died.Questing is broken as can be often completely removing a side quest if a main one or new side decides to showup. Toggling the map to search for it turns up nothing.AI is broken, while at times humorous, very annoying. God forbid you want to make a quick getaway while your partner tries to make up his mind what door he wants to get into deciding to take a leasurely stroll into the drivers side bumper for a few minutes while zombies run up, bend him over the hood and introduce him to prison♥♥♥♥♥♥ This is not a rare bug, this will happen almost any time they approach the front side of the vehicle you get into. Dont forget you can flip a car just by hitting a small bump cause the physics are garbage. Or you know. Decide outside the base is a great idea during a zombie seige. Zombies will often glich out when climbing and shooting them has a good possibility of them just teleporting to the otherside for quick easy access to your yummy delicious flesh.AI are stupid in the matter of guard towers, they dont use them even though they are avaliable. When they are an actual designated structure they often leave them unmanned because they are ""tired"" and no one takes their place. Not that someone with a shotgun is any good at hitting anything further than the base of the tower anyways. Might as well be shooting cottonballs out of a shotgun if you're  further than shoving it down a zombie's throat. Most item durability is a joke. Zombie hoard? Get in a car and run them over cause your generic tools wont last the fight, firing a gun is a waste of time cause it just generates more zombie spawns.My mind is still boggled how a small tri town of maybe 1000 residence can have so many zombies. The way I ran over zombie hoards I should have had the entire populous cleared in ten minutes.On top of all this I felt bases were generically useless and left me with little customizing or results of what was there to the point I wondered why they even bothered. The lack of realism in any sense just left me laughing. Like a Juggernaught walking to the gate of a chainlink fence when it should be able to walk through. Or better yet. Lets board up these windows but not let us shoot through the boards instead the boards will break no matter where you shoot. These are all lazy♥♥♥♥♥mechanics you expect 15 years ago.			"

While still not bug free, the game is running ALOT better...(Strange miracles do happen I suppose) I wil not change my downvote but I will say read the reviews..and decide if this title is something you want to invest in.Absolutely horrible, DO NOT PURCHASE! Wish I could get a refund.The above being said, I own this game and all of it's DLC's for Xbox, I like it so much I bought it for my pc...as my pc goes with me everywhere and my xbox does not. Having played..or well tried to play it  I have pretty much given up.Bugs Everywhere,,,,THIS GAME IS BUGGIER THAN A HOTELS BED (and that's being generous, I'd call it pretty much broken. I play Early Alphas that are put together better than this) can't even fight properly as half the time I hit the zombie while it manages to hit me, or they are just plain unkillable no matter how many times you do hit them.Let's not forget the zombie who I used Z to kill..getting up and continuing to hurt me WITH A BROKEN AND SMASHED HEAD (Really? this is just plain♥♥♥♥♥♥..) This is a CHEAP and rather CRAPPY made version of the console title.. and again I repeat DO NOT PURCHASE, unless of course you just love wasting your money....I don't, and I am sorry I paid for this.

												I can't believe I paid for this, there are more bugs and glitch's in this version than the original and the graphics are not that impressive. I would have thought they would have fixed all the things that where wrong with this game but they didn't and they added new ones. My advice, if you have the original don't bother, but if you do have the game it's fun to play even though the glitch's really♥♥♥♥♥♥you off.			"

												I know this is a very fun game, that is why I bought it at the first place, but how I wish I knew this before buying this game for PC. The lag is REAL for this game, even on the lowest graphic settings. I searched for solutions to this problem, but due to my technology noobiness, I wasn't able to follow the unclear instructions provided. So if you think you are tech savvy enough, go ahead and buy this game, but be warned!			"

												Overall:  Yes, recommended.  It has a story line that is above-average, game-play is above-average, graphics are above-average (considering when made).  Everything is essentially above-average.  It needs a bit of work, but still worth buying, especially on sale.Pros:Story - A bit fast-paced at times, without much explanation for the ""why"", but it's not the worst.  Immerses the player adequately.  Playable Characters - Each character seems unique and has their own personality.  I believe there are over 100+ characters/NPC's in game.  Characters/NPC's will bicker between each other and do small missions (i.e. scavenging) on their own.  A nice touch.  Makes the base camp feel like the NPC's are contributing without you having to do everything.  They also defend the base on their own.Game-play - needs some polish, but it's still enjoyable.  Melee (blunt, edged, heavy weapons, etc.), gun-fighting (all types of pistols, rifles, SMGs, shotguns and sniper rifles), and vehicles (cars, trucks, SUVs) sum up the way to kill zombies.  3rd person perspective only - pro or con based on your taste.  Works great while outside.Base-building - definitely one of the best characteristics.  Build up the infirmary, food storage, tower, workshop, etc. to provide various benefits for your group.RGP-like - can level up various skills.  Not very intricate/complex, but enjoyable.Weapons degrade over time and need to be repaired.Scavenging - fun to scavenge.  Grab a survivor to watch your back though, especially at night, and hop in a car (more cargo space than your backpack).Radio - can call in scavengers to help bring back supplies, back-up (SWAT), artillery, new home base relocation, etc.  Of course, you have to complete missions to unlock many of these.2 other DLC's that are included in YOSE which change things up a bit.Cons:3rd person only - pro or con.  Can be problematic when entering buildings and small rooms.  Cannot see threats until the character is fully in the room due to 3rd person.-Driving - one area that really needs a patch.  It...just...doesn't....feel right...the turning and handling is a bit strange; also, accelerating and decelerating does a weird zoom in & out which distorts vision - hard to drive and recon the area b/c of it.  -Closing Doors - ugh, an area that is very annoying.  Sometimes you'll close them without a problem, other times you have to maneuver the character a bit before you can close doors (time consuming) - not good when being chased by a zombie horde.-NPC's / AI - weird glitches occasionally such as:  will stop accompanying you for no reason - happened twice to me; when escorting AI to destination, they've stopped moving just outside the objective (I had to physically push them into the objective to complete the mission - happened twice).  Companions like to block doorways - not game breaking, just an annoyance, you can roll through them or even push them out of the way.  They also like to spazz out and take their time when loading into vehicles - again, not game breaking, just needs a patch.Rated 7 out of 10.			"

												From the screenshots, descriptions and reviews the game looked promising but I am quite disappointed: The world feels empty, you can find items only in scavengeable locations, there are no drops from zombies. There are a lot of cars everywhere but all their trunks are empty. There is no really any goal. You are being spammed with very repetitive missions (kill zombie/rescue survivors/clear location/scout area/collect resources). Within a few hours of gameplay you have the largest available base with all buildings constructed. Except a few buildings' upgrades there are no upgrades in game. You cannot add weapon/armor to your car or craft and attach a scope to your weapon. You can attach silencers to weapons which are destroyed after 10/30/50 shots. You cannot detach silencer or replace is with a new one. The world is small and easily accessible. One of the first missions is to drive to the other end of map which takes only a few minutes. Cars don't have fuel. They can blow up if you drive over zombies too much. Poor choice of items. Melee weapons, range weapons, usables (medications and grenades) and that's it. There are no armors and an assault rifle takes same space in the inventory as 3 grenades. There are two types of backpacks giving you either 8 or 10 slots for items. Weapons statistics are not shown. For melee weapons you have absolutely nothing other than it's cost. For range weapons there are a few icons but without any descriptions you have no idea what they mean. AI of your fellow survivors is very poor. They will not attack zombie if it is rushing at them until it hits them. They often get stuck in buildings or are unable to get in cars. You may be just being killed by two zombies and they will be standing a few meters away and watching. No save/load. Game saves automatically and if you die the character is gone, you can still play as another character though. I did not really enjoy having to copy save files. The game is not prepared for multi-screen setups. It blacks out non primary screens. If you minimize it, it switches from fullscreen to window and there is no setting to switch it back. You have to search on forums for a magic alt+enter combination to bring it back to fullscreen, and this combination is not even in the controls. There is no borderless windowed mode. "

												What I think about this so called remasterHonestly after playing about 15 mins of playing this I thought is was a complete waste of money and do not recommend purchasing this at all.The so called graphics improvements are noticeable (if only the slightest) in what I think giving the game a more cartoony feelFrom what I saw there was one new vehicle and some of the others had been remodeled/reskined, there were a couple of redesigned items and a fancier inventory, survivors, home management screenI all so think there were a couple of new zombie animations and the airdrops are a nice addition but honestly this is only really worth being a $5 dlc for the original game which I thought was one of the best zombies games I've played in a long timeBut if you have already played the first game and found it very enjoyable or your new to SOD and looking for a great game to play, you may forgive the $20-30 dollar price that is asked for this butI diden'tIn ShortAudio - Hasn't changedVisuals - Slightly ImprovedGameplay - only a few little additionsoverall, this is not worth the price that it is currently selling for(Edited because someone wasn't happy with me trying to save the person reading this some money)			"

												First off i would recommend to buy it on a sale but if you think this game got everything you want for a zombie survival game, who am i to tell you what to do.You start at the lake where you spent some time with your friend but then some cannibals (because they dont seem to know what a zombie is) are trying to get a piece of you.Here i tell you a bit of the content:-Base building: After a while you find your destination to your first home the church at those homes you can resupply, rest, switch your character, etc. If you are sick of the little room you have you can get a new home with more space BUT you can only have one base. Also you can choose what your base contains for example more beds or a garden to produce food.-Zombies: Normal zombies are fast or not its a surprise, but the troublemakers are the freaks. Freaks are mutated zombies with special abilities like pin you on the ground or just smash you. Every Zombie is sensitive to sound so its an advantage or disadvantage, because while they can hear you they can also hear fireworks and other distractions.-Survivors: You can get more and more survivors to join you, but you have to win their trust. Every survivor is different and if they die they stay dead. If your character is tired or wounded you can choose one of the other survivors in your home.-Map: The map is large and contains small towns, big cities, farms and a military base.-Cars: In this game you can choose between a medium cast of cars some have more place in the trunk, others are faster, etc. But cars make a lot of noise wich attracts the undead and you are driving a car not a tank so it dont take much to destroy them.-Loot: You can find everything you need to survive weapons, snacks, firecracker, ammo, painkillers, everything. But you are not the only one taking the supplies you need to keep your home stocked with food, ammo, medicine, building materials and oil.-Gamemodes: In ""State of Decay:YOSE"" you get 3 modes but they arent that different. The modes are: State of Decay (basic), Breakdown (Harder than the basic mode with big hordes attacking your home in waves) and Lifeline (Basicly the basic gamemode except you are the military)-Conclusion: I enjoyed State of Decay because its a solid survival game with great gameplay elements and this game makes sure you wont run out of zombies. I hope i could help you out with this little review, have a lovely day!			"

												STAMINA. MY GOD, MAINTAIN YOUR STAMINA.Delivers a satisfying third-person action/survival experience at it's best. At it's worst, it's a cheaply delivered imitiation of popular ""zombie apocalypse"" games and tv shows that still manages to be dull at times. Though the balance of survival elements were a bit overbearing and unpredictable, it delivered on the action and suspense when it counted. I had a lot of fun with this one but wouldn't recommend it for someone looking for an arcade-style third person shoot'em up.  "

												t's the best zombie survival game out there. The scavenging, crafting, saving area and making base camp makes the game so realistic. Even npc's permadeath is so realistic.  Year one edition made a graphical overhaul and included all dlc's. This game is so repayable and not a game you'll be bored with so certainly it is a must have game, although the story isnt good enough but the dlc lifeline has a better story element than the original game.

												I usually don't write reviews but I think this game deserves one. Looking at the negative reviews, most of them seem to complain about the fact that people had to buy this game again. I do agree, that was a bad move for the reputation. But as a fresh player I have fresh opinions. I don't have many hours in this game but I bet there will be a plenty more.My first thoughts were just about: ""Zombie GTA!"" I just thought it played very much similar to GTA games. When I got deeper, I realized that this game was just what I had hoped for. It's what I actually look for in a zombie game: You have to think carefully what amount of zombies you can take up and not just go full rambo through a horde. And another aspect: Human survivors. Most zombie games seem to make the player the only survivor or, if the game is online, there are other players. There aren't many zombie games out there with actual human NPCs.Another great aspect is how the world lives on even if you're not playing. If the character is tired or injured, just quit the game for a couple of hours and they will be ready for action again. Good for me since games with unlimited action tend to make me bored after too much playing.If this is what you're looking for, I recommend giving this game a try.			"

												Notice my Review was removed from Store Page and I can't repost I played Past the Church to ""Finding RadioLady's Brother"", ""Protect a House for a Doctor"" and ""Find People & Items (Isaisah)"" near Gas Station & Tall/Long Bushes (And refunded the game because it did not save the ""Protect a House..."" part after the time I spent looting, when I wanted to rest from the game on ""Find People..."" part...even though saving only happens after completing a Mission...yes...can't switch characters on mission)@Charly I'm new to State of Decay & YOSE, but not new to zombie games or games in general. (Mind you, Steam counts is off)If you've never played a game, I would reccomend because State of Decay is unique because its like GTA (Graphics & Realism-ish) & Saint Row (Sprint + Melee) with Survival/Zombies/Post-Apocalypse, but blocks your grind...wait for updates.NoteI do not hate this game (cause Coder/Prog/Art worke hard and I got tired of RE (Expect ReRev1 & Raid Mode) taking down corps who destroy population, and the rest of the world is left unscathed hence Why I came up with Perishing Rain/RE Extinction Movie A Game)...read credits and want to know who is the director?), I in fact nearly cried when I realize it wasn't what I excepted and had to refund the first time.Inventory & Items- Small inventory, Vehicle Trunks have less/equal/more slots than/to Large/Small Backpack (Happy for No weight limit in Cars/Trucks)===Runout of slots faster than weight and a limited to Stacking Items (Marcus can Stack 4 Chips w/Large Bag & Maya stacks 3 Chips w/Large Bag...WHY???)===Large Backpack has 2 slots more than Small & you can't drop items, you can only destroy, no Equipment screen so equipment takes up slots (Could add 2 Slots (Simple) more or a Tab (Advance, Check Discussions for my Idea) for Equipment and you can't store items in places you found them- Being Overcumbered here is better than Skyrim, can Run, can't Sprinting, but cars are plenty- Party Members can't take stuff, weapons or items/unless I befriend them...... Bag Has few more slots than Minecraft's Quickslots)...4 Slots Without Bag, +4 Slots with Small and +2 with Large (Rugsack don't Add Slots)===And if you find another Bag -not referring to rucksack- its not like you put stuff in it, drop it, store it somewhere, carry it or have/escort someone else as they carry it===When you equip, nothing really happens unless the bag is bigger or too small- Food should be eaten on a daily basis (GTA San Andreas w/MGS Peace Walker Rating System) while Meds should only be used for injury===Food should restore back small health w/high Stamina and be easier to gather ===Meds should restore health at high rate/stamina at low rate, but hard to find -Not just hard in amount, but say Zombies in Hospital like how you have it===Needed to Mod in order to get Stats on Weapons and items too so you don't know how good something is and I don't know if you can dual weapons (Most likely Can't) and auto-switch when they break (Also I discovered there is Workshop for Cars)Driving is Awesome++ Happy you can drive (Fallout 3 & 4 don't have vehicles unless you mod), have storage (Only accessible from outside, but Journal/Inventory is accessible from inside), get dragged out of vehicle if door is gone (Love that), scrape zombies of vehicle by running into/besides things or suddenly stopping (Koodos for that), you can drive & drift like a wheelman/vin diesel with the brake and if the vehicle flips over or explodes you go automatically flying out the vehicle (Cause technically everytime a car flips over in GTA I exit, so thumbs up on that)- Can Door Attack (So Can Ai), but can't shoot or hit with weapons from vehicle (At least Aim from Car in 1stPS or 3rdPS and Party covers Blind spots, Front Passenger Covers Right/225 DEGs & In a Pickup a Back Passenger can cover all/360) - (*After Reading Update* after Refunding, so *ignore the following*) *I don't know if they have User defined customization/Re-enforcing/upgrading/repairing*/cleaning (Add Mesh to Windows, Grill Guards/Shovel/Different Exit=Roof, Clean Blood off, Repair, Gas up/Siphon/AddGas, etc)*===I tried to park into a Workshop and nothing happen, must have not fullfill something/update*, but I was kind of hoping Mechanic would be a Skill that a Survivor has and you could ask for repair and they would send you to find parts...That Extra Locker Slot for Quest Items?...Focus on Skills Please, Wrench Double as Weapons/Tool===This could be fun when trying to start a car/battery while zombie surround, but hey so is going to the workshopDLCs (*Unsure) - DLCs are Spinoffs (1.99 Stories) with slight differences/advantages (Wish DLCs where in Base)===Lifeline gives you lots of guns -cause your the army- but *no commanding/tell a person where to stand*, ===Breakdown has a bunch (~20) characters you can play from...I wonder if I meet them all in each storylineHow Saving Works- Saves only when missions done. - In an open world -miles away from destination-, that leans to Linear World more than Resident Evil 1 (If being realistic is fun, then I wouldn't be able to Mario & Luigi on a zombie's head...takedown moves)===Can't switch characters mid mission and your character gets tired as time goes on (And you can't sleep in a bed either...there isn't enough for you)What are Ai/NPC like - Couldn't command Ai...even down to Ed (First Guy your with...save his life)...feels like another game where I'm doing everything and everyone does nothing or help fight (Skyrim had a good/lite system for Commands, Hold Interact > Point at Targets: Floor=Wait There, Chair=Sit There, Item=Pick up Item and Enemies=Attack That, well leave where waiting to Attack,)...could instead Wait Mode > Command > Gambits (FF12)- I'm the one barricading (cabins & church...mission too), moving stuff from vehicle to vehicle & couldn't tell Ai where to stand to wait...some teamwork when fighting a horde and were all hiting the same zombie...No excuses you had space for 4 Emotional Actions, Throws Arms up*...What are you waiting for?- No Far warning when Ai is tired (Just run home)From Cabin To Church- Got to Church, unloaded stuff (5 meds I found at a warehouse w/car) and notice an Influence system (Like Currency, very good system, but can't make mistakes), Meds only have 5 Influence and I found that strange cause firecrackers & molotovs where equal and weapons had more...should have Market Stock Exchange System=What you need is worth more (I suggested already)- So I went to my jampacked SUV Yukon during First time Tour around Church and got MISSION FAILED/Romance???...came back and found out they badly needed Meds...that system is so linear, I know there is a mission with my name on it saying I have to go somewhere and find meds and bring it back (HAHAHAHA there was predictable)- Yeah meds are needed, but the weapons are worth more *Update Type-Med Rucksack/MedCase is what they wantCabin People (I found out there is no swimming or maybe lake is blocked)- I wonder if I store more meds/Rucksack would they (Cabin People) still be alive? Cause if we had to go to Church -can't command AI- who can drive in a car and fool (Thinking of Saints Row 3 hence why I kept Interacting in and out of SUV while nearby another car in Decay)Only reason I rebought the game after refunding it cause I heard of SoD2 rumor, possible Mods**, found I can overlap some keys and I sounded very arrogant...I wonder if its going to be Deja Vu (Already Seen) the same way I hoped for when I heard of SoD:YOSE for Xbox1 in Metro Newspaper (Too early for Mods**)Final ThoughtsWould refunded again (might not happen cause Steam Admins...Update* I did and it went through), reccomended if this is your first game.

												State of Decay is probably one of the most best immersive low budget zombie sandbox game i have ever come across.Especially being around since the first initial release of State of Decay, completing that made me want to know what else happened and what other senarios will occur in another story. Pretty much the entire game i have done the main + side missions and loot buildings of all sorts for specific or random goods to advance my safe haven of community i built.Pre much too much to explain, its literally a adventure. Maybe not for the first 20 minutes of gameplay cause of the typical zombie approach but after that its all action and adventure / stragedy survival !Down part is that they could have updated the original release of State of Decay, but notice that a lot of bugs have been fixed and more features have been added it was probably not so easy for the developers to just update as they probably reconfigured the framework they started building at 0.1Alpha. So i do not mind spending that extra bit of cash for it hopefully this time they should take more care of their framework and make the game struture more dynamic for them to update for State of Decay 2 (Which is actually being released soon i hear from Machinima!) It will contain Co-op gameplay which is something that i dreamt about for this game!!!! Anyways. Yeah.Story line 9/10Vehicle mechanics formular: 5/10Weapon & Fighting mechanics formular: 6*5/10Zombie AI & Friendly AI mechanics: 5/10Looting and Survival: 7/10I rate overal 7/10. Great game.			"

In fact there is really no need to switch to this version. The graphical improvements are not really noticable. The only thing maybe that was improved is a 1080p version running at 30fps.What is a contra for this version is the devs and publishers greedy politics.

												You will enjoy this game for at least 10 hours I assume.  After that you be wondering how this amazing game got so lost. Lets start with the good:-Graphics are well done, buildings and houses and car mechanics all great.-It's a sandbox game and has base building.-Game controls are fairly easy to use and generally work well.-""Zombies"" are realistic and can have a slight jump factor.CONS:-Gets old fast.-you will constantly be having to go out and rescue people that wander off your base or be forced to settle disputes within your people almost constanty.  -You can never have more than one person with you at a time except for very limited ""quest"" circumstances.-Resources are not infinite and neither are cars ""although they can be fixed"".-""Special Zombies"" can be tough at times.. you come out of a house and haven't saved in awhile and one of the huge zombies kills you.. well you're dead and that's it.  You just lost that person that you could have had since day one and was your best player.-WHEN YOU LOG OUT THE GAME KEEPS PLAYING... so when you log back in some people could be gone or heaven forbid dead and your resources will be gone just about.  The longer you are logged out for the worse it is.-Story is hardly worth bothering with.. it's mundane at best.How this game should be:-Open world sandbox.-Single player good story.-YOU pick the teams that go out and scavenge for food and tell them where and when to go.-Make parties bigger than just a small group of 2.-get rid of all the annoying distress signals ""your people only leave the base if you tell them to""-Need more materials in more places so you can play longer.-Have more freedom on basebuilding and job assignments.Do I think you wil enjoy this game? Sure but there is no way I can recommend this game for 30$ wait till it is 75% off before you even think about it.  I wanted to love this game.. sad.. really dissapointed stupid distress signals.. completely ruin the game.			"

												Though I have only played a few hours on this I have noticed no more ""bugs"" than the original game (whuch I have played 65+ hours).  To me its the next closest thing to a ""Walking Dead"" simulator than any other zobie survival game.  You try and keep your base supllied with food, medicine, ammo, construction materials and fuel;  While trying to keep you people alive.  Each survivor also has special skills which can assist in construction, medical help and combat.  Death of a character is permanent which brings even more realisim to the game.  If you like the AMC Walking Dead or just zombie survival game GET THIS ONE, you wont be dissapponted.			"

												Please bear in mind this review was left at the time of release and may be out of date. I cannot change the review because I no longer own the game (had it refunded/removed). If the bugs have been resolved, great, but my review will remain the same, just remember it's out of date so take it with a pinch of salt.I don't often leave reviews. If I do it's either a) the game is fantastic beyond words or b) the game is so awful that people need to be warned to stay away.This is nothing but a cash grab, and not even a remotely good one at that.I can't comment on the game itself, because I've not played it. I've not played it because I can't face playing it due to the many pre-game play bugs I've already encountered within the first 5 minutes of loading, which are ruining it for me.It's 2015. Yet this 'remastered' 'game' is worse than the original - wow!I have a brilliant computer, which far exceeds the top end specs for this game. My monitor is not great, it gives off a lot of glare because of the material the screen is made from. Therefore I use a 7 year old matt-effect monitor, made from a similar material to the screens of the paperwhite Kindles, resulting in next to no glare or migraines.This 'remastered' game looks no different to the original, despite my graphics card being 3 times better than the machine I had when I played the original release. The 1440 x 900 resolution I use for every other game I have (and without issue), isn't supported by this game. Yes it's in the list of resolutions, but if you actually choose 1440 x 900, you're greeted to lines around the screen (no fullscreen), about 1.5 inches of the game screen not being viewable, going off the right side of the screen, and the task bar constantly shows up and superimposes over the 'not fullscreen fullscreen.' Pressing alt+return to force 'fullscreen' works, until randomly your taskbar superimposes over the top.I'm a little OCD, so I can't play a game with 1.5-2 inches of the gameplay off the side of the visible monitor. Games shouldn't be released like this in 2015. I've tried all of the staff suggestions and none of them have provided a satisfactory screen/resolution or fixed the 1440 x 900 issue, which they haven't even agreed is a bug yet.Multiple complaints on their forums about resolutions and they release a bug fix patch neglecting the resolutions issues.For almost a month people complained about resolution incompatibilities and nothing was done. Poor service.Avoid until they a) fix the many bugs and b) offer some additional content. The 'remastered' features are not, I repeat not, worth buying this for.I no longer own the game, removed/refunded.			"

												I rarely finish games anymore, because I just haven't got time. Yet I've beaten State of Decay five separate times - each one more fun than the last. I don't know why this game is so much fun to me, but it is.The negative reviews on this game are due to the versioning and price. This is essentially a re-release of the original game, with a few tweaks. They sold it for full price, and I bought it. Is this worthwhile, if you have the old game? No, probably not. But the game itself is so good, and so engrossing, that I don't mind having essentially bought it twice.Do yourself a favor and pick this up if you haven't played it.State of Decay is a true open-world game. There isn't really a main character, per se - you can and will control multiple people. Your first main character can die. You will lose people you care about. You will be responsible for the deaths of friends. It's heartbreaking and terrifying and difficult and frustrating and sometimes it's not fair. But because of that, it's engrossing and wonderful.

												I played the original State of Decay before playing this one. Apart from some resolution settings and a view graphical changes, I can hardly tell the difference between the old and updated version of the game.However, this version comes with all the dlc included which is nice.This game is an interesting zombie game as most of them set you up as a zombie killing machine where practically nothing can stop you. In this game, you can easily be overwhelmed by 2-3 zombies; but that what makes this game fun compared to other zombie games. You are not a hero, you are a just a random person looking to survive in the zombie apocalypse. And you'll survive by scavenging, building a base (in preset locations) and dealing with the morale and personal issues of everyone within your community. Overall, I'd say its not a difficult game as long as you use your head and don't go full Rambo.I would totally recommend this game for aspiring zombie killers everywhere.			"

												While i do recommend this game on its own, i only do so if you do not own the original game. Year One Survival Edition = YOSE is basically a texture patch(barelly noticeable at that, do not trust the advertised screenshots) masked and sold as a re-release. Shamefull cash grab for something that should have been free, or at least sold as an upgrade, rather than a separate game for full price.As for the game itself its awesome!! Hope the soon-to-be released State of Decay 2 can deliver.			"

												This a great game for any fan of the post apocalyptic survival genre. The game puts you in charge of several survivors as they struggle through a zombie outbreak (Explained in the story mode).You get to manage the survivors home, and its different upgrades, which all add something different to the survivors (Kitchen/training room/ sniping tower, etc). You can control each and every survivor that is in your group as long as you befriend them (which can be done easily) and then use them to scavenge or go out on a killing spree against zombies.The story mode is decent enough to be played through a couple times, it explains why the outbreak happens and introduces the main characters. But where the game really shines is in the ""Breakdown"" mode, where you start on level 1 with just one survivor and your goal is to find a van and ""move on"" to the next level. While searching for the van you come across other survivors you can help and have them eventually join your group. Now this is a fun mode in itself, but add a couple of simple to instal mods and Breakdown suddenly turns 100 times more fun and enjoyable.The game does have a few issues, like zombies spawning out of nowhere and getting you potentially killed at higher levels, but you learn to manage it (as you should be using survivors with Ninja-sneak perk anyway). Overall its a really fun game that I'd recommend to any zombie/survivor fan.			"

												.... I bought this to confirm the quality of this release. I got my answer along with regrets....I really hope there was a NEUTRAL RECOMMENDATION for this, because this is one of the best game I've ever played and I would like to recommend it BUT at the same time would NOT recommend it. As the owner of the original for PC, I decided to NOT RECOMMEND it just to balance out the GOOD/BAD reviews here as well to justify that releasing this in its state right now FOR PC is a bad move, shame on you Microsoft. There were already many reviews here that can clearly tell what to expect from this ""thing"", so I'll just summarize this base on this stated fact:I RECOMMEND:It's fun, no doubt about that, especially to new players to this series.I DON'T RECOMMEND:Original version with bugs + minor patch without bugs removal, like putting thin makeup to cover the pimples on your face, is what the returning players should expect from this, IF they return. Also did I mention they have the original bugs in it as well plus they upgraded the bugs, because who doesn't love bugs?To NEW PLAYER:Get it if you like survival zombie genres especially when it's on sale or IF they've fixed the game-breaking bugs.To ORIGINAL OWNER:Get it on your own judgement, they probably gonna sell extra patch DLC or something to at least cover it later, or maybe use the funds to make YEAR-TWO SURVIVAL EDITION instead........ in terms of gameplay, here's my old review for the original NOT-REMASTERED SURVIVAL EDITION of this, since it's hardly any different: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198008168929/recommended/241540/P/S: In all serious note, please give some more love for the PC version this time around. Microsoft should let UL do that when they're done giving love to that X1 thing. For now I'll leave this uninstalled...			"

												Pc version on Win 10 64 bit.I think I have enough hours played in order to make a totally informed opinion.  This game is quaint but if you love it, you really love it and can't put it down.  Year One Survival Edition has game and both expansions, has upgraded graphics and new characters and content.What it is:  a mix of a shooter/hack n slash, base building, leveling of skills and base facilities, driving, making items, finding items, and going on various random missions.The first game is a run through with built in tutorial, and is story driven.  The second is the open sandbox mode and has 99 levels that get harder, faster, and nastier (bosses get more numerous and start getting perks they didn't have before).  The third game is a set mission driven, base denial type game that sees the zombie apocolapse from the military viewpoint.You will need a graphics card capable of DX11 but don't expect UHD graphics.  Gameplay immersion is awesome and you will jump out of your seat if you round a corner and a zombie does a leap attack or the wife grabs your shoulder to get your attention (yes, I jumped out of my skin and she is still laughing).  Any game that gets you that involved is something worth playing.The downside is the engine they had to use sometimes allows zombies to go through closed doors and some other collision effects.  I would have liked to see the company continue working on the game to polish minor points that could be improved but you get used to the glitches and they really don't detract from the game much.Death is permanent for that character but you just transfer to the next playable character.  You have to work at morale so that the others in your house are friends, thus playable.  If you don't like ""death is final"" games and just like to die, get up, continue, rinse and repeat then this game is not for you.  I personally like the fact that you have to play intelligently and wisely so you avoid death situations, get really upset when you lose a hero that you invested time in, but sign a huge relief if you survive the encounter and limp back to base to tag out to another hero.As of this post I am at Breakdown level 58 and ready to move on to 59.  I think you will like the game but watch out for the feral zombies because they are the worst!			"

												Whenever I attempt to describe State of Decay to people who have never played the game, I find myself describing the game I want State of Decay to be--and the game that Undead Labs attempted to craft--more than the game that State of Decay actually is. State of Decay wants to be many games--chief among them the first video game to properly capture the community survival elements of a Dawn of the Dead film in mechanical terms (as opposed to the narrative terms of Telltale's The Walking Dead)--and, at its best moments, it creates a sense of community, tension, and character agency matched by few of its peers. But for each moment of spontaneous, unscripted story wonder that State of Decay generates, it is also one glitch, bug, or broken feature away from drawing you completely out of its experience.THE GOOD- Creates legitimate sense of community among your group of survivors-  Permadeath adds tangible tension to every outing- Building up base & team feels like a less pessimistic George Romero filmTHE BAD- Omnipresent bugs ranging from humorous to game-breaking- Controls lack finesse for more hectic action sequences- Multiple modes of play fail to meaningfully feed back into one another- World lacks distinct sense of placeIn my opinion, I give this a 6 out of 10.

												Theres a lot of griping of how horribly ""broken"" this version of State of Decay is compared to the original. As someone who has been playing SoD since launch day (on the Xbox 360) I can honestly say that this version is perfectly acceptable. Its not a massive upgrade over the original version, but there are some marked improvements. Ive noticed next to no bugs not present in the original, and my only issue with starting it up is I had to go into properties and add ""-fullscreen"" to make it fullscreen.State of Decay has never been perfectly polished, its janky and funky looking and its physics are strange and kinda broken. But it does what it sets out to do in a way few other games can match, and compared to my experiences playing the 360 version on day one, this is a huge upgrade. If you are looking for a open world zombie survival game thats a bit more serious than dead rising, but not nearly as hardcore and unforgiving as DayZ, that has more of a focus on surviving as a group than as a individual, look no further.

												Loving this game so far! Has a pretty neat story, (typical of a zombie survival situation in the country). Great controls (most of the time!). A lot of complex base management and character customization (for skills, rather than appearence). Overall, a really fun game. for 30 bucks, it comes with both dlc which would have been cheaper than the original + the dlc (this costs 30 right now, original+dlc would have cost about 4 dollars more). On top of some nice graphical improvements and bug fixing!Some people are complaining that they can't support a company who re-releases a game a year after it was made just to fix some graphics and bugs. A ""Paid for patch"". But that's not what this is, its their own version of a ""Game of the year edition"". Games and companies have done this for years. A Prime example would be bethesda with fallout and skyrim. they've always re-released their games as special editions with all the dlc included. they didn't even improve the graphics, it was just a straight up re-release. And worst of all, they charged the price of a full 60 dollar game. This is half that with a really decent amount of content. I'd say it at least rivals fallout 3, maybe rivaling skyrim. One thing to note is the game can get a bit grindy at times. I often find myself just going back and forth between my base and town gathering one or two types of resources because they're used so heavily. only to get on a few days later to find all of that resource completely drained. There are things you can make and do in game to ease this and i've just not made it that far but it's still a small gripeThe other issue i have with this game is that it tends to expect alot of foreknowledge of you as far as the way things work. I had no idea you could recruit neighbors if you had enough trust with them and talked to the right people. Nothing in game seemed to tell me this (granted i could have missed it. The tip dialogue seems to be either really short and specific, or very long and vague). I ended up watching a youtube series and saw someone able to do this. Which is somethign at the time i had wish i had known.The main thing is it rarely tells you how things work. It doesn't explain outposts. It doesn't explain recurting members or how you become friends with people (so that you can take control of them). it doesn't explain how much time you have left for missions in any way other than hearing ""some of these things are running out of time here"" over the radio. Which, when you have 20 ""things"" on the map, it makes it hard to descern what exactly they want you to do.One last major dissapointment is the lack of co-op or really any mutiplayer aspects. This game just screams, two friends riding in a car bashing heads in and would benefit GREATLY from something like that. I have however heard the sequal (which was announced last year) will contain multiplayer (as far as i'm aware) so we'll have to wait untill then!Overall, a super fun game, some mechanical issues but nothing that can't be solved with a bit of research on the wiki. I've had to do that for many a game before so seeing it here is not unprecedented. I'd definintely suggest this if you're a fan of the zombie survival management game.			"

												Introduction:State of decay is an open world game, which you are on vacation on a small town where a zombie apocalypse is happening.To survive you need to search for resources such as food, medicine, materials etc.You need these resources to make your base/community survive.Besides that, the game has RPGs elements, where your character gain XP improving and gaining new skillsThe Good: - loot the abandoned houses in search for resources is satisfying. - The game has a story, but is bland. - Base management is fun - Character Permadeath, but you don´t lose the progress you made, you just loose the character The Bad:  - The missions are kind repetitive, you go to some place, kill zombies and search for resources  - Base Management is simples  - Bland story  - Some bugs, for example, sometimes you can´t interact with the game at all; it is necessary the restart the game, doesn´t work well in 4k. ConclusionAlthough simple, the game is fun and gives a very rewarding progress felling.Definitely will buy the second game in the next year. "

I too was new to this game having not previously played the original but thought id give it a go and wish i had not bothered. I really did try to like it but many things just ruin it. Very glitchy game, Does not run very well, Zombies just spawning right infront of you, The AI players that should be helping you just standing in doorways getting in the way doing nothing, To many side missions popping up all the time ( Most of them basically being the same thing ) Luckily i got it on a sale but still feel like it was not worth the low price.

												Survival Zombie-RPG ALMOST done right. This game is what I had hoped Dead Island and Dying Light would be on release. Gameplay: 9/10Survival Aspect of the game went above and beyond my expectations and probably the best one I’ve experienced in this genre:-	Declining Group Resources-	Timed Missions-	Community Building/Morale-	Camp upgrades-	Character perma-deathYou have all of these aspects to manage, all while trying to keep your played characters alive during missions, which incidentally update simultaneously, adding more pressure to your already stressful playing environment.RPG Aspect of the game is what I feel took a hit. Character building is fairly shallow. Aside from the general character stats, there isn’t enough character development in-game. Skills are fairly shallow and doesn’t do much to differentiate playable characters from each other, aside from their weapon specialization.Graphics: 7/10Not the prettiest of games, but that was never a strong point of this genre. Dying Light was probably one of the few exceptions to this, and maybe RE 5/6/7 (although I can hardly classify RE5&6 as Survival Zombie RPG). Regardless, it passes as an ok-game in terms of visuals. Music and Sound: 8/10Music in-game gives me a very Left 4 Dead-esque impression. Aside from Nostalgia, tension in the game is really well matched by its music and ambience. I think it’s really well done. As for voice-acting, it’s fairly bland, you can also easily notice recycled voices. This, however, I can forgive. Western RPG Games, in general, has yet to catch up to Japan’s voice-acting quality in terms of game characters only Bethesda, Bioware, Ubisoft and some select W&B games really stand out. Plot and Story: 6/10I haven’t gone too far in the game yet to make a credible conclusion, however, I’m not impressed so far. However, this in my opinion is also forgivable, being that the game is a Zombie-Surival RPG game. The premises of the game itself limits the variety in story I think.I highly recommend this game to fans of the genre, but if you are a perfectionist I’ll give my warning ahead of time. There are just too many instances that can happen that will “F*** up” your perfect run. If you’re this type of gamer, be ready to restart your gameplays at least a couple of times.			"

												Game is great.I would definitely compare it to Dead Rising 2, in terms of how the mechanics work a little bit. The controls are smooth, and I haven't had any hiccups with the game's performance, stayed at a nice consistent 60FPS on Ultra, even where there was a lot of things going on in the background.There are a lot of zombie survival games out there, but this one is one of the better ones that I've played so far. The ability to switch characters on the fly gives it a little bit of a tactical feel, as you can outfit characters with different weapons and items and the like. It's great fun. Overall 8/10 for me.			"

												I'll leave a link to the review for the original SoD Review I made: http://steamcommunity.com/id/ktg123/recommended/241540But for the Year One Edtion? I can say that I can't fully reccommend this game. This being a follow-up to the original game, it basically upgrades itself in terms of graphics, and gives you the DLC in the full game. But what is wrong with this game is the amount of bugs it has and the same problems I mentioned in the linked review above. Now the game is still good, don't get me wrong, but the bugs just ruin it sadly. I would say buy the original version, but it seems you cannot do so anymore. Don't let this review (or any other review) skew your judgement on this game. Only you can figure it out yourself, unless you like to go by reviews or gameplay videos on Youtube. Either way, it's your judgement call on this game, readers.			"

												Highly recommend this game if you want a good community builder experience mixed with zombies.Base Building: 9/10The base building is very fun to mess around with, and being able to move your home base at any time is amazing. The only reason I'm not rating 10/10 is because I really wish there was more space in each home site for building.Story: 6/10This is not a story rich game. The story is kind of rushed and is very short, but I feel that this isn't meant to be story rich. It's meant for you to spend as much time as possible building up your own community of survivors and gathering resources for them.Gameplay Mechanics: 10/10The mechanics in this game are hard to beat, perma-death mixed with basic survival keeps you alert and ready for any ferals or juggernauts headed your way. the combat is fun and easy to grasp, and I love the auto-aim system for guns.

Posted: March 15
												I have no illusions about how I'd survive in a zombie apocalypse. I'm not the fastest, the most prepared, the most agile, or the most sensible. The uncertainty of such a dangerous, nomadic lifestyle, where vital resources could simply not exist wherever you choose to go; I find it demotivating, a response that would prove deadly. But, in spite of this, I've always had a fascination with zombie survival games (i.e. not the arcadey shmups like Resident Evil 4 or Bulletstorm). There's something about that delicate balance between horror, stealth, action based combat, strategic base building, economic management, and curshingly bleak drama to be found in a deadly, crumbling world, all wrapped up in an emergent, player-driven story. It's a heady 7-ball juggling act that many attempt but few do well. Often the game can only juggle one or two at a time. Often, some balls are just dropped altogether.Make no bones about it, State of Decay is brilliant. I've played my share of zombie survival games, and just about every single one of them has left me slightly unfulfilled, thinking about the potential the genre has to be great. And, when I do, State of Decay is the game I keep asking for.With the exception of perhaps the drama, State of Decay juggles all the balls with aplomb. You are an ordinary person, on holiday with a friend, when zombies strike. After a small tutorial, you're then basically free to explore the massive area, looting resources, building outposts that net you resources, finding people to help (or do missions for), or just to walk around killing zombies. You can approach the zombies as stealthily as you want, either by sneaking up to them and smashing their brains on nearby objects, shoot at them with the firearms of your choice, by just running away, or any combination in between. Zombies will naturally spawn in various locations, and there are no progammed jump scares, so the horror is completely organic.You also are only human, so after enought time and exertion, your character will become fatigued, which lowers maximum fatiue. That's when you have to return to base to rest. You can then talk to another NPC to take them out on a mission, or even convince them to join you on a scavenging hunt. The base can be upgraded using scavenged materials, which affords a variety of benefits. Bases have running costs too, so the scavenged materials must address these needs. Plus, killing zombies affords benefits to your base, as it naturally should; the fewer zombies around, the less damage they'll do to the base and its morale.On top of all this, there is a story, and missions for you to complete. So there is drama, although not all of it emergent. It's a delicate balance between story-driven purpose and sandboxed fun. There's plenty of reward for exploring and doing your own thing, but at the same time, you don't feel like it's all pointless.As the big red thumbs down indicates, after such glowing sentiments, there is a big ugly ""but"" coming. BUT, as much as State of Decay expertly realises some high ambitions, and as much as it is the game I keep asking for, I'm not sure if it's the game I want to play. The problem is that surviving in State of Decay feels a little bit too like the real thing (obviously I don't mean ""the real thing"" literally!).First and foremost, there's State of Decay's most controversial feature: real time passing changes things in game. Remember when I talked about the running costs of bases? They subtract from your base's total every 24 hours IRL. It's also not the only thing that changes IRL. I came back to a game I had stopped playing, and found that several of my people were either dead or missing, which is potentially a big problem. Bases also chew up building materials like nothing else, which is essential for various upgrades.This ties into my second gripe, which is that resources are more or less finite. Once a place is looted, it doesn't magically spawn new resources. With certain upgrades, it's possible to convert certain resources into others (e.g. food into fuel, by a process of making biodiesel), but other resources (such as building materials) cannot be manufactured or converted at all. So, it is possible to arrive at a situation, after many hours of play, where you no longer have access to any building materials. Plus, when a base can't cover its running cost in materials, this causes a very large hit to the morale, which can cause people to run away, so refusing to collect them until you need them is not a good option either.The people are finite too: once you run out, that's it. The game doesn't generate any people procedurally, and once your last person dies, that's game over. It accumulates to a rather off-putting thought: that the time you spent slacking off and exploring, or the hours spent making mistakes and trying to learn the various mechanics could cost you the game down the road. I don't think the game is that unforgiving in the end, but the thought is discouraging nonetheless.That kind of pressure can really work well in a roguelike game (e.g. Invisible Inc -- great game, by the way!), but State of Decay is too long, and doesn't have enough procedural generation to work on that level. While the economy of zombies is very much dynamic, and makes the world feel alive and dangerous, the missions are exactly the same every time you attempt them.So, despite the obvious brilliance of State of Decay, it's a tough title to recommend. I appreciate more as a piece of art than a game, and not because the graphics are especially pretty. It's that hardcore ideal that I hold zombie games up to, conveying both the intoxicating freedom and the unforgiving hopelessness of surviving in a zombie apocalypse. The problem is that it conveys it too well. I'm hoping that anyone who actually reads all of this will not be discouraged from buying and trying this game. Most gamers just want a game they can be entertained by, and on that basis alone, I can't really recommend State of Decay. But if, like me, you can appreciate an innovative, indie take on a tough formula, even if it can be unpleasant to play, I wholeheartedly recommend trying it out.			"

The combat is alright but you will die from ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like zombies glitching through the wall. Not the best zombie game and it isn better then Dead Rising but has some cool features that you wont find in other zombie games. Your best bet is to wait for a sale.			"

												I own the original.  Bought this one even though people said it's not worth it, and that it didn't add much if you have the original.  But I knew what I was buying it for.  I wasn't looking for the new character, or the ""better graphics"", etc.  I was looking for the increased difficulty scaling in levels.In that department it delivered in aces.  The challenge is real.  And that's what made me like this game in the first place... it's just so... much... fun.What people say about bugs is true.  Sometimes the zombies walk through the walls.  But instead of ticking me off, and wanting to ask for a refund... it instead made me go ""OOOOH SH**"" and started fighting.  It did not rob me of my fun... I was having a blast.  Once I did encounter a bug where I had to exit then continue... had to start the mission over.  I encountered it once through all my play.  Whatever... I can live with that... it's just so much fun.It got to a point where I stopped noticing some zombies passing through walls.  Because when your survivor stands up after searching (even silently), zombies right outside will notice you.  Before you know it there's 15 zombies inside the room with you.  Quite frankly you won't care (nor notice) that 3 of them passed through the wall... because a dozen of them just crashed through the window.There's nothing better than seeing the super-awesome powerhouse that is Amelia Crasman bust through the door of a house filled with zombies, eating a snack... and running the OTHER DIRECTION... leaving both the house and her vehicle behind in the background.  Because seriously... that house is a job for a survivor I DON'T like.  The size of hordes in this game is unreal... the days of casually standing there and fighting off an entire horde with just 1 or 2 snacks are over.You know what's worse than fat zombies?  Fat zombies who bring their fat zombie friends for a party at your house.  Yep.  Even worse... at higher levels... when you are grabbed by a fat zombie, it's instant death... there's no wiggling out of it.Bloaters galore?  Out of ammo?  No car?  You mean I have to walk across the field jam packed with ferals with only 3 snacks?  Everybody sick and dying?  I'm actually struggling to survive?  COUNT ME IN!!This new edition enhances this game's crowning jewel... the fun factor.  And for me, that was more than worth the price.			"

												Honest opinion coming here...Love the game, the idea and concept are great.Hate the company.  They abbandoned the original game that glitched and stuttered even on absolute top of the line rigs and charged for what should have been a patch/bug fix and threw in some more ""dlc"" and charged full price.Sure if you didn't already own the game then $30 is a good price tag, but what they did to pre-existing owners was flat out wrong.  Basically the buisness practices of this company have taught me to be extremely cautious and skeptical of future games or products they put out.  I'm sure you have already read many, many, MANY similar reviews...Because of this i honestly can't reccomend this game due to the way they go about their buisness practice.  I truly feel they could have gone another way about it that would have made people fall in love with them and been loyal for lyfe but chose to anger and outrage people that DID support them in the early days and showed absolutely no love for them.If they had given a MAJOR discount to original owners it would have shown them that their trust in the company was just while at the same time showing new customers that this is what you could expect from them if you chose to become a customer of theirs.So after all the drama and opinions my final report on my end is i love the game, it is fun, but can't support the company.I will not buy another product from them i believe.

The only problems I experienced was with when I first launched the game the resolution was giving me problems (there's no 2560 x 1440p res for my 1440p monitor) I just had to settle on 1080p.

TONS of bugs, much more than in original game, zombies glitching through the walls, invisible weapons, other problems like gamebreaking bugs.... This ""upgrade"" is disappointing in many ways, If you never played state of decay, you can try yose edition, when it will be on sale, prepare for ton of bugs, graphical glitches and bad optimization, if you own original base game, don´t buy this, otherwise, I can not recommend this game to anyone at all pros:-awesome gameplay-base building-character progress ( leveling skills )-more playable characters-music-lot of melee and shooting weapons-scavenging ( might get repetive )cons:-gamebreaking bugs-bad optimalization-car physics-mediocre story			"

												This game is the zombie survival game i would have killed for as a child. I always wanted something that scratched that itch, and DayZ didn't do it until later years. I played the telltale walking dead games (Which are amazing and you should totally buy) and that scratched that itch to a degree. Where as the surival in there was scripted, this game lets you recruit survivors and build up bases. Set up outposts and even more. So it really does it for me. Graphics: The graphics are okay, nothing more, nothing less. There are some lighting bugs for me, but i assume that is because i am playing in 4K. Story: Story is great, but you will be focusing on survival and morale. The game comes with the two DLCs' ""Breakdown"" and ""Lifeline"". Breakdown is a ""Free Play"" where you dont have to follow the story, you just get plopped down and you simply survive. You build up your base until you feel comfortable to move onto the next town over, using a old RV which takes time to fix up. Lifeline however, places you in the hands of the military, you start with all this amazing gear. And as the game progresses you lose that gear. So you go from badass, to normal survivor with benifits. It also gives you a full city to explore, that is ripe with resources and dark secrets!Both are great DLCs', and the main game is great too. Looking forward to State of Decay 2 if that comes to PC. You couldnt ask for a better bundle of fun if you tried!			"

												Unfortunately State of Decay Year One Edition has let us down. What was supposed to be, in the developer's own words the ""definitive edition"" of State of Decay manages to be worse than the original. I could tell the original SOD was unoptimized, having to play it on medium settings on a beast PC just to maintain 60+ FPS at all times. (And this is for a game designed from the ground up for the 9 year old X-Box 360) Well YOSE is far worse in that respect. YOSE has a terrible stuttering/frame drop problem that occurs regularly even on the lowest graphic setting. In a game with unforgiving perma-death of characters you have spent hundreds of hours to build and level, it is unacceptable to loose a character just because a long heavy stutter skip made you die in the middle of intense combat. Also the game just feels like it will crash if you bump into your PC lol. What I mean, if you bring up the steam overlay, minimise the game, someone on skype calls you while your in-game, doing almost anything in the background will cause the game to crash. I have found that even if you manage you unminimise the game by some miracle, the performance will be bad until you close and reopen the game. All the old glitches from the original SOD I remember are still here, including the ones that glitch your save file, requiring you to start over.I admit is was pretty cool to see higher resolution versions of all the old art assets as I was able to see and read things on signs and posters that I never could in the past.Overall I find the original version of SOD to be better overall. Performance is way better, has better load times, and I'd rather not have the gimmicks of YOSE that do not add anything to the experience. I'd rather keep my 60FPS gameplay with minimal stutter over higher res textures, non stop stuttering, and having to exit completely out of the game in order to respond to a Steam message. Also the flashlight has no purpose anymore in YOSE as every playable character magically emits light from their body.			"

The YOSE is without a doubt alot better then the original. I've had this game for 6 nearly 7 days and already have 10 hours clocked. This game is absolutey amazing with the adrenadling rush of not wanting your characters to die and gathering enough resources. I give this a 9/10 Defiantly Recommend.

												You can't turn off the f****** inverted mouse acceleration... I like the game, but...It uses inverted mouse acceleration. If you do a fast mouse movement, the game act if you moved it slow. If you do an slow mouse movement the game act if you moved it fast. Good luck trying to aim or doing a fast 180 turn.For me it is a tedious experience, so if you have played lots of 3er person shooters or alike, i would not recommend playing this game. If you are a casual player, probably you won't get frustated by how the game manages mouse movement, then i would recommend it to you.			"

I don't have much positive things to say about this game besides it being just as fun as the original. Those who don't have the original will most likely buy this game but those who have the original don't bother at all but remember they cut support for the original.

												It was a typical night in town. Day 11 so far. Morale is starting to lower and one of our members  is beginning to let fear get the better of him. This needed to be fixed before a crisis would occur. This would be Jacob’s second new mission and so far so good with him. As Jacob, I took our fellow survivor out to kill some Zeds to loosen him up and it was going well so far. Until a random Feral came out and ripped Jacob in half before I had a chance to munch on my energy bar. It was terrible, just terrible…and also pretty cool. At its best, this is what State of Decay is all about. It’s random, enticing, devastating, and exciting all in one package. But there a few major problems that keep this from being a satisfying experience.GameplayState of Decay is a Survival Action-Horror game with RPG elements. Set up in a small town, you are thrust into a zombie infested world which acts as a hostile playground for players to explore. Your ultimate goal is to create a surviving community until military evac arrives. Gameplay involves fighting via third person hand-to-hand combat and shooting. As you progress, the community you help build will begin to expand and gain the ability to create infirmaries, libraries, etc. And the survivors that you play will begin to develop their own skills such as shooting, fighting, and wits while out doing missions or searching for supplies. The catch is that there is only a single save file with permadeath enabled. If a survivor is killed, morale drops and you’re switched to the next survivor. Progressing through the game requires story missions, side quests such as interacting and helping strangers and fellow friends alike while trying to survive another day.There is so much to do and explore in this game. Exploring your environment constantly brings a sense of danger around every corner and comes with its own risk/reward system. Finding supplies is uplifting and all, but making sure you have a plan for getting back is necessary as Murphy’s Law can and will happen.Managing your community means making sure that everyone is well fed, mentally and physically healthy, etc. As you progress through the game your community can continue to expand to different areas as a means of safe zones to prevent zombie hordes and other problems from arising. Honestly, I found this aspect of the game to rather shallow for specific reasons. For one, you can’t manage what other NPC’s should be doing; nor could you send your companions out to various locations for errand runs. Instead, you drive all the way over to the location and then decide to bring a runner, should you not have enough space in your inventory to take a load back home. This resulted in lots of precious time being wasted and monotonous at times. Not only that, at random times I would be making a long drive to a mission only for one of my runners to be trapped by a bunch of zombies, resulting in me having to drive all the hell back just to save them. This happened so many times that I had lost count.Combat is surprisingly satisfying. Approaching combat requires to weigh the odds for each method. Do you go all in with melee to avoid attracting other zombies or do you take them out from afar with your gun while potentially compromising your location? Monitoring your health is not the only important bar to pay attention as each character has their own specific amount of stamina that you need to pay attention to. Running out of stamina spells out your doom and requires a strategic mind to maintain while fighting. With the various amount of fighting abilities and specialties for each character, experiencing combat with each character was consistently fresh and exciting.Driving in the game is on the neutral side of things. Cars get you around but some have terrible and unrealistic handling.What brings the gameplay down are the extraordinary amount of bugs that you will encounter in the game. I can’t count how many times a zombie would spawn right next to me, ruining my attempted stealth run. Sometimes, zombies would simply spawn out in mid-air while you are driving and there was a time where I was forced to reset my game because I encountered a bug that would not allow me to talk or interact with options. For a game to have been around so long, it is quite disappointing to see such problems take you out of the experience. Don’t get me wrong, this is a very fun game to play, but the problems are as obvious as white on red.NarrativeThere is barely any story to really mention in this game. What I mentioned in the intro paragraph is what the story is basically about. There are story missions which are all unremarkable and side missions which help flesh out some of the characters in this world. It would have been nice to see more consequences for the death of a fellow survivor rather than a simple notification or some obviously sad music for five or so seconds. Consequently, this aspect severely affected my enjoyment of the game as barely any conversations are meaningful and are combined with shallow responses from your player character during side missions.Speaking of side missions, they’re mostly fetch quests with some go rescue this shoved inside. These missions have a timer on them unlike the main quests and not fulfilling them can result in a death sentence or loss of potential relationship building. Having to decide on which side quest to pursue is great and all but it is consistently bogged down by repetition and lack of surprise.GraphicsWhat stands out are the various environments you will visit throughout the game. Despite having ugly and blurry textures reminiscent of an early Xbox 360 game. The environment is pleasant to look at, but what isn’t pleasant are the god-awful character meshes and textures. Combine that with static animations and robotic conversations, the graphics department is a bit of a mixed bag. Though the combat animations are quite satisfying to view.SoundThis game wins in the sound department. Whether it’s hearing the satisfying crunch of a zombie’s skull being smashed or when firing your weapon, this game works well with what it has. Voice acting is at times decent and other’s just terrible. But the music itself was perfect all aroundEnding ExecutionThis is what almost killed the game for me. After a very tense fight with multiple hordes of zombies, you get a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥cutscene with a few bits of dialogue and then the game ends, achievement unlocked. This was lazy, pointless, and pretty much failed to impact in any way possible. It was so anti-climatic that I kind of felt I wasted my time with the game. This method of ending a video game is shoddy, lazy, and shameful.OriginalityToday, there is an insurmountable amount of survival based zombie games now. But few have it done it as well as State of Decay. None of the gameplay really stands out, but the experience of success, loss, and just epic failure will stick around in your gaming memories forever. But its terrible graphics, bugs, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending keeps me from recommending it to anyone.6.7/10			"

												I played the first State Of Decay (as in not YOSE) on my brothers account back when we shared an account and I bought this when I got my own account before we both knew what gameshare was. Now that the backstory part is over...Im giving this a positive review mainly because I can and I did enjoy both the original and YOSE version of the game. What really pushes my buttons is that this is 30$ and the original was 20$ (I could be wrong, most likely wrong). HOWEVER this game has only 2 loading screens, 1) for entering the game apon start up 2) when returning from home with certain characters.This game can really keep you on your toes hell maybe even make you want to levitat off the ground at those really REALLY intense moments where your favorite survivor is in a very bad place. Each ""spiecal"" zed/zombie (however you want to look at it) can make you change your strategy in an instant. For example: Bloaters, for some odd reason you packed a shotgun with you and you see a bloater coming at you. You also see a feral zombie off in the distance and now you wished you didnt pack a shotgun (or revolver, or gun without a suppressor) and you want to get away. You sprint away and then the feral spots you and then pounces on you. You manage to kick it off ya but the zombies around the area are overpowering you, next thing you know, your character is then RIPPED IN HALF by the feral making you want to break the monitor since that was your main guy. By the way, once a character is dead, HE (OR SHE) DEAD FOR GOOD. I mean its one of those games.Dont rely too much on one character (Hence the sick, tired, and wounded system) or else you might want to uninstall the game.The Bloater-Feral was based after a true story by yours truly.I still think the game is fun, even with 79 hours of playtime by the time I wrote this review. Plus I have not been focusing on the storyline since I always screw it up so I stick with Lifeline and Breakdown more often.			"

												Do you like zombie games? Do you like survival games? Do you like sandbox games? Well, State Of Decay is a MUST for you.This game didn't have that much of a spotlight back in 2013 but surely it should be considered a masterpiece.For the first time you have control over an entire community of people and not just over one or two main characters.Each person you control has unique skills and perks that give him/her a particular role in your community.You have to pay attention to your resources (food, materials, ammos, etc) and at the same time you have to make sure that your people don't get sick of tired a lot during your scavenging missions, paying attention to their morale and helping them when necessary.Is interesting how you can switch between the characters to allow others to rest or to do missions while you are away doing something else, as well as keeping zombies away from your HQ that you can upgrade or switch when required.All the choices you make in this game are permanent so if you let a character die it stays dead living a mark on the entire community, raising fear and dropping the morale of the entire community.The ""game over"" feature is non existent in this game. When a character dies, you switch automatically to another going on to your struggling quest of survival. Plus there aren't really ""main"" protagonists even if you start with the same 3 people, at the very beginning.If you are the kind of player who likes to play a ""different"" zombie game, compared to the classics, then I suggest you to try this game out. Even if it's 4/5 years old, this game still kicks the♥♥♥♥♥of many other titles and offers you a total different approach to the concept of ""survival"" we are used to, thanks to games like Resident Evil, Silent Hill or Alone In The Dark.The graphics are totally ok for a game like this, however you can make use of mods if you want to give this game a new outfit. So if you are someone who likes to play a game only if the graphic is decent (sadly for you), I can say that you can still go on with this. It's really really worthy.			"

												Promises much but delievers little.What could have been a good game is mired in shallow gameplay and content. The game forces you to rush from one mission to the next with little to no time for exploration or developing your team or base beyond the basics all to hide the lack of depth of gameplay. If you like your games short and sweet then State of Decay would probably give you a sugar rush.But if you are after greater depth and content you are best off looking elsewhere. There is certainly enough Zombie survivial games out there to choose from.			"

												I like survival games, and I love zombie games.  And this is definately a Survival zombie game.But my love for these kind of games can't best the hate I have for games that let enemies spawn 3' behind you where they immedately grapple and knock you down.  It doesnt happen often, but the respawning zombies is completly out of control here.  You can clear a small room, turn around and see enemies respawn.   See a group of 15 zombies?  toss a molly at them, burn them down and watch a new horde of zombies spawn in their ashes.  In an empty field? Better watch your back, a special zombie will likely pop and jump you.Worst of all the game 'runs' when you have it closed.   If you want to heal health/stamina you are forced to log off.  Dont play for a day?   Your resources still drain (and drain they will, at best you will always still suffer massive resource loss every 'day'). Then there are the little things.. Find 4 medical bags you want to bring home?  You can only hold one, and cant store them in cars (trucks work, if you risk glitching).  Expect to ocasionaly get grappled though walls, have cars you are driving randomly suffer damage or flip over, and worst of all is having critical quest npcs run off infinately in some dirrection so that you have to reload and hope the game didnt auto save and corrupt your entire game.  Plus sides. I love the concept, and the voice actors are nice.  and it has enough guns and melee weapons that you have several choices for each character.   Unfortunately that cant make up for its down sides.			"

												Got this on Xbox 360 when it first came out, so technically I probably have over 50-60 hours playing it combined. It was the only reason I kept coming back to playing my xbox at the end of the life cycle. Amazing, you build a community of survivors and you have to scavange the map for resources and such. Original SOD is awesome and story driven. All DLCs are included in this version of the game: Breakdown DLC, is pretty much sandbox game in which you can play at building your community up until you run out of ressources to scavange in the map, then you can move on and start over carrying a few survivors over with you and doing so increases the difficulty. Also you survivors (in all game modes) can perma-death, which adds to the tension. Lifeline DLC is another story mode in a new map that let's you play as the military; that means, more guns GUNS GUNS, haha. Overall the complete package is a must buy, get it on sale if you've already played it in it's original form, don't hesitate if it's your first time (unless you want to, I'm not your dad). It's a game I will always go back to... until State of Decay 2 comes out at least.EDIT: This game when it first came out was 2nd only to Minecraft on XBLA sales.			"

												This review came about as a product of my own fear whilst buying this game. The negative reviews had made me a little on edge. I can now, safely say that this product deserves a positive review. The game is fun, replayable, and unique as it focuses more on survivor progression and communities of survivors than blowing zombie brains out (Although there is a fair bit of that too)  And in this way it creates a sort of tension as you fear for you survivors and their lives as you develop a connection to them. Overall this is a unique experience that I would reccomend to everyone who enjoys zombie survival games.Now, to address the negative reviews; Although I can understand why people who bought the original game would be annoyed, I also would like to remind everyone that when you write a review it is for the game, not the developers business practices. At the top of your review it says ""Write a review for State of Decay YOSE"" NOT ""Write a review for Undead Labs""I reccomend all new players ignore these reviews as they are not aimed at you, but the devs.			"

												This was a great game until undead labs decided to update it with only 1 gaming group in mind. Those who want a hardcore experience. So for the rest of us who just like a great all round gaming experience, which is what this used to be. Tough! there's no option to change the level of difficulty, so unless you like everything set to very difficult, forget this game and keep looking! I'm very upset about the update because I invested twice in the game after year one came out and now I find it so unplayable that I uninstalled it from my machine.			"

												I say it's a good game you just have to overlook the bugs and various other simple things if you know how to do it right. (AKA mods help)I bought this game for my brother for a birthday gift a few years back. He didn't like it why? It wasn't first person or something. I instead started playing it. Sure there's a lot of things that bug me about it. Number one  being the fact  that the game in itself for some glitch or another seems to run best on the highest settings which I have no idea why but if it's below maximum specs for me it lags beyond all reason.But yes there are clipping issues, Zombies phasing through walls, People being kinda dumb and taking the grenade launcher to stand on guard and destroy all your cars when they try to kill one zombie in the parking lot of your base, Some repetitive gameplay and missions that are so common that they are annoying at most times, Lilly nagging your ear off by telling you to check out them survivors she mentioned when you did that just five minutes ago, some broken guns that might have been added in from a mod or not I have no idea. Yeah there's a lot of bad but the game has a lot of good at same time.This is the only Zombie open world game I've ever seen that isn't and mmo or pay to win pvp, sure the missions are repetitive but in that kind of situation you kind HAVE to do the same thing over and over again to maintain a base, sure there is bugs but hey it keeps you on your toes.But honestly if you ask me it wasn't all bad and it's enjoyable if you look past all the bugs and mod the thing to improve some gameplay issues but this is honestly one of those games where if you love it, you love it and if you hate it, you hate it. My advice try the game. Who knows it may be worth your time and you might have fun. ^^			"

												State of Decay: YOSE Day One EditionThis game is incompleteSince back then in 2013 I really wanted to have this game. At the last sale I finally got myself to buying it. From what I had read during this long period of time, I had very high expectations. State of Decay managed to excel them.I have played for 11 hours until now and I have thoroughly enjoyed them. I wouldn't say this is the definitive zombie game but yet it is the best one I have ever played (it was my first zombie game ever xD).The core gameplay is real fun. You stroll around a pretty big map and try to survive somehow: you collect food/materials, you upgrade your home base, you make sure your crew stays motivated. Later on you even fight against various diseases who kill you almost instantly. Overall, it's very satisfying. Although it feels a lot like babysitting the dumb AI at the beginning, you learn to appreciate that the game always keeps you busy.Nevertheless, there are a few negative aspects which affect your experience badly.1. Glitches. Be it zombies under floors/zombies in walls or backpacks also under the floor.2, Lack of personalisation. You basically stay forever with the basic appearance survivors have by default.3. The ridiculous real-time-feature. I mean srsly, bros at Undead Labs?? All types of materials you can collect in this game decrease daily. Which means you would have to play more or less everyday in order to provide yourself and your crew a functioning home base. This isn't motivational, it is f*****g annoying and also f*****g ridiculous! I can't play everyday and so I decided to leave Story Mode alone and try the endless ""Lifeline""-mode. I'll probably come back to the story someday, but I just don't understand the reason they built in this feature.Summarized, I hope there will be a sequel at some time, but please people, please don't let it have this ridiculous feature I mentioned above. I'm looking forward to playing DayZ.7/10Good Game, but incomplete and with some strange design decisions			"

												Disclaimer: Nominated this game for THE “I THOUGHT THIS GAME WAS COOL BEFORE IT WON AN AWARD” AWARDI really enjoy this game, especially the modability of it due to it being CryEngine. I've been modding the game since the original version; love the new characters in this one but I wouldn't recommend buying it over the original IF you already own the original. The improvements are great though some of the original's bugs still remain. It is highly playable and a great game to pickup to get the backstory into State of Decay 2, coming 2017.			"

												Short version:Standard Edition Owned = 5/10 - Skip it (unless making ammo in Breakdown is essential for you)No Version Owned = 8/10 - A really great zombie game with some slight RPG elements and a solid survival feel.Long Version:Having put a metric ton of hours into both this version and the old version, I can with confidence say there are some significant differences between the two.  Firstly, the actual entire reason I bought the YOSE version after having bought and played the standard version is that you can have the Munition shops now make ammunition in both the base game as well as breakdown.  This alone makes a significant difference in the gameplay experience, if you are one of those who enjoying going through all the levels of Breakdown.  It makes skilling your survivors out in guns skills actually worth it, which is something I wanted desparately from the start.  However, this REALLY should have been a free update rather than a whole new buy.  This fact alone makes this a hard pill to swallow and has made me question if I would buy anything from this company again.Graphics are much improved, however stuttering is still a big problem, mainly when driving around at high speeds.  This is particularly noticable in Lifeline as there is a lot of smoke and fire effects with most of the map being highway full of burning wrecks.  You need to have a beefy system, quite a bit more than even the minimum specs as it doesn't appear to be well optimized for PC (surprise surprise).  Even with an 8 core with 24 gigs of RAM and various Gforce 900 series cards, I still get significant framerate drops while driving around.  However, it is still impressive given there are no loading screens for the quite large open map.  Still, it looks nicer that the standard edition, but runs worse.As I said, you can now craft ammunition in breakdown and the base game, which is a game changer (for me anyway).  You can make snacks and coffee in the kitchen now as well.  A few more vehicles have been added like the Army truck from Lifeline is now available in Breakdown, as well as the ability to repair your vehicles in Lifeline, which is nice, not having to just ditch the Army trucks when they start smoking anymore.For me, most of the bugs from the old version have been cleared up, but some new different bugs have been introduced which can be just as annoying.  No more driving at full speed and then for no reason the physics engine decides it wants you to visit the moon, and launches you  500 feet into the air.  Your survivor then automatically bails out of the car mid flight, and you get to watch as one of your best survivors plummets to their death with nothing you can do but watch in utter horror.  Now however, doors/gates seem to offer very little benefit  with stopping zombies, since about 50-75% of the time, they just walk right through them, which can make things particularly frustrating (and deadly) in Lifeline sieges.So all in all you get a cleaner interface, some animation changes (blades skill animation has been tweeked slightly), better graphics, a few (very nice) guns, some olds bugs replaced by new bugs, the ability to craft ammo, snacks, and coffee, and some new survivors (Lifeline characters have been added to Breakdown).  If you own the standard game, and none of the things mentioned interest you, then I'd say give this one a pass.  If you don't own the standard copy and like zombie games, then I would absolutely recommend you get this version.			"

												If you want to buy this game then go ahead. Pro: Gives a true apocalypse atmosphere and puts you in situations where you are on the edge of death. Con: Bug mania. Your gate is closed? nah no such thing exists, they just walk though like nothing was there. And p.s expect to have the responsability of saving a entire city by yourself because no one else will be there to do any of the tasks and if you dont do it then you're the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Aaand if you enjoy games where you have to wait for things to get done with real time then this is the game for you because your character will start loosing his total stamina and hp after a while and you can't gain it back unless you switch to another character which you only have the option of maybe choosing 3 from 10 or quit the game and let them re gain their total hp and stamina. would rate 4/10. Would rate higher if even quarter of the bugs where fixed.			"

If you are new to this game however and you are looking for a zombie survival game in the style of GTA this is just perfect! I can overlook some of the bugs like zombies poofing through a closed door and had so much fun. I even got my first heartattack today where a 'Feral' jumped on me. I did not hear it comming haha.Play the story line to get used to the game or play in breakdown where you can get into a RV with Lilly and 4 survivors you rescued and progress to the next level where things will slightly get harder for you. Then there is the last playable mode called Lifeline wich I have not yet played a lot myself but looks fun so far aswell where you are the military and defend your base on the edge of a over run city while you escort survivors. Overal I am enjoying this game very much as I was looking for a GTA styled game with zombies (Saints Row just didnt do it for me haha).			"

And there a lot of new things such as new mission in Breakdown, new weapons, new vehicles, UI improved, new combat moves.Graphics are a bit better, it uses the same engine CryEngine 3 but with improved animations, texture bumps, a better draw distance and a 1080p resolution.

												I just got this game yesterday and it is already so fun. It has lots of elements on how a real zombie apocalypse would play out. If someone dies they are dead for good and the game saves all the time so you cant reset to where they are alive (I learned that the hard way).I do have some complaints, mainly that the controls are a bit clunky and the graphics could be better but overall a great game.I also love how the ultimate weapon in this game are cars. If you have a car you can last for forever and when you get out the zombies know that they have an opening and take full control over it. The car's horn helped me clear out many of the infestations and save many survivors. A little tip to anyone looking to buy this game... NEVER GO OFF ROAD WITH A CAR YOU WILL CRASH AND DIE! ALSO NEVER DO A MISSION WITHOUT A CAR BECAUSE THEY ARE EVERYWHERE! A car can take out basically every zombie I have come across so far. If they weren't so overpowered I would be more in fear of the hordes of zombies around every corner.It is still possible to die a lot even with a car and I love how nothing lasts forever in this game including survivors and have lost 2 of the 8 starting survivors already. It happened when I went off road while trying to rescue Jacob. I never got to know the character that died yet still felt sad and regretted my choice. Everything is life or death in this game and that makes it all the more fun.I would say this game is part The Walking Dead and part Dead Rising. The Walking Dead because you get to love the characters and truly feel bad when they die, and part Dead Rising because it is all out good times and chaos whenever you play.I also love how many things you have to take into account when managing your survivors and base. If you focus on one thing and not the other you will die a painful death. You truly need to manage every little thing about your character to survive. The clunky controls make it a little bit harder to get out of sticky situations but I still love the game none the less.If you aren't at least interested after all this who are you and what have you done to your personality. There is truly something everyone can love in this game. I haven't had the game crash on me yet like others have said and it runs well on my computer. I love this game and think you will to no matter what your preferences are.			"

												Zombies are overrated, but this game lure me in becuase this game has no protaganist everyone is the protaganist. If one of the characters dies is not game over it continues with a replacement when you get a replacement there is a scene that she or he gives thier condolences of the last character you play with pretty cool. Is all about how many days can you survive and the best part how many characters can you send them to safety. This game is fun and challenging.			"

												I liked this game enough to buy it twice! Played the original when it came out, then grabbed YOSE on sale for $15. No regrets, looks great, and the updated game feels like more than just cosmetic fluff. THe changes are subtle, but noticable... Driving feels smoother, zombie behavior seems more realistic, more variety with quests, weapons, vehicles etc. For anyone who owns the original, it's up to you if you want to spend more money on the same game but if you haven't played this yet, grab this while it's on sale! One of the best zombie survival games out there, it's the closest thing I've seen to The Walking Dead in video game form.			"

												So this game is a few years old at this point, and far from perfect (some glitches and framerate issues persist) but it's still a great game.  I like zombie survival games, and own several of them at this point, and State of Decay and 7 Days to Die are the two that really stand out.  State of Decay is more like Grand Theft Auto: Zombie Survival Edition, and it's a ton of fun.  Seeing as they just announced the sequel at E3 2016, I'm super excited to see what the developer comes up with to improve the existing formula.			"

												I bought this game becaue I enjoyed the origonal, although couldn't play it well as it would have incorrect graphical display, so lo and behold when I was shown this, I bought it immediately, and I got my wish, I guess.Its State of Decay, except, it has more bugs than the origonal, and thats saying something, I've launched the game twice now, and every time the exact same issue occurs, now in the origonal I could handle this bug, walking into strongholds for the first time would freeze the game for a few seconds, but no, now it just crashes, every time.So yeah, I love these games, but like a disease ridden dog, it would take a lot of work to fix, or we should just put it out its misery.

												The, rereleased game, still has the glitches and annoyances of the first. In addition, IT RUNS WORSE. It might be a good buy for new players but is worth nothing to owners of the original, and still, frankly, feels like it is in early access. Main complaints:-Glitches Galore-Lack of feeling of completion-Repetative-Little NCP customization that is not redundant or requires mods-Base buidling works, but feels rudementary-Durability aspect is nice, but having to replace your weapon every 10 zombies is notAdmissions:-Have spent many hours in this game, despite its flaws-Lifeline is awesome-When not worrying about ammo, is greatly fun			"

												ok i have only played 7 hours to date and here is my thoughts.UPDATE: i am not going to waffle on this going back and forth. today i had a real issue getting the game to even work. the start up screen was windowed and would not respond in anyway with the mouse. after getting it to run the ai went bat♥♥♥♥♥♥crazy and i had no protection even inside my base. i was killed after a battle that should have drawn some attention. there was no guard in the tower and even when i was inside the gate the ppl were running right by me and not helping. i have had fun playing this and will have more fun playing it but just be aware there are issues. these issues should not be in a completed game. would think they would spend a little time to fix these problems but i know this is not going to happen. this will be the last game i buy from this company. if this company will release this with the problems it has they will release more games with other issues this i am sure of. the rest of my review stands. this is not a game breaker but it sure does not bode well for gameplay in general.i have played many zombie games and this one stands out as being one of the best. as with many of these games the mechanics seem to be the same. the same melee same third person view same same same.though it stands out to be among the best it is not without its flaws. i have read many reciews mostly the negative ones to see if i agreed. on some issues i do and some i do not and here is why.the ones i do not agree with are those that already owned the game that are crying that it is no improvement. well in all honesty most times it is not an improvement but a reskin of the same game as this is. though i do not own the original i can already tell that is what it is from reading so many reviews. it seems like a high percentage of those negative reviews are by those people that owned the original or those that played it on xbox and wanted the same experience on pc. fact is that will never happen as the two are so diffrent from hardware and player machanics i.e. keyboard verses controler. and if you look at those reviews alone your looking at a high percentage of 80 to 90 percent.to console users i say gfy many developers wouldnt even be creating games if not for pc and now pc is suffering due to all the cry baby antics of console users. most developers haven given in way to far to console players in general and that pisses me off as well look at bo3 for example. if not for pc users call of duty wouldnt even exist but now pc users are of no consern to the development of cod. ok on with the reviewcons.it does have flaws not magor but nerve racking in general1 the ai is wonky as hell i have experience the tower guard not being on duty and almost being mauled to death outside the gates.2 the zombies do respawn at an alarming rate. you will clear an area and run back to it after dumping off supplies just to find that there are 2 or 3x the amount  respawned. that in itself is garbage and shouldnt be.3 zombies will be in walls in fences in trees... umm ok4 after updating a base i run out for more supplies just to get a warning someone is sad and giving up? really i upgraded the base to make things better just for some ai to get sad and leave?5 it starts in window mode even after ive set it to be full screen? i have to go back and reset it everytime i play.6 lack of settings. again this is a port from a console so not much thought was put into the settings for pc.you have sliders that hardly work for everything. using a mouse on these is very hard and it seems where the pointer is  isnt accurate at all you have to fiddle with the mouse to get it just right to even attempt to use the settings.7 no save feature though it does this automaticly i am sure if you leave without it saving your going to lose things. that is why you leave after it says saving. lolthough these are bad and really bad  they are not deal or game breakers. the ai of the base though can be argued.the graphics are not that bad and i do not get where people are saying they are. only thought that comes to mind is they are on a very old pc with out dated video cards or something. the graphics are not fantastic like a new gen game but they are not horrible either and on par with say dead island or better then that i should say but not by much.again i have only played 7 hours to date but i have enjoyed it very much. the keyboard control is a bit weird but easy to get used to. the only part i am having issues with is sneaking and hitting z while moving. sneak is c and to kill a zombie while sneaking it requires z. all the while moving with the standard keys w a s and d not easily done.fighting is almost exactly like dead island but has other parts that dead island does not. that is what makes this game stand out. the looting and finding things though i agree with finding to much of certain items like twinkies for food.with not having owned the original to compare this to and having to judge this on its own merit i have to give it a thumbs up. it is not a horrible experience regardless of the many bad reviews it has been given. it is fun and i suposse it could become boring but if you play a certain game hours and hours sure its going to repeat and get some what boring. thats when you exit and go do something else and dont expect the game to get better when youre tired of doing it.i would buy this on sale it is not worth the 30 dollar it is being sold at. it is fun it isnt fantastic isnt worth 30 but on sale id buy it again.

												Too many repetitve things to do makes this game felt too rushed and unpolished. The whole building community thing is friggin sweet and I will recommend it based on that alone. Will give 100 out of 100 if you can clear an area and make it permanently safe (kinda like cleaning up the whole place scenario like Infamous)(+) Build your base(+) Take care of your people(+) Salvage for supplies(+) Expand(+) Your character(s) can die permanently(?) Combat is ""meh""(?) Story is barely there(-) Control is laughable(-) Zombies can pass through door and sometimes can just stand there doing nothing(-) AI kinda felt Beta-ish			"

												Honestly, this game is pretty bad whether or not you played the first one. This probably won't happen to you, but when I first started up the game, the sensitivity of the view was so high that everything was just a giant random flash of orange and brown light and some guy named Ed talking to me about cannibalism or something. The controls are so weird that i spent the first 10 minutes IN THE SETTINGS. Now, I'm not going to lie; the idea of managing your resources and the different characters is a fun idea. That part of the game is actually really good. Unfortunately, that's one of the only good parts of this game. The rest of it is just utter trash. Lots of the supplies' locations don't even make sense, the fighting is unrealistic, as well as the dialogue. Another problem that I have with this game is that everything is just TOO EASY. The game kills off some of the characters that you encounter before you can even get attatched to any of them and the game then proceeds to give them a dramatic sendoff. This game simply doesn't realistically depict what the zombie appocalypse would be like, the characters are too predictable, and the story part is just plain stupid. It's the same game as its original, but worse and slower. The good things don't outweigh the bad, the stupid, and the annoying things in the game.			"

												Fun game at first, but gets boring and repetitive after a short while. Seems like they had an idea for a game and then took a lot of input from the usual never satisfied gamers, you know the 'wouldn't it be cool if it was co-op?' or ' let us build bases but not have to manage them' or ' I want to play as a (fill in the blank) type person'. Bottom line it is a third person sandbox zombie survival game. No stratagy needed, no tactics and very lacking in the rpg department. Worth $30? No. Worth $10 sure.Pros:Open worldVehiclesDifferent styles of guns and melee weapons.Cons:Vehicles are to weak. A ♥♥♥♥♥ slimy rotton zombie is not going to total a 1/2 ton military pickup with a reinforced gated bumper. And really all I can put in it is 4 duffle bags of stuff, wish I could have told my Sgt. that in the army...lol. Oh and stop sighns and other little stuff causes severe damage to your vehicle too, and some of the zombies laugh at you cause when you come back, they put all the stuff you tore up your other car on back up.Combat is very clunky, have a zombie right in front of me, but my toon goes 5 steps away to hit a different one so that one can now get from behind. Partners are a hindrence, best to just leave them behind. They will hold one while your hitting three and get mad when you don't hit the one they are holding.Video and graphics are typical low budget stuff. A lot of pop ins 20ft away, makes it kinda hard to drive at max speed then suddenly a broken down car pops in or a horde right in front you. Then again, the pop in happens when you're walking and running.....SMH.Menus are a very bad port job. Sometimes they glitch so bad that keyboard shortcuts are the only way to make them work, mouse is yuky to say the least. No tooltips or very vague, scroll doesn't work well at all.Tutorial is basicly ' you are a survivor and zombies are everywhere, go make some friends and kill zombies.....end tutorial'Bottom line, good concept but poorly executed game. DLCs are just more of the same with achievement unlockers (see listening to whining gamer input) and a quick cheap storyline for the military. Game is steril and incomplete, would hate to have seen it before the graphics update. Best thing they could do is open up the sdk and let people mod it into a good game.			"

												I first played this game on my Xbox 360 years ago. I beat the main story, got maybe halfway through Lifeline and played a ton of Breakout. When I saw this game on Steam with all of the DLC included into one price and on sale, I just had to buy it.  I love this game. I feel like it's proabably nostilgia based since I have so many good memories from this game from my Xbox days but I do feel like it is a worth while game. The main story does have a lame ending but the DLC is great. I think the game looks fine, nothing too special but nothing too bad either. I haven't run into some of these supposedly ""game breaking"" glitches that people have complained about but there are a few bugs here and there. I lov ethe gameplay. The visuals are fine as I said but don't expect this Year One Edition to enhance anything. It's really just there to throw all the DLC in one place. I think if you are into realistic zombie survival and don't mind a lack of multiplayer you will like this game a lot. I know I sure do.			"

												I really wanted to like this game.  An open world zombie game should be right up my alley, but I had to force myself to not give up on this.  It's hard to put my finger on why I didn't like it, I just wasn't having much fun.  The combat left a lot to be desired, in fact, I spent 90% of the time ramming zombies in a car, which got quite old after a while, but it's the safest, most effective way to deal with them.  But even the standard combat felt ""meh.""  Also, the missions left me feeling like an errand boy.  Go to this location, retrieve the resource, bring it back.  Over and over again.  So, after forcing myself to play for 5 hours, I finally gave up.			"

												English:I haven't seen the Steam Page for this game since it's release, and holy ******************************** , what's wrong with you guys??"" If you Relog, everyone is Dead "" Seariously? Never had this issue, one or two dead, ok, but everytime they were atleast "" Missing in action "" or part of an rescue mission. NEVER EVER was my base wiped out. Not in base game, not In YOSE Edition//DLC's"" I can't even PLay it, it needs DX11 "" Well, this is bad. But not really the fault of the Game, is it?"" Not worth the money cause.... Its just bad "" Most of this reviews got  a playtime under 5, most under 2 Hours. The Game is heavily grindy at the start.Kind of... Especially the Storymission slows you down if you are ahead/ want a new Base and have to go throught the neccessary Missions. That sucks, ok. But it doesn't make the game bad.Story Mode : You and your Buddy were camping as hell breaks loose. Youll fight your way down to an old church were Survivors hiding, and the fun starts. Almost every charactoer is kind of unique, and storymissions can have alternative Dialoges, perhaps outcomes with different characters. Hell Even sidecharacters from other survivor hideouts have Sideplots, if your lucky to stumble over them. Gunplay is way better then in the original, you can Unpack ammo crates for Ammunition, and the new CLEO missions are Pretty good. Atleast the loot can be awesome, unique weapons and stuff. Breakdown:Story mission without story. You fight your wayy throught hordes of Zeds, which get stronger with every run you make. As you go higher in the stakes, you can unlock more characters throught Challenges, there are fewer cars and more "" Hero""-Zeds. The Unique, Bad-**** I kill you in one swipe ones xD. Screamers, and sorts. Can't remember the names, sorry^^Lifelinebasically another story-DLC. Shorter, but nice enought to play throught. Overall, with its crafting, basebuilding and managing this game is awesome. i bought it for...20? or 15 bucks, cause i had the previous SOD when it launches, but haven't had the dlc's. So it was a hell of a deal. Is it worth the 30 bucks ? Kind of i guess, but when its on sale for 20 or so, get it asap. you won't regret it.German:Irgenwie hab ich kb mehr alles neu zu tippen ^^.Ich versteh die reviews nicht, lest oben, das spiel an sich ist der hammer. Hatte es damals als es rauskam für 15 oder 20 euro bekommen da ich die alte version auch habe. Ansich hat mich das spiel noch nie enttäuscht, das Gameplay ist gut, steuerung vll bissle hakelig, aber durchweg ein Geiles Spiel mit den verschiedenen Basepositionen, Räumen die man bauen und aufwerten kann und das Managen der Überlebenden macht das spiel eigentlich extrem laune.Und Breakdown, quasi der survivalmodus ist auch richtig hart. Man hat eben auch nur begrenzte ressourcen. Irgendwann ist alles aufgebraucht, man muss also immer wieder fortschreiten im schwierigkeitsgrad,wenn es im sale ist, definitive Kaufempfehlung. Wenn nicht muss man eben für sich entscheiden ob man das geld ausgeben möchte oder nicht. ein schlechtes Spiel ist das auf gar keinen fall!			"

The vehicles don't drive very well, but all in all there's a few new features that make the YOSE edition worth it.You get a new character who is a bad♥♥♥♥♥ among some new weapons and vehicles scattered around. The breakdown DLC has been updated to more difficult levels. Now from 0-100, you actually start to feel a real challenge.Great survival game, just overall fun to bash some zombie skulls in!			"

												If you already own the original State of Decay on PC, £22 is not worth it. All it adds is a balance in gamma and includes all the DLC, which you can buy seperately. However if you have not got the original get this. The game is fun and has permadeath for the handful of characters you  can play as. You can hve more characters to play as buy making friends. The game can get repetitive as you go around trying to keep food sleep and supplies and morals high. But the story is not bad, the gameplay is fun, and the soundtrack is good! Defenitly worth it if you like zombie games. Each character is different and when playing it almost felt like an episode of The Walking Dead xD.			"

												will people just shut there gobs when theryre reviewing this compared to there copy they already bought its stops the rest of us getting a clear image of what the game really scores and it scores a 3/10 in my book its lame, tedious missions are constantly repeating zombies are not much of a challenge its easy to survive and you are punished when you go to your real world job because when you get home someones is sick or ran away, and zombies have killed your neighbours who you almost have enough trust with too join your group also the world isnt very big i find myself driving the same roads all the time and after a week ive just lost complete interest in this game its the worse 20 quid ive spent on steam so far. i would recommend it if i had bought it for under a fiver Any 1 likes zombies try 7 days to die that 9/10 this state of decay is♥♥♥♥♥♥and i lack the will to get to the end of the game			"

												Really fun over the shoulder zombie shooter with long term survival as the driving element, this game feels like a combination of Grand Theft Auto and Killing Floor. This game has hundreds of references to zombie pop culture, and it's really great when you catch them. Unfortunately, the characters are bland, and the game is incredibly buggy.I'd recommend this game to pretty much anybody who enjoys zombies.			"

												things can get overwhelming with the amount of stuff you have to do!. you cant do everything in the game sadly you have 2 be wise in your choices of mission priorities, also keeping certain characters alive opens up new quests to them but if they die you cant finsh that quest thers always sumthin goin on its intense! either you are rescuing surviors, helping defend neighbours, scavenging for supplies or parts to complete a facility, seting up outposts, clearing out infestations, killing a certain zombie type in community 2 keep neighbourhood safe, building up your base etc etc alot goin down defo, and ontop o that u have 2 survive while doing all of this!! this has to be one of the most biggest maps i seen on any zombie game period!! it makes moon map on call of duty look tiny haha. If you bought the previous version of this game you get preppers pack & a new character a suv and some weapons. This game does make you think before you go out on runs i.e stocking up on meds weapons & guns/ammo etc.Alot of people have said this game should be coop its got all the makings of coop. you can play this game for hours literally there is a few character tweaks u can try for a challenge i suppose i.e reflex + heavy weapons. There are bugs in it but some make you laugh others look stupid but gameplay outweighs the bugs imo its got smooth gameplay also you have to be accurate when doing melee attacks because hitting them on stairs or hills you can miss swings/hits on them.                                                    ZOMBIES IN THE GAMENormal (4 -5 different types) /  FERAL /  SWAT / POLICE / SCREAMERS / JUGGERNAUT / BLOATER / INFECTED.id reccomend this game to any hardcore zombie gamer even has a hardcore mode (breakdown dlc)the game has 3 game modes: Story Campaign (SODYO), Campaign hardcore (BREAKDOWN) and  Army story (LIFELINE)iSOD YOSE you play through the story rescuing survivors along the way  build up ur base etcBREAKDOWN there is no story but your own you make all the choices and survive as long as you canLIFELINE you play as army soldiers and play through a story extracting VIP'S and defending your base from zombie hordes and learn of how the infection began. YOSE & BREAKDOWN are the same map in YOSE you are inclined to move to the warehouse whilst in BREAKDOWN you can choose anywere you want build up the area then escape.id give this game a 88 outta 100   (8.8 - 9)if it had coop then a 93/4 outa 100 (9.3/4)                                                  "

												Probably the best zombie survival game out there. It has an open world feel in a town setting which helps immensely in making the town feel real. It was a surreal feeling as i was starting to learn the roads and ways to get back home recognising signs and houses as i drove by them while mowing down zombie hordes. Cars really make a difference making missions play out faster and a little safer though still quite dangerous especially when your vehicle has no driver side door allowing a zombie to pull you out of your car to make a flesh dinner out of you if you dont toss em off somehow. Having a car makes mowing down zombies which have formed a horde much more easier to tackle compared to the much more terrifying on foot melee combat. You will have many different types of vehicles at your disposal which feel great to drive and have a nice collision model with some good visuals showing car damage until eventually you have to abandon it as it begins to smoke eventually catching on fire. You can though with the proper base upgrades repair vehicles before they get too banged up.Of course you can always walk it which makes things much more dangerous as you have to bring food to keep your stamina up and medicine to deal with any possible injuries while evading any large gathering of zombies as the day fades into the night. You can defend yourself with melee weapons for close up combat and guns for long range attacks. You will be limited by what you can carry especially with supply stockpiles you come across but this can be remedied by using a vehicle for supply runs which allows you to load up multiple stockpiles to take back to the base where your friends and other survivors are.Going through houses and commercial buildings for supplies and survivors is creepy as you never know if there is just that one zombie you see slowly moving past a first floor window or if the place is infested by zombies in other parts of the house. With some stealthy movement you can scout the outside of the house looking into windows to get a possible idea of what awaits inside. That is unless a zombie sneaks up behind you as you struggle with it attracting the zombies in the house. Next thing you know the stealthy silence is shattered by an explosion of zombie moans and growls raging with crazed cannibalistic hunger for your warm raw flesh. Gathering supplies is needed to build your base and upgrade it over time allowing it to have more survivors living there while better dealing with the psychotic murderous zombies roaming the country side. Gathering supplies which are used daily, completing missions, bringing new survivors, keeping things peaceful between fellow survivors, cooking a nice big meal, brewing up a pot of delicious hot coffee among many other things helps to keep morale up at your home base. You will also gain influence points and fame which allows you to choose better equipment from the supply store and influence others to help you.You will be playing more then one character as you do missions you will become tired over time and need to rest. This is when another survivor can be asked to take the place of your current character out on the field while they rest up. As your characters grow and develop you will find yourself getting attached to them. When my characters died i was surprised just how it effected me and actually missed them afterwards feeling the loss along with people back at the base talking about their death. They also died in some incredibly blood thirsty gruesome ways which shocked even a gore hound such as myself. It felt strangely sad as another survivor i was playing came across my previous now dead character's backpack full of supplies as they picked it up to take back to base. The excellent journal log keeps tracks of all these events and effect it has on everyone. It is also used to give orders for things like base upgrades, seeing what quests are available and things like how other survivors are getting along with each other and the morale of the base.Weapons and vehicles can be repaired when the proper base upgrades are built. This is usually over night so it pays to use more then one type while the other is being repaired. Music is done very well setting the tone of a once normal world transformed into a unbelievable living nightmare which blends well with the home town family surroundings all around you constantly assaulting your mind with contrasting atrocities of flesh eating zombies feasting on the living.Graphics are interesting in the fact that they are not the greatest yet get the point across like a sledgehammer as you are suddenly witnessed to a brutal death and even more shockingly so if its your own. STATE OF DECAY: YOSE Day One Edition if i could call it one thing it would be the perfect George Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD simulator capturing a normal if not blissful country setting where unbelievable horror is occuring.

												Do not buy especially because it's $25.00 that is an outragous pricetag for this game. Not to be to harsh but i really cant think of ANY pros for this game, everything that is one basically just turns into a reapetative piece of garbage. Later in the game the real sucky part comes when you have to go on ""Supply Runs"" and you use your best character with practically all the supplies from base camp dies from being eaten because you were backed into a corner. This game does have potential, but it'll have to be some really bold fairy dust to get it out of this Non-Reccomended review. 2/10 would rescue another survivor			"

												After many months and a few patches, the game still has silly bugs for many users.Just an example: when you set resolution @ 1920x1080, the game set refresh rate to 24 fps.I'll change the review, if they mind to fix bugs that afflicts the game since the release.			"

												Used to own the original. I bought this ""reboot"" for $8,State of Decay: Year One, plus Breakdown Year One DLC and Lifeline Year One DLC....all at the clearance isle at my local Walmart. Played 5.2 hours so far. Still awesome, looks and sounds even better now in 2017///and only things missing from it being a perfect 10 for me are multiplayer/PVP/CoOp. But the DLC's are wicked and make it a steal if you can get a deal. Good stuff.			"

												Let me just say after probably 70 hours of offline time painfully watching my allies die from both storyline and sheer acts of stupidy even a glitch where Sam kept running past the base I most dearly love to the  neighbor base that forced me to kill her with zombies cause I couldn't save otherwise. This game had pros and cons. I apoligize for any grammar mistakes.Otherwise to its a 4/5Pros - Great Storyline / Drama / Action for a RPG- Great selection of weapons- Painfully realistic but not so much you kill yourself on accident- Great selection of zombies for a balaced diet of hardcore and easy- Fast paced but dangerous - Balanced and Diverse sets of charcters you find that can progress to be more effective- All characters talk as if they where the main character when you control them.- Lovable option to press Alt and summon forth your powers on zombies- Lovable ways to travel in style Cons- Tideous as in excessive moments where your base is low on supplies and they can barally find it themselves even if its next door literally- Not enough choices in conversations to feel you can make a real impact on their opinions - They are amazing at combat except they do not understand how to equipment themselves aside from excessive snacks and painkillers. ( For insatnce we have a almost 50 guns and some don't even have a pistol in my base. )- They do not search enough for supplies to live on their own nor do they leave base in groups- You can't kill people who kill other people - There are little to zero moments where you just run into survivors or they come and find you- Zombies are literally endless in a shut off area for some annoying reason- You can get a whole pick up truck and a maximum allied group but you cannot order any of them help you carry items into the base or from an area. Additionally, you cannot take whats clearly infront of you or search it but instead have to wait 10 or 3 seconds to load a random group of items from some random lit up box and only carry enough to still be able to fight where optionally you can dump it or put it in a vehicle that looks huge but has as much space as a squarilles cheek. - There is no armor - There is no customization other than selecting upgrades for your base that leave a lot of open room where you would assume would let you put an extra upgrade but cannot "

Another issue is the annoying amount of things/chores you have to do, like take care of people's morale repetitively, travelling super far to save runners. You just want to progress and do something new and go on with the story without someone annoying you.			"

												I enjoyed this game.  Some of the dynamics and story line are excellent.  I like it better than Left for Dead, and about the same as Dead Island though the games are somewhat different.  I got it at the Halloween discount, so at that price it was a steal.  The game seemed very much how I felt when I watched the walking dead.  When my first character died, it was a wake up call that this game felt real.  I have trhree complaints:  1) there was no way to stop the story chatter that prevents you from moving.  I like how Borderlands handles that.  You get the information but are allowed to go about your business.  2) the game ended quickly without much variation in content.  3)  The first DLC was disappointing - it felt like a repeat of the base game.  OKAY, I have a 4th.  The game could do a better job at conveying the rules to you vs requiring a lot of reading or trial by error.  Most games these days give you training sessions or small tidbits of information that help you get up to speed.This review was poorly written, but I have to get to work.			"

												State of Decay: Year One Survival Edition is a fun survival zombie game. Where you try to survive by scavanging containers for supplies while searching for other survivers. To stick together you must find a suitable location to turn into a base while you try to escape the infected town. State of Decay is a that is fun and interesting but for a short amount of time and here is why.The Graphics are decent, there not realistic or nothing but you can tell what things are in the game. From a zombie to a car and people.The day and night cycle is a cool machanic but its a useless one at that. The zombies are not tougher at night so going out during the night is the same as going out during the day.The  six different zombies are a nice in the game but the game calles them ""freaks""instead of zombies. There six total ""freaks"" but there are about 3-5 close to each other. There is hordes as well which has about 5-10 ""freaks"". Toughest ones to kill are the juggernaut due to the amout of hits they can take. The zombie diffculty isn't that hard maybe on a normal difficult setting.The game-play is not that great. The game will lag a lot, items won't spawn in, some items will be unusable sometimes, ""freaks"" will glitch through doors, deflecting a ""freak"" works when it wants too, all A.I. are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the game lacks survival. Skills and leveling are pointless in the game for you rarely ""level up"" in the game and when you you can only pick one skill per character to specialize in. Blunt, blades, pistols, shotguns ect ect. Only picking one to be good takes away the achivment of leveling a character. It feels like all your work in the game was for nothing.Supplies was one of the disappointing thing in the game. I was able to go out and raid every building, bring everything back in one hour. Once I did that, the ""rashions"" barley moved unless I chose to build or upgrade a station. Even then I was able to hit a few country places and regain the ""rashions"" I just used. Breakdown and Lifeline DLC are okay add-ons but Lifeline makes the game feel new while Breakdown uses the same map as State of Decay. I personally feel that Lifeline is the only DLC you need and not Breakdown. I had played 39 hours of the game and I can tell you that you could beat it lesser then my 39hrs if you know how the game works and knew what to do. This game looked and sounded to be good but it's not. Playing on low quality and still getting glitches, lag ect ect I really can't recommand this game to anyone at the asking price its at especially when it forces you to get the DLC. I'd wait for it to go on sale or something. I give this game a 5/10, just average game.Thanks for reading my review and yes I know I had spelling error. I have bad memory so can't remmeber how to spell words correctly.			"

												Buy this game, no really. Support the developer. It's fun for roleplaying in a zombie apocolypes or just plain fun if you like cracking skulls or building a base and micromanaging survivors.  This title has its flaws but a lot of it has been addressed in the Year One edition, such as the new vehicle inventory system. Only downside I have for it is the keyboard controls aren't the greatest, I would definatly recommend trying a controler. Also this would work great in multi player, hopefully Undead Labs will add that in the sequal.			"

												I bought it and played it for 39 minutes. Unfortunately the UI does not give me any hints in what to do and how to do. And I just found the survivors in the Ranger Station. For me, that is an annoying experience and no fun, unfortunately, as I love open world and also zombies. In addition the controls and camera are annoying as a PC gamer as well. You just see, that you play a console port. For people who use walkthroughs for playing and don't have problems with the controls, it might be okay. For me personally it's not a game I can enjoy.

Human AI is very bad esapcally in protect while they scav where they will do nothing leading to ur possible death, which i did die from. Cars will also flip or get stuck on far to many things leading to it blowing up causing supplies lost. Combat is good the game doent have too many bugs and it contains a stealth feture as well as scaving is fun.  All and all its fun ,but did not realize its full potential due to these reasons and more as well as a only decently sized map.         Though its good and i think an 8/10			"

												Its a great game all around. Sure, there are some boot issues with windows 10, but that is to be expected due to the fact that windows 10 was released in July 2015 (July 29th). the devs recommend Windows 7/8 for this game because thats what it was built for. This is just telling the people who give it a bad (for the tech reasons) review that even though it was released last year (April 2015) it can still have compatibility issues with windows 10 due to the fact it was created for windows 7/8. The bad reviews for the gameplay, thats just them not liking it so read those before you buy it to see if you may like the play style.My Rig: Win 10Intel core 2 quad Q93006Gbs RAMAMD radeon R7 360 2Gb DDr 5 VramDell Optiplex 755 mobo and case			"

												This game is the ""difinitive"" zombie survival and is as close to ""The Walking Dead"" as it gets, closer than their crappy version of the game. It's as close to a zombie survival as it gets and the 3rd person prespective isn't so bad either. If there had been more research and co-op put into this game it would be the #1 3rd person zombie survival situation. And when i say this i don't mean to confuse with the ""ultra"", over-blown zombie games...i don't classify this game in with them. It's not as fast paced and you're not FORCED to go all out for the majority of the game.What utterly SUCKS about this game:No safety when you climb: If the game glitches, during a high climb, and you're pushing toward he ladder....you're DEAD. Horrible Lighting: This game is made darker than dark and the gamma is all you have, it's crap.Glitchy controls: This game is slow to respond to ""keyboard/mouse"" players (at times) so you might end up doing the same attack sequence after the zombies are dead or running too far or snapping around too soon (or too slow) and you end up getting bitten because of it.Clipping: This game clips like a MOTHER and you will see it all throughout this game.NO CO-OP: This game would be 10x better with co-op and it looks like they're going to SCREW up ""State of Decay 2"" by leaving the co-op out of it as well. This game would still be on the Top 20 list IF there had been co-op.My last thought here, if you like the game...PLAY IT. Never let anything, that someone else tells you, ""completely"" dissuade you from playing a game...it's just one person's opinion. It was just too much drive space, for something that's already been done, to me...In NO way am i implying ""like what i like""....i'm just telling you how it felt to me....there is no right and there is no worng, there is only perception from the experience and that's what i'm verbalizing here :)			"

												The year one edition of this game is truly the best experiance you can have while playing it. The game itself has a good story though I must say the missions get very repetative with companions, and the breakdown mode is also repetative but it gives you a sense of.. acomplishment. As well with the fact that the main story is very short aside from all of the side things and defense buffing that you do the game itself is enjoyable, thouhg it can feel as though it is all for naught if you build something up to be very epic and have an abrupt ending. I put about 27 hours into the game I'd say about eight of that was on the story while the rest had had to do with building up bases and outposts. 7.5/10			"

												I been playing State of Decay (original version) for close to two years. The Breakdown DLC is what keeps me coming back to this game. With Year One version:  new female character and The Cleo missions are an added plus, but some buggy issues with the original version are still present.  However, Year One looks much better image wise.			"

												Spend alot of hours playing this. This has very good replay value and you can always try something new in each playthrough. This might not be cutting egde technology but it does the job. Graphics are decent, UI is great and easy and sound is great as you will be using it alot on higher difficulty. There's lots to play through here in form of main game plus two DLC's which each enable more features and even more content, fully voiced with story and new items. But the ""area"" you play in is huge and it will take many hours alone just to explore it all. If you're a Walking dead fan and interested in survival of groups of people, building comunity and help others, this is the probably the best game for just that, i've played atleast. Despite many bad reviews due to some relaunch issues at beginning, this is a good and stable game which can be further added with many mods made available via Nexus.			"

												I've been meaning to write a review of this for so long--the main game IS good. It's really fun BUT you need a lot of patience and really gotta work on strategy to survive and keep all your characters alive.One playthrough I was kicking major butt and suddenly my character Marcus' (which was my favorite cuz I had him crazy leveled up) head got ripped completely off. I was so mad I uninstalled the game. I thought F this all that work and then that happens???But I went back to it eventually and tried it again, but without trying to rush through everything, without the mindset of guns blazing (which I think was part of my problem). Went much much better. And I eventually finished the game, satisfied for the most part. The constant respawning of zombies, and Lilly's voice constantly radioing was really the only thing I found extremely irritating.Breakdown seems super pointless to me, so I haven't really gotten too far into it. Lifeline was good in the way that it showed the military's perspective, and in a city environment. But the ending of it felt abrupt, like there should have been something more afterward.Overall I'd say yeah you should buy this game. Most of the reviews I've seen have been about specs and all that  ""oh it's a ripoff cuz graphics aren't any better blah blah blah."" Who cares??? The graphics are fine, doesn't ruin the experience. Try it--try it around Halloween, it's really fun around that time. :)			"

												I played the demo of this game on xbox and it was pretty good. I picked it up during the steam sale, and it's like a more casual singleplayer DayZ with a story. You have to swtich characters or they get tired, build up your base and protect it from hoards and special infected. There is supposedly limited ammo for the whole game, however in what I've played, there is just so much around that it's not something I have to worry about at the moment. However over time some guns will run out of ammo sooner than others. Your characters can die, even if you're not playing as them. I just lost Maya.... She was my second favorite character to play as. She had high melee and shooting stats but... A zombie jumped on her and killed her... It was the last one. Why did you have to die Maya.... I'll miss you forever. You were there since the begining... almost... You were the third person with a name, but like the 7th I met. I still miss you Maya...However there are some faults with the game. Often times the game has frame dips, and takes a while to load. It is a ""Seamless open world"" however certain zones take time to load and I even crashed into the edge of the world (It didn't hurt my car) because the game didn't finish loading as I was driving by with a fast car.

												Its a good game, The wish you could hold more outposts then just limited by your base like xamount of outposts based on your amount of people. When i got up to 30people having just a few feelt silly,What i would like is the option of having a small base outside of your bigger one making it like a sub base(In which you'd need to designate some people to hold and protect it).So having one base feelt abit of a limitDid not enjoy the big bases so much. Zombies were always at the gates no matter what just because zombies stockpiles behind the base where you could not make a clearing, So sometimes if you were unlucky you'd walk out and find a juggernaut.(sometimes even more)The smaller bases were easier to defend since you could make a safety proximity. also the only ones you can exit the base without seeing a bunch of zombies wanting to fight.Another intressting idea would be to have a small base being able to upgrade to a big base, Like for instance join up two buildings, Or you'd have a apartment complex and you'd tear out a wall and the living space would become biggerNever really experianced any game breaking bugs, Had one or two crashes and one time when a zombie walked into the base and no one really shot it until it nearly killed someone(Carnival base)			"

												State of Decay has aspects to it that make it a bit unique, like the fact that you are managing and playing as a whole community of people. However with the time that i played i barely had any fun playing this game mainly because the mission structure is very mundane and uninspired, the story is dull and uninteresting as well as the characters themselves and there is nothing to the gameplay itself that makes it better than the average zombie game out there, fighting zombies in particular just ended up being a clunky, button mashing, frustrating mess. I applaud the game for being very ambitious for a budget title and it mostly succeeds at what it tries to pull off, for me personally though I never found the gameplay to be compelling or fun and I also don’t feel compelled to continue playing the game I feel like I would just be wasting my time, it all just feels tedious and pointless. 5/10 (Average)			"

The camera angle is not at all comfortable and not customizable. in cars its even worse because of how the camera changes distance from the car depending on your speed so you are at a constant zooming in and out while driving. Ive had big problems with the NPC's noclipping through walls and zombies walking straight into rocks and walk out a bit later without even taking notice of me running next to them. The game world felt very empty and linear, it was just alot of flat ground wich could have been uneven to make the world feel more life like.			"

												State of Decay was originally released in 2013 on the Xbox 360 and PC and two years later in 2015 we have a remaster known as Year One Survival Edition. I originally played the game in 2014 on my Xbox 360 and had hours to spend on it. I decided to buy the PC version when a new version of State of Decay was released, but the original version was taken off steam. I'm going to be reviewing the actual game itself, if you want to know the difference between this remaster or the original, then these are the differences. The game has been remastered, so that just means better graphics, less bugs and problems and more smooth gameplay, and the game has ticked all those boxes. But the most notable difference is that this version contains all the DLCs for free. If you have already got the original State of Decay on your PC, then I do not reccommed you buy this. Unless you want the DLCs and improvments to the original and you're willing to pay £23 or around $30 for this, just stick with the original. Onto the actual game itself, you start off at a fishing lake getting attacked by zombies or as they though it was 'a cannibal family picnic'. You end up at a police building where you meet some other survivors. You and your friend, 'Ed' search houses and find a woman who's friends were killed. Eventually you make it out of the mountains and into a town where you meet a girld called 'Lilly' who you met on a radio. After that, you have your own free will to do whatever you feel. The story is slightly bare as the cutscenes are just as advanced as the camera system you have when you're still playing. But the gameplay is what makes State of Decay so good.No other game is like State of Decay, it's a bit like  a mix of GTAV, DayZ and Telltale's The Walking Dead. If that appeals to you, you will love this. As the game is open world, you can go anywhere in the Trumbull county. There are several towns to explore and lots of long countryside roads, but you will spendf most of your time inside the town your base is in and looting it. There are some vehicals to drive which you will probably blow up in 10 minutes and attract a load of zombies and there are tons of buildings to loot. But knowing where to start is up to you. This game makes you make choises by your own instinct.Combat is very well designed when your attacked by zombies. You wack them with a mele weapon or just beat them to death. One zombie is easy, even ith no weapons and low stamina, you could take one on and not lose any health, but when your attacked by a dozen, it gets hard. You will automitically lock onto the zombie your facing and repeatedly smash it until it's head breaks. But when another zombie attacks you from behind, it will jump on you forcing you to try and shake it off. One thing to know is that this game is slightly over the top with gore. You can sneak up on a zombie and kill it by grabbing onto the head and smashing it on the the floor. Not to mention this game has some finshing moves that look badass. In terms of weapons, you have a lot but only really two types of mele weapons. If your using things like hammers, hatchets, cricket bats, you do quick slashes on zombies that take about five hits. But if you use big sledgehammers or an axe then you will do big swings at the zombies taking only three hits, but more time. This is simular to Skyrim with one and two handed weapons.In terms of guns, they nail this too. You will often be scrounging for weapons, and you may come across a gun shop or police department, in that case, bingo! Because guns are very useful in some cases, in some missions you will have to protect NPCs from zombies by barricading houses and attacking the zombies. Often you are left with no choice but to shoot some, especially some of the 'freak' zombies. When you scavenge for ammo, you will not find a lot, making every shot count. You can get many guns, pistols, rifels, assult rifels, shotguns, even grenade launchers (not common).AI is alright, the zombies aren't meant to be Einstein so they are pretty easy to sneak past when you are crouching. But when your trying to survive the apocalypes, you may make a lot of noise, and this noise willcertainly attract zombies. Shooting, driving, running, jumping, fighting, scavenging will lure zombies towards you, which can be difficult because you will be doing a lot of the previously listed activities. This is also useful when you need to make a distraction, using firecrackers will make lots of noise, attracting zombies in the area so you can get past or loot. The actual zombies come in many forms, some are stronger than others but the strongest are the 'freaks'. These zombies are much more tough or deadly, especially juggernauts. These are huge zombies with look like they have mixed DNA with a bear and tank, these are incredibly hard to kill.Your community is controlled by you and your influence. Influence is kind of a 'symbolic currency' in your community which you can use to spend on different things. You can ask to find supplies or make outposts where you can store supplies or make facilities in your base, the concept is very useful. You earn influence by doing missions such as saving people, finding people, finding supplies, killing 'freaks', looting houses, talking to people and other activities. Your community also needs to feel safe, so that means you need lots of supplies and not a lot of zombies in your town, and no infestations. These are a sort of nest for zombies where they live and eat and if you don't clear infestations, your community may slowly fall apart.You can find new members to join your community to help you survive, but this also means another mouth to feed, and supplies are rare once you have scavenged most of them. Your map shows the whole of Trumbull county and has crosses on the houses you have already scavenged. So sooner or later you will need to find a way to escape Trumbull county by following the main missions which lead to an alright story, what you would expect off a zombie survival game. I personaly had no problem with the ending, but I know many found it dissapointig. But this is a spoiler free review so I will not say anything else.There are several vehicals to drive, but as I previously mentioned they tend to be about as safe as petrol and fire. Some vehicals are big and protected with a lot of space to store supllies and some are small and fast with little protection. One thing to note is that youi can change your character to go on house raids or when your character dies you can change to another member of your community, and then find the supplies of your last character. This game also has a very nice soundtrack along with very nice graphics. I remember the first time I tried to go on a scavenge in State of Decay was at night and I was too worried to fight the zombies in case it attracted more. So I was just sneaking from bush to bush, hiding from the zombies, along with the beautiful soundtrack.But like most games, I do still have my fair froblems with the game. First, you don't really feel any connection to the other members of your community, when another member joins, it just means less space but more help. The only characters I ever really cared for were Marcus (the character you start with), Lilly, Ed (your friend at the beggining) and Maya (another early character you meet). And the game is slightly buggy. It doesn't feel very polished at times, but this is easily passable by the fun gameplay itself.Overall, if your looking for a zombie survival game that isn't just buggy multiplayer or the slaughter of millions of zombies, I can't reccommend this to you enough. Despite the lack of polish this game has, you will get hours of fun from it.9/10 Not a masterpiece, but real damn close!			"

Intro TL;DR This is a 3:rd person scavenge and survival action game with RPG elements. It is set in a post-apocalyptic setting where most people died and then stood up again. This game is for you if you like exploring under tension,running slightly simple mission and building a small society. These are the things you need to be able to overlook.    -    Auto save that you have absolutely no control over.     -    Game world has poor and inconsistent persistence. Zombies often spawn in when you can see them. Cars can get repaired whilst doing nothing. Areas don't stay cleared (due to random spawn-ins)    -    Some of the missions you get are of a ""You're a school teacher who needs to hold everyone’s hand""-type    -    Game can be repetitive. Some missions feature you haveing a talk with a given character. When you for the fifth time do that mission with the exact same dialogue it just feels lazy.     -    The game has no Cooperative play mode. This could seriously mitigate most of the negatives.     -    The menus are cumbersome to use.     -    I've built at least a few facilities because I clicked one to many times on something whilst finding out what that facility was.    -    You cannot cancel facility being built    -    Physics are twitchy. Be careful about flipping your car full of loot...A few tips for enjoying the game.  Whenever a slightly different mission shows up. Do it. You'll get enough of the repetitive ones anyway  Use the radio tower to find resources you need.    Recruit people when you can  Extend the base as much as possible.   Don't be afraid to move.  Build outposts around the base. Really does help.  What did I like about it?    +    Big gameworld to explore. Nothing is locked down. Go out there and explore.     +    A bunch of characters to choose between.     +    Characters actually die and are gone from play after that.     +    You do have some control over how the settlement survives based on resources gathered, facilities built and outposts settled    +    Game has a mechanism for how much sound you make. It works pretty well.     +    I like the palette			"

												dont get me wrong, this is a great game. really, it is great. it is the all in one survival simulator, but there are A LOT of issues with it. there are a sh*t tone of bug, for example, zombie get stuck between walls, zombie get stuck under the deck etc. this game is also very poorly optimized. i have a GTX 970M and guess what, it is not a very good gaming experience i got. sometimes, the frame rate drops down to less than 30 when it is on ultra settings which is just a great disappointment on my part. all in all, love the content, but WTF, releasing a half finished game is not something you should do.

												For me, it was most awesome experience when I could actually chop limbs off zombies instead of the DayZ laggy amateurish ones. Make this an online multiplayer and I will go to the streets to help you sell it. One of the best if not the best zombie experience so far for me. Runs smooth, vehicles have perfect physics. Nothing more satisfying than hitting a bunch of zombies with the car despite the car getting wrecked as it should in real life after a certain number of strikes. Very well thought through. Nice story.			"

												Certainly the best zombie game I have played. Especially with the latest mods.

												A lot of people are complaining about the fact that this is a paid ""update"" and I can understand that, but if you are new to this game and didn't buy the first one I must say that it is worth buying. The game doesn't have a lot of real bugs in it anymore and while it still does have a few negatives like the NPC's trying to get in your car and getting stuck at intense moments, it is a good game with nice base building and base managing mechanics while still keeping a nice third person fighting system that (in my opinion) doesn't get old after you killed a few zombies. So I would recommend this game to anyone that likes the zombie survival genre or would like to get in to it. Keep in mind that this is a game where you have to manage your survivors so it isn't a game where you are completely alone with the zombies.			"

Posted: February 12
												I don't know where to start with this game. Apparently there's no intro-- I start a new game, the scene opens and I'm standing by water being attacked by zombies. Not even time to get my bearings, adjust to the physics of the game, make any necessary changes, or even process a storyline. Following this my main character acts completely nonchalant about what's going on, apparently unbothered by either the zombies attacking him or, if he's unaware they're zombies, the fact that he just murdered three people.The controls are not good. The movement feels awkward, turns are awkward, the camera is also awkward. I suspect gunplay would not be particularly fun in this game and the melee (at least at the start) is mindless mashing.Following the very abrupt introduction (i.e. appearing with no context or character/story build-up whatsoever), I make my way to a nearby ranger cabin and am greeted by someone who acts like I know exactly what's happening. Here, take these supplies and head back out to secure the area! And I, seeming to lack interest in the background of this situation, unable to express shock or horror at the unfolding situation, agree to do this with no particular need to question this man. I head back out to explore the area, climbing a water tower to assess different points of interest. This is pretty cool and finally begins to ground me a bit. I manage to access the menu system (which, for some unknown reason, does not default to the Escape key but instead picks a random button on my mouse) and am fairly bombarded with information. It's not an excessive amount of stuff-- it seems they struck a good balance between depth and accessibility-- but it's still a lot to take in at once and with no real tutorial. I manage to access game controls and can finally fix the y-axis reverse and change some of the hotkeys.Following this I begin to explore and seek out quest locations. However, my minimap is not 'locked' but changes as my facing changes-- again, I can't comprehend why this was done. So I have a difficult time orienting myself in the pursuit of static locations. I also realize that the movement isn't getting much better, even after adjusting the camera sensitivity. I find a few cabins, beat down some deadites, and enter to see what appear to be items strewn all over. Yet the cabin is described as empty and there's nothing to loot. I noticed the same thing in the ranger station-- lots of goods lying around that can't be picked up. I find this strange and an immersion breaker.A few minutes later I realize that I am already bored and have no real interest in trying to adapt to the game's clunky controls, no real sense of world immersion (largely due to the horrible 'plop you in with no context'), and am getting no enjoyment whatsoever from the combat. I log out after about twenty minutes for the second time since I picked the game up, recalling that I had tried once to play, didn't enjoy it, but wanted to give it another chance.Now I know it's not a fluke. The game as a whole might be fun, and it might have been more acceptable before I got into the Fallout series, but at this point I just can't comprehend some fo the developer decisions or the lacklustre beginning-- which is generally among the most important parts of a game and should be polished quite a bit before release.Scoring this game would be difficult because I haven't given the breadth of it much of a chance. So I will say 5/10, but if you can get past the issues I've outlined here, or really, really love zombies, the system seems interesting enough to warrant a 7.  "

												So Long time player of the Origanal State of Decay, Loved it and still do. Year One came out and I jumped on the band wagon like a drunk needing booze and I loved it, Why, Because State of Decay is a Zombie game I enjoy. Yeah they closed down the other one and will not sell it anymore but this game is still the same as the other just updated for the Xbox One so that is why they did this. So that being said here we go into the Review.The game is just like the State of Decay parent but there are infact different vehicles, animations, fixed bugs and infact some new added characters and example is Milo (Sasquatch's brother from Lifeline). So they rereleased the game, so are you gonna complain about Final Fantasy 7's Remastered? I loved State of Decay and I love Year One.			"

												Ignore 90% of the negative reviews. They are angry at this being practically a ""Game of the year"" copy, where all of the DLC and updates are included. Seriously, read some of them, they're pretty salty over nothing. As for the complaints about graphics, perhaps they just need to upgrade their hardware, because I've ran into very few stutters as some have claimed. You do see a little flickering on some distant images, but its really not bad at all. This game is absolutely fantastic, ranking well into my top 10 favorite games of all time; and that says a lot considering how many fantastic titles I've played in my lifetime. This game really makes you put in the effort to keep everyone alive and satisfied, without feeling grueling and overbearing. I waited until i put in over 10 hours before deciding to make this review, just in case it was an easily beat, or at the very least quick to beat kind of game. I can say without doubt, i'm not even close to half way though, and that's without touching the DLC yet. So please, give this game a chance, especially if you can while its on sale, you wont regret it. Even if its no longer on sale by the time you come across it, its well worth full price. I recommend this title to anyone into survival games, games similar to The Walking Dead, or just looking for a game to invest time in. Rating 9/10 (Would me a solid 10 but only a a very rare select few titles get a 10 in my book.)Cons- Zero. I've yet to find anything about this game to warrant a con. Small things, like a few minor graphics issues are to be expected from a game that's not made by some super development corporation. These people obviously worked their asses off.			"

												Where to begin?  Lots of negativity in this one but not from me.Many are pessimistic here because, indeed, this should ave been little more than a patch rather than a total new release.  So, some had to double buy.  However, that stated, this comes with the DLC of Breakdown and Lifeline that the original one had to purchase them seperately.  Here shows, once more, waiting for that right time to buy, instead of getting immediately at release, can be a good thing.  Many games have updates not patched immediately, but held until complete and packaged together wit their expansions then.One thing, I desperately wish I could use my controller with this one.  Keyboard functions are nominal, but can take that precious second to reach that finger over that would have saved your life by rolling/sprinting away.  I only feel, using a controller I may not have had to restart so many times.  If I had a controller, the way it saves may not be so bad!  Death is perminant for every character, and between that and using the keyboard, completion of the game is possible but improbable. Visually, the game is stunning, grim, dark, amazing, and terribly terrific.Audio does cut in and out at times, and is extremely important as your char gives you clues on if you can outpost yet or not a place, and radio from home base updates missions still to do/new on map.  A text caption backup at the bottom of the screen exists, but is far from full proof.  Once I loaded a relatively young game up, at the church, we had our gate per usual but the wall wasn't there.  People were running freely from the church to the parking without using the gate.  Now, this may speed up their little scavinging runs, but what if we had a horde come through just then?My biggest dislike though is glitching through walls.  It happens pretty frequent, especially when a juggernaut does it when you're trying to pitch him fiery cocktails and not get the NPCs or yourself wasted during a besieged mission.Tip, at all costs, avoid a jugger when elements would otherwise force you to face it one on one in the open.  Avoid jumping into a horde on the other side of a window to try to kill the juggie at a distance.  Just run away to fight another day.  Strategical retreats, also, are noble.  Especially when twenty something people depend on your continued existence.  You need not tell them you ran away from fighting another thirty zombies, just tell them about the seventy before that you killed over dinner.  You are the apocalypse hero, so tell your story, your way.  History remembers the words of the winner, but dead things tell no tales.  Worry not, for the zombies you ran from will not tattle on you!Okay, I've mentioned many little nuances, and few large good things.  All those nuances though remove very little from appreciation and immersion for me.  Overall out of a rating of 100, I rate this a 99.  Great product here, UL			"

First you buy a game you could have known of it could have been the same and then get upset, also for the player who dont have either but a good pc i would still recomend this one, because as people say: ""avoid YOSE"" i say ""Buy YOSE"" because there is more content, some bugs are fixed and the graphics are increased.

												I know there are a lot of bad reviews about this game but honestly most of these im guessing are problems with their computer not the game because i run this game on high graphics and I get no problems whatsoever. Sure the companions in this game are not the most useful but they do help. One companion could be the diffirence between you getting a lot of resources and a zombie ripping your face off. Vehicles are super useful especially since 1. they can kill zombies really easily, 2. they can carry supplies in the trunk, and 3. there are a lot of them. Also i'll tell you right off the bat that this is a ""year edition"". Year editions like for example ""game of the year editions"" aren't remastered versions. Year editions are just the original game but with a little bit better graphics and all the DLC but at a lower price. Your not going to get incredibly better graphics with this edition just a little bit better. If your looking for a single-player version of games like Day-Z or H1Z1 then this game is for you. So to sum it all up. 1. not many problems.2. companions are useful.3. vehicles are super useful.4. a little bit better graphics.5. all DLC.6. decent combat.7. pretty good survival aspect.8. decently interesting story and characters.

												I agree with a lot of people.It's not a good strategy, to sell this game again under a "" remastered "" label, while basicly you are paying again for a ""patch"" HOWEVER, also i bought the first version and still I am buying it again.But I will NOT just downvote this game because I might be butthurt that i have to pay a full price again.I payed again because I like the game, its good fun, and I did not had the DLC's yet, so i thought , well I got the money, i can afford it, so i rebought it. I will upvote this game, because of the fun I have in it. But I can understand the butthurts of those who downvoted it for legit reasons.My upvote is therefore only meant for those who are new to this game, if you are into testing how many zombies you can kill with your car, or see how you get ripped in half if zeds get the best of you,  and you like zombie games in general. and you can turn a blind eye for the fact the developer is greedy, buy the game :)  you only live once :)			"

Despite it's bugs, it's the best zombie apocalypse single-player game - so far.But I strongly recomend using a mod to enhance it's options and gameplay, like Extended Functions - it will add tons of new weapons and unblock the ones in the various add ons (Lifeline weapons in Breakdown, etc.), give more building options, frees up more contruction sites in home sites, etc.The only problems in my opinion are the constant small bugs and, what really pi$$es me off is that you find A LOT of guns - this is a ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE, it should be a little harder to find usable guns, not to mention ammo.Maybe it's just me, because I live in a country with severe restricting gun laws (Brazil), but I find it odd that in just 5 to 10 minutes of gameplay I might find myself with a grenade laucher AND a machine gun - both fully loaded.

												I definitely have never understood the negative reviews surrounding this game.  Sure, the updated YOSE edition only included an entire 1080p graphic overall, loads of bug fixes, and new playable characters/items/vehicles/zombies in Breakdown... But, you didn't have to buy the ""update.""  I did, and I don't regret it at all.  I'm honestly waiting with baited breath for a new one to be released!  I want more content!  MORE!I have dumped hours upon hours into this game and I can truly say that it is awesome!  There's a level of difficultly that you can set for yourself--depending on your play-style.  I'm a more casual player, doing a lot of stuff just for the story and team-building that this game allows.  Some of the tasks *can* get repetative after a while, but, you can always choose to ignore them.  The developers made sure there was plenty to do to keep you busy.If you like survival, zombies, RPG, adventure, and discovering new play-systems with a twist--then SoD is for you!			"

												State of Decay, to date this is quite literally my favorite zombie game. SoD gets it right on so many levels, the main characters truly have character and the voice acting is actually pretty decent. This is an old game I had it on Xbox live and put far more time into it there than on steam. If you like survival horror games this one has one of the better replay value that I have found, rpg elements let you build characters base building to fill the needs of the camp.Needless to say you can tell I'm a fan, but I will say there are some consthis is an old game the graphics are a bit datedthe zombies never die out they just keep coming this kinda leaves me with a feeling of failure at the end of each play though as these are supposed to be small towns how many 10's of thousands of people could there have actually been there, sometimes hoards spawn in places that have been totally cleard instead of roaming from uncleard areasthe zombie killing can get stale, you spend alot of time conserving ammo with meele combat which is a little clunky and not very deepand the biggest con of all no multiplayer, the new game is supposed to have multiplayer of some kind.all in all I would recommend it but not a full price even moreso now that their is a new game coming, but I bought it twice at full price and still feel like my value was through the roof.

												State of decay does not have the worlds best graphics but it compensates (I think) in gameplay and challange. This game is not flawless (no game is) ocassional glitches are annoying but not a deal breaker, zombie hords are constant and never ending.  Anyone in this game can die, and I mean ANYONE! my biggest pet peeve is when the zeds swarm you and you have no way to stop a character from dying.  Zombies (zeds) are way too awair of their surroundings making stealth a moot point accept in the very beginning. The story is not very compelling but still enjoyable.  Guns are helpful but tend to lead to  more zeds coming to attack you, melee is dangerous and comes with it's own shortcomings.  This game is not for the ill-tempered or easily annoyed because you will have both happen to you.  Stealth needed to be better, more options for building forts all would have added to the enjoyment of this game. You end the game walk away only to come back and discover that all your safehouses have been overrun, Half the people you rescued are dead, (for no reason) and in general moral sucks. Yet when you left the game everying was on a highnote, so not having everything you have worked hard to achive suddenly fall apart while you were not playing the game would definatly been better, no would make more sense. Despite all this I have still enjoyed this game and would reccomend it with a warning, its your fault if you put you fist through your monitor.			"

												Yes. I played the first and owned the DLC's for it. AND LOVED IT. It wasnt perfect in terms of stabability but State of Decay was one of the BEST zombie games I have played. I was reluctant buying this re-release due to all the negative comments BUT I eventually did during steam sales. Now, in all honesty this game doesn't really add much to the experience (contrary to what the description says) and I can see where people are coming from when they talk about having not a lot of NEW content for previous players (some more map areas or places you can settle would have been great to increase replayability). I am still having fun however and I am enjoying the game just like I did with the first AND ONLY FOR $11.99 cheaper than what I payed for the original when I first got it! Here it is The devs probably should have considered making the game cheaper for owners of the previous game... considering the MAJOR point in buying this re release is due to the graphics and not a heck of a lot to do with extra content.IT IS WORTH PURCHASING ON SALE. and by all means for those of you who feel cheated by it can get a refund BUT REMEMBER BY BUYING THIS GAME YOU HELP SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEQUEL!!!!!!

												I'm not going to lie there are many things wrong in this game from invisible enemies, clipping though walls and stairs, finicky controls, lag which has gotten me almost killed on several ocassions, and non consistant doors, which sounds like I'm being picky but when zombies can walk right through our defenses if the gate isn't closed I'd like all the doors to be consistant. Either I have to shut them myself or they shut automatically but in this game half the time the doors are automatic and half the time they're not.Still I recomend this game because the concept and the basic mechanics are sound. This is one of the most realistic zombie games that I've played and I like that it revolves around a sense of community instead of you being a lone wolf trying to do everything. And while it can get annoying to have been playing for 20 minutes for your survivor to get fatigued and you either have to switch out for someone else or stop playing for a while, I feel like it works with the realisim. No one can do everything all the time as much as we want to.			"

												Best survival zombie game ever! I love the game so much I have the original version too. Best living world I have ever experienced in an open world game.A day surviving State of Decay; driving down the road and see a zombie horde, I'll just run them down, so many zombies my car gets bogged down long enough for a feral zombie to pull me from the car and rip my in two, I am dead, next survivor please :-) man I love this game.

												While this game got some backlash for going ""YOSE"" I still feel like this game is worth the money especially since you get all of its DLC.Pros:>For a game that was put out in a rush, its a very unique game that accomplishes what other game could not.>Large map with TONS of lootable buildings, camp sites, ect. Its safe to say that 99% of the buildings are lootable.>Fun and dynamic base building with several choices to where you can set up your base.>Has a good mix of challenging and relaxing moments.>You can play as any suvivor you rescue or meet.>has a good mix of different types of missions so your not always doing the same thing.>Has a huge varity of guns (uses the names of real guns) and melee weapons along with many types of ammo, grenades, food/snacks, vehicles, and distraction items.>Fun DLC that adds many more hours of gameplay.>Has replay ValueCons:>The game still has bugs but none that i found were unbearable.>Zombies keep respawning in looting areas despite already killing them.>Has a cap on what can fit in storage but iv only hit it once and im a huge pack rat.>Cant keep playing after you finish the main story missions.>Have to reset the game every time you want to swithch to DLC.>No multiplayer (although State of Decay 2 is fixing that -

												there are a lot of negative reviews on this game from disgruntled PC gamers who feel like the original port should never have been sold and that this version should have been the PC version from the begining. This is not a review of indignant entitlement.This game is NOT Hugely different from the original, there are a few new questlines, some tweaks, characters all have a combat knife so when their melee weapon breaks they don't do repetetive kicks like they did. There are a couple new weapons and the campaigns all share vehicles and weapon drops.The part that doesn't get talked about much is that the graphics engine is substantially improved, it wasn't just a texture package, the UI, shadows, and geometries were also improved, resolutions run higher and the framerate is actually better. there are mods on the nexus that can make the original game much better, but they don't approach the visual fidelity that the YOSE version does. I bought this game in part to support devs that built something unique. I both this one and the original on sale, and i don't regret either. IF you've never played the original this game is EPIC, its on my top 10 all time games list, next to titles like Skyrim, Lego Marvel Superheroes, Bioshock, Tomb Raider, X3TC/AP, and Command and Conquer 3.if you've played the original and wish to see some improvements, most of them are here, there are also mods to correct the few remaining flaws on this one.

												Having played this for as long as I have, I have just a few comments:-it doesn't have wonderful graphics-it has no happy endings-you can't kill other players (read what you buy before you buy it)-you have to save NPCs-you have to earn acheives by actually doing them, not by cheesing them somehow-you have to create and maintain viable communities.It has great replay value, you get to kill lotsa zombies, and if you have a moderately decent PC, knowledge of keyboard commands in Windows, you can easily have a fun gaming experience saving NPCs at the same time. If your defintiion of a good time is looking for humans to kill, you're going to have a hard time here...altho it is possible. :)			"

												I feel people are being totally unfair to this release. This is one of my favorite games of all time and this version adds a lot, great new characters, new weapons, new missions, a variety of much needed new vehicle skins, new animations, along with better graphics and slightly better performance. People think because they bought the original version they are entitled to the remaster, but that's not usually how things work. I had no problem buying this game twice. This game is worth every penny. I've got way more out of it than most $60 AAA titles, so even buying both versions of the game and all the DLC I feel I'v well gotten my money's worth. Plus I love to support the developers of this great game. If you already have State of Decay, and don't think it's worth it to buy it again, than don't buy it. The original version is still great. If you absolutely love SoD and can't get enough, than $30  I keep both installed and mod the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the original version.For me State of Decay YOSE is tied with Telltale's Walking Dead for the greatest zombie game of all time. It makes me sad this has ""mixed"" reviews becuase some people felt entitled to a free copy.			"

												I love zombie games.   This game is a lot of fun and I can get lost just doing random stuff even in this small world.  Then theres always a but...The FPS in this game is just super unstable.  I have a R9 380 and I bounce around not ""stutter"" but BOUNCE from around 60 to -30 fps depending on whats going on.   It doesn't make the game unplayable but I had this edition on my Xbox One when I still owned it and only repurchased it cause I thought I could end up playing it at a constant smoother 60fps.  That was not the case.  If you own the original and don't really care to play the DLC I wouldn't recommend purchasing this but if you want a new open world zombie experience and not too worried about story elements this one is a good buy.  Would wait for it to be on sale though.			"

												This game is exactlty the same as the non-YOSE edition, except with all the DLC included and a couple minor things, more car skins... etc.   The graphics dont look much better if at all better than the original on PC.  If you were to buy one of them definintely buy this one, but dont buy both unless you're a huge fan.  Highly recommend this game, it's been a while since i played it now and everytime i see screenshots for it i get the itch to play it and it's hard to resist it...  may be one of my favourite games of all time, and i've been playing a long time...My original review for the non YOSE edition:Longest review i've written, and i dont like long reviews but i cant stop talking about it.I recommend anyone who tried this game to play at least until you've gotten to the church, which is fairly early on. I stopped playing it as i didn't understand the point of the game or what to do. Not a lot is explained to you very well but you can figure it out over time. I get really engaged in this game and it feels very real. When your favourite character dies, they're gone forever. No loading a savegame to bring them back.In the game, you can drive vehicles plowing through hordes, gather resources, rescue survivors, change home base locations to better suit your needs and build and upgrade your base as well for other purposes. There is a storyline and a definitive ""end"" to the main game, which i was worried it didn't have at first. However, the ""Breakdown"" DLC allows you to keep playing the game forever by reaching the next level after repairing an RV each time and driving to a new location, which is just the same exact map that has been completely reset except on higher difficulty (up to level 6 i believe, afterwards it's the same difficulty).I highly recommend this game, i cannot stop playing it, and i definately recommend the ""Lifeline"" DLC as it's a new map and more of a story based timeline, with daily seiges on your base you have to defend. More ammo and supplies are available in this DLC also. You also get to drive on abandonded highways and get caught in ""Danger Zones"" which is fun too.Only problem i have with this game is you never see anyone else on the map outside their camps, no one else is ever driving around, walking around (unless walking home from a mission, even if you're there to drive them home). You friends in the game never use guns or the weapons in their hands either when fighting. A lot of people criticize the way your friends go on missions and get stuck and never seem to do anything on their own. I actually like this, it gives you more to do. The game does get a little repetitive after a while too but if you switch between the DLCs it changes it up. Another problem which is debatable, is that time passes by without you actually being game, even though it's an offline game. The game simulates the time spent offline (to a point) when you start the game next. Despite all this i'm not sure this game could be any better.			"

												One of the best zombie games today. It's not about firing zombies, it's about survival so don't expect to be firing at everything that moves because it's mostly the stealth that counts. 3rd person zombie survival game.Pros:- Good environement.- Open world.- Variety of weapons.- Fort building (not a full one, but upgradable ones).Conts:- Story could be deeper.- Open ending, not conclusive.- Dumb NPCs.

It's thrilling with the micro management supporting your homebase and helping the helpless neighbours out. The only negative thing is the laggy framrate, however is by far better than the original State of Decay version.			"

												SoD : YOSE Is one of the few zombie games that I would advise others getting just plain simply because it is just so fun, tho granted it is quite repetitive and you feel like you are babysitting your survivors all the time, the amount of times I just spam my buttons for an execution just to see it happen is unreal.I shan't lie in saying I was rather disapointed when I heard that we were finally getting a game which you could barricade things in order to survive only to find out that 3 thin pieces a wood accross a window would be sufficient and nothing else, cannot barricade doors or place massive wooden panels accross sadly... But eh oh maybe for the future. Anyway, I still play this game on and off since it is fun to drive around and kill things tho I will advise that playing with a mouse and keyboard is quite difficult, instead I recommend getting a cheap wired Xbox 360 controller or something because it is so much smoother playing and less hasle trying to find your keys or having to set them for personal use.8/10 Game.

												Bought the game with the expectation that, though some comments are negative it would still be a decent and playable game. About 40 minutes in, the game has no explanation along with constant bugs that include intense lagging at anything other than minimal graphics (I'm running a computer that can play Fallout 4 on high graphics no problem) as well as camera jumps and other things that alone do not break the game but together make the game unplayable: instructions on the many weird parts of the game (like updates on characteristics of characters I don't even know yet?) overlapping and going before I can even start to read them; when I left the map and started running I had to completly stop touching any movement key before I could do anything other than bounch up and down (?). Overall, the game isn't totally broken but the large amount of glitches and poor debugging make this game almost unplayable.			"

Even getting to the basic user config or .ini file to lower GFX settings is a pain requiring downloading third party tools to unpack odd file types etc.The above is all a terrible shame, because SOD is one of the best games ever and i spent hundreds of hours on it on Xbox360 !Only get this version if you have a rig that will just power through the lag, or the technical savvy and will to delve deep into the files and fine tune it, and even then reports indicate you may fail.Still got high hopes for Undead Labs next game, an MMO SOD apparently !Recommended purely because SOD > other zombie games.  But this PC version is bad.  Refunded, would buy again on advent of large bug fix/optimisation patch.			"

												Bottom line up front: Think a less comical Dead Rising without the stun-locking psychopathes with more than one playable character, Left4Dead-style special infected and some Walking Dead scavenging. It's no flawless diamond, but it's FUN. Don't let the ""Mixed"" rating fool you. If you look up the original State of Decay (that's not longer available for purchase), you'll see it had plenty of people praising it. Most of the negative reviews for SoD seem to be original owners who were upset they bought the special edition and found it didn't offer much more than the original.The difficulty is sneaky, and I mean that in a good way, like when you try to sneak up on a lone zombie, only to realize (too late!) that there was a cluster of zombies standing just out of sight, or when you leap out of a window to make a quick get away, only to land right in the path of a zombie horde. The tension can ramp up quick, and a moment of carelessness can result in a deadly chase.Houses that aren't cleared every so often can get infested, leading to more freaks (special infected) and hordes wandering around (and even wind up attacking your home base). To compensate, you can build outposts, set traps and recruit more survivors to defend your home. It's a fun feature and it's nice to know you can create small pockets of (relative) safety.My rig isn't high end by any means (Laptop, 5th Gen. Intel Core i3, integrated HD graphics), so I have to run it on minimum graphics, but it rarely chugs. Occasionally, a zombie will be standing in a wall, or I'll swing endless at a zombie and the hits won't register until I dodge away (not sure if that's a graphic problem on my end or a bug). That's about the worst problem I've encountered in my 20 hours of gameplay.Give it a chance, especially if you can catch it on sale.			"

												If you're into survival in general and Zombies in particular this is a game for you. With three different playstyles; Storydriven (State of Decay), level based (State of Decay: Breakdown) where you can reset the game to reach a higher difficulty in the next level, and last but not least the Military perspective (State of Decay: Lifeline) on a City map specific for that story.The story told as well as the game in general emphasizes the building of a community of survivors and the teamwork required. Despite it being a Single-Player game only, they succeed quite well in portraying the everyday struggle of a (albeit fictional) Zombie Apocalypse.However it does get repetitive, the narrative could have been expanded upon. Especially in Breakdown this becomes obvious, but if you aren't annoyed by that one issue you're free to enjoy the game on higher and higher levels of difficulty with each new level you reach. I have noticed some glitches related to the graphics, specifically the lighting and shadows which is unrelated to the game functionality and I do not know if this is a problem on my system only or a general issue with the game. It is only noticeable in the early morning hours of each 24 hr cycle so I think it's a minor issue.In Lifeline you get all the cool Military Hardware so desired in the other two versions of the game. Based on a story where a team of soldiers find themselves isolated in a City full of Zombies, their only support being Helicopter supply drops hence the name of the title; Lifeline. Once the storyline is completed you are given the option to continue playing and save as many civilians that you can find (still alive) or end the story and the game to finalize your score.Overall a very enjoyable game. It's a shame there is no Multiplayer mode, though.			"

												If you are a fan of zombie games, I'd say this is a decent go for the $12 sale price. To be fair right out of the gates, there are a handful of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ things about this game. The graphics definitely won't blow you away and it's not the greatest looking nor the best playing game out there, with numerous bugs and glitches. However. that being said. I put over 100 hours into the original, and even with all it's problems, Year One is still a good buy and decent game if you can look past the rough elements. It has decent base building, combat, and characters, and at the end of the day, you will become moderately invested in your base and the survivors inhabiting it. Overall this is a pretty fun game.

												This game is awesome. Can't even tell you how much of my life I've wasted with it, and I am, or, was, a strictly FPS/RPG Hybrid kind of guy.I recommend you skip the State of Decay ""Story Mode"" (unless you just use it for ""basic training"") and just play Breakdown. Seriously, at around level 4 or 5, I've had some fights that were ""Spartans at Thermopylea"" intense. Like Aragorn at Helms Deep, but with only  Merry and Frodo for help and no one else.....Not *real* sure that YOSE is worth it if you have the original, but, I enjoyed this game so much, I decided Undead Labs needed more of my money. Plus, sweet deal if you bought the original.There are still some very minor (too me, at least) issues. Wonky vehicle physics at times, etc. But, if a random dead guy clipping through a door ruins it for you, why are you playing this game anyway?10 out of 10, would be torn asunder by infected undead again. And again....			"

												For all of you looking for a true zombie survival game, you've come to the right place. You're going to spend a ridiculous amount of time having stories to share with your friends unfold before your eyes.The base game has an enjoyable story, though it's the sandboxy feel that goes along with it that makes this game an excellent one. You are continually capable of working toward your next story goal at your own pace, though if you're like me you'll find the majority of the game is spent exploring, collecting supplies, building up your base, dealing with other survivor groups, gaining skills for you survivors, etc. Every character has a unique backstory and there are -a lot- of survivors out there that you might run into and have join you.The base building is simple, yet very enjoyable as well. Depending on what skills your survivors have, different options are available and you have plenty of options available to you. Do you want to be able to support more survivors? Build a bunkhouse and a garden so that they have a comfortable place to sleep and food to eat if your scavenged supplies run low. Looking to cut back on the sneaking around and really take the fight to the zombies? An infirmary will keep your survivors healthy and a munitions shop will keep them well armed. Just remember, even healthy, well armed survivors might run into a challenge when facing off against the 'freaks' or special zombies.The Breakdown DLC removes the deep story aspect of the the vanilla campaign, though it adds a brand new achievement system that unlocks 'hero' survivors that, more often than not, are more capable than your average survivor. This mode also has 'Breakdown Levels', each time you complete one you move on to the next, more challenging phase, with new survivor achievements to unlock.I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the zombie survival genre. I'd been looking for a game like this for a very long time and was extremely happy when I installed it and truly learned what it was all about. Enjoy and I'd love to hear your stories!			"

												The negative reviews are unwarranted. Boo hoo, you guys had to pay for an enhanced edition of the game...they do it all the time. If people really didn't want this happening, there'd be more of an outcry for it to you know...not happen. People are stupid. This game's great, I can't wait to dive in for more. The general feel of it is nice, I get the uneasy feeling that at any moment my base could fall to pieces (and I like that for whatever reason. The combat is pretty swell, except I wish the AI companions were a bit more prone to using guns. The vehicle controls are really kinda floating and don't feel quite right but you can manage as long as you're not going too fast. The base management is a nice touch that I enjoy immensely. I also like the friendship system where you can basically befriend folks and get them to go on hunts, missions, scavenges, etc. with you. Basically, get this game if you've been interested, it's totally worth it so far for me.EDIT: I'd also like to note that I have had no bugs, so the people who are reviewing saying that...maybe Google your issue before complaining mindlessly on here. I'd appreciate it and so would a lot of other people who know this game's better than you're letting on.EDIT 2: If you're having issues on Windows 10, just do searches. People have more than likely found solutions. Use your brains before giving the game a thumbs down.			"

Now I just got this version and I'm not disappointed. I just started and I noticed a lot of stuff that I really enjoy. Still got bugs, but oh well.   Animation (Walking, attacking,different zombie walk)  Mechanic ( changed the kick of unarmed for a grab and stab attack <3 )  New cars (new cars and different colors for old cars)  New breakdown character ( character from lifeline DLC )  New icon for the map  More zombie on map   New music  New HUD  I don't know what people expected.. It's the main game just with more stuff, it's not like they were making a new game. It's just a different and better experience.			"

												Please do not be turned off by the negative reviews. If you think its a bad game because of them, you need to reconsider. The game is very good in itself, ive played nearly 200 hours of it for the xbox 360. Most of the negative reviews are only from people who are dissapointed that it is not too different from the original. The new version of the game includes new vehicles, survivors, missions, and a pretty nice graphics remake. While this doesnt add up to be TOO much content, its enough to keep the game fresh. Even in its own, the game does not get boring easily. Plus, the fact that it comes with both of the DLC for the game justs the price. Its kind of dissapointing when I see people hating against the game as a whole because the update wasnt that impactful, and they dont even realize that the price comes with the DLC included. If you have never played the game before, and like zombie games, I highly reccomend that you try it out. I got the game for 360, played 200 hours, and decided to buy it again for the PC.			"

The game ran so slow I was debating on if I was playing a really laggy game or having a three way orgy with a lonesome tortoise in the Galapagos islands. If your system can handle this game, then go for it, but if your computer still supports windows 7 then better cash out about $250 on a new laptop to play this game because just upgrading to Windows 10 won't do anything better. Instead don't waste time on that and download origin and play all 3 dragon age games while eating sugar babies because you'll get a better experience doing that than playing this garbage.			"

												First time to play this game! I really liked it. I have played many zombie games and this one has a nice mix of build base/ zombie killing/ missions/ looting/ and panic. It is not perfect as i would have liked to see more upgrades to each part of the base and outposts, better control of people in your base whom you are not plays as (send them to scout, loot, attack zombies, snipe zombies in the towers and so on, put in a few bad people/looters/raiders in the game that can shoot at you. Hopefully they will add some of these things someday. In the end. GREAT GAME, worth my money. If you have never played and like zombie games YOU WILL LIKE THIS!! Plus there is NO stupid multi-player which turns into kill everyone on sight BS.			"

												I would not recommand this game to die hard fans of zombie genre. although the base building feature might sound tempting and it gives you the feeling of walking dead-like community building, it falls short on delivering any of those things. specially the base building feature has such potential. but really falls short on actualizing this brilliant idea.yeah I think this game has so much potential. not worth buying though.

												The camera is too hard for me to understand what is going on, the angle makes it hard to judge depth and I find I always miss my swings and then get grappled. It is also independant, in the way that it does not attack the way that the camera is facing, but it still auto resets which is annoying when your trying to look around. I thought the camera would function differently, or have some settings. Its also set at your characters back straight on, so you can't see over your head or in front of you all that well. Too difficult for me to control.			"

												DISCLAIMER: I played the original State of Decay, on PC, and loved it despite all its flaws.So what about SoD:YOSE? Well, it's more of the same minus the most obvious flaws, that's mainly  the weirdly behaved renderer, which seemed to render at 720p internally, then upsampled everything to whatever resolution you had chosen, doing so without any sort of filtering. So it looks a lot better now. Still no antialiasing option in the game's menus, but you can always force that from your video-card control panel.The engine still isn't very good at streaming the world geometry in a fluid fashion, so the fps still drops significantly at times, slowing the gameplay down A LOT in the process, but that usually doesn't last for more than a second. Might also be a lot less noticeable on a SSD, I'll have to give that a try...Lastly, the quests' progression will still get stuck when some random zombies forget to get into the quest area and you'll still have to either chase them down or wait for them to despawn in order for the mission continue.In conclusion, I'd say it's not exactly the facelift I was hoping for. The graphics still look sort of dated, the engine still can't handle the size of the map (I could fit the game 8 times in RAM, but the engine insists on swapping and streaming from the HDD like it's 2008), the zombie AI still gets in the way... But you know what? It's still a great survival/resource management game, probably the best in the zombie flavor: numerous quests, some generic, some unique; nice story; great character management/progression system. Plus you get all the DLCs, which are pretty good. I'd say you get a lot of game for your money... even if some small part of me still wishes it would have been released as a free update for those who already had it, because if you only sort of liked the first iteration, I'm not sure what little changed can justify buying the game a second time. Me, I had a great time with it, and I'm having an even better time with this one.TLDR: Is it worth a buy? If you like the zombie survival genre and didn't get the original game, yes. Definitely. If you already have State of Decay, you may give it a pass, unless you really liked the game or you feel the horrible upscaling-with-worst-possible-filtering engine prevented you from truely enjoying it.

												This is not a HUGE upgrade from the original, but it is still fun.  I can't really recommend it for anyone who already has State of Decay and I'm sure much of the negativity might be in relation to that.  Since I didn't have the DLCs, this was a value to me, but if you have the two DLCs, you will want to avoid this as it doesn't add a whole lot to the experience.  I rate this as a thumbs up because it's still a good game and should be judged on it's own merits.  This is nothing more than a GOTY for a game that wasn't game of the year.			"

												As a big lover of the orginal I purchased this ""updated"" version - now if your a new player looking at this game for first time and are worried about the mixed rateing - ignore it - its mostly people made that the year one edition wasn't a bigger upgrade to the orginal then anything about the actual gamefirst I want to say - this is more a good deal for new players then a upgrade for current owners as its really the same in a new box - for new people you won't care as your getting the stuff we payed full price for a while ago for a discounted price with better graphics if you own all the dlc - don't buy this its basically same game - and to be honest they did not advertise it as a new 2.0 version they just upgraded the graphics polished it a bit and made it a better deal for new players - I own both and after playing it I'd probably have prefered this released as a dlc to the orginal but lots of devolpers do things like this and I don't regret buying it.its a fun game with beginer levels of base management - premade areas you can mildly customize by adding or removing buildings - its a fun game the stories good and large range of characters to play with - all and all a game worth the price			"

												Perfect game for anyone who loves building a team of kick♥♥♥♥♥zombie survivalists as well as feel immersed within a zombie apocalypse.I was thoroughly impressed with the amount of fixes that were made on this version of the game. I love the additions to the loyal fans and love how modding has progressed within the game.During the campaign, you look at the survival of 3 main characters. Marcus, Ed, and Maya. You find them stranded at the very start of the game. You are invited to join another enclave of survivors who are in the same position. As you progress you are introduced to new characters and the military's involvement within this apocalypse. You are constantly bombarded with quests that will allow you to help your community prosper as well as the characters you favour most but make no mistake the dead are still there.If that was too laid back and easy for you then the first edition of DLC will help you get that difficulty increase you desire. Unlike in the story, during 'Breakdown' you start off as one character with the forever loved radio girl, Lily Ritter. You are tasked with finding an enclave to take shelter in and help them thrive. While you are collecting resources and battling the dead you will be looking for an RV. A large vehicle which you can fit up to 7 survivors on to progress to the next level. As you increase in level, so does the difficulty. Introducing fewer resources for you to take home. More deadly special zombies which will tear your characters up one by one and faster zombies to make sure you are always on your toes.If that's too grindy for you and you'd like to play a story with a bit more then 2nd edition of DLC is perfect for you. Looking at the military's involvement far from the home that you are used to in the Campaign and Breakdown. In this post-apocalyptic city, you will battle your way through hordes of zeds to extract VIP's from the area in all hopes to defeat the virus. You will also be tasked on the side if you wish, to help civilians still trapped within the city before it goes up in flames.I put a lot of hours into the original game during my time on the Xbox 360 and I can happily say that the game runs perfectly on both platforms. I don't think I could find a more perfect game when looking at survival a zombie apocalypse.I recommend highly to anyone looking for a challenging experience into the survival of the undead.			"

You worry more about your group's survival; looking for resources like food, ammo, building materials, etc, that your community can use to fortify your base. "

The organic gameplay, characters and things you can interact with are amazing, there are bugs that dont do more than break immersion (so far). Its a very weak ""remastered version"" overall with the same bugs from the previous game. Basically if youl like the walking dead like game that results in perma death I do recommand this game but if you have the previous version and DLC stay away, it will most likely♥♥♥♥♥♥you off more than anything else.

												Do not understand how this review got marked a few times for not being helpful? Oh well..State of Decay: YOSE Day One Edition despite the negativity for this game due to previous owners concerns, it is a great game to play. Purchased the game while on sale and was not disappointed at all with the overall gameplay. While playing the run-through of State of Decay Year-One, it was rather challenging but yet balanced to keep up the stamina of the characters.  The Breakdown edition is very balanced as you get to higher levels. The Lifeline edition is a great story line to follow to the end twice since you need to in order to get both achievements.With the Breakdown and Lifeline DLC with State of Decay Year-One edition is great package.My personal complaints are:Lily broadcasts seems to pester a little too much at times about other tasks when you wish to secure your home site stockpiles. The way I managed to search all the buildings and it helped to level up the characters Maya and Marcus with less difficulties, is to perform those searches before entering the church at the start. After sufficiently searched and found the needed stocks, only then enter the church to continue on with the storyline.The characters and zombies can walk on water and do not swim.My personal suggestions are:The pick-up trucks and SUVs should have more available room then 6 slots since they do have more space in reality to toss the duffle bags inside. Something like 10 would be reasonable.It would have been awesome to have multiplayer sessions of the game. To have a real community together to secure resources and defenses for the home site.Would like to have seen a home site big enough to implement all the facilities that you can add for the site. It could have had a home site requirement of 20 survivors needed and 75 building materials.Having 8 outposts is sufficient but it would have been even better if they were setup as mini-sites that you could lock in survivors into position on the roof to snipe oncoming zombies and you must maintain their stock levels in order to keep up the defenses and not just placing the standard mines for the surrounding area.Even though the game map is big; it just still seems rather small after playing for a while. Having a bigger map area would have been awesome.As mentioned in complaints above but now noted as a suggestion here, the swimming ability. If you were to swim in the polluted waters (filled with dead zombies) you could get sick compared to swimming in clear waters.I could continue to add to the list but it is still a great game to play. I do hope that the developers “Undead Labs” will continue with this game and create a great series/add-ons with it with all the suggestions made from so many players listed here and their forums. Also, thank you to so many players on Steam that created great guides to obtain the achievements, it helped a whole lot.			"

												You will play multiple characters, one at a time. Straight up zombie killing fiesta and the occasional missions/side missions to keep the game going for a bit. I truly hate the constantly distressed housemates that you need to help in order to regulate the overall happiness of your base. AIs can't drive so they will walk all the way to the loot locations (guess what happens to and fro?!). There is definitely no break in between tasks for you to discover other things (that don't exist anyway). Other than killing zombies, limited upgrades on your home base and weapons, the game does not go beyond that. If you want a beautiful game and weapon varieties, you should play it!			"

												I will have to say the game has its downfalls. First the mission line is little to be had. Manny could have been expanded a little. The Wilkersons could be alot more to that (if you know what I'm talking about). As for the game play after the 4/29 update. It worked a little better in the long haul. Game mechanics work pretty good throughout the game. But over all I have to say I love this game. I just wish they would do more with it. This game could have been a franchise if done the right way. If you like killing zombies, collecting stuff, and building up your bases. This is the game for you.			"

												(Previously had a 'Not Recommended' review which was rushed and uninformative.)Graphics: 7/10Controls: 8/10UI: 7/10Audio: 7/10Story: 5/10Voice acting: 7/10Port quality: 6/10After completing the main story of the original State of Decay a long time ago, I decided to pick this up and give it a shot again (had the zombie survival itch).I got it for about £10 which is about the same price as the two DLCs for the original game, so a decent deal, considering it is a sort of Redux version of the game.As a user of a 1440p monitor, I found that this game does not support 1440p at all, no matter how much fiddling around with the settings or by using mods, it just doesn't work, yet it supports 4K? Odd indeed... but this wouldn't be too surprising (as it is a console port) if it were not possible on the previous version of the game, which it is by using a simple command. I am unfortunately stuck with playing it in a blurry aliased 1080p which ruins the graphical improvements of this version of the game. Why the ability to use this command was removed is beyond my comprehension.As for the game itself:It is a very good attempt at creating a scenario where one must survive with a group in the event of some kind of zombie outbreak. There are elements of stealth; survival; loss (of valued group members); resource management; and exploration.The game is, however, not perfect. The simple act of collecting resources can be tedious and repetitive, and it is a large part of the game, but the threat of possibly losing a very experienced survivor on any supply run does keep the tension high, at least in the early-mid game.I can’t say much about the DLCs as I haven’t played them yet.

												State of Decay: YOSE Day One EditionA better than average third person zombie hack and slash. Decent sized map, but can run out of things to do if you binge play. The two DLCs are great.

												This is by far one of the best zombie games on the market. I am really looking forward to a new release of this style of game. Possibly a larger world with more one on one interaction between survivors. Make coversations a larger part of the game. also allow for larger communities, maybe a little customization in designs for home base. It would be really cool to pick a place and try to make a base from raw resources (time being key) where you have to defend it as you setup walls, then hope your base is strong enough to defend against what comes at it. Zombie hoards and other survivors attacking it would be interesting. giving the AI more skill in self defense and attack as well as having other survivors attack your base you could be out rolling around doing missions that are so far out it takes days to get back only to come back to everyone being dead. Also allow camps to be setup for long missions that take days your buddies that are with you could stay up in shifts... maybe some of them fall asleep and you wake up to zombies eating them... some cool features this style of game has huge potential I hope to see that capitalized on.

												I never played the original, I got year one a while ago, and I think that the game offers a great post-apocolyptic zombie survival world and could be great, but the 3rd person camera control just makes it nauseating and and makes melee combat far more difficult than it should be.  I feel like I'm drunkenly flailing at everything, exhausting the character and taking unecessary damage.  If it weren't for the camera issues I'd play this game a lot.  This is so close to being a Left 4 Dead meets GTA,  ""The Walking Dead"" experience if you will, just needed a better targeting system or a FallOut quality camera/view adjust.			"

												I guess you could call me one of the 'lucky ones' as I bought the game after Undead Labs decided to rework it all and charge the people who had already bought the game once more, to be able to play the then 'new' update.The game itself is amazingly set, it suits the whole apocalypse look throughout the game very well, and It's a joy to just look at, even though the game now is somewhat 'old'. I've always wanted a zombie survival singleplayer game set just like State of Decay is, and it has everything you could possibly want. It's a game you could easily sit and play for hours on end, it's somewhat addicting and it always has things such as side missions that wants you to not stop playing.I'd say it's a 'slow pace' survival game, you chose your own path to some extent, a large extent that is, which I think is a very important plus. Overall great game, great looking game.			"

Don't let the negative reviews fool you. It is a great game and fun.Have the original? Don't REALLY need this but if it is on sale, why not grab it for the slightly better graphcs and slightly smoother gameplay.			"

												As a returning player of State of Decay with over 300 hours into the original, I felt I should share my feelings about Year One Survival Edition.  For the people who have played the original and want to know what was polished in this edition, here are the definitive improvements I have noticed so far (in addition to the more obvious changes that were made):-  Ferals are nearly impossible to hit with a car.  They have some very responsive reflexes, leaping multiple times to dodge a moving vehicle and they will jump over your car if you kick it into reverse (so no cheesy brake kills in YOSE).- Characters you've spent Influence on so they will tag along no longer run back to base when they get tired or injured, and they will continue to help out even if you take on a mission while out.  Previously, a lot of missions immediately forced them to run back to base.  I have run several missions and wiped out half a dozen infestations without my companion heading home.Edit:  A friend of mine says his follower just ran off after accepting a Scavenger mission, so there may still be some missions that auto-kick the companion.  So sad.  Did some testing of my own and found that companions tend to leave when doing missions for survivor enclaves (scavenge, beseiged, etc.) but stick around during missions for your own community.  I have run several Ally in Trouble, Missing Survivor, Zed Hunt and 'needs a talking to' missions without my companion bailing.  Hope this elaboration helps.- Juggernauts seem to have less health than before.  I continued my game on BD11 and managed to take one out with less than a clip of .22 bullets to the cranium.  To counter that however, there seem to be more of them out there (at least on higher BD levels) and I had to take out 3 of them on my first Ally in Trouble mission.- Less Bloaters.  They were everywhere in the original on higher BD levels and they seem to have had a significant population reduction.  The number of Ferals and Jugs though seem to be higher than before.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------And for some of the annoyances that still exist:- Zombies still clipping through walls.  I can see their heads but I just wasted a couple shots trying to hit them even though they are on my side of the fence.- Still getting stuck on sidewalks.- Fighting on hills can still be hazardous to your health.- Still having some trouble getting companions to get in the damn car.  Just have to drive back and forth here and there.  There does seem to be a semi-fix added to YOSE where a companion who is running in place due to bad pathing will try an alternate route after a handful of seconds and get in the car.  This is only if they are already in motion (doing the running man on the corner of the car).  A companion who is standing still will continue to do so until you can trigger a new response by moving the car a bit.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------All in all.  I still enjoy this game a lot and I hope they address some of the bugs that have existed from SOD's inception.  But for what it is, I still gave a thumbs up because those glitches were annoying, but not nearly as bad as the completely broken companion AI.  If you were a fan of the game and can look past those glitches, YOSE is still a lot of fun to play.I did have some issues with framerate, but I modified my settings to Maximum Graphics @ 1280x720 and it has become a hell of a lot smoother.  The draw distance isn't the best, but it's still a lot better than the original and the combat is much more fluid, the combat animations look much better and I love the improved variety of vehicles.Note:  I am set up in the Fairgrounds on my BD11 group so I have not experienced the returning Snyder's Trucking Watchtower problem yet, but from what I have read, it still continues to plague that home site.Edit:  I have decided to start over from BD1 on a new profile and will update this review as I progress through the breakdown levels again.

												Oh my ♥♥♥♥ing god, they demand 28€ for this?! Im surprised cause I tried it on my dad because it looked promising but..this..its just a mess, AVOIDI played 20min and saw so many bugs and then had a gamebreaking bug by the end. Before I could even play I had another bug! BLACKSCREEN while the game ran. What a good ♥♥♥♥ing game.Seriously, this game is literally in alpha. I dont get how anyone sane can play this.The whole game feels rather clunky, especially the meele combat. Only the shooting felt nice.However, you'll notice so often zombies being stuck or spawned into an object somewhere, animations that get stuck or have someother kind of bug..if you can even play the game and wont be stuck in blackscreen and change your resolution till it works and then back. Wow. ONLY TO THEN HAVE A GAME BREAKING BUG BY THE END..How my 20 min went:Started the game1.*Appreciated the main menu/background*2.Could not do graphic options apart from low to high, im not a console peasent..graphic options not avaible and the menu seems rather bad  with sliders.3.New Game4.Black Screen...3.4.Black screen..Changing graphics solution, Vsycn and such till it worked..changed it back then5. Playing the game, having a clunky meele combat with another guy6. Going into a house while having bad textures all over the place..1080 remasted version totally7. Looking arround, having everything already pointed out for me where to look for..8. Going there then scavaging one item/place literally and then following the quest to free a woman..8.1 -> During all that I killed zombies, had bad textures..when i was at the woman it went so bad, zombies got stuck in objects, could not go over simple objects and I had to squeeze myself into there too to somehow get the zombies..9. Changed to play as the woman then, gunplay felt nice10. Was at public toilets to flush down this bad game but sadly my character got stuck in the exhaust animation and then the game crashed...So hard I had to restart my PC cause altf4 or whatever did not worked anymore28€ right there, quality 100% REMASTERED...The original game must be pre-alpha then.Edit 1 / 24.2.2017So..after I was really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I tried it some more. I was actually able to play for a hour or two *yay* and my session did not got interrupted by a crash. I was able to play now till the first real village with the church and it looks like the game behaves alot better on the open world than on the scripted missions. At least I haven't seen the game placing zombies that bad again.So far it feels a little average overall, you got your ""base"" with different characters..do quests and collect supplies. The quest scripts are cool for making me teleport out of my vehicle *cough*I so far really have another big problem, or rather, its more of a game design thing. If I do have multiple characters, how is it that only I can collect stuff if I go out with someone else? At least in the scripted quest they did something as well (but actually brought nothing back that got added to the supplies from what I saw) I will check more into that again soon. Apart from that it was average, had meele combat with zombies the majority of time and I realized that some guns feel a little weak but that is at least smooth, the gore is also acceptable. Stealth seem to work as well, though better change controls for the silent kill then.			"

												This game is filled with interesting ideas, the so called ""important questions"" of the zombie apocalypse. Sadly the execution is done very poorly. It's hard to immerse yourself with the bad graphics, the clunky controls and all the glitches. But reading both interviews with the developers and news about the game, i'm confident, that they will do WAY better with State of Decay 2.			"

Good Points-Very fun and time consuming running around looting houses, Warehouses shops etc all while evading hordes of zombies-Good story-If you die, You actually dieBad points-Terribly optimized engine-Iffy graphics-Low Fps (core i7, HD7970, 8gb)What id say to this game is if your a first time player, Buy without hesitation but if you are a previous player of the original i doubt it would be worth it as i heard they didnt actualy improve much ?

												The Good:- Endless hours of fun.- Incredibly terrifying moments when you truly believe that all is lost and there's no point in going on. (Which leads to one of the best achievements involving 1 grenade and many zombies *no spoilers*).- This is a fantastic game for virtual hoarders. (I've spent more time in cars than on foot, hooning around the map picking up rucksacks just to keep my influence in check *Influence is actually a currency in the game which you will need to build or use just about anything*).- A huge modding community which enables you to change the game to suit your own personal play style. (This is a must for any good apocolyptic sandbox).- Awesone game play.- Decent sound effects and music throughout.The Bad:- Yes, the graphics are outdated, even with the YOSE version (Year-One Survival Edition).- Lilly: Your Personal Assistant to ""The End Of The World"". She's an annoying woman. Does this sound familiar to all you SOD Veterans? ""Sounds like they're in a bad spot, maybe you should lend them a hand"". Yes, the character audio gets old VERY quickly. But thankfully to the Modding Community, you can shut her up.. PERMANENTLY.- Soul crushingly repetitive quests. Go here, fetch this, kill that and save this person from themself. Again, gets very old.. very quickly.- There are many elements to this game which fell short upon release, but again.. thanks the modding community, a lot of this game has been improved. More inventory slots in vehicles and the ability to slow down (control) behaviour of the zombies is a nice touch.The Horrible:- Lilly. You all know what I'm talking about. She sure as hell doesn't have to keep reminding me that time is short on EVERY single BLOODY mission. I'll get to it ALRIGHT?! It definitely makes freedom hard to bare when you're being constantly verbally carpet bombed by an incredibly up beat woman, who realistically does SFA towards helping humanity during the apocolypse. State Of Decay 2 has been confirmed:Is there anything they should incorporate to improve on the original game? Yes. Many things. Here are some of the main things that need to be improved:- Graphics, obviously.- Sound (character or otherwise). This includes and is not limited to character dialogue.- Music.- More quests. (And a lot more variety).- More vehicles. (Modding them would be great. Let us go all ""Dawn Of The Dead"" on the apocolypse, heavy plated shuttle busses for everyone!). Oh, and for the record.. there's a big difference between putting 6 rucksacks and 6 stacks of cofee in the back of a vehicle. I'd change the storage slots to a ""Weight Limit"". It makes more sense.- A lot more base customisation. There's no need to go Fallout 4 on the game, but at least give us some nice choices.- Weapon customisation. (And more melee weapons. Firearms too if they can.)- A larger playable area. The original mad from SOD is incredibly small compared to other modern sandboxes. Think: Day Z, on a much grander scale. Show us what Trumbull Valley really looks like. - A wider variety of buildings. - Possibly destructible environments as well.- And if the developers see fit to release a similar DLC like BD, go a bit harder on the density of zombies. I loved games like Dyling Light that made you really work to get where you needed to get to early on in the game. This made for an excellent challenge and a superb gaming experience all round.And most importantly.. Co-Operative play. MUST HAVE!Yes, I have much love for the Zombie Apocolypse. Many say it's being done to death. The truth is.. you can never have TOO MANY zombies. Bring on the end of the world.I'm really looking forward to SOD 2, and I'm hoping that Undead Labs knock one out of the ball park with it. Come on guys, don't dissapoint us! (No pressure)..Final thought: Would I recommend this game to anyone? You bet I would. 8/10 for State Of Decay - YOSE.			"

												I'll start off by saying that I got the YOSE edition during the steam summer sale and it was worth every ~$8 that I spent on it. At this point I have 38 hours into it after beating the storyline, I haven't even touched the DLC yet. The best thing about this game is the gameplay, I would compare it to Left for dead with a little bit of GTA mixed in. I'll make list of my pros and cons so you don't have to read a wall of text.Pros;Very enjoyable combatBASE BUILDING with some tower defense mixed inDecent ammount of weaponsspecial combat/finishing moves that are learned over timehandful of drivable vehiclesvaried missionslarge selection of playable charactersvaried and unique attributes and quirks for the charactersa few unique zombie typesCons; I'll write a bit more on the cons afterported from console camethe game engine does not scale wellquirkly environmentstupid AIactually looks a lot like L4D2 (could be a pro or con)a few bugsno minimap interactiondraw distance waaaaay to shorttraveling becomes a bit of a chore, a fast travel system of some sort would have been niceinventory management is also a painvehicles don't feel quite rightmenus and team/base interaction is badzero character management if your not playing themI think a lot of the cons boil down to the fact that the game is a console port. I have a beefy gaming PC with a brand new Nvidia 970, 8Gb of ram, and an i5 @3.2 which can run most games at 60fps on the highest settings. That said I had a lot of issues of texture and environment pop in, really poor draw distance, and just overall very poorly optimized for PC. In fact I turned on Fraps to check my frames per second to find out that if Vsync is enabled it locks the fps at 30. The biggest problem that I had was when driving, when moving at a higher speed the draw distance issue was really obvious and the game itself would lag witch made it even harder to drive giving the amount of invulnerable objects that there are to dodge. The other big issue that I started to notice after playing for a few dozen hours was how bad the menu and management system is. There is absolutely zero character management if you are not playing a given character. In a game about survival and asset management that seems like a big oversight and missed opportunity. I imagine it was partially planned that way since many of the missions revolve around helping out or rescuing the other survivors that have left the base but it would have been was more fun to designate certain characters for scavageing roles or to be able to lock more important characters to the base. Special characters actually fill roles in the base and give your base bonuses if they are manageing the kitchen, farm, etc so it sucks to have them go out. I think I logged in one day to find all my neighboring survivors had died while I was out which kind of sucked. But realisticly in my playthrough I think I only noticed one of my survivors dieing and that was because we were on a mission together and he was torn in half by a tank mob. The last think I would mention is that there really isn't a lot of explination for the dynamics of the game. There are a lot of things happening on the map at a given time and the dispatch character will constantly be reminding you that your running out of time to take care of certain things but for the life of me I couldn't tell what the consequences of my action or inaction were. Anyway, the cons seem big but the gameplay is fun enough that you should be able to make it through the campaign without too much work. Also there are some fixes out there for for some of the problems that I pointed out, if you tweak any of your PC games then you should be able to find them. I would highly recommend picking this game up if its on sale and it is probably still worth it at full price. It certanly scratched that Left for Dead itch that I didn't know that I had. p.s. - If they skinned this game with The Walking Dead and fixed some of my cons it would be the ultimate zombie game.

												With all the negative reviews, I feel I have to do this release some justice.I have spent 110 hours on the original and 35 hours on this remastered version already.For newcomers, State of Decay is an innovative zombie survival with an open-world ""GTA""-esque vibe to it.There is no other game on the market that fills the gap like this and considering the huge modding community for State of Decay, I strongly believe that this is a ""love it or hate it"" game. I cannot stop playing Breakdown.The definitive version looks stunning remastered in 1080p with new objectives and game mechanics. You can also import your original save files.As for bugs, there are a few minor which are common to the open-world genre, but there has not been one instance where my gameplay or immersion have been interrupted and there are certainly no new bugs with this release.Having said all that, for those who did not enjoy the original State of Decay, this release will not change your mind.I advise prospective buyers to read up on the new features and watch some gameplay before deciding whether to purchase. Do not be too easily put off by the negative reviewers who were disappointed after asking Santa Claus for too many presents.Sincerely, Aslan "

												What can I say about this that has not already been said? Probably nothing, but as this was one of the games that got me back into gaming after a long hiatus I have to say something.In a gaming market saturated with zombie survival games what interested me about State of Decay was the clear George A. Romero inspiration. The zombies are classic Romero, a slow ponderous mass of dead flesh that are all kinds of messed up, and as such they often lull the player into a false sense of security with their weak, slow movements. This is their weakness but collectively this is also their strength.It is easy to forget than more than a handful of these creatures are much than a match for the average player and often while allowing yourself to get carried away it is easy to overstep and find yourself face to face with a zombie horde. The results of this are obvious and as you struggle fruitlessly for what seems like hours the end is inevitable.And it is an end. Once a character dies they are gone for good and if you have not succeeded in bringing in new survivors the longevity of your community is in real question. This fact, coupled with the need to find recourses and protect your borders, can easily overwhelm even a well organised player; leading to ultimate destruction.There’s a lot good about this game, but I am sad to say it also has a few negatives that grate on the player the longer they play.Characters are almost non existent, use of dialogue is simplistic and does not allow for much variety and the result of this is that missions can become formulaic and lack interest. This is not as bad as it seems, as the open world provides a great deal of interest in itself; but greater character development would have improved my personal enjoyment a vast amount.The worst thing about this game must be the pure stupidity of many of the character, partly this is due to the afore mentioned lack of variety but its also because the random nature of the story means that often characters take up residence in the most foolish of places.This means that the player is sometimes frustrated by the need to protect characters who are simply too dumb to care about. On occasion prompting this particular player to wish I could put them out of their misery (or at least mine).All this having been said, I enjoyed this game a great deal; in spite of some poor storytelling the game mechanics worked well to instil alternating moments of the habitually mundane and the fight-for-your-life terror that makes the game rather unusual. As in the Romero movies that I feel inspired the game, State of Decay is less about the living dead and more about how we react to them, the terror is not about death but about how we live.I, for one, am hoping that the poor storytelling and awful characterisations will either be fixed at some point with future updates or will disappear in a continuation of the game franchise.

												The story is a little under developed. You're pretty often running alone in sandbox or otherwise which is just unrealistic. The map is really bare and pretty small. It gets repetitive quickly.Game looks fine and plays well. I really enjoyed most of the mechanics. Character progression could be a more in depth.There is an influence systems which determines whether or not you can do anything outside of looting and killing zombies. This is a really LAME system. When you do convince someone to come with you it only temporary and they leave you if you start a mission. Overall the game is fine and youll enjoy a single play through perhaps more if you have the time to waste. There is a great idea hidden here in poor execution but any zombie game where it feels like you're alone doing everything is not okay. Give me more character development, more despair, more freedoms and a bigger map, and for god sake if you're going to give me a group of survivors to work with don't make them so freaking useless.Basically take the freedom and level of immersion of a game like Project Zomboid offers smash it into this game and removed a few quirky mechanics (such as influence) and you've got yourself a winner. As it is, this game has a great idea but they just didn't deliver.State of DecayProject ZomboidDayZCombined these three games with an intelligent AI system so it seems like youre living in the zombies world then you've won it. You don't really need a storyline, but give me the freedom to create my own with. This game SCREAMS for a coop or multiplayer mode. It really feels empty most of the time.When it comes down to it, the storyline isnt horrible and you'll get your moneys worth if you like GTA sytle games + zombies. The breakdown DLC is neat but really sort of time consuming and repetitive, the lifeline dlc is meh.			"

												This game rules. I can understand the negative reviews if you owned the first one. As they say they have the same thing, but for people like myself who never tried it till now, this game is great, runing over zombies and bodies and blood everywhere as bodies fling 50 feet in the air. Can be challenging at times but still fun.....watched a few of my people get ripped in 1/2 with the spinal cord showing, I was like AHHHHHHH!!!!!.....just to get another one of my characters(some lazy person that is eating my food) to watch him get riped in 1/2. Great game lots of hrs of fun.			"

												I played the original version back on the 360 and i enjoyed every minute of it. I love the base upgrades, the repairing of vehicles, the scavenging. the only thing i wish they would have implemented in the YOSE version is ONLINE CO-OP and multiplayer. They screamed that they wouldve had to re-write the coding for the entire game but we all know thats entire bull♥♥♥♥♥♥ All in all still a great game but i just wish i could play with friends. Would make things much more interesting.			"

												Let me get this straight. If your new to this then yes get it, but if you owned it before don't get it unless you never got the dlc for the original. This is a fun game with some bugs that need to be fixed and features that could use a little tweaking. One example is the cars durability. They feel fragile and after 5 zombies are run over they look really beaten up. Still I enjoy the game , but I still hope the issues get fixed.			"

												So here is the thing. The game is amazing and just like the cliche, I don't write reviews ever. I bought this game when it was released on Xbox and believe it to be one of the best games. I don't know why people ♥♥♥♥♥ and moan about bugs when the gameplay is perfect. You need to survive build and look for supplies. you need to sleep, rest, and eat. The game can get old after awhile but it is amazing to come back to. The last DLC where you play as the army is kind of constrictive because you dont have the ption to move your base arounda nd the map is smaller. However the overall experience is amazing, I would recomend this game to anyone who enjoys survival games but can't put 4 hours in at a time to get a game going. you can play the game for hours sure, but in small doses this game kills boredom. Could have better more flushed building and features, but remember this was made for the xbox 360. ++			"

												First, I want to say that I am NOT a returning player. I never played the original State of Decay, so this game is all new to me and I am loving it. I did run into one bug while playing the game, I kept crashing when trying to run one particular mission, but I ended up going back later in the game and finishing that line just fine. I bought the Breakdown DLC along with the game and I have to say, this DLC is what really makes the game worth playing. The stand alone game is really just a warm up to the challenges you face as you level through Breakdown. The stand alone game was good, just not challenging enough, so I really recommend learning the game there and then continuing through Breakdown. I have yet to try the Lifeline DLC, although it looks to be an interesting change to the story as well.			"

												I've read some of the reviews on here, and quite frankly, they are baffling to me.  This isn't a sequel.  This isn't much more than a GOTY version, in fact.The graphics are noticeably better than the original version of this game.  The gameplay seems a bit better (game is a little harder than I remember, but that could be my own perception being off).That all said, I had the first version, but had never purchased the DLC for it.  If you already had all of the DLC, this purchase might be hard to justify at full price.  For me, not having played any of the DLC, along with the minor improvements made, this was a solid purchase.			"

												First off, I ask that anyone who agrees with my review or likes it, please up vote it to help combat the people who're posting negative reviews and downvoting positive reviews to give the game a bad reputation for reasons that have nothing to do with Gameplay.If you enjoy Zombie Survival Immersion, State of Decay is the game for you.State of Decay is a Zombie Survival game that focuses on community building and management rather than pure Zombie Apocalypse Horror. You will have a group of survivors and a Home that you must defend and manage. You have to scavenge for resources such as Food, Medicine, Ammo Caches, Construction Materials, and Fuel. But you have to decide, ""am I going to be quiet and take my time searching, or am I going to search really quickly and risk alerting every Zombie in the area that I'm in this house!"", believe me, this can lead to many quick and painful deaths, which is only amplified by the fact that this game uses a perma-death system. If you die, then that survivor is dead, they aren't coming back. If you have more survivors back at home, then you can continue playing as one of them, but you won't be bringing back that dead survivor in any way.State of Decay is much more of a casual game that you can sit back and enjoy your Zombie Apocalypse with a few heart pumping moments like when you run out of stamina in the middle of a fight you can't run from.I personally enjoy this game because it has a higher level of immersion than most Zombie Survival games these days. The fact that it is free-roam while maintaining a linear progression so as to keep you moving, only adds to my enjoyment.The survivors have their own quirky little comments that can give you a giggle or even a facepalm moment for how much a survivors comment can annoy the hell out of you. It brings to life the fact that each survivor really has their own personality and brings something new to the community. Beware, vehicles can and WILL be damaged to the point of explosion. And if that happens, RUN FOREST, RUN! Because that particular big bang, will bring the hordes running for a free happy meal.In the main campaign, you start off up north in the woods, I like to call it Camping Central or Ranger Town. You're rather clueless as to what's happening because you've been outside of news broadcasts and such while out camping. You then proceed to the Ranger Station and things start to become clearer as you go, you will meet new people, and have to decide how to work with them. I'm trying to avoid too much info to avoid spoilers. After you get through the basic intro, you will be at a church with your group of survivors. You must protect them, the church and scavenge for supplies. After some time, it becomes your responsibility to move to a safer location, and eventually, leave the town to complete the campaign.In the Breakdown DLC, you're in the same town/map as in the main campaign. Only with a bit more freedom as the main campaign missions have been removed. You start in the middle of nowhere and get given the choice on how to proceed, you can start a new community as a single survivor, or you can join one of three communities that are available from the get go. Items no longer respawn in buildings once you've scavenged them (not like they do in the main campaign). And this time when you leave town, you start all over again, so be prepared for it. Because each level of Breakdown, while there's a better chance for better loot, will also increase the spawn rate of Zombies and Special Zombies. Making it harder as you go along. Giving you more replayability to scratch your Zombie Survival Simulator itch.In Lifeline, you take on the role of a group of soldiers that are trying to recover a means to combat the virus (very Resident Evil like if you ask me). You will be on a new map made up mostly of highways to get you around the map faster due to the lengthy distance for each objective. This DLC is rather fun to play once you've put a bit of time into the main Campaign and Breakdown DLC, it gives you some variety and new storyline and characters to follow.Each character in this game has their own personality, this has only been improved upon with the Year One Survival Edition. What YOSE has brought to the table is some old bug fixes for this GOTY-like release plus many other improvements such as:29 new melee weapons 29 new firearmsCleo Military Supply Drop Missions55 vehicles (34 in original breakdown/lifeline)8,275 new audio lines30 minutes new music This is not to mention the higher resolution availability for YOSE compared to the Original SoD.But the bottom line is, if you're looking for a full blown, balls-to-the-wall action game, State of Decay isn't what you're looking for. I suggest you go and play Killing Floor (Killing Floor 2 is now released as Early Access) or something similar.			"

												I don't know how to recommend this game enough. If I could impress upon you the ""why"" you play games, it'd definitely make you feel like a zombie apocolypse was something you could live through... Or not... There's just so much to this game... But here are some things you might be expecting which will dampen an otherwise fun experience...1) The graphics aren't the most amazing. They're perfect for this game, but this isn't made in the Unreal engine and it's not that type of game. It's got a lot of things to put on the screen and very few walls between them, so expect medium view distances, and lots of ""adequate"" graphics. 2) No seriously, the graphics. This was originally an indy download game on the XBLA, so it wasn't shooting for the stars. There's a lot of short cuts, like how blocky putting up baricades can be. The graphics repeat a lot, Not every limb will fly off a zombie in a unique manner, it's just not aiming for that kind of game... 3) The action isn't fast paced. It can be at times, but for the most part, you're questing in a zombie apoc world. Running errands, or looting to keep your home base in order. That's the bread and butter of the game. If you're looking for scary wall to wall thrills, you'll find this game wasn't designed for you. 4) The game isn't going to tell you how to play. There's a fun leveling up system... it won't tell you how to use it. There's a neat system for maintaining your home base... it won't tell you how to use it. If you're not willing to experiment on the game a bit to figure it out, this can be frustrating. 5) There are glitches. About 4-5 times through a straight play through... you're going to get something that defies physics. Whether a zombie runs through a closed door, A car gets trapped in a porch, or a feral zombie goes flying across the gap between you... I know it sucks, but for the most part, the game is very fun, and those errors won't dampen the experience much if you're ready for them. 6) You're determined to not like new things... If you want a game that could be described as ""Like Call of Duty with..."" or ""Like Resident Evil... "", then this is the wrong game. I've honestly never seen such a good blend of action and strategy. You're gonna have to come up with a plan for how your team gets by. And your second play through will be more enjoyable than your first. Honestly, I'm on my fourth, and it's the most fun yet. You have to learn what you can slack on, and what you can't put off. It's a unique experience, and that's probably its best quality. If you keep all that in mind, and don't forget that there's mods you can pick up on Nexus and stuff, this game is great. It's one of the only games I've bought that I keep returning to play. I play it again and again. I love the DLC... I love the alternate modes. And I love the voice acting. This game can be greatly engaging... Or it can be a disappointment, depending on if you're open to what the game is, and not what you hoped it would've been instead.			"

												I once had the original version of State of Decay, and its been a while since ive played it again. I really like this game just like the first time i played it, i love the survival aspect of the apocolops that no other zombie game has, it is not just a hack and slash zombie game, it felt like i was in a season of the walking dead. The crafting and upgrades you can do to your safe house is increadable. this game is the first zombie game that i have played that actually has consecuenses to dying, the zombies actually post a threat and when you come across a horde it is quite challenging and sometimes sadening when your character dies because they dont respawn, you just play as another character. Everything you do in this game has cocequences which can be good or bad. This is the closest to a realistic zombie survival game i have every played. If you like the Walking Dead, then you will fall in love with this game.			"

												I played State of the Decay when it first launched on the Xbox 360. I enjoyed playing it at the time, even with the many bugs it had. Now with the ""new"" YOSE, I am still enjoying the game as much as the original 360 version. Granted I did not play the first PC edition as I knew there wouldn't be much of a difference, playing the YOSE after playing the 360 version does make it seem as a similar, yet satisfactory experience. Seeing how all of the DLC is bundled together along with some small perks, the game seems fine for its price. If you already played the game recently, and expect a totally brand new game, I would advise not to get this version as you may feel ""ripped off"" as many people already stated in their reviews. However, if you have not yet played this game, or have not played since the 360 version, I would highly encourage you to pick up this game. EDIT: A recent update on 11/18/2015 added 4k support and more features.			"

												Okay just for the record all of the people below complaining about how much it sucks that they ""have"" to upgrade is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, both the vanilla and year one edition still have the same ♥♥♥♥ing functionality with the difference of downloadable content which doesn't make a difference because each campaign playthrough is different and experience-filled, I'd recommend this game to anyone who can run it and I'd recommend people to stop making cheapskate comments on the updated version, it's not like you're required to buy it is it? ;)			"

												IF YOU HAVEN’T PLAYED THE ORIGINAL BEFORE…MAYBE GIVE THIS VERSION A SHOT.If you’re interested in this title get it. If you’re looking for massive updates and polish because, you loved the original version and want to return. Don’t it's not a new game. Me I own the original on xbox360…Like it enough to buy it on PC… Read about YOSE wanted to support the games future development bought it again.A lot of potential fun to be had here…State of Decay tries its own thing with the zombie genre… YOSE does not seem like much of an upgrade to the original. I game kind of light game and haven’t had much problem with bugs. It is possible that any potential future content update will only come out for this version.  Such content would be a welcome bonus. Thanks for your time, have fun game on. "

Summary- If you don't own the original SoD, read on. The game is solid.- If you own the original SoD, this is just a minor update. Read below to find out what changed, and decide based on those and the current price tag.- Shortly after release, there are bugs. New ones. I trust they will be fixed soon.EDIT: A year later they seem to have gone. Either a fix or other changes in my PC got rid of them - for me, at least.ReviewThere are many negative reviews from people who actually like this game, just expected something more from this new release of their old favorite. To them: please remember that Steam users might decide on purchasing the game based on your reviews. Your review should be about the game, not the maker's way doing business. This game is solid. Some say this is the best single-player zombie apocalypse survival game in the Steam market. I agree with them.SoD:YOSE won't bring much for the owners of the original game though. These new features are:- High-res menu items and icons- Better lighting- One new car type (SUV)- Varied car paintings- One new hero- Many cool new weapons- Some new combat moves- Some new textures and 3D models (don't expect a lot!)- You can re-case ammo in the original campaign and 'Breakdown' too, not just in 'Lifeline'- You can find and use the military vehicle from 'Lifeline' in the original campaign and 'Breakdown' too- Some new bugs, hopefully to be fixed soon (nothing game breaking to me)About the game:SoD is a third person open-world zombie apocalypse survival game, unfortunately only single-player, where you can manage a small survivor community, build and upgrade base structures, and research new items for your ongoing combat against an unlimited zombie horde. The game has perma-death, some RPG elements, a wide variety of weapons and you can use the environment to fight the hordes too.The main campaign provides a mediocre story with a good atmosphere, and introduces you to the gameplay.'Breakdown' is a sandbox version of the main story - you play on the same map, without the storyline. You start in a random location, find and join a community, and then take on its management. When all resources were used up, or you are just bored, there is a broken RV you can fix and use to take a few key members of your community to another area. It will be the same map, with all resources respawned randomly, where you will start in a random point (from your broken down RV) and have to build up everything again. As you repeat the previous steps, the horde gets stronger and stronger, and you will receive new, stronger survivors to reinforce your team. This is my favorite game mode.'Lifeline' takes place on a new map, is more military-oriented and as such provides a different experience. It is a mixture of the previous two: there is some story, but you can decide to stay and continue saving people at an increased difficulty - with a global leaderboard.Would I recommend this game?- If you don't own the original, but like what you have read here, definitely.- If you own the original and like it, maybe. You won't get much extra, so decide based on what I wrote earlier. Or wait for a sale.			"

												If we're gonna be honest. This game is great. coming from an owner of the original State of decay. I understand why some people would be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off about the release of this game, but it's still a great game. it's a great value for what you're getting. I recommend this to anyone who Likes survival or zombie games. One thing though that I found weird is surprisingly how slow the game was running for me, considering I have a poor PC. it's not that easy to run, and to make it even worse there's little to no options allowing to tweak the graphic settings. just a minimum,medium, high or ultra  pre-setting. great game to comeback to. even better if you're new.

												Very good game. Like GTA, only with zombies :) The attention to community survival and not only lonely survivor scenario is very interesting. Although the community detail lacks in-depth it's still something new. A nice part of the game that you can change characters and one dying is dying forever with no return, but the game doesn't end - you just take role of another survivor. "

												Personally I do enjoy this game and while this game certainly does have its ups and downs, I am not here to praise or criticize this game. I am here to offer a phenomenal 4 Cheese Ravioli recipe!Here are the ingredients you will need!Ravioli Dough: 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 pinch salt, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 2 eggs, 1 1/2 tablespoons water.Ravioli Filling: 1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese, 1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened, 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup provolone cheese, shredded, 1 egg, 1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley.Pesto-Alfredo Cream Sauce: 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 cloves garlic, crushed, 3 tablespoons prepared basil pesto sauce, 2 cups heavy cream, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce.1. Mound the flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat the teaspoon of olive oil, 2 eggs, and water in a bowl. Pour half the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing the egg with the flour with one hand; use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add the remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.2. Knead the dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form the dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.3. While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling. Combine the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, egg, and parsley and mix well. Set the filling aside.4. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Pour in the heavy cream, raise the heat to high, and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the Parmesan cheese and stir until the cheese melts. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.5. Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, warm the marinara sauce over medium-low heat.6. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash.7. Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli, brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop the filling mixture on the dough by teaspoonfuls about one inch apart. Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta, pressing out the air from around each portion of filling. Press firmly around the filling to seal. Cut into individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Seal the edges.8. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot, 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well.9. Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the sheet pan and bake in the preheated oven until brown, about 4 minutes.10. To serve the ravioli, divide them among four warmed serving bowls. Drizzle the marinara sauce over the ravioli and then top with the cream sauce.			"

												So what is this game?It's a zombie apocalypse open survival game.Enough said to be honest.Story: X/10So why a X instead of a number?Well, it might be because I really don't know which mission is the story, and there's basically no story at all at the same time where there is one. The game throws a x amount of missions at the player at roughly the same time. Gameplay: 8/10The gameplay is good, really good and addictive but it ha it's rough edges. The game starts with introducing the settlement mechaninc a settlement is a place where the survivors that you found live. For them to be able to live, they need food, medication and a place to sleep. Food and medication is able be found within the world itself, while you need to build a place for your survivors to sleep. Each settlement has it's own selected areas where you can choice what you want to build. If you want to have a survivor with you, well you gonna want to do a lot of side missions so you can rise your morale in your settlement, a low morale will make people leave your settlement.Looting is a big mechanic in the game, you do it like 80% of the time. It works but it's kinda weird. For some reason rushing a looting process makes more sound than shooting a zombie with a shotgun. The ""fighting"" mechanic works more or less. Shooting feels good but actually fighting feels awkward most of the time. You need to earn fame before you can take a weapon from your settlemet, yes you can find a gun and ammo in the world itself.Music: 7/10It's nothing special, but it's quite impressive when you can hear a gun shot in the distance.AI: 5/10This is the ""best"" thing in the game. If I could earn steam money for every time where an AI used their gun instead of melee a zombie. Sometimes they shoot when a zombie is not aggresive, and making them and every zombie within 20 feet aggresive on you.Total score: 7/10It might seem like I'm hating on the game, and in a way that's true. The game is really good, but it has it's rough edges. I'm on a ""mission"" to find the perfect survival game and this game is on the top three on my list. It's funny and challenging at the same time. It could have been so much better if they had fixed some of the things that have told you about in this review.			"

												For new players interested in SOD, yes I would reccomend this to you. For the vet players who own the original SOD and are debating about buying this one, think about if the new additions are worth the price tag to you. The game itself is basicly the same except with a few tweaks, visual improvements, new characters in breakdown and some of the breakdown challenges changed.For new players:State of Decay is a sandboxish zombie survival RPG. You switch between different survivors that have their own perks and personalities and try to gather supplies to help your group survive. There are lots of different weapons to use and there is a small RPGlike skill system. For example, if you spec a survivor in using blunt weapons then when that skill levels up enough you can pick 1 of 2 attacks for the survivor to learn. With firearms depending on what type the survivor specs in you can get better firerate, longer distance lockons, etc. The game also features perma-death so if your survivor dies, they are gone for good which adds a bit of tension when your trying to escape a horde or dealing with one of the ""freaks"".There are 3 modes in the game that you can play and they are:Storymode:The one you want to start with as it explains how you play the game. You follow the story of 3 survivors and without any spoilers, basicly work on surviving and expanding your base as you help other survivors out and start learning about whats going on in the world.Breakdown:The main survival part of the game. You start out with a random survivor, pick an enclave group to join, then get to work surviving. The main goal is to find an RV and fix it up. Once you do that you pick which survivors you want to take with you to the next level and repeat. With each level resources become more scarce and zombies become more populated. There are also challenges that when you complete them, unlock hero characters which have their own special perks and bonuses. Theres a small escort quest to bring them to your base and from then on if you restart breakdown you can then choose that hero to start with instead of a random survivor.Lifeline:This mode is unique because you take on the role of the army inside a city crawling with the infected. Your job is to simply scavenge supplies while extracting key VIP targets and any civilians you find. The key difference in this mode is that after a period of time you have to fight of a siege of the infected which gets steadily more difficult as you move on.To sum it up, State of Decay ( or SOD ) is one of the best zombie games out there at least in my opinion. If you've never owned the original SOD and were interested in grabbing it, then yes I would reccomend this to you 100%. As for vet players though, I know alot of them are angry about the support being dropped for the original and they do have a right to be. Its purely up to them if they want to buy this version for only a few new features.For new players this is perfect for you. For the old vets, again just think if spending the money is worth for the extra features that they threw in.			"

												This is a really great survival/management/exploration zombie game.  It's -almost- the perfect combination of different genres.  It only falls a little flat on the looseness of it's excecution.  A really terrible quest log makes your goals confusing, with missions and morale issues popping up and disappearing quickly while you struggle to figure out where you're even supposed to be headed.  If the combat controls were a little tighter, and the management tools were more powerful, this would be a perfect zombie survival game.  Why not emulate Assassin's Creed for fighting and exploration?  And your fellow survivors are almost useless because they will only scavenge buildings when you are already there - Why can't I tell someone to take 3 people and go grab the medicine we spotted in the pharmacy last week?  What about a contruction tree, rather than vague descriptions and no hint at what you are building up to?Hopefully there will be a State of Decay 2, and it will combine aspects of tighter, more specialized games into a really fun symphony of death and destruction.  8/10 would send Alan to his death again.

												This is the first time i have cared enough to leave a review. This game is completely unplayable. Have tried on three different computers of varying specs. Controls, especially mouse, are completely haywire. Completely unoptimised- I was getting between 6-10 FPS. Numerous crashes to desktop. Flying Zombies disappearing into the ground. This game has it all. And that is from trying it for 10 mins, tried all three game modes, same result.I have literally gone back to playing the original SOD, which I already had a couple of hundred hours on and is just far superior. What an absolute waste of money for somethign that should have been a patch but instead makes the game unplayable.			"

												This review is coming from a person who has not tried this game or the previous version at all. Well, tried most of the old version at least. I downloaded the crack a month ago and I realized that the game was rigged, or in other words, has an anti-piracy gig were zombies attack you in multiple hordes every single minute. Yeah, it has like Hell. I totally regret my decision. So, I wanted to buy it, so I waited and waited. Until this version came along. What impressed me is that it has all the DLC's and includes more characters, vehicles, and extra weapons. All that for only 30$? Heck yeah! This game is awesome, even though I am a console dude. It is a must get if you are a fan of the Grand Theft Auto series with Gameplay like the Dead Rising series. And remember, instead of buying the old one for 30$, you can get this one with everything for the same price. Holla! ( It is a pity that some people can't accept an honest opinion.)			"

												It was difficult for me to give it a thumbs up. The only reason I give it a Yes is because I think that the changes they made are just barely enough for me. If you have never played State of Decay, this is definitely worth a buy. If you already own State of Decay and are considering the upgrade, I would watch some videos first to see if the changes made are enough for you to enjoy it. The graphics are nice, the UI has been improved, they've added some new weapons and vehicle skins, there are plenty more zombies on screen, and you can port your original SoD saves into the new game. That for me was the kicker, but again that is just me.tldr: If you don't own SoD, buy this right now.If you already own SoD, be wary of this purchase.			"

The graphics are a huge upgrade (less so from the original PC version and yes a lot of this could have been patched in) the new features are welcome. Performance and draw distance greatly improved too. . There are still bugs too but I've not encountered anything game breaking (yet.)It's still the best zombie survival game and the permadeath character system still makes you care.Solid upgrade and the definite version if you dont already have the orginal on PC in which case it is a personal preference.

Then start again making a good version. "

												This game does have many glitches and graffic problems; like ""occasional zombie popping through closed door/gate, or even jumping through barricaded windows"" and "" bumping into a guard rail in your favorite car causing massive damage/ random flip into the sky then rolling out after it crashes back down into a horde..."" -Whatever the case may be.Concept is strictly survival on a team basis. The game practically throws you into a situation right from the start where you help your friend and anyone else you come across to form a team of sorts. if you dont switch between members of your gang your fav characterruns out of stamina and is useless in a fight and you cant make your character rest while your playing him/her, also you home base ""Moral"" is a continuous battle because its falls to you to make everyone happy in the apocalypse.Even with all of these things the game likes to throw at you-it is awesome Harsh reality and constant threats keep even the most experienced survival gamest challeged for hours of gameplay in this huge sandbox.  the combat is more realistic to real life expectations and the ""leveling"" is purely experience with tasks or previous life knowlage. it has a lot of strong points to counter its weaker pointsafter 50 hours of playing the hardest thing to deal with in this game is the loss of your ""hero"" The first person you play as. Death is without a doubt the most annoying thing for characters you like because they dont come back theres no reloading and if the game saves you will not see that character again unless you restart from the very begining.I totally recomend this game for the shear joy of running hordes of zombies over with a fast sports car and bashing in countless skulls.7.5/10 is my take.

												Okay, something none of the negative reviews seem to understand here. You have to realize what you're buying here. This is not a new game, never was advertised as one. If you spent five seconds researching what this new edition consists of, it is essentially a GOTY edition that you've seen on a hundred other games before. For those that already have the game, there will be little gained aside from minor visual and technical fixes alongside what could be considered a slight DLC addition, the new weapons/vehicles/etc. For those that don't have the game, it's a complete steal to pick it up now.This game is as awesome as it always was. Considering the size of Undead Labs and the size of the crew that made this game, it is a very well done job. Considering the fact that I picked up the first game for $20 and this one for $20, I don't think I was ripped off in the slightest. This game is by far worth $40.To all the people that hated all over this game, let me put it this way. Does it have paid mods? Does it have microtransactions? Was it made by EA? Shut up and enjoy an amazing game that is worth every cent charged for it.			"

												So I looked over the recent reviews and thought I'd pick this game up.  Seems like a majority of the people are clicking ""No"" where it says  ""Do you recommend this game?""  But in their reviews they recommend it for new players.  So.. which is it?Anyways.  I've only spent a couple hours in the game and so far it has been alright.  Stealth attacks seem a bit clunky whenever I try to pull it off my character calls the partner over instead.  Other than that though it has been quite a different zombie game for me.  I'll probably keep playing and see how far I can get before I get bored but so far it is entertaining.Scavenging for materials and keeping morale up amongst the survivors has been pretty interesting for me.  I just wish my axe wouldn't break so easily lol.So yeah if you're willing to overlook some of the minor clunky stuff then I'd say the game is worth playing.  Hope to see an online coop mode in a sequel!			"

												Just as good as the first, however, returning fans won't get much other than some variation in weapons. New players will have a blast as all the DLC is included which provides 2 new avenues of play style (sandbox and shoot-em-up). Regardless of the little improvements to the original game, I do still recommend this game as I did the first one to my friends. Buy it and try it out. Hopefully one day this game will get the multiplayer mode that it deserves.			"

												If you don't already own State of Decay, then yes, definitely pick up one of the best single player Zombie group survival games there is.If you already own State of Decay - read up on what this edition brings to ensure that it is worth your time. The original was a PC port of the X-box 360 version. This release is the same as the first game + DLC, but Microsoft had Undead Labs update it for the X-box One and this is the port of that version. So it is primarily minor visual improvements (imo) with a few tweaks that may not be worth your extra cash at this time.			"

												This is the zombie game that I've been waiting a long time for! There are some minor bugs and the graphics aren't the best but overall it's a great experience. The zombie apocalypse is overwhelming at times, which is part of the fun and it has some elements of an RPG, which I think is awesome. Deaths are always a tragedy since characters can be extremely valuable to your survival depending on how you upgrade them and building a base that can defend against the zombies is another fun task. If you haven't tried this game, check out some videos and I'm sure they will raise your interest. No regrets on my part.			"

												Bad reviews are about the devs republishing an upgraded version of the game. Don't see the issue really. This game clearly still has the same bugs since I've encounterd them. And they got the old version which I had rather had, since this one takes a lot more from my computer's performance so I do have lag at times. But really, it's not like Square Enix is gonna give me the Final Fantasy VII remake for free either cause I bought the original FFVII back then. Guess people always gotta Q.Q about something.Anyway, the bad reviews have nothing to do with the gameplay itself. The game itself is great. After playing through both Walking Dead games from Telltale, I was looking for something similar. Not just a brainless zombie shooting FPS game. Something with a story to it. This game, has that. I can definitely see it take place in the same universe as The Walking Dead, which to me is great.You also have to make choices in this game that could lead to good or bad things, find other survivors, team up, people will die, you may have to relocate again, etc.etc. I haven't gotten too far in the game yet, but so far I am really enjoying it. If you like zombie survivals games with a story to it, or The Walking Dead games from Telltale then I think this one's right up your alley!			"

												If you have played the original game, you may be wondering if the remastered version is worth buying. There are no significant improvements to the game, it's still the same game with a few nice changes. These changes do make the game more enjoyable but are probably not worth the full price. Improvements include:-Enhanced graphics and draw distance, and new textures. The graphics aren't significantly better, but the difference is noticable.-Improved effects, with dust, fog, and fire effects...-More animations have been added. Zed's move differently, and they changed the unarmed combat.-Cleaner looking interface.-Some of the features in Lifeline have now been added to the main game and Breakdown.-A new mission type, with new special weapons.-Grenade launcher attachement and incendiary shotguns.-More vehicles and some new skins.-One new character is included (if you bought the original game).-You can now play as Hawkes, Kilo, Vince and Sasquatch. (More dialogue was recorded for Breakdown).-More music in game.-Increased number of Zeds.There are still some problems with the game. Zed's can pass through doors, and there are pathing problems (Surviors can get stuck when trying to enter vehicles).  Unfortunately there is still no support for 4k or 2k monitors. I have a 1440p monitor and I find it dissapointing (and I'm sure I'm not the only one) that I have to play the game at 1080p.It may be better to wait for a discount, before considering to buy this game. Having glanced at some of the negative reviews, I agree that this game is not a major improvement, and there are still the same bugs. I suggest you buy this game if you haven't bought the original (or you bought the base game but not the DLC). For others, I suggest you wait for a discount. I still like this game and the improvements (particularly the new mission type), but graphically I expected it to be better.			"

												To buy or not to buy, that is the question...If you own the game already. People who already own the game and who are upset with the new verison, understand State of Decay was released for xbox live and the PC, you couldn't go into the store to buy it. State of Decay year one edition actually went into stoers because of it's success and basically it's just a way to get more attention to a great game.I spent almost 240hours on the State of Decay, reaching level 13 on the Break down DLC and making it into the top 100 players. So this was an easy buy for me, just simply because I enjoyed the game so much, or too much. Now I'm on breakdown 28 or something and in the top 14 players.Improvements? The graphics are maybe 5% betterFighting seems to have minor differencesMore guns and you can craft your own bullets which improves gun playSUV's and the army truck is added from Lifeline. The cars and trucks have new skins as wellNew CharactersA bonus drop system called CLEO is in the game which is going to play into state of decay 2...You learn nothing about it.If you really enjoy the game, get it for breakdown. Being able to make your own bullets now made guns a great weapon now and you feel like this bad a$$ pulling combos than going to slow-mo and killing zombies wtih your rifle...Rifles are the only guy really worth having in the game.The game is a bit easier because of this, but also more fun. If you don't own the game buy it! If you want to go back to state of decay it's worth picking up, I bought it at full price because I'm crazy about the game, but I can see waiting for a big sale on it if you already own it.I do wish they added a different type of Zombie, or opened up a few buildings, like the movie theater you can't get in, as well as just added some extra buildings.

												It may seem a bit early in this game's lifespan for a Remaster, since there's still games from our childhoods we're waiting for (God damn you, Blood.) but it does what it says on the box. Cars handle better, combat is more interesting and less face-roll, the backup survival knife is nice, Juggernauts don't require an act of god to kill, and other than that it's a prettier version of State of Decay.If you already owned State of Decay : The ""thanks for owning the original"" exclusive Hero is pretty amazing in Breakdown, and the discount is good.If you didn't already own State of Decay : This is a great time to scoop up the whole enchilada with all the extra polish right off the bat.Haven't seen any of the bugs people are whining about. If you liked the original and still fancy playing it, there's enough mixed around in the bag to warrant another round of play-throughs with this purchase.			"

												An Excellent Upgrade to a game that has excellent re-playability.If you've never played State of Decay before but want a game that is huge in it's gameplay variations and open world area, with a true level of immersion, then this could be the game for you.Many of the Negative reviews are sadly the result of the sign of the times and many other games face this same sort of negativety. Much of the negativety is on the back of what people feel should be a freeby (no surprise there then) particularly for those who have the original version. Personally i don't see it that way, nor do i expect upgrades to be free  of charge either.So if you are new to the game and are interested in this upgraded version I can only suggest you do some research yourself. Best compare the feedback between the Original and this Yose version to see where the negativety comes from as it's not borne from the game per-se. The Publisher of the game is Microsoft, something often overlooked.Also the this Upgraded version has revised hardware recommendations - please do check them out or ask on the forums for help/feeback etc.			"

												Disclaimer: I'm reviewing this game as its own thing. IMO if you already own State of Decay and its associated DLC this is nothing more than a 1080p graphical update and is not worth the upgrade. PC Specs (just in case):AMD FX6300NVidia GTX7608GB of RAM Played on a Microsoft Xbox 360 controllerWhat can I say about State of Decay other than it is the best zombie survival game in the market. It does a number of things really well:1) Make every character feel uniqueWhile you will always start with the 3 same characters, the community members you can acquire and how you build your characters can differ tremendously playthrough to playthrough. My first go at this game (in the 720p version) is completely different than my just finished 15 hours of playthough (on the Vanilla campaign). This game rewards smart play, some characters are more suited to melee and some for gunplay and building your characters around these strengths can help greatly or you can take the added risk of building evenly on every character. By the end of the campaign, I had three characters suited for gunplay, three for melee and two all-rounders and tasked each group to specific mission types. Everyone had a backstory and I tried to incorporate this into my decision making as I roleplayed them for what I thought each character would do in real-life. Each character also suffers permadeath and nothing is more heart-breaking than watching a character you build get destroyed by a silly move in a routine scavenging mission although after one or two deaths, you'll usually know when to pick your fights.2) Simulate a zombie apocalypse. Resources are scarce and while there are ways to end up not having to worry about resource A or B more often than not you'll run short on Resource C or D (there are five in total Food, Medicine, Ammo, Materials and Fuel). These resources are also consumed as the game is turned off meaning that you'll have to log in to check on the health of your community and to scavenge what you need. Which segues well into my next point. This game requires resource management. While you may be overflowing with food, not having enough medicine to stave off the flu or materials to maintain your defenses can and will spell certain doom. Adding to that is the fact that you can and will run out of resources, so it is a battle against time to stockpile resources and find a way out. Additionally, you will need to balance your time out as well. You will need to decide whether you want to clear the path around you or pursue story or community missions or scavenge for resources. You can roleplay as the hero of the community or the leader of your own isolated community depending on what you choose.3) Combat is kinda awesomeThere is nothing more awesome IMO that kneeing a zombie's skull open, or taking an oar and beating the crap out of multiple zombies. Melee combat in this game is great! You have your attack, dodge or (as I call it) space making moves that allow you to dictate melee fights with zombies. However, get overrun and surrounded and you will die. On the controller the Left Bumper (forgot the keyboard equivalent) allows you to add more power to your attacks, dodge further and finish grounded enemies all with the added cost of more stamina meaning that you can't just spam the attack button all the time. Gunplay is tight as guns react as you'd expect forcing you to choose the range of engagements depending on the weapon you choose. Pistol's can't one tap enemies from as far as a rifle can, but rifles don't have the rate of fire as pistols do. Assault weapons are a happy medium but ammo for them is scarce and automatic firing will burn through ammo. There are plenty more weapons and I enjoyed using all of them, none of them felt particularly overpowered (though any weapon that can take a silencer should be top priority picks) and filled each niche appropriately. 4) StoryThe story was in my opinion strongly average, there are some bits where you have to fill it in with your imagination but the game's narrative is relatively realistic with well-written dialogue. Needlessly to say, this is the most subjective part and I'll leave you to make this decision on your own. In short, this is in my opinion the best zombie game out there and you should buy it if you are new to the series. Hordes of zombies can be either terrifying or exhilarating to fight against depending on how prepared you are to face them. In between all the fighting there's managing your community, resources and characters. Sprinkled on top of all this is a great melee combat system and great gunplay. The story is what you make of it honestly, I found it adequate to keep my playing and motivated to finish the game but it isn't going to win awards. Some technical stuff below.Technical stuffGraphics: Decent looking. I had everything on the Max preset (there's the Ultra preset after Max) and the game looked beautiful at times. What really detracted from the experience was the game slowdowns as you moved from area to area. It almost felt like the game kept reloading assets of the upcoming parts of the map leading to some noticeable stutter. Sound: I liked how everything in this game sounded. Zombies whether aggressive or not sounded suitably dead and menacing. The guns sounded great, melee weapon effects were also pretty good. The ambiance came together very well for me.			"

												The State of Decay: YOSE is an up-rezzed version of State of Decay. What you get in YOSE over the original is as follows:Base game and all DLC in one package.Edged Weapons now have a different basic attack animation to differentiate them from Blunt Weapons.CLEO Supply Drops that act as short events. They give you some weapons and supplies if you can collect them.The ""Unarmed"" kick has been replaced with a Knife. Fighting with a knife is more viable, but its still not as strong as actual weapons.A few new characters in the Breakdown ""Survival"" Mode.Up-rezzed textures and graphicsIts still the same great but slightly flawed game, with some minor tweaks and additions. The discounted price of reentry was worth it for me since I just so happened to feel like replaying the game anyway and I liked the new additions.			"

												Many people buying this whom owned the previous game are giving negative reveiws simple because ""it doesn't have enough new stuff"" even after the devs said this was more angled towards new people.As a returning player I find this to be an improvment, albeit a slight one, over the origional. I find that it looks better and even runs better than the previous game. Many of the bugs from the previos game still exist but I've never experienced something in either game that 'breaks' it. Also I would like to point out that sometimes bugs are directly linked to the game engine and can't be fixed easily.I will also say that the new animations make me enjoy the experience more than the previous game and I find it to be well worth the twenty I paid for it.To new players: Buy this game its one of the best zombie survivals out there. To returning players: It's up to you wether the small improvments are worth it but at the very least don't be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ about your reviews just cause it wasn't ""a whole new game"".			"

Summarized: Haven't played State of Decay before and have a love for zombie games? Buy it. Definitely worth it. Have played it before, have money to spend and like minor changes and tons of minor extra stuff? Buy it. Cause they've added a lot of new things. Have played it before while liking major overhauls or major changes? Then don't buy it. Nothing major has changed.[/b][/list]Review:I bought the original title without any of the dlc's 2 years ago and first played about 2 months ago. Then I saw that a newer, more well done version of the game was coming out.  After seeing the discount and thinking about how addicted I was to State of Decay I decided to buy it.If you're new to State of Decay or you've played the original State of Decay without the DLC's and/or you love zombie games like I do, you'll definitely like this game and it's going to be worth it if you have the money for it. It may take a little bit of getting used to but it's such an elaborate and amazing game. If you've played the original without the dlc's, it wouldn't be a bad deal to buy it since it includes the DLC's.If you're not new to the game.. It may feel like not much has changed at all OR it may feel like a lot has changed. I thinkthe texture overhaul, extra weapons, extra survivors, extra mission, extra combat mechanics, better UI and extra cars are awesome and enjoyable. Most of the game has indeed not changed, but those extra things really make it feel like it did to me.If you want to see a State of Decay that has undergone major changes, you shouldn't buy it. Cause it hasn't.			"

												It's hard weather to recommend this game or not for me. To begin, THIS IS MY FAVORITE GAME EVER. No doubt about that. I love every inch of it. It's got everything I love in video games: freeroam, zombies, guns, scavenging, base-building, leveling up, permadeath, stealth, and that's just to name a few of my favorite aspects of it.Now to my suggestion... Should you buy it or not?Well let me answer that with another question, do you have the original game or not?If you do not have this game already, get it. Get it now and don't think about any other game. This game is absolutely amazing, and in this pack, you get all of the DLC's. It's fantastic! :) You can spend many many hours playing this game without boredom (at least for me). I can do the same stuff over and over, and it's a crazy fun experience each and every time. So great.If you already have the old game, I would waste your time on this ""upgrade"" if you even want to call it that. I paid $20 (33% off for having the original) for very slightly better graphics, one or two new finishing moves, and a new character. That was not something that I was pleased about. I had the old one too, but I personally loved the first game so much, that this version is more of a collectors item for me. But from a player's point of view, if you're not 100% crazy about this game, I wouldn't waste your money.More of my thoughts on THIS VERSION OF THE GAME and a gameplay video are below.--------------------------------The graphics in this game don't seem to have improved that much. They seem like the same ol' graphics from the original, just a bit brighter and now you can see guts in detail. It's not that big of a difference.The combat had a few new added techniques. You can now slice down on zombie heads and there are some new finishing moves based on the melee weapon you're using. Which is pretty cool. You can also chop off body parts it seems. Also pretty neat.I heard there were new weapons, which I never really got to find during this 45 minute session, but I'm sure they're there somewhere. The new weapon you get from the van is cool enough, though it shoots like a normal gun.Honestly, the coolest thing for me was the new character, Gurubani Kaur. She was pretty bad♥♥♥♥♥ wielding her suppressed rifle and sword. Very cool!Would I suggest this game? Well, it depends. If you do not have State Of Decay already, GET IT. It's awesome! This version in particular will even save you money if you plan on getting the DLC's with it. However, if you have State Of Decay already, it's more of an opinion type thing. If you REALLY care about graphics and stuff, go for it. Because that's really the only major change (although the UI looks pretty neat too). If you truly love State Of Decay like I do, get it. It's like a collectors thing at this point, though.

												I haven't played the original game, but I can understand why people who bought it, and then bought this version would feel cheated. I just found out about State of Decay, and so far the game is quite good. TL;DR The game doesn't really match the complexity of other open world survival games, and the PC-port is subpar.The game is focuses more on being a sandbox. The story is very light, and dialogues brief. The voice-acting is good most of the time. Graphics are ok, but animations are quite cartoony, and there's never any really scary environments or events.The world seems kind of small, most locations are just a stone's throw from the base, and distant locations take less than a minute to drive to. Scavenging is mostly about finding special lockers (about 2 or 3 per house) and looting them. There's no way to gather natural resources, or construct makeshift weapons on your own (ie. no crafting). Focus here lies instead on maintaining base happiness, upgrading facilities and managing resources. This is not entirely obvious how it works though - the interface is clunky, uninformative and its far too easy to misclick and start deconstructing rather than upgrading, thus wasting precious resources. The interface and controls are painfully poorly ported. They do the job, but it's obvious that it was designed for a console controller, and very little effort was put into adapting it to a mouse and keyboard (even Skyrim did it better).When it comes to zombie survival games, my main go-to game is Project Zomboid. In comparison, this game is easier, more cartoony; but also more immersive with the 3D environments, has some good NPC dialogue and adequate AI. For these reasons I think this game is entertaining enough to recommend, although some better controls would make it easier to recommend.			"

												It may seem a bit early in this game's lifespan for a Remaster, since there's still games from our childhoods we're waiting for (God damn you, Blood.) but it does what it says on the box. Cars handle better, combat is more interesting and less face-roll, the backup survival knife is nice, Juggernauts don't require an act of god to kill, and other than that it's a prettier version of State of Decay.If you already owned State of Decay : The ""thanks for owning the original"" exclusive Hero is pretty amazing in Breakdown, and the discount is good.If you didn't already own State of Decay : This is a great time to scoop up the whole enchilada with all the extra polish right off the bat.Haven't seen any of the bugs people are whining about. If you liked the original and still fancy playing it, there's enough mixed around in the bag to warrant another round of play-throughs with this purchase.			"

												After thinking and breaking my mind on it i decided to buy this game.A friend recomanded it, but the reviews and forums where mostly hate.Good thing people said that it might be a good game for newcommers and they were right!Since i didnt own the old game i dont know anything what happen with it in the past, but this version atleast was great to play. I Almost played it non-stop to be honest about it.Although the graphics are not perfect its still very much playeble and doesn't give a bother at all. The game can be buggy at times but it makes it that much better. I like the fact if you die you DIE, no comming back and you lost your person forever. The story mode was alrightish, the Life Line was fine and the BreakDown has been great so far because infinite playing plus it gets harder and harder.so to sum it up: For newcommers take the bad reviews with some salt since most of them are from players who played the old version. And im glad i bought it in the end <3			"

												Whilst a very obvious console port, if you can forgive the game for it's poorer aspects (melee combat doesn't feel completely fluid, zombies don't render well at distances, blurred textures, low dynamic shadow distance), you will have a blast. Big map, driveable vehicles, lots of items, customization, base/community building. Definitely worth the price in my opinion. Far from an 'AAA' title, but it has it's own charm.Pros:*Graphics are better than original release (albeit not significantly)**Seems better optimized than the original release (from what I've tested I'm getting pretty-much a solid 60fps on Ultra)***Very easy to mod (hordes of zombies, zombies do more damage, remove lit-up containers, remove zombie radar icons)****Mods for the original game work on YOSE too*****Map is a decent size******Breakdown especially is very fun, lots of different characters, difficulty increases*******An abundance of different items, weapons, levelling********Different zombie types, adds to the excitement/fear without being too far-fetchedCons:*No anti-aliasing**Assisted-aim with a controller can't be turned off***Lootable containers (wardrobes etc) glow white, which kills immersion. Google: No More X-Ray Eyes to disable****A hunger system would've been cool, but stamina forces you to eat which is an okay compromise*****Can be buggy, can't climb on certain objects, etc******I sometimes encounter a bug where if I die, and start a new character, a sound repeatedly replays which is incredibly irritating. Restart game to fix.7/10. Not the best game I've ever played, but worth it for a cheap price. I'd happily pay £20-$30 for it. Can definitely get a decent number of hours out of it. Just don't expect perfection.			"

												There was a bit of debate and some doubt in my mind whether or not to get State of Decay: YOSE after reading a bunch of the reviews and seeing all the thumbs down. I have the older State of Decay and all the DLC for it already and I did enjoy that one greatly.I also had a few mods installed and I feel Yose adds what I already added in mods for the first State of Decay, which is a good thing. Now I don't have to add mods to get the experience I wanted with the first State of Decay. I like what they did with their zombie game, third person, having perma death, having to run a community of survivors the whole lot. I have gladly wasted many many hours. I certainly recommend the first one. If you are on the border about getting or not getting this. just go to youtube and watch a few videos and or reviews, find out with your own opinion about this game by seeing actual gameplay.After playing this one for a bit I have no problem recommending this one as well. Sure i've seen a few weird zombie glitches, maybe a zombie gets stuck or you hit C to dodge and he grabs you anyways or you swing and somehow he manages to hit you brushing off your hit as wind in his hair, not really game breaking in my opinion, makes your odds less and in my opinion more fun as I welcome the challenge of staying alive. I also noticed the zombies like to spawn pretty fast even though I dispatch a ton and feel the area should be clear they keep on coming in waves appearing from thin air right in front of me. But I don't mind Killing zombies, it's fun and gets your stats up.Most people say the game has frame drops, that it isn't optimized, the previous game ran smoother and it doesn't look better than the previous State of Decay, or it's not worth $20 for the ""exact"" same game. I have not had any of these problems. I don't know what hardware people are using. I am on a modern mid level gaming computer ($600), I have my game settings maxed out. It does run smoother, it looks better, I have no problem with any lighting or shading, everything renders fine, and there is no black border in full screen as I read in one or two reviews, I also saw that people don't like the load screens or the load screens take too long. I have not encountered a load screen that was longer than a few seconds 20 or 30 seconds if even that, at the most, besides those everything is pretty instant in my experience. All I can say about this is make sure your computer meets the requirements.Onto the $20 is too much. I like what the devs made as a game and I am willing to support them so they will continue to make more for this game, or more games in general, sure you could argue this should be DLC, there's not enough content to resell it at this price etc. I haven't gone through everything in the game and encountered every single bit just yet, but so far I have used the SUV, I have an SKS w/ 40mm grenade launcher, i've used the new melee weapons and the new character which has new animations. I like what I have seen and used so far and I have confidence I will like the rest of the game just as much if not more as I reintroduce myself to State of Decay.Conclusion: If you don't already have State of Decay and you like zombie games along with slight base and resource management, pick this up. If you want to upgrade and relive your older State of Decay adventures, pick this up.Review Update: 5/21/2015I would like to address the people who are ""stuck"" in windowed mode and have incorrect mouse coordination in game, simply hit alt+enter to go full screen and fix the mouse. Simple fix.Another thing almost everyone is complaining about the fact they are buying the ""same game"" and it's not updated enough to be worth buying again. Why is everyone so surprised when they buy it? Guess what? it IS the same game, it is remastered, aka they added slight improved graphics, textures, more weapons, characters etc. but it is still State of Decay. This is not a new game, it is not State of Decay 2. Just like when they patch an mmo. Same game with a little more than before the patch.I have not had any game breaking problems with bugs, glitches, or crashes as of yet. I played through the first two levels of breakdown and have not lost any survivors, heroes, vehicles, whatever to any bug or glitch. I have completed all my sieges and have not had any special zombies come through closed doors. No followers get stuck due to bad path finding, or die from bad path finding. I have used the incendiary shotguns and the knife fighting which are both really fun in my opinion. I have also encountered most if not all of the vehicle paint jobs and vehicle variants which I find sort of funny and nice to see at the same time. I like the new variety, but I feel some of the paint jobs are a little much, but still fun.I am still enjoying the game as I wrote in my first part of the review. and I still recommend the game if you have not owned the original or if you enjoyed the first and are buying it for a second time.

												I purchases the original and both expansions as they were released.  All very fun games.  For me YOSE was worth it for the added content and to support an indie company making a great game.  If you don't have all three games than YOSE is a must buy.  If you already own all three, than you need to decide if the added content is worth it to you.  It may not be for everyone.			"

												Great game! The only complaint I have is having to listen to the repeated nagging from the girl that sits on her fanny talking on the radio.  It's virtually impossible to become friends with her and even though all you have to do is take a look at the map, she's right there nagging you about things that should be done.  I'd love to see a Mod that shuts her up at least half of the time she would normally be reminding you about something... lolThe new feature in ""Day One"" featuring the random supply drops is a great boost and a quest worth undertaking.  Unfortunately if you have a helper with you at the time, they will jump out of the vehicle when you approach the supply drop and run home leaving you there alone to fight off 20+ Zombies yourself.  I've never been able to kill them without using the vehicle as a weapon.  However, this updated version is one that will give someone that enjoys the game many hours of entertainment.  A ""Toast"" to the Programmers that updated this game, they did a great job!			"

												I'm going to preface this by saying that I did not own the game when it first came out. This is my first introduction to it and for the price it is phenomenal. I understand all the negative reviews and they are valid as ♥♥♥♥. But if you have never played this game, I would highly recommend you get this. I have become so emotionally attached to my characters that I have felt legitimate shock and sadness when they die. I've played 40 hours and am still on my first playthrough. I have been putting off main story missions and just messing around and looting. This game is awesome. It has its issues but overall I would definitely recommend this game to someone who hasn't played it and even remotely likes anything related to zombies, especially The Walking Dead. This game is the comic/show's close cousin and it fuses a bunch of great aspects of zombie culture and gaming into a ♥♥♥♥ing great experience. 9/10 P.S. Obviously if you already have played State of Decay, DON'T BUY THIS OR YOU WILL BE MAD. The developer really should have released a disclaimer because their sheisty business practices have really ♥♥♥♥ed up this game's reviews. It is excellent if you are new to State of Decay. Otherwise it's a total ♥♥♥♥ing ripoff.			"

Seriously, it's the exact same as the Xbox 360 port only it comes with everything the Xbox One port does (because it's an XBox One port) and fixed bugs, a new character and vehicle/ weapon DLC, and unfortunately, whiny entitled reviewers who think slavery is groovey as long as they get free stuff, oh, and the best zombie game on the market with imptoved everything, except they left out coop again. Definately next time, though. I mean they aren't scam artists like the folks at 'Day Z'! Since you're already buying a finished game, not one still in alpha that was supposed to be published before the end of 2013! But using Kickstarter money for whatever the hell you want to is perfectly legal, and even if you got the best lawyers in all the land, not only would you lose, you'd have to pay millions in court costs. They tripple-dog dare you!Have fun in arbitration kiddo's, while I play the wonderful, funderful, zombie-got-rununderful 'State of Decay: Year One Survival Edition'! "

												State of Decay (including its DLC) is a great game and YOSE brings new additions to game but on release it has a few annoying bugs.If you never owned State of Decay or don't have the DLCs before this is a good purchase Yose edition gives you both the DLC with the original game.If you already owned State of Decay with all DLC I recommend waiting for it to go on sale, you wont be waiting long State of Decay has been on sale on steam over a dozen times at one point the biggest discount was 80% off. Some of the new features added to the game by YOSE include A new mission that appears in all 3 game modes where mystery supply drops appear drawing hoards of enemies, that even the most experienced players will have a challenge beating. A handful of unique skinned cars which perform slightly differently to their original including slightly faster but take more damage.  New fully voiced characters to unlock in the breakdown mode. One new vehicle type the SUV. Returning players who decide to purchase Yose will find More enemies to deal with than before being loud and reckless is much more risky. Special infected such as the Feral appearing far more frequently and in greater numbers (especially in breakdown) Ferals are now far more evasive when trying to run them down in a car Facilities in the original campaign and breakdown now have the features of making snacks and ammo. New sounds and weapons and voiced dialogue. The journal/menu is noticeably better looking with sharper images on items. New combat animations with edged weapons and unarmed combat being particularly brutal.As i said at the top of my post the game does have its bugs and some can be quite annoying a few close to game breaking. Bugs worth mentioning I had to manually set my resolution and screen aspect using the in game menu. Sometimes when alt tabbing the game goes into a windowed mode. Zombies occasionally clip through doors Friendly AI can be slow or unresponsive, especially when they really need to be. small frame drops when the game loads up the city areas as you drive into them.My Computer is running Windows 7 64bitIntel(R) Core(TM) i7-4770K CPU @ 3.50GHz (8 CPUs), ~3.5GHzNVIDIA GeForce GTX 77016GB RAMThe game runs at 60 FPS on the in game ultra settings for me almost consistently except for the brief second it takes when loading up the city areas while driving a fast car, but after its loaded its back to a solid 60 fps.I recommend this game if you haven't played State of Decay before, otherwise wishlist it and wait for a sale.

												As a new player to this game I have to say I really enjoyed the challenge that it provides. like with all things there are a couple of bugs in it like there would be for a new game that just came out but it does not affect the gameplay completely where there is major disadvantages because of it. The graphics were good, gameplay realistic with characters you play as stay dead if they die and even a new game changes the entire game as to where things and what the buildings hold, the location of infestations. time to try the other two gameplays and see what that is like. Look forward to playing more of this game			"

												I bought this game with a grain of salt as there were literally ""mixed"" reviews on the page but I am surprisingly impressed. The original State of Decay (which I own and have played thoroughly) did have some performance issues even on good rigs, especially if the ultra setting was on but the Year One edition runs at a smooth 60FPS for me apart from some hitching when loading textures but this doesn't effect my experience.This is a good purchase especially if you haven't ever played the game but even if you own the original (more so if you haven't played any of the DLC's like me) I would still recommend this. Some of the reviews aren't correct from what I have experienced, this versions performance is much, much better than the previous one and it does look a little better but personally, I would purchase this edition purely for the performance boost.Overall, this is a brilliant game and also a brilliant edition to release, the only problem that I would raise is that the discount for previous owners could have been a little more, maybe 50% but oh well, it's still worth the money.

												Worth it IF you have either never played the original or never bothered to get the xpacs. Graphically it's a huge step up but we've seen companies do this without putting a price tag on it. Everything else that has been added has been done to death by modders.If you already own the collection I'd reccomend holding off for a sale. You are basically paying $30 for improved resolution. If you've never played State Of Decay then this is definately worth every penny.			"

												State of Decay: Year One Survival Edition is an ""HD"" re-release of 2013's State of Decay, an open-world survival game very clearly inspired by the success of the Day Z mod for ARMA II. This version includes the two DLC game modes released for the original State of Decay and features improved graphics, making this the definitive version of the game.As of this writing there are many negative reviews for this new version focusing on the fact that there isn't any new content for players who already own the original State of Decay and its DLC. So first let me be clear: If you already own State of Decay and the DLC, there is nothing new for you here. However, for ""zombie survival"" fans who missed out on one of the best very games in the genre, YOSE is the definitive version and well worth the price. One need only look at the very positive reviews for the original State of Decay to see a more honest and accurate representation of this game's merit.			"

												Short Answer: Fun Game, but is just an Improved State of DecayIf you bought the original State of Decay, Do Not Purchase This, at its full or current discounted price.While this game is fun and entertaining still, even introducing a few much appreciated tweaks and upgrades, I could not in good faith tell someone to rebuy this game.That being said, if you have NOT bought the original State of Decay this is a much better version of the game, being as how it's basically a full fledged game now. I can reccomend this game, but not without some honest criticism.			"

Notice:Now understand before reading this two key facts: first and formost that I've only played 6 hours at the time of writing this. I will likely edit this review down the track if my opinion changes due to future gameplay. Secondly, that I have only invested $25 into State of Decay (paid $5 for the old one).IntroductionNow onto the review itself, state of decay is a zombie survival game. You play a community trying to survive in what ever ♥♥♥♥♥♥ walled building you can lay your hands on. The game itself is split into three gamemodes if you will: the main story, breakdown (loot the map and move onto a harder version of the map) and lifeline (I have played much of the last). GraphicsSimply put the visuals feel clearer and more polished then the original game. There are a few dodgy textures here and there that feel like temp/hold overs but with some luck undead labs or modders can fix them. Also now supports 1080p which is nice.GameplayGameplay is much the same, you'll get the same dialog as before and you'll likely ignore it now like you did the last 100 times. A few new guns have been added (least I've been told) and there seems to be a pre-order character you can play now.OverallI'm not going to go nito the debat about if this one's better then the original or not. State of Decay: YOSE is a HD remake of one of the best zombie survivals (most likely the best one) that brings this two year old classic back from the dead (no pun intended =P).What remains to be seen is what Undead labs will do with this new version of their game? Will they add more content (hopefully co-op, not holding my breath there though)? or just leave this game to rot in gaming hell (ok, that one was intended :D)?			"

												The game looks great and is fun. I like the feel and atmosphere.  Survive the zombie apocalypse and, build a small community with your fellow survivors. Go out, loot houses for food and guns.  If you like that kind of game then this is it.If you got the old SoD and are in doubts to buy this one. Then, i can't really help out.  I think it is a totally personal choice.I really liked the game and, i knew what i was getting. And the price was acceptable to me. Compared to the old version the graphics are better and, zombies look better. There are new car skins. Menu's look better.Unarmed combat is now replaced by knife combat.  Just to name a few things. There are some bugs but, i havent experienced any game breaking bugs.If you have never heard of State of Decay and this would be the first time you see the game. I would recommend checking out some more reviews and "" gameplay video's""  on youtube and then decide. Anyways this is just my opinion.  Im currently replaying the whole storyline again and, i like it.			"

												Just started playing this game after a long week of working. Definitely in love with it! The graphics are better than the original. I noticed a HUGE difference as soon as it loaded. I loved the original SOD but SOD:YOSE is worth the $20 dollars for the ""upgrade"". The new zombie animation is great. The next textures are beautiful. And the new weapons. OMG, I can't even believe how amazing this is.My only complaint is that the camera is a little harder to control. That might be because the graphics are better and I have a terrible computer.TL;DR: Love the game. It IS worth the money. But the community sucks. I've never seen a community for a game that WANTS the game they report to love... want the game to fail. Makes me sad.			"

If you are a true gamer and can overlook bugs and try to experience this game itself, then you will get a kick out of this game. I played it on xbox 360 and loved it, so i figured, hey, let's get the new version. The game is the same, but just feels better. You get so immersed in it you feel that it is a new story ever single time. You dont only do missions, you explore, build your base, clear zombies to make the area safer and so on... I personally think this version has nice graphics (BESIDES THE BUGS). Overall, if you are looking for a true zombie survival video game in which you will get fully immersed, then this is for you.

												For the current prize if you want something a bit more casual to play for a time i recommend this game. But with a fair warning that you also need some casual patience with it's performance. It's a fair price i can't complain about that.here's why:Still got a bunch of bugs in it. Optimization leaves a bit to wish for. I have crashed twice, some serious pop in and stuttering issues when entering a new area or moving to fast in a car. It's not that good of a port. Controls and UI not to mention camera can at times be frustrating but you quickly get used to it.  On average it's an okay zombie survival RPG it's not great by any means but it's heading in the right direction. And it's sort of meant to be played a little bit each day instead of sinking hours upon hours into it. This helps with keeping the patience to.Luckily if you want to spend some time on it there seems to be optimization mods around doing what the developers could not. And there is even some nice candy options to give it that nice PC master race standard looks.  "

												Read the pre release info. Decided to go ahead and get the game. Not a 100% bust, but it really needs fixes, as did the previous version. Glitches, unexpected vehicle, item, and general game issues cause me to lose more people from my community than anything else. Also, even after clearing buildings, icons still show as though something is there when the building is clear. Bonus Survivors no longer populate and the ""Saving"" feature will no longer turn off, causing lag every few seconds, making the game nearly unplayable. I waited until now to watch the forums and see what dev's do about any issues. To be honest, I have not seen much change. You got my money (twice). How about fixing the game issues and addressing the reasonable player questions?Overall, I do love the game for what it is intended - an open world Single Player Zombie Apocalypse World. A couple of things to make the game better - 1. Multi-Player (at least LAN-Based) Of course if you add Lan, Online play is right there as well.2. Expansions outside of the Valley. Let's face it, Breakdown is by far the best of the three choices. Keep expanding the Valley. If I can play for hours, killing zombies, collecting supplies, and rescuing others, I think I can skirt around a few vehicles blocking the road to leave the Valley. Maybe add a Tow Truck so I can clear it? Just a thought.3. Dont hype up what you know has issues. Fix the issues, Beta Test them with players like me, then release when it is ready.4. Workout, Take your Vitamins, and Eat Right.			"

												So, as an owner of the original game, I was pretty excited to see the XOSE Day One Edition released. Then I saw all the negative reviews, and really didn't know what to think. All the improvements tehy made (https://forums.undeadlabs.com/threads/everything-we-know-about-state-of-decay-year-one-survival-edition.47074/) looked pretty cool, but the reviews were all pretty bad. I decided to buy it nonetheless, especially since I didn't own Lifeline, so I thought ""why not?""So here is what I think:All in all, if you're new to State of Decay, go buy the YOSE, it's great. On the otherhand, if you own the original and both DLC's, I'm not so sure. All I can say is, I didn't regret buying it, but I only owned one DLC before.Technical problems are still there, but all the small changes and improvement make it worthwhile for me. Game looks better to me, I get a lot less graphical glitches, I like the new unarmed knife mechanics, I noticed some ncie new animations, Gurubani Kaur is awesome, and the overall gameplay feels the same, if not better to me. Also: blood and gore looks better now. That's really cool. I don't know if its worth 20 € for you, but I most certainly don't regret buying YOSE.I hope this helps if your unsure.Best regards and have fun smashing zombieheads :)			"

												It's a bit janky at times, with weird bugs, hit and miss voice acting, and even with the new update, the graphical fidelity is still leaving something to be desired. But behind it's rough exterior lies a well rounded singleplayer game that combines, survival, strategy and RPG elements with a dash of rougelike multi-character permadeath.			"

												One of the most enjoyable zombie games I've played in years. It ticks all the right boxes for me: RPG elements, multi-characters to play, visceral combat, zombies and tactics that make sense, open-world, survival on a large scale, decent story. There's so much to love about this game. Really easy to pick up and play. No frustrations so far other than a little pathfinding for AI characters but nothing that ruined my game yet.			"

												If you liked the first game you will most certainly love this one. This is one of the top PC games when it comes to zombie survival. I had fun with this and will continue to have fun for many more hours. You can get 100s and 1000s of hours out of it. Note that this is not multiplayer if you are looking for multiplayer. All in all this game is a great zombie survival open world RPGs.			"

												State of Decay is a great mix of 3rd person zombie action and survival role playing.   Play is fairly open as to how you go about doing things (slow, stealthy, fighting everything in sight, etc).   To me, it feels more like being in a real situation as compared to some of the ""action only"" zombie games out.  Graphics are good, I much prefer the lighting in the YOSE version compared to the original, much better for my old eyes...  There is some clipping at times, nothing worse than I've seen in other games and nothing that bothered me.  I've not had any crashes (except vehicles..hehe). I highly recommend State of Decay.   If you don't have any version yet, go with YOSE version.   If you have the original but not the DLC from the original, this is still a good deal  (if you haven't played it to death).  If you have the original and the DLC you won't get as much out of this version so it's kind of iffy.    For me, the graphics make it worth getting, but others may just mod the original and they could certainly pass on this version.Overall a SOD is a nice addition to the genre and I hope to see more from UL.

												In light of the bad reviews I've seen for this game, let me give a positive one. Disclaimer: I've only had a chance to play breakdown thus far, so I have no comments on the main game quest or on lifeline, but I expect like everything else they will be like the original.Summary:  If you enjoyed the original game, this version gives improved graphics and perhaps a tiny bit more gameplay stuff.  If you expected anything different than that, I don't know what to tell you.The game plays like the original game, because *gasp* it is the original game.  All that was promised was improved graphics and a few little tidbits to make the game more fun.  It's basically a textures overhaul mod you'd expect to see for Skyrim, except its official.I've heard complaints about the bugs, and all I can say is that they were neither better nor worse than the original game.  I'm guessing they were bugs that are driven by intricacies of the Cryengine version used be SOD, but that's just conjecture (it's all physics related and a few random crashes that honestly shouldn't happen, but I couldn't care less.)As for the improved graphics, I noticed a huge improvement.  Everything was far less dingy, and undead labs seriously toned up the lighting.  While I can sort of get the realism of not being able to see at night, I'm glad they fixed it because for me the game was virtually unplayable during 'night'; if you want to be unable to see for 50% of the game I would then of course recommend the original.They probably added new character traits, and definitely added new shirts and pants and hats.  This mixes up what sort of characters you will see and increases playability.  Similarly the vehicles were diversified and given new textures, which again makes for more replayability since there are more than 6 distinct cars in the valley.I did in fact notice the higher res textures.  The original was grainy as heck.  The menu and maps have been cleaned up significantly, which is really good.  I'm so glad they kept the physical journal interface (the game menus look like pages in a notebook) ====== very cool UI.  Plus you can now tell which item you have selected!In closing, the Year One edition is worth it if you liked the original game (or if you never played it, I suppose).  If you go in expecting a vastly different setting and feeling and a bug free game, then you'll be disappointed.  Good luck, it's a brutal game. "

												I didnt play the PC version. I bought the game when it was released on the xbox 360.  Its a major improvement from the 360 version. Better Graphics, better, resolution, smoother gameplay, plus it comes with all DLC which I never  got the chance to play. The only problem I have is the Graphics. Yes they are better but only slighty. Their faces still look like poop.			"

												Loving the game even more this time around. although it's basically the same. it looks more beautiful now smoother textures, lighting a little bit better fighting mechanics. i can see why some people could be upset because it doesn't have much more added. they basically added things from dlc over to different portions of the game we have a ton of new weapons and some skins on vehicles but i'm not upset or thinking i wasted my money. the $20 pricepoint from owning the original is very reasonable. and the $30 dollars still is also if you have never played the original. we will definitely get more dlc and they have never costed much from this company. they are trying to add more to the game but keeping the same game and putting on 360 would be a waste.

Yea, its a bit glitchy. But HELLO the original was buggy when it first dropped too. Everyone needs to put on their big girl panties and take a chill pill. Undead Labs did an awesome job. Things I love: - All the new cars (Hello...

												I purchased the original State of Decay, and I have many hours on it.I pre-purchased this game, and was amazed to see that I had 33% of the price deducted from owning the previous game! I also received an awesome in-game character, special to only previous supporters of State of Decay!I have to start of with the STUNNING graphics. Somehow, these amazing graphics run on my computer (more like a toaster, but ya know what I mean) with very little lag.The gameplay is FAR, and I mean REALLY FAR, smoother. There is no glitches that I've found (yet), which is awesome. The game actually looks epic, and the gameplay is too. While my game was downloading, I was reading the reviews, and was not feeling to good. I started to regret buying it, but now that I've played it I know how full of dog turd some people are. Whether it's your first time joining the State of Decay or you're rejoining it from the previous game, this is WELL worth the 29.99 USD (or the 19.99 USD for returning players).I'm looking to enjoy hundreds of hours on this within a couple of months.If you are looking at this game and want it, DO NOT hesitate. It's amazing. You WILL NOT regret. There is one thing about that though, this game is not for people who only have 5 minutes of game play time a day and who want to be an OP 'boss' in 2 minutes. You can't buy premium stuff, only the DLC for 2 extra game modes (Well worth the money).This game WILL get boring over time. It did for me (with the original game, but it will with this one too), but I KEEP coming back for more. So the difference between this and your mom is...well...this one costs a few extra bucks! (It's just a joke, please take no offense).I will probably be updating this comment at least once to let you know over time if this game has changed (for better OR worse), enjoy!			"

People are complaining about preformance and crashes, but I get a graphics card not supported pop-up, and that my game might crash but I have no problems with it. If you played the original, this is pretty good. If you have never played it, this is a great way to get into one of my top 5 games.			"

												I've put a little bit of time into the new version of the game and I am quite happy. I'm a previous owner of the game and all the DLC and thought it would be a great opportunity to see some of the graphics in a higher resolution with more detail. After some tweaking and some strangeness with the way the game changes resolution, I now have a great looking game running at 60+ FPS. I had no problem spending $20 for the upgrade in graphics, the truck, survivor and weapons.  Great value for more high res fun. It's a shame so many others are disappointed with this upgrade. I really thought it would get a better bunch of traction. Unfortunately, many don't share my belief that value is perceived differently by different people. This, this right here is great value. Buy it. TL;DR: Buy this version of the game if you enjoyed the gameplay in the previous version or if you really enjoy slightly deeper zombie survival.			"

It runs fine and i am yet to see a glitch. Also being a SoD vet i was playing as Marcus thinking i've already seen and done it all.

												I read these recommendations and lament; that in a world where hours are measured in dollars, I've owed thousands to this series compared with what I bought.For two years I've played from Vanilla, to Breakdown, to Lifeline - sweeping the hordes on rusted-steel saddle, with a lasso burst from gunpowder, and a mania forged from clout. I've burned, I've savaged, I've salved, I've saved, I've cried, I've praised. It is the community by which we're raised. It is the loftiness of support, it is the understanding shoulder, the irrevokable lamplight in an otherwise sullied seam...You can play your other zombie games, with an endless struggle of manacled, aging reflex against a toe-tapping slumber party of shamble crumblies with a penchant for frame-skipping in your general, meandering, stumbling, blathering direction, or you can drop that market wholesale and quaff the star motes of an untapped dream.---You take that entire genre, you break it down, and make it drown, then throw it a lifeline. Strip away all the non-essentials and see it for what it is. You take away its pretty vestments, its mini skirts and tube tops and stone-washed jeans. You strip away what society has made it, you strip away the old, superfluous tools of survival in whatever culture's theme, from the drip of alchohol to the baker's creme.Crushing down all the trappings, enigmatically removing much, towards making whole.Peeling off its Grecian idealism, its mustered motion of messosoprano Machina (Deus Ex), of lights at ends of tunnels, of softly spoken ""It'll be alright.""You take the pseudonym you once knew, you make it real, you care for it kindly, you watch it grow. You slave and love and praise its wishes, you listen to its dreams, you fight you die you live you tell you lie - from the 13th canto do these mountains rise.Until in nonchalance it's bitten, dragged home, bleeding in your bed. You swallow your tongue crying, empathetic solution's liquefaction - seeping heartward, salting now-ephemeral human wounds.You stop.Strike out!Sweep the cliffs, sweep the shallows for some poultice, for some penitent panacea - an herb, a vial, a bottle, a philosophy - anything...everything...something.Each footstep first thundered, in passion, now's a noose, each footstep strung in heart sinew, stumble's pounds to bear, whimpers come in volley, tears trailing from trebuchets, splashing hard around the ears. Til each wail's a windlass - descending downwards with a knell...cranial crevasses calmly creeping, knowing naught is all's been found.This is your world, is your misery, is your mercy shot against your once-loved friend. This is horror...is honor...is triumph...is survival...is your mind's eye into this world.			"

												I understand why there are so many bad reviews for this game. But many of those ""bad reviews"" recommend purchasing this game if you have not played the original. I agree with them to purchase this addition. Pro:1. they have updated the User Interface. Not to say the original was bad, but it was too gritty, along with much of the graphics.2. They are still updating this game. That means It is just going to get better.3. They added new content, that doesn't include the pre-orders, the bonus of purchasing the game early or the bonus of having the original game.  They added new gear. and added some characters from the last DLC to the second DLC. Cons: 1. they do have some glitches and bugs. I encountered much of them, but what makes it better is all the fun they are, much like skyrim. They are not game breaking glitches, they are just something that make you laugh. Like for example I had someone floating while sitting down. or had a zombie fly against the ground against it's back. 2. I do admit that the graphics may not be as advertised, but it is still much better than the first game. the opening background is much cleaner and more interesting then the first.  3. there was one glitch that I did encounter that was rather upsetting, but upon further review I realized I may have caused the glitch and it can be avoided. I began a mission and then immediately I started another action (searching a cupboard) that made it impossible to finish the mission. I just simply restarted and it came right back before I started the mission once again.Overall, if this game seems appealing, or at least the first one did and you are thinking about buying this game. I would recommend it. I already put around 25-40 hours into this game in a week and I am still enjoying it. I just cannot get enough from this game.  "

												A lot of people are knocking this edition because it is essentially a polished version of the original.  While yes that is true but completely overhauling the textures on a game is I am sure not easy.  The more polished look goes a long way to making the game a lot more fun.  Everything is clearer the characters models look better, and overall the entire experience is much smoother.    In the previous version the lighting was terrible at times especially around dusk and sunrise, this new version makes me feel like someone turned on the lights.Myself I was happy to pay 20 bucks for the new version and I am excited to try out the rest of the new content.

												State of Decay: Year One is basically a repolished version of the original with some new cars and guns. There is nothing wrong with that. It is marketed as a remastered version and it is. It has nice graphics that run well, less glitches than the original, and some new content. If you don't have or never played the original I implore you to get this fantastic game. It is the single greatest zombie game on the Steam market right now. If you do have the original then there really is no reason to get this one unless if you're a die hard fan like me.			"

												I didnt have SOD, so i bought SOD YOSE..ive enjoyed it so far... i can understand the frustration and anger by other gamers who should have gotten this as a patch.i fully support them and do believe that the discount they were getting to purchase this game was unfair.However, i am about 4 hours into the game,,, it is fun,, music is good, and it does work at 1080ii recommend the game but i will not be happy if they try to repackage this and sell it again...good game,but microsoft should do good towards their loyal follwers of this game...i recommend it you are new to state of decay			"

												For anyone who hasn't played this game yet then this edition is well worth picking up. State Of Decay is one of my favourite games and this new version adds new weapons, characters, missions etc as well as adding beter textures and lighting to the game (also fixing the dreaded crushed blacks some users had). If however you had the original as well as all the DLC then recommending the upgrade becomes a little harder as it's essentially a £15 patch. Personally if you were a massive fan of the game then I would give it a punt but there may not be quite enough extra content for others to feel justified upgrading.It goes without saying the game is great and I recommend to everyone but make sure you know what your getting (and what your not) if you already own the oiginal version.

												Fair play there are some issues, but honestly there aren't that many games out there without them. Everyone who thinks they're someone is but-sore because of few bugs, for me personally it doesn't take away from the fact that its a brilliant game. There is no other game like this, the detail and thought behind the game and the way you choose to play it for me makes it the best post apocalyptic survival game out there. Well worth your money, and I fully support the developers.    However why they chose not to include multiplayer confuses me, they shot themselves in the foot with that one, im sure the game would be far more popular with it included.			"

												State of Decay Year One Survival Edition is the most enjoyable single player end of the world Zombie game available. Period. Part simulation and all action the game looks good and the Gore is very abundant. The controls are quick and responsive and the fear of character permadeath keeps you on your toes. There is a bit of clipping and a few isolated graphical bugs that some people cry and complain about but these do not stop or distract from the immersion or enjoyment of the game in any way. I owned it first on my Xbox360 and then purchased it for my computer. Don't listen to the fussy detractors. They are nit-picking and looking for things to criticize in this good quality budget game. If you think you'll enjoy a captivating open world head popping Zombie smashing simulation then State of Decay might be your game.			"

												As somone who didn't buy the original SOD this game has ben great fun. There ae some problems with it for sure, such as lackluster environment textures and the controls aren't as responsive as I would like. But even with the problems the game as whole makes for an enjoyable addictive experience.I will be intrested to see what Undead Labs can create with major funding if this is what they can do with an indy budget.-ProsAddictive gameplay Emotional attachment to characters.Large expansive area to explore.-ConsLackluster texturesControls are a little clunkyClipping issues while fighting zombiesThere is a lot of hate at the moment from people who feel cheated about the original game not just being patched and having to buy the game again. I wont get my hands dirty with the argument of wether it was right or wrong. I will say that if you havent played the game at all then go for it. If you have the original then it sounds like it may not be worth your money for the small changes made.			"

												This game is what they say it is.... A remastered game with far better graphics. This is an independant studio which developed a unique product to fill a niche in the market. When they achieived great success because of the design of the product, they made money.Still independent, they elected to redo their game with better graphics. They still aren't a massive company with huge budgets, but they do care enough about their creation to want to do it right.This game is the the same unique design which the first released, but with a far better framework than what they had the capabilities of releasing before because of money.Support indy developers who buck huge companies and purchase games which are focused on enjoyment, not making piles of money.FYI, the framework is far better, so now they can release additional dlc to add lots of new content (something they very successfully did with the original.....

												One of the best survival zombie game I've ever played.  Fun and addicting. Buy this only if you never played it like me.  Its worth it.  But if you own it, maybe give it a pass unless you REALLY love it like someone I know :)I did not encountered any game breaking bugs.  Max resolution is 1080P, so if you looking to play anything higher, need some cfg tweaking like I did.  The sounds effects for this game is excellent.  From the slashing to the bashing of zombie, all add weight to them.  The DLC does add many more hours to the life of the game.  Are they fun? yes I had many hours of fun and I  never buy DLC.  This just comes with it.  overall excellent zombie game Must buy if you never own original.  Here comes the downvote haters.			"

												There's been some remarkable customer backlash over this being 'the same thing as before'. Well. State of Decay is a great game. This, right here, is a new edition of a great game. There aren't too many changes - this is, after all, a very slight upgrade which is primarily to make State of Decay available to X-Box One owners. On PC, the changes aren't too obvious, but there's a different engine running things in the background. There's a new knife-wielding mechanic for characters without weapons. There are new bits and bobs in various game modes, but again, they're marginal - new heroes, some bits of hardware from DLC being offered across all game mods, that kind of thing.The 'consumer revolt' is entirely out of proportion with what this is, and with what this is advertised as. It's State of Decay running on an updated engine - same game, significantly different back-end... but it's the same game.And it's a really, really good game. I bought it as an excuse to replay it, and I'm enjoying it. I think the developers did a pretty good job.			"

But, if you don't grab it so far it is fun, and worth it to me. Or if you want to wait for it to be on a sale. Because we know these all go down in price. While if you don't own the first one at all. You should really play it if you like GTA style games and zambies. This game is pretty much that. And you can replay it as many times as you want.			"

												While I do agree that this is how the PC release should have been to begin with, I'm not going give a negative review based on that fact as it would be petty.   Because the truth is, if you've never played this game or you own the original, I'd recommend it nonetheless.  Its the only real single-player driven zombie survival experience you're really going to find that delivers on the survival front AND gives you some interaction with the world itself in the form of other NPC survivors.While I've played 7 Days to Die (and I do recommend that game) and Project Zomboid (another great game but it still has a long way to go) and a few others, I found myself playing this one out of the batch the most.  Mostly because the worlds in those games are...well, empty currently, though I intend to revisit them when NPCs survivors are added.While the world itself is solid and interactions with it are limited (you can board up houses, establish outposts, rescue other survivors but you can't say, build an entirely new building from the ground up) it delivered what I had hoped and that was a zombie experience with some drive beyond, ""I'm going to go on and on and on..."" because while survival is fun, it is not inherently interesting if that is all you're doing (in a virtual space, mind you). Plus, the game gets downright difficult as time progresses; there are some serious heavy weight zombies that you don't even want to run into while you're driving a vehicle.  Your insurance won't cover it, trust me.TL;DRDay Z (can't blame you, its a long♥♥♥♥♥deathmatch not a zombie survival game) not your thing but you want a zombie focused survival game? Pick it up.  Already own it? Pick it up on sale because the fix to the draw distance, graphical tuning are good but not worth the full price if you already own the original and all the expansion packs.  I agree with the notion that this is how it should have been to begin with but I disagree that the developers should be ""punished"" for that, especially since they were primarily focused on a console released way back when.

												Quick review of State of Decay Year One Edition. First off I played a bunch of the original on XBOX 360 then later picked it up for Steam. In comparison YOE looks WAY nicer then the original! Cleaner textures, brighter and more vibrant. Also the FPS are leaps and bounds better then the original. I get an almost constant 60 FPS on my Alienware Alpha (i7 - 8GB version). This will be the third time I have bought this title and honestly it is worth every penny for the upgrade.

												I've seen a lot of blasting in the negative spectrum for this game. I really just couldn't disagree more. I played a LOT of the original version of this, and there is clearly a great improvement on the graphics qualities. Texturing of wood is noticeably better, and details and shadowing of characters and zombies are improved as well. The trees look fantastic (not that they were bad before.)      It's easy to hate on a game, but you won't see me doing it with this one. There are new animations, new sound effects, vehicles... the menus have been revamped (i.e. inventory)        I love it. I've experienced no glitches yet either. And if they arise, Undead Labs has always been good about fixing problems. Love it. Thanks guys!			"

												This game is a very fun game and I like it quite a lot. It's a clever idea that still holds a lot of potential, the devs could still do very much with this game especially since they just 'remastered' it.I played the original and I deffinately notice a difference with graphics and frame rate, mainly because I have a computer that wasn't exactly built for gaming. I can run the remastered game on ultra and 1080p just fine without frame drops, in comparison to me running medium to high graphics with violent lag and occasional crashes at times in the original.However this does not constitute the developers charging (quite a bit) for a remake, several bugs are still present from the original but overall it's still very nice. It would have been nice if this remake was a free upgrade to whoever bought the original and It would also be nice if the devs were to add more content in the form of updates (In all seriousness, this is a huge oppurtunity to release some more content).Overall, I'd say proceed with caution. This is still a very fun and enjoyable game. The game runs a lot smoother for me in comparison to the original and I noticed a few little changes. I'd say that if you didn't buy the original, buy this version. If you have the original, stick with that because you might be disapointed.			"

Like I said if you are new to SoD then I highly recomend this to you, but for old players I wouldn't really bother with this unless you want to support the game.			"

												I find all these negative reviews a bit unfair and misleading for the game and for new players as almost everyone base their negative review on faultered/not reached hopes and hypes. If we are to review ONLY the new parts of the game, then it's one thing. But if we are to review this as a whole game, for new and unaware players, then all this criticism are misplaced. Therefore these negative reviews is a shot to the head on a really great game.If you are new to this game and you like the Zombie/survival genre, then this is (in my opinion) one of (if not THE) the best game there is to date. You get to survive/live in a pretty realistic interpretation of a post-apocalyptic zombie-virus outbreak. Vehicles, basebuilding, team-management, permadeath and scavaging. Done in a really genial way. Even with some RPG elements!What needs to be fixed is the framrate/optimization issue. When travelling by car the game does not run very well, a problem I never had with the original. And a very personal opinion of mine, as I understand the hordes (maybe zombie overall) spawnrate has been increased. One of the (by me) strongest sides of SoD compared to other games in the same genre is that there is peaks of intensity. Your not overun 24/7, the world can seem silent and peaceful one minute and then hell breaks loose the next. I really hope it will stay that way.So. If your into the Zombie/survival genre, for the survival ideas, this is a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome game and worth every penny! Can't wait for the sequel!			"

												First impressions:When I got the game, I expected the game to play like GTA and Project Zomboid had a baby. Instead it felt more like Dead Rising and Saints Row had a baby. The graphics are similar, and the car controls are about just as clunky when it came to sticky acceleration and steering delayed by milliseconds.As far as I know, you can't loot the occasional weapon from a zombie (police/security zombie/randomly armed civilian). You have to search boxes within structures for loot instead. I don't own the original game because I got this one by mistake (I meant to get the first game), but it still plays great despite it's quirks. Not to mention killing the zombies feels great. I'm on the fence about recommending State of Decay: Year One to anybody else, but if others say the first game is better, I can't argue with it since I don't know.I'll see about editing this reveiw with an update later once I've completed the game.

But I mean, cmo'n. Why would you even bother dropping $30 on updated graphics if you already own the base game? Don't crap all over this  game because of your not-well though out choices. Anyway... this game is great. I say buy it if you don't have the original. If you do, I guess don't bother if you're overly sensitive since you're not getting that much more content.			"

As far as the graphical changes go, i notice a few little things here or there, but its no DayZ or Arma3. Also, for you nVidia users, you can activate special effects via nvidia control panel to get increased effects out of this revamp. So for future ref, dont zero-bomb a game thats only 20 bucks if you're playing on a potatoe or dont know how to configure a game on your own. Once again, I have noticed ZERO bugs and ZERO FPS loss.

												So first off, I'm not kibitzing about the YOSE - I have both the original and the remastered as it's kind of like the GoTY edition - those aren't given out to original purchasers either so I personally don't see the issue. I've played the hell out of this game and I love it even with its flaws.The game looks nice. Maybe not 2015 Assassin's Creed, Witcher 3, Dragon Age Inquisition, etc. nice but it's not terrible. The effects are overall better and I enjoy the new look a lot. Unfortunately the textures break a lot and flatten out to look very low-res. Cars handle better. Now that being said, they still handle really wonky at times. Car drives beautifully for a while and then you hit a small pebble or stick and car shoots into the air, slingshotting my character into a swan dive. Sometimes it does this for no reason at all. Textures on the cars break when my character is in them. Going from decent to low-res the second my character climbs in and sits down. There is no reason why a car sitting still should develop a case of the blurries. I do like the new vehicles UL added, they give the game a bit more variety and flavor.Some pathing has improved. Some hasn't. I still get stuck on curbs and sandboxes and anything that is ankle height. I think my characters must all have weak ankles and thus have developed a fear of short objects. Game difficulty seems cranked to 11. I started over instead of importing my save and opened up Breakdown lvl 1 (I prefer Breakdown to story TBH) and I was getting swarmed constantly. I lost one guy to a feral which is totally something that happens but a lot of survivors are getting mauled by packs of two and three zombies who glitch through doors and seem to hit like they migrated from a much higher difficulty. And OMG HORDES. Upon starting my game and moving into the Alamo, 6 hordes spawned. And each time there is a horde announcement, there are between 7 and 8 hordes. Half of these will almost instantly infest a house. It's kind of daffy. Overall however, I feel this game is still wonderful. I do wish there were more features added - more home base sites, perhaps city access like when you choose to move on in Breakdown you could wind up in a Breakdown version of the city instead of the valley - more base-building freedom (Seriously. I'm looking at all this negative space in my bases wondering WTH I can't plop a garden planter here or more beds there..) and maybe a toggle on mission frequency. (STHU LILY. I'M BUSY!) But it's still a terrific game overall and I love it just as much as I did when I first played it.			"

												This game is getting negative votes for the wrong reasons, I owned the original on PC but did not play it much as it did not feel that good,I took a risk and bought it again hoping tweaks like the new anims would improve the experience and they do.I'm enjoying it this time, Okay it's the same story but there was never any claim it wouldn't be.It is a polished version just like what they did with the Metro 2033 Redux game.If you already own State of decay and played through it this is probably not for you but if you have not played it or if like me you gave up on it the first time around due to the PC originals shortcomings then you may be pleasantly surprised,The tweaks may be subtle but there overall effect is anything but.I'm enjoying myself which is what matters.8/10			"

												From someone who has played the original SoD on 360, PC and the DLC. A majority of the negative comments are going to be from people holding grudges against Undead Labs for a ""paid upgrade"". Something people do not realize is nobody is holding a gun to your head, dont want to pay for this edition, then don't buy it, its that simple. With that said, in terms of graphical improvements, from the original PC edition it is crisper and smoother lines all around, not enough to be called a full HD remaster (IMO) but decent enough from where it came from. The gameplay is still a bit rough around the edges and zombies still bug out (gametime only 20 minutes and I saw 1 stuck in ground and another in a tree). The sound from what I heard is cleaner and the control input is smooth with no input lag (I use 360 controller).Overall I would recommend this game to someone who has never played SoD before. The people who have bought the original can probably bypass this version as your not getting much of an upgrade.			"

												I think everyone here saying it looks exactly like the original is kind of re-tarded. You HAVE to and SHOULD change it from ""Low"" to ""Ultra"" in the settings (any game you should delve into the settings before hitting play). I own original SoD and all DLC, even all modded out with textures the new one looks way better.I'ts a great game and I highly recommend it. If you are having trouble running the game with your system than, its time to upgrade from the Wal - Mart special sale computer you are running now. I run at 144 FPS smooth, dips once in a while to 120 ish.Like the original one, this one has me hooked again. I will play the p00p out of it. All the reviewers here are giving it thumbs down but still recommending it to new players. Read all the whiney reviews with a grain of salt.			"

												Great zombie survival game that makes you feel as if you are actually trying to live in a zombie filled world. I care for all my survivers and try to make sure that no one dies... because if ya die here... its perma death...Great for newcomers to the game who havn't purchased it yet!As for the overwehlming negative reviews from customers who have purchased the past dlc and such I'd like to point out that Game of the Year type bundles have been coming out for years and I have never seen as many butt hurt people. The game is great and its sad for me to think that so many people are bashing it over this. Bethesda regularly releases Game of the Year editions that include all the dlc for thier games which are full priced $60 and I have never seen this kind of outcry.Word of advice to you... allready bought it? Don't buy it! That easy! No one is forcing you to buy the ""same game"" over again. Not trying to be mean... I'm just saying some people are just being ridiculous.With that being said... don't forget to bring a frag grenade just in case you need to blow yourself up because you are being eatin alive.			"

												I had to write my first serious review just for this game,first of all i have to say most of the negative reviews on here are not even about the game or from someone who has not played.The devs delivered everything they said they was going to with this release.The textures and graphics are a big improvement over the original,the animations and gameplay have been improved as well.all the extra stuff they said they was putting in ARE in the game and so far i have not had a single bug take place.Now all the negative reviews on here are from people who are very upset they have to pay money for this release, and have started a bash attack because of it! all that is is just a bunch of misinformed people that have thrown a major fit over how the devs released this copy! So to get right down to it, as it IS yes it's a major improvement and worth the 30 bucks if you have never owned the original...is it worth the 20 bucks if you did own the original? i would say no wait for a decrease to 10 if 20 is to much for you.

												I've had this game for so long and I never gave a review.  Here we go.Let's just say the first impression of SoD is addictive.  I remember getting this game on the xbox for like $10.  I played it and had to leave the next few days to Canada on a business trip.  I kid you not, I couldn't wait to come home and play.  Then the game was released for PC.  WHOAAAAA!!!  I just had to get it.  Need I remind you, I never finished the game on the xbox.  Here I am running around building base and gathering resources.  Man the game is so much fun.  I'm following the missions and storyline just having a blast.  BAM!  Game over!  I win!  WTF!!!!!  The shortest game you'll ever play in your life without warning.  I felt like I was ripped off.  I thought this was a survival game.  Turns out it's a small tiny map and the game ends right when you setup your second base.  Total rip off.  SoD 2 I will not be buying because I don't trust this company nor do I support them.  Purchase at your own will.			"

												YOSE is State of Decay's GOTY.  And it is a damn good one.PROs:+Butter-smooth framerate and animations+Crisp graphics.  Textures are far less muddier than the original.  The world is more vibrant+UI looks cleaner+New unarmed knife combat is pretty slick+The mods I had installed have worked right away (though icons need to be edited)+Literally picked up in my Breakdown game exactly where I left off in the originalCONs:-Zombies still pop in.  Not a con for me, but worth noting for others-Still can't use the Court House as a Home!  In fact, I don't think any new potential homes were added-Still can't put a rucsac in the bed of a truck without a modTL:DERRRRRR- A great game made better.  If you're not burnt out on SoD, there is no reason not to own this iteration of it.  It does not feel like a completely different game, but it does feel like the original greatly enhanced, which was what this iteration was aiming for.  For an XBLA title, this game is really freakin' sweet.			"

												A good game and a better PC port than the original State of Decay.  Still needs a better graphics menu as at the moment there's really no way to tweak things like AA etc.  Would be nice to have these options.Performance isn't bad consideing it uses the CryEngine, but it does stutter a little bit here and there. However I haven't yet played enough of this game to give it a full on review.A few problems- There was a mission where the army had two surviors on the floor but said survivors were invisible and it looked like the soliders were talking to themselves. - Graphics menu isn't that great. We can't adjust anything such as AA.- Frame rate can vary wildly.  Although on my system this isn't game breaking its something to consider.- Car handling is a bit weird.  They seem to turn a bit slow.A few good things- Gameplay seems a lot better compared to the last State of Decay.  Doesn't feel as clunky.- Graphics have seen a decent overhual.  Looks a lot better than the previous State of Decay.My recommendations to the developers- Give us more options to tweak. The slider doesn't really tell us anything. This may even help the performance of the game for a lot of people.			"

												You will love this remastered vesion of State of DecayThe game was always beautiful to look at, but now it's breathtaking, every detail has been graphically detailed from the buildings to the leaves on the trees.The combat is much easier more fluid too, with new enhanced combat , which is needed as the difficulty of the game has been raised in the original game and both DLC'sAs the developers said, ""it is now the game, they wanted us to have back in 2013.""I have over a 1000 hours of gameplay between Xbox 360 and PC , I love the game, but always played with caution, mainly because my ppl never seemed to move quick enough in battle,I been playing YOSE Breakdown levelling up Gurubani ,  Wow I just slaughtered about 150 zeds using hand to hand combat- at the Grange . You will love playing as her, she is a thank you gift from Undead Labs, for buying and supporting the franchise over the past 2 years I just love the game and what they did with it , not fond of the loading screens but I can forgive that , it is now the best zombie survival game on the market ever, nothing will ever best it . 10/10.

												Really loved the game; still do, but I'm disappointed the graphics aren't as good as I hoped. If you haven't played the original, definitely get this one, but veterans may be slightly underwhelmed with a high powered system. I was hoping that it would display at 4K, but it is still limited to 1080 resolution on PC. (That is, cannot select a res above 1080, at all... -fullscreen launch option used to work, but now does not).Perhaps the GTA V PC remaster has ruined it for me. I would also have liked some AA settings, or any graphics configuration settings to tinker with. The only really noticable upgrade is the UI/Journal screen...gr8!Considering this remaster doesn't add much content and was marketed as a purely graphics upgrade (which is why I bought it) I am, actually, REALLY disappointed. I still recommend it though, but only if you haven't played it before.			"

I blame the blur thats put on everything.Any way, It's exactily what it says it is. And I bought it no because I expected a whole new game but because I love the game itself and wanted to support the Devs who will hopefully make another one only much better.			"

												Note: I'll be reviewing this in terms of changes compared to the original.I'll start off by saying that this IS the definitive edition of State of Decay. The game looks nicer (goodbye, harsh shadows), the animations are slicker, and the colors are more vibrant. They've added a new set of animations for ""unarmed"" (now knife) combat, which seems to include some takedown animations, which is a welcome additions. There are new vehicles, weapons, and a character. Overall, it also performs better.The only major problem I've identified so far is the fact that it lags horrifically when driving. Hopefully this will be patched, but until then, it's REALLY bad. There's also a really stupid motion blur effect when your vehicle is in motion. It blurs the car itself, and nothing else. Seriously?If you already own the game, get it. $20 for the game and its DLCs are completely worth it. If not, $30 is still the most cost-effictive way to play.			"

												So i have only played the new version of the game through the first mission and felt a review was needed. i had the original state of decay and loved playing it i had all the DLC. the game is brilliantly crafted to a nearly perfect zombie survival game.  now only reason i say nearly is you have to restart in breakdown in order to keep playing. To be clear its not even a justify able complaint as the developers were clear on the experience they want to give the player. which is why they have breakdown mode. i would  have to say if you love zombie movies, zombie games then you should get this game. if you have the original like i do and play the hell out of it, get this version its beautiful and i feel my money was well spent. i would say any fan off zombie movies or games should add this to their collection. its just a great unique experience i think all zombie and open world fans will truly enjoy			"

												Easily the best zombie survival game ever made, when you log off the game doesnt stop. Did you leave enough supplies for everyone when you quit playing, well if not you could be coming into a mess. The graphics are way cleaned up in thi sversion, all the DLC, its so worth the 20-30 bucks for all the hours you put into it. If you want a great open world zombie survival experience BUY THIS GAME NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

State of Decay: YOSE - What's new in this version?!State of Decay: YOSE is the remake for State of Decay Undead Labs worked on.What a great game, YOSE Day One Edition adds so much to the game, even if you played State of Decay and all the DLCs like I did there's still so much stuff to do, I totally recommend getting it! Undead Labs added so much stuff, if it's in new challenges and Achievements or in features like new DVR, knives, vehicles, weapon add-ons, new music, unlockable characters and more! There's even a 33% discount for users who own State of Decay if you buy until June 30, 2015 - just purchase from the account that own the original game! There's new knife animation, YES the default melee is a combat knife! good for 1v1 but not for more than 2 zombies at once! (so it's not OP and there's still reason to carry a melee weapon!) And the graphics looks AMAZING!, the developers did great job with bringing State of Decay to the 1080p. plus there's an improved lighting, textures, and shadows which makes the game beautiful more than ever before. Also the UI looks so clean and good, really love it! :D To sum up, you're going to enjoy the game so much, there's a lot of new stuff to do and much to discover! :)Reviewed on http://scop3scout.webege.com/State_of_Decay_YOSE "

												This is a great classic game title and with mods and graphics enhancements it's even better. Started out on a bad note because for some reason my gtx 950 ssc kept popping it's gpu clock speed down to 418mhz from a base idle of 1189mhz when I'd start the game. After awhile and some tweaking I was able to get it all to work fine so at the 2hr nonrefundable point that makes me happy.  I recommend getting the Year One edition, go to Nexus Mods, search 'state of decay' and search YOSE under that title and a few mods will come up. Unfortunately many of them don't work anymore, but there are just enough mods there to give the game a good refreshing. So get this if you don't mind having to spend some time fine tuning and even yelling at it a bit. It's worth it. Don't get it if glitches and squirrely gameplay get on your nerves.Edited 12/8/16: Experiencing the lock-up glitch way too often. I just can't recommend this game until that issue is fixed.			"

												Update: My issues have been addressed, changing to thumbs up.For $19.99 I got a handful of minor new features, worse (IMO) graphics with more glitches, and a host of new bugs. All of the bugs I was hoping would be fixed are not.It honestly feels like I just installed a handful of mods that (as usual with mods in my experience) destabilize the game. Things I'd hoped for: Updated textures, higher resolutions without -fullscreen, a couple more home sites, and many of the commonly complained about bugs fixed. I got none of that.I would like to recommend this game to new players but I can't.  The bugs that plagued the original version are still not fixed and yet they discontinued support for that game.  It is unlikely they will fix most of the bugs in this version too.			"

												A spectacular game!This game not only immersed me neough to loose track of the time I had been playing but it was just so awesome.

												I should probably point out that the original state of decay was the first ever open world zombie apocalypse game that I played. Long before DayZ, H1z1, etc. I put 46 hours into the original version of this game. I bought this version hoping for more, but basically just got the exact same game with updated graphics and sound and some general improvements to gameplay. If you've never played the original state of decay, I would suggest you play this... but I think the price of $30 is too much. Buy this game while it is on sale.PROS:-You are in an open, zombie infested world and can essentially go wherever you want and do basically whatever you want as long as you live. You have to rest though and the bigger your group is, the better off you are, as long as you keep supplies stocked. There is a story and you have to follow it if you want to beat the game, but technically you can just survive and explore as often as you prefer.-You can grow a garden, build a medical center and can craft sniper towers in your base. There is some customization of bases in this game and it is interesting.-You must maintain supplies such as food and medical. You can raid houses, factories, schools and collect weapons and loot.-You can recruit other AI players that you meet, or you can deny them. You can let them into your group and if they start acting crazy you can send them packing or help them. You can control several different characters in the game and can decide who you want to play as, as you go.-You can establish a base where you can build a small community of survivors.-There are vehicles throughout the world you can take and drive. You can use the trunk to stash extra supplies to transport to your base. Driving around in this game feels a lot like the open AI world of Grand Theft Auto-Different types of zombies provide various levels of challenge to kill. Sometimes hoardes come upon you while you are raiding a house for loot and you end up having to barricade yourself inside ""Night of the Living Dead"" style.-The story, acting and soundtrack are all excellent. They keep you interested and engaged in the game.CONS:-There is no online mode. You cannot play co-op or with anyone online. This is a single player game only. This is a massive strike for some people, but understand that this is still a great game without online.-You have to play this game in 3rd person. There is no option for 1st person.-There is no way to customize your characters. You have to play as the survivors on the game. Lack of customization. You can techincally mod the game unofficially, but it can cause crash problems.-The map lacks very large structures to loot inside of, such as a large hospital or large schoolhouse. You spend most of your time looting houses and small shacks or warehouses.-There are no real destructable environments. Sure houses burn down and cars explode... but that's about it. You can't pull a fire axe out and chop a hole into a wooden house.			"

												After 4 hours of play I already have a love/hate attitude for the game. Concept is good, but events thus far have felt very scripted for an ""open"" game world. Graphics are decent, love how my laptop is able to stay relatively cool while running. Shooting and targeting objects appears to be fluid for distant combat, but melee combat turns into an inchorent, frantic button mash (there doesn't appear to be any visual targeting for melee like there is for ranged fighting). Had to adjust the mouse sensitivity big time.  My character gets ""sucked"" into animation sequences during melee combat which kind of sucks (kind of like a RB in an older Madden game getting hit by a defensive lineman, animation sequences once triggered appear to have no way to get out of) There is a dodge button somewhere but there is no tutorial or message on that feature, it's something you'd have to look up in the controls. There are help messages for some of the controls but it's the basic ones over and over again thus far. The death sequences are well done, gets kind of addictive splattering zombie brains. The bad is that zombies tend to spawn in the middle of walls and fences, while also having a terrible respawn script running. You'll be walking in a forest and all of a sudden a zombie will respawn right next to you. You'll clear an area out only to have zombies magically reappear instead of them walking to the area from an offmap starting point. The UI has a good layout but terrible functionality attached to the buttons. Easy to accidently purchase a feature with your influence currency, particularl when you're starting out and learning the controls... which leads me to saving. There is no save functionality. It's all automated. Which doesn't work for the flow of the game. You'll want to be slow and quiet, which means you'll have spent many minutes/hours of playing and need to go do something  in real life yet there is  no way to save except for reaching end of missions and ""magical"" save points. Getting in a car is no fun whatsoever. The controls are bad, and it doesn't even feel like you're driving a vehicle on earth, it's more like piloting a paper airplane in space. It's been fun to level up a character, but the inability to not switch to other members in the group until the game decides it's ok is very annoying. I would purchase the game again for the $30 price, overall experience has been 75-83 range on a 100 scale, it's just really disappointing that some of the features are the way they are...And probably would have been♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at anything more then that. (Have not purchased played the earlier version which is no longer available, this has been my first experience). If I could give a sideways thumbs I would, but will go with thumbs up, there's been enough good to overcome the shortcomings thus far.			"

												So where to begin, State of Decay is flawed and depending on the kind of person you are these flaws are fairly easily overlooked for a period of time until things kick in with force so for now the simple pro's and con's of the game before further elaboration:Pro's:- Lots of characters and the DLC only adds to that across 3 scenarios (SoD, Breakdown and Lifeline)- Good base building actiongs albeit a touch limited- Weapon diversity, even if it pretty much boils down to guns, melee and throwable- A fair bit to do if you're a 100% completion person as some of the challenges are more time comsuming than they are hardCon's:- Whilst the action is good to begin with and the whole concept of the game is great (in my opinion) after the first 20-30 hours it's very much the same ""get this"" ""save that person"" ""go here"" type of quests- AI is as dull as a sack of hammers and in the Breakdown DLC (as far as I've seen) the AI doesn't use firearms unless they're in the watch tower at base- You have to do pretty much everything yourself (see above for partial explaination) as the AI doesn't simply go out in force and search for you whilst you're away over the hill putting a slug between a zombies eyes- The bugs, whilst not as bad as people make it out to be, I've had some serious ""wut?"" moments like driving down a road only for the car to hit something and over turn leaving my character hurt, carless and the ensuring explsion luring everything undead in for a good 500 metersDespite everything this game is easily one of the more enjoyable games I've had a chance to play over the years, whilst not perfect is a solid basis for the series as State of Decay 2 is meant to be in the works. I won't try to play down the bugs as they can be a royal pain or a source of amusement but in literal sense if you're unlucky a bug in game can be the difference between your best survivor making it home goodies and all or being torn in 2 by a freak class zombie. The core game play itself is solid if a bit rinse and repeat after a while, the DLC alters a few things with the likes of lifeline but its very much of a sameness but with a military setting. Breakdown isn't exactly hard as it is trying, as you progress levels you'll get less resources and more zombies / freaks as a result giving what I feel is a false sense of difficulty as they all take the same damage and dish it out but the sheer volume causes the fight or flight moments.TL;DRAs a whole the game is good, not perfect, but decent enough to keep a zombie fan interested for a while. Anyone with a short attention span may want to avoid it however base builders and to an extent RPS players may enjoy it for its limited RPG like character stats. 7.5/10			"

												A few bugs (e.g. ombies suddenly teleporting through closed doors), but they aren't enough to distract me from what is a thoroughly enjoyable game. Other reviews have drawn parallels with the Walking Dead. I can see why. but don't expect this game to be as strongly character-driven as that. Each character does have unique characteristics and traits, but they don't seem to have much actual impact on my tactics or weapons loadout. So long as you're a bit cautious (i.e. don't dive into a horde with just a crowbar to hand and expect to walk away - although it can be done) you can manage to deal with most situations using any character. There are exceptions like the military being more receptive to characters with a military background.DLC - Breakdown is more of a sandbox version focussing solely on survival.Lifeline is focussed on a different, more urban map where you play as the military who end up cut off from supply and reinforcement, so you need to balance progress against survival with dwindling loadout of the chunky weapons you start off with. Different enough to add a lot of additional gameplay and enjoyment.Definitely worth a play.			"

They keep you interested and engaged in the game.CONS:-There is no online mode. You cannot play co-op or with anyone online. This is a single player game only. This is a massive strike for some people, but understand that this is still a great game without online.-You have to play this game in 3rd person. There is no option for 1st person.-There is no way to customize your characters. You have to play as the survivors on the game. Lack of customization. You can techincally mod the game unofficially, but it can cause crash problems.-The map lacks very large structures to loot inside of, such as a large hospital or large schoolhouse. You spend most of your time looting houses and small shacks or warehouses.-There are no real destructable environments. Sure houses burn down and cars explode... but that's about it. You can't pull a fire axe out and chop a hole into a wooden house.			"

												This is a good game with core elements that I really hope the developers build upon in State of Decay 2. It's best features are that there is a lot going on - you feel like you have to keep up with various responsibilities, like keeping your base's resources up, ensuring your survivors are happy with each other, saving your neighbours and recruiting more people. The zombies also come in force - it feels like the zombies scale well in number, although cars are overpowered when it comes to mowing them down (if I drove through a group of humans my car would be totalled and I'd probably be injured in the process = here you can slice through a horde of zombies). I felt cars were a little too easy to come across, they're everywhere and there's no limit on fuel for them. I like having a base of operations where you stockpile resources, and the 'influence' ""currency"" is a great concept (although I think it'd be better for individuals to have their own influence ranking rather than a groupwide influence pool). The main negatives are that the game can be a bit easy - I didn't lose many survivors at all and my base never felt under any real threat. I want the game to punish you more without it becoming boring by requiring say lots of walking. I found the most enjoyable section of the game to be after the tutorial when you're in the church - there's a lot to deal with, most of its in walking distance and it felt like the game was more alive. If the developers take these positives, add base building and micro management of survivors, State of Decay 2 could become the definitive zombie game.			"

												Update: My issues have been addressed, changing to thumbs up.For $19.99 I got a handful of minor new features, worse (IMO) graphics with more glitches, and a host of new bugs. All of the bugs I was hoping would be fixed are not.It honestly feels like I just installed a handful of mods that (as usual with mods in my experience) destabilize the game. Things I'd hoped for: Updated textures, higher resolutions without -fullscreen, a couple more home sites, and many of the commonly complained about bugs fixed. I got none of that.I would like to recommend this game to new players but I can't.  The bugs that plagued the original version are still not fixed and yet they discontinued support for that game.  It is unlikely they will fix most of the bugs in this version too.			"

												For me, this game has hit a sweet spot. Is it perfect? of course not. Controls, graphics, the explanation of the UI could all be better - but after a few hours in, I completely forgot these shortcomings.The setting is among the most immersive apocalyptic settings I know of, and the combination of base and survivor management, exploration and extermination (of zombies) has proven to be a most effective way of keeping me entertained, finding quests, loot and ways to get around without becoming zombie bait has been (and hopefully continues to be) one of the most fun gaming experiences of 30+ years of gaming.

												One of the best zombie games I have every played. Not only is the game fun, controls fluid, and graphics great, but it never gets old. With the three game types offered, it adds maybe too much fun to this game. I just like to get set up at the house and bust out on missions. The only thing I don't like is losing a character I like, but then I try to lose the ones I don't like to find a new favourite. Just a great game over all, endless fun!			"

												So where to begin, State of Decay is flawed and depending on the kind of person you are these flaws are fairly easily overlooked for a period of time until things kick in with force so for now the simple pro's and con's of the game before further elaboration:Pro's:- Lots of characters and the DLC only adds to that across 3 scenarios (SoD, Breakdown and Lifeline)- Good base building actiongs albeit a touch limited- Weapon diversity, even if it pretty much boils down to guns, melee and throwable- A fair bit to do if you're a 100% completion person as some of the challenges are more time comsuming than they are hardCon's:- Whilst the action is good to begin with and the whole concept of the game is great (in my opinion) after the first 20-30 hours it's very much the same ""get this"" ""save that person"" ""go here"" type of quests- AI is as dull as a sack of hammers and in the Breakdown DLC (as far as I've seen) the AI doesn't use firearms unless they're in the watch tower at base- You have to do pretty much everything yourself (see above for partial explaination) as the AI doesn't simply go out in force and search for you whilst you're away over the hill putting a slug between a zombies eyes- The bugs, whilst not as bad as people make it out to be, I've had some serious ""wut?"" moments like driving down a road only for the car to hit something and over turn leaving my character hurt, carless and the ensuring explsion luring everything undead in for a good 500 metersDespite everything this game is easily one of the more enjoyable games I've had a chance to play over the years, whilst not perfect is a solid basis for the series as State of Decay 2 is meant to be in the works. I won't try to play down the bugs as they can be a royal pain or a source of amusement but in literal sense if you're unlucky a bug in game can be the difference between your best survivor making it home goodies and all or being torn in 2 by a freak class zombie. The core game play itself is solid if a bit rinse and repeat after a while, the DLC alters a few things with the likes of lifeline but its very much of a sameness but with a military setting. Breakdown isn't exactly hard as it is trying, as you progress levels you'll get less resources and more zombies / freaks as a result giving what I feel is a false sense of difficulty as they all take the same damage and dish it out but the sheer volume causes the fight or flight moments.TL;DRAs a whole the game is good, not perfect, but decent enough to keep a zombie fan interested for a while. Anyone with a short attention span may want to avoid it however base builders and to an extent RPS players may enjoy it for its limited RPG like character stats. 7.5/10			"

												After 4 hours of play I already have a love/hate attitude for the game. Concept is good, but events thus far have felt very scripted for an ""open"" game world. Graphics are decent, love how my laptop is able to stay relatively cool while running. Shooting and targeting objects appears to be fluid for distant combat, but melee combat turns into an inchorent, frantic button mash (there doesn't appear to be any visual targeting for melee like there is for ranged fighting). Had to adjust the mouse sensitivity big time.  My character gets ""sucked"" into animation sequences during melee combat which kind of sucks (kind of like a RB in an older Madden game getting hit by a defensive lineman, animation sequences once triggered appear to have no way to get out of) There is a dodge button somewhere but there is no tutorial or message on that feature, it's something you'd have to look up in the controls. There are help messages for some of the controls but it's the basic ones over and over again thus far. The death sequences are well done, gets kind of addictive splattering zombie brains. The bad is that zombies tend to spawn in the middle of walls and fences, while also having a terrible respawn script running. You'll be walking in a forest and all of a sudden a zombie will respawn right next to you. You'll clear an area out only to have zombies magically reappear instead of them walking to the area from an offmap starting point. The UI has a good layout but terrible functionality attached to the buttons. Easy to accidently purchase a feature with your influence currency, particularl when you're starting out and learning the controls... which leads me to saving. There is no save functionality. It's all automated. Which doesn't work for the flow of the game. You'll want to be slow and quiet, which means you'll have spent many minutes/hours of playing and need to go do something  in real life yet there is  no way to save except for reaching end of missions and ""magical"" save points. Getting in a car is no fun whatsoever. The controls are bad, and it doesn't even feel like you're driving a vehicle on earth, it's more like piloting a paper airplane in space. It's been fun to level up a character, but the inability to not switch to other members in the group until the game decides it's ok is very annoying. I would purchase the game again for the $30 price, overall experience has been 75-83 range on a 100 scale, it's just really disappointing that some of the features are the way they are...And probably would have been♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at anything more then that. (Have not purchased played the earlier version which is no longer available, this has been my first experience). If I could give a sideways thumbs I would, but will go with thumbs up, there's been enough good to overcome the shortcomings thus far.			"

The combat is a bit bad, but hey you win some you lose some.You can spend hours with searching for resourses and doing quests. It is an unpolished diamond and you should not miss it.If you have the game it's a maybe....See I played the original without the DLC and loved it, and for me this was worth it just for the DLC.If you have the original game and the DLC this is not worth it at all. It's still good and the graphics is sligthly better.But that is not worth you rebying essentially the same game for that. It's still good, but as unpolised as it ever was.The bugs are still there and  so all the other problems.Yet it is still an entertaining experience and if you do not already own it you should pick it up.Should you already own the base game, wait for a sale and buy it then.

												A few bugs (e.g. ombies suddenly teleporting through closed doors), but they aren't enough to distract me from what is a thoroughly enjoyable game. Other reviews have drawn parallels with the Walking Dead. I can see why. but don't expect this game to be as strongly character-driven as that. Each character does have unique characteristics and traits, but they don't seem to have much actual impact on my tactics or weapons loadout. So long as you're a bit cautious (i.e. don't dive into a horde with just a crowbar to hand and expect to walk away - although it can be done) you can manage to deal with most situations using any character. There are exceptions like the military being more receptive to characters with a military background.DLC - Breakdown is more of a sandbox version focussing solely on survival.Lifeline is focussed on a different, more urban map where you play as the military who end up cut off from supply and reinforcement, so you need to balance progress against survival with dwindling loadout of the chunky weapons you start off with. Different enough to add a lot of additional gameplay and enjoyment.Definitely worth a play.			"

												Currently there are very few game developers that are not too lazy to do good games or too scared to do hard games.Is this game perfect? No. But it's good and just being good is atm a very rare badge of honor.As for people complaining, well for me as a person who lived under socialism it is so much fun to watch a crowd of westerners DEMAND from a free market agent something as if it were their social due.Advice to any reader out of the squabble - this is one of the rare enjoyable games with an ever increasing difficulty curve from old school style easy (i.e. casuals might still struggle) to really difficult. The genre is survival on the run with temporarily upgradable buildings and depletable loot and it is not very mod friendly so do not expect to be able to mod it into endless survival in one place, but for what it is, it is one of the best.I can't say 'buy it now' because part two is coming, but if you are collecting good games - wait till the first 50% discount and grab it.

												It is the ultimate Grand Theft Autoish game in a zombie world. Its a great survival game, with solid base building and good RPG elements. Control is fine, action is good enough and combat is deeper than it seems at the begining, since progression opens up unexpected new avenues. Graphics are probably not in the top nowadays,but for me they do their job and I ended up liking them more than I thought. The story part is nothing to die for, but at least it makes you feel part of a post apocalyptic world and throws in some nice details that in the end, bring the world alive and believable.The map is probably a bit limited, if you want to read a con. And both DLCs are just average.Wonder how I managed to miss this one so far. Now I cant wait for State of Decay 2.			"

												Single player zombie apocalypse survival in an open world nearly at it best.I dont like to be a leader of survivor so it really annoying when i keep having to ""hand out"" mission to other survivor.The amount of mission that are sent our way in a single day is just way too much even when you ""hand out"" some of them to other survivor.Car durability to body impact seem too high and some weapon durability seem way too low.Even though there a few thing i really dont like, i am still going to recommend it.

												I played through the original game on the Xbox 360 and enjoyed it very much. If you also played it through I do not recommend the game, it is only good for new players or if you want to experience the DLC.Pros:-Gameplay: Simplistic yet addictive survival-Characters: Decent and after playing them for a while you will care about keeping them alive-Bases: You have the ability to change your home base-Limited amount of resources: All vehicles, resources etc. are limited so if you trash the car you are driving you better find a new one-Base Management: Upgrade your base with new ""buildings"" which provide you with buffs or completely new features-Multiple ""Main"" Characters: You play as all of your survivors and have to switch when others get tired. Makes you care also about others and you want to level them up for later.-Progression: Has a decent progression system with levels and ""perks"" which you can choose to differentiate between the specialization of each character.Cons-Horrible last gen console port!!!!The graphics are awful, the graphic settings are very lacking and the performance is very poor compared to the graphical fidelity. The game does not support 1440p and should be locked at 60fps. I have a 144hz 1440p monitor but I am forced to play at 1080p with locked 60 using Riva Tuner to get a decent gaming experience. This is unacceptable in the modern day. If the new game will be the same way I will refrain from buying it.-You Should Use a Controller: The gameplay is ok with a mouse and keyboard, but you really should use a controller for a more fluid gaming experience.-Bugs:Still has many of the same issues as the original Xbox 360 version had. Some bugs are minor others rather troublesome. I have not yet had massive issues, but the bugs are still annoying.-The Graphics:I mentioned them before, but they are just so awful I have to mention them twice. This game looks worse than the original Fable on the original Xbox. Fable had good graphics for the platform it was on and for the time it was made, this game doesn’t.ConclusionI have to recommend the game as I enjoy it very much. I have not yet found a better alternative for a action base-building walking dead type game so this game is the best one out there. It has its flaws, but if you are willing to look past them the game itself is great.			"

												I say its pretty good but the fact that i coulden't buy the normal game, i had to buy the YOSE edition and i didnt want that, but other than that its a pretty good game, i would recommend it if it was sold in original form, and i have no problem with bugs and stuff like that so its pretty good game by itself.

												Pretty worth if you're playing in oceania. The fact is that oceania area doesn't really have enough players for zombie/survival/open world games, this single player game would be the perfect game to experience how zombie games are like !			"

												Bah... I was  a sucker to buy this game.  Like all the other reviews say, there is no added content that I could tell...  They just tricked me into buying the same thing again.  Like buying all your CDs on Itunes.  Good investment.			"

												Buy this game if you don't already own State of Decay, don't own all of the DLC, or are a completionist.  Otherwise, don't bother.This edition does add a knife as an unbreakable back-up weapon for when you run out of bullets or break your last melee weapon, mysterious crate drops, new weapons and characters, and SUVs, but nothing that really ""changes"" the game like multiplayer, ATVs, new locations, or new story mode quests.All that aside, I still love State of Decay.

												First time I tried was on my quad core laptop. Laggy, choppy bad experience. Got myself a nice shiny new AMD FX-8370 8-core rig and what a world of difference. The game is about as close to a ""Walking Dead"" or generic zombie apocalypse experience as I can imagine.PROS:Game is pretty easy to pick up and figure out combat-wise even for an old guy like me. The atmosphere is great, the vehicles are easy to use. I felt pretty studly until I walked into a house with primary character and got jumped by a mini-horde. Torn to pieces, pretty jarring moment, but I have no problem with the permadeath as it raises the stakes. The base building options give you something to work towards. I have not experienced the glitches that others have (jinxed!).CONS:Now, note that these ""cons"" are on me cuz I suck. Slow reflexes, more of a strategy gamer so.. I've lost so many main characters already, I think I am on #5. He's doing pretty well but got exhausted really fast and I had to quit and play something else. That was a bummer. Once you lose so many characters you can't switch between people. YOu have to shut down the game for a few hours to rest/heal. There are healing options as I understand it, but haven't got there yet. I'm really only 8.5 hours into it and slowly starting to get a feel for it. I hope there is a way to regain a playable second character or I may have to start over. Again, these are all my own issues and not knocks on the game. I can't say anything negative about it at all in fact! I'm having fun, just wish I didn't have to shut down to rest!A must try game for all fans of Romero, TWD, etc. Highly recommend it! "

												Been eyeing this for awhile now. Had it on Xbox a few years ago and I loved it. Just picked it up a few days ago, my first purchase on Steam and I'm happy I did! I just hope that Undead Labs releases State of Decay 2 here as well.			"

												Could have had more potential. I got bored with the game really quick.**Edit**Thought I'd give the game a second try and it's pretty good. I have never played the normal edition, only the remasterd one. So I can't say anything about the bad mechanics, which are apparently there. The game is a little glichty but it doesn't override the gameplay. You should give it a try.			"

												This is about the Sandbox Mode and not the normal story mode / campaign!! Best Zombie Shooter/Survival game I have ever played. Characters feel real, both melee and ranged combat are fluid, group managment is quite fun thanks to perma death, stealth is nothing new but fulfills its purpose, and the world has a very walking dead tone to it. There is a bit of story that wil make you do some missions but the game mostly benefits from the ""make you own adventure"" aspect. You just get thrown into the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and then you figure everything out from there. I really enjoy that concept.And all of this in a single player! Shows that not every game has to go multiplayer. Unfortunately at a certain point the game gets boring due to the fact that the map will be completely explored and gathering materials and saving the same characters is not really interesting at end game. The graphics are bit dissapointing especially when it comes to the overall color of the game (but thats just a matter of taste i guess). However the journey is amazing and fells very immersive. Now add the mods (crossbow is a must) that are out there and you have a great game. Very recommended for zombie enthusiasts.  "

												If you dont have the orignal game then by all means its a great buy. I dont see much difference between the original and this copy i feel like i was cheated out of 20 bucks. The game is great but if you have the orginal and the DLC there is no point in getting this version. Instead of wasteing time doing this they should have put the effort into co op. This game would be great to play with friends. And from what i have seen with the fan base many of us want a co op option.			"

												After watching the walking dead I wanted to find a game similar to the series, State Of Decay: YOSE was the best one I found, the game is really cool and it really looks like a the walking dead zombie apocalypse. you really should buy it.			"
