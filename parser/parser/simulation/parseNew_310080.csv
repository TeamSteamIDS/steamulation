												Lately, a lot of fowl games have been released on Steam. This has ruffled a lot of feathers, and with good reason, as there are some real birdbrains making videogames nowadays. But I'm talon you, this isn't one of those, this game is eggcellent. You might fink people just buy it for ironic purposes, but it's eggshelly a very good game. The premise may make you worried that the game's a bit of an odd duck - a human gull going to a school for birds? To call that ""realistic"" would be ostrich, so a lot of peeps might wonder how the flock that can make for a fun game. But if you give it a chance and carrion with it, you'll discover that it is well written, with a migrate cast of characters. You're bound to have a pheasant time with this, and even if you're still hesitant, you should swallow your pride and buy the game on a lark (it's not that expensive, so don't worry about the bill), and you'll discover an impeckable game with hours of replay value. So just spend some cash from your nest egg, and from heron out you won't egret your perchase. You'll have a hoot, guaranteed.			"

												Okay.. uhh.. wow.What to say about this game..It's definitely not something I thought it was going to be. I originally bought this game for the lolz since the general idea for this game is ""Oh it's a dating sim... for birds.. lol"" So originally, I played it as such. But as I carried on through the different routes you could take, I found each story more and more compelling. So many twists and turns and things that just randomly straight up hit you in the feels or made you think ""wtf just happened?""The main story is really creative and the genre twist really takes you through a loop and keeps you hooked. And for birds, the characters are really well developed. I think the makers of this game knew exactly what they were doing. I want to take the player into a false sense of ""This is going to be hilarious and stupid"" Which granted, at some points, that's what it does. Very well. It's really funny.When really it's building you up for a huge unexpected story hit. All the different routes are just branches of character developments, readying you for the main plot. I applaud that. Over all, I'd actually recommend buying this game and doing exactly what everyone else is doing. Go in while not taking this game seriously at all and let it change your mind. Because it seriously will. Then it'll leave you there to sit there and think about how unexpectedly brilliantly done it is. Mediatonic, Hato Moa... hats off to you, this was a great experience.			"

												What is Hatoful Boyfriend? Hatoful Boyfriend is a bird dating sim.I purchased this because I thought it would be funny to say that I was playing a bird dating sim.  There wasn’t suppose to be any real feelings behind this purchase, it was all in jest.  I launched the game and quickly got to the bad ending.  I figured I should at least complete one or two “good” endings before I uninstalled the game and abandoned it to be just another game in my library.  To accomplish my goal of being able to complete a good ending, I quickly made a “birds.txt” where I would list everybody in the story with a couple words to allow me to remember who was who.Ryouta : Childhood friend, sickSakuya : ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Yuuya : Works in infirmiry, upperclassmen, half brother of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, flirtNageki : Library silent dudeSan : RUN RUN RUN RUN RUNKazuaki : Homeroom / math teacher, falls asleepShuu : DoctorReferencing this “cheat sheet”, I was able to get a good ending fairly easily.  I repeated myself, this time going for a different ending...sometime in this third playthrough, something changed.By the end of that ending, I was actually enjoying what I was doing.  This “Joke of a game” was actually drawing me in, not because of “bird dating sim”, but because of the actual plot and the compelling characters.  My cheat sheet was pointless, I knew all the names.  Everybirdie had their own personality, and their stories had wildly different outcomes, yet were all tied together to help reveal a plot that actually mattered. As you play through the game more, and achieve different endings you find little bits and pieces about the world.  You read how birds became the dominant lifeform on the planet, how the human race almost fell to extinction, and how bird politics work.Each story feel completely different.  They all showcase a huge variety of emotions and social conditions.  One story / ending exists entirely for humor, and no deep thought is put into anything.  You are able to laugh your way through a 20 minute story and have a great time.  You re-roll your game, and suddenly your story is filled with great sorrow between all the funny bird puns.  Sadness then turns into happiness as your story becomes complete.  Re-roll again, now you are exploring yet more bird puns, but this time also the impossible expectations sometimes forced onto oneself from their family.  Re-roll, now genocide is brought into the fold.  Re-roll, we are happy and excited again.What the hell just happened?  This game somehow managed to put an actual fantastic plot full of emotion and lessons of how the world works into...a bird dating simulator.  Somehow this completely over the top game idea is completely overlooked the more you play it and fall in love with it.Everybirdie should download this game and try it out because “lol bird dating sim”.  You’ll be amazed as the joke suddenly starts being enjoyable and the fact that everyone is a bird spouting bird puns is able to be completely overlooked.What is Hatoful Boyfriend? Hatoful Boyfriend is a fantastic game filled with more emotion and story than it should possibly contain.			"

												Hatoful Boyfriend is more nuanced and compelling than it has any right to be.Its outrageous concept is so over the top that it’s hard to view the game as anything more than a joke; something amusing but mostly held together by the mere fact of its existence. But these preconceptions, strung along by even its own marketing and description, are hiding the shockingly well written and emotionally stirring narrative underneath.To be entirely clear, it is in part exactly what it appears to be: an otome dating simulator/visual novel, set in a world where birds have evolved to be the most intelligent species and humans have been mostly driven to extinction. Playing as the lone human student at Pigeonation Academy, you are tasked with going about your day, trying to scrape by in your schoolwork while wooing the bird of your dreams.It’s an intentionally laughable idea, and one which at first can seem so ridiculous as to turn those less drawn to Japan’s stranger exports away, but its one which never dissolves into idiotic bird lover pandering (assuming that’s a thing that exists) or outright stupidity with its writing. Hatoful Boyfriend is entirely aware of its own absurdity, and treats it almost as an afterthought, to the point that the fact these characters are nearly entirely birds became irrelevant at least as far as being a very odd novelty.Hatoful Boyfriend’s writing is exceptional, both hilarious and comical, and heart wrenchingly sad and contemplative. Though it begins as little more than a silly teenage romance, it spends this time crafting characters that you come to care about, before hurling them into a plot darker and more precarious than I ever could have imagine. While there are certainly parts (and entire storylines) within the game which are nothing but comedy, allowing the humorous and charming side of the game to take the spotlight for a moment and provide more than a few laughs, it was when the subject matter moved away from this silliness that I began to finally see the hidden brilliance of the game’s writer.It’s shocking to even consider at first, and even now as I’m writing this I’m rather stunned at what Hatoful Boyfriend manages to do with its narrative, but it handles it's incredibly dark material with incredible grace and consideration. Calculated genocide, mass murder and biological experimentation, interspecies racism, and the value of family are not only touched upon, but discussed at length and in such a way as to not only allow you to take them seriously within the game’s context, but actually emphasize and become emotionally invested in the avian characters that once seemed so innocent and comical.Hatoful Boyfriend made me laugh; it made me smile and appreciate its subtlety; and it made me cry. The spectrum of emotions I experienced throughout my handful of playthroughs (which should be considered a requisite, as you will miss the vast majority of the game’s content if you only go through it once) was something I never imagined this game to be capable of. It kept me playing for hours on end, up late into the night, and I’m still attempting to process all that I witnessed. It could very well be the apotheosis of a game you shouldn’t judge by its cover, and something that everybirdie ought to at least give a chance before writing it off as something it by and large is anything but.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

I wasn't expecting anything more than a joke game that would be good for a few laughs but, Hatoful Boyfriend is so much more than that.  A lot of love was put into this game, and the video on the store page doesn't do it justice.  Hopefully we will see the sequel released on Steam in the future!			"

												Before Hatoful Boyfriend, I was a happily married man with a home, a well-paying job, a wife, and two kids. Then, the eve before my birthday, a close friend had stealthily bought Hatoful Boyfriend and sent it to me, thinking it'd be a funny early birthday present. I decided to humor him, and booted up the game on that one fateful Saturday night.My house burned down, I lost my job, my wife divorced me and took custody of the children, and my pizza delivery guy was late.I'm now pregnant with my 17th child from my new pigeon hasubando and am currently living in a giant, underwater nest filled with kawaii mutant human-bird baby hybrids that feed off of human flesh and Lego blocks.10/10. It's okay.			"

												this game is an emotional trap. you buy it because the idea of a dating simulator with pigeons is 'LOL SO RANDOM!!11 XD' and full of 'teh lulz', but then you accidentally end up playing a parody game that turns out to be far better than the majority of material it's actually imitating.the writing is thoughtful and well-balanced, containing humor of the rare 'actually funny' type, which will result in feelings of warm attachment to the characters... before TWISTING THE KNIFE OF FEELINGS DEEPLY as a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions overwhelms the plotline arc and cast.the writing also has a highly surprising amount of depth, as the characters (including your own) must make some morally ambiguous choices, and even the most immoral characters have a few redeeming, wholly human features to their personalities which make them relatable and strangely likable.there are 16 different endings to the story that are achieved based on the choices you make, with one 'true ending' and 15 'alternate endings'; notably, the alternate endings to this story are cleverly interwoven into the 'true' ending plotline, as with each new ending you discover, you are given new revelations that consistently give you deeper insight into the events that unfold prior to the finale of the 'true' plotline. this means that there is an actual reader's value that goes beyond shallow 'what if' ideas to following every path to its ending, which is fairly uncommon in the genre of multiple-choice story games.the art is also clean, colorful and high quality, and the music sets the tone nicely. honestly the only thing i could wish for is that it was fully voiced (it isn't).recommended for people who actually enjoy good stories in visual novels, as opposed to the endless list of VNs with vapid, soulless storylines that rely on a cast of waifus and husbandos to appeal to buyers... although, you have been warned- after playing this game, the odds that you will have horrifyingly/ heartbreakingly fallen in love with your first ever 'pigeon husbando' are high...

												I share a similar story with many other reviewers here. I bought this game for the laughs. I mean, a pigeon dating sim? I assumed I'd have fun with it for a couple of hours and then be done. I was not expecting what happened next.  Cons I must admit that there are negatives, and I will point them out before I praise the game. To start off, I'm not sure if this can be considered a negative (I think it's a positive), but a few of the story lines seem to be created merely for amusement and humour. They make no sense, and are there as a joke. However, If you are looking for something that is 100% serious, you're in the wrong place, and I have absolutely no clue why you would be here in the first place. Anyway, the interface and skill point system is simple, but they do the job. There are a few spelling and grammar errors scattered throughout, which may be distracting, but they are far and few between. As well, the starting routes are short and perhaps shallow. I recommend you try to complete all of the endings in order to see the ""Bad Boys Love"" bonus ending and the epilogue.  Pros Despite all of that, this game sets you on an emotional roller coaster if you put in the time to explore the different routes, and carry through with the finale. With various endings, each path provides a unique narrative. If the final ending is achieved, all of the stories tie together quite well, leaving you with an unexpectedly profound story, a group of memorable characters, and a collection of bird puns. I came for the laughs. What I got was comedy, romance, horror, mystery, and tears.I didn't ask for this. But I'm glad it happened.			"

What does ""Hatoful"" even mean?...WARNING: CONTAINS POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!Hatoful - hatofuru - is a word pun between the Japanese word hato - which means either dove, or pigeon - and the English adjectives of either Heartful or Hurtful. On these terms, the title of the game is self-explanatory. Hatoful Boyfriend is a humorous otome/visual novel in which you get to date birds. Aside the humorous, or even strikingly unconventional nature of the game, this joke veils a deeper truth.The story is set in the fictional future of 2188. A century ago starting with rock pigeons, birds all over the world started to take the next step in evolution and challenged the omnipotence of mankind. After a long period of conflict and even open war, the mankind survived only as a minority. Now, the majority of the world's conscient population consists of birds. In this particular dystopia, we take the role of the only human student invited to attend St. Pigeonation, the most prestigious high school for birds of the world.At first, the display of the story keeps us oblivious to the grim face of our setting. Nothing indicates that Hatoful Boyfriend would be more than an unimaginably crazy joke. We keep playing the game in this meaningless context, as a silly joke, flirting with different kinds of birds and all. We laugh our hearts out for the absurdity of given situations, the reactions and portrayals of characters, and logical flaws of the setting are unbearably funny. It is like watching one of the most absurd anime series, like ever!But as the stories progress, and we accomplish different kinds of romances, we learn a bit more about different characters each time. As we play, they become more than silly depictions of birds. We learn their stories, their backgrounds, their aspirations and their wounds... just like real people. I tell you, the narrative of this game, and the narrative's ability to conceal the most shocking fictional events in silly jokes are totally scary. As we play, bits and pieces roll up to their proper places to paint an incredibly political and ethical discussion with suspense and immense tragedy!Gameplay wise, nothing is extraordinary. There are some pretty background pictures, and an incredible amount of bird photos flying around. Each character has their own separate background music. You start reading, and make some dialogue or event choices now and then. Finally, it wraps up to become a romance path for a bird of your choice. When you complete all endings, and start a new game; you face with the question whether you'd like to keep a long forgotten promise. If you say yes, things take an incredible turn, to reveal all past mysteries. Annoying or peculiar occurrences that you've been witnessing in your prior games now form a painful meaning. This final storyline reveals a darker side to our fictional setting, and brings question to concepts such as war, peace, misinformation, discrimination, racial and ethnic differences, and even biological war! Now, that was certainly unexpected, wasn't it?Hatoful Boyfriend starts as an absurd joke for you to kill some meaningless time, yet if you bear with its lame display and take a moment to look deeper, it rewards you with a most thrilling and disturbingly realistic story. Take your time, get bored by the joke. You'll end up picking a glass of water to wash the bitter feeling in your throat towards the end.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												When people hear the term ""games as art"" they generally make the mistake of lumping everything into the same visual category. Sometimes art is in the form of a concept or idea and not just an optical quality, and it's in this sense that I highly regard Hatoful Boyfriend as a work of art. It takes a tired and cliched concept and reworks it into a thought provoking and never before seen idea that manages to be both humorously satirical and affectingly sentimental, causing the general public to reconsider and ponder the meaning of a mostly mocked genre. Some may discount the games merits based on the corny puns, and these people miss the point entirely. What makes Hatoful Boyfriend so damn funny, so artfully clever, and so hard to stop smiling at is the overall concept of what's happening and the way the emotionally driven story is delivered. The idea of seeing such seriously toned dialogue combined with the strange and surreal imagery of a school of pigeons is wildly outside of the box, and to anyone with an imagination is at first incredibly entertaining. What really takes the player by surprise is the emotional draw the story has on you in the end for what at first was such a seemingly laughable and satirical plot.Hatoful Boyfriend isn't just a satire or a mockery, it's not just one big comedic joke like some might intially believe. The characters are written well and manage to shine with more personality and.. humanity(?) than what we're used to seeing in the generally shallow world of anime dating sims, which is what makes the experience feel even more bizarre, strange, yet memorable given it's subject matter. It manages to feel more real and authentic than even the most sensible or conventional games in this form of interactive storytelling.The strange feeling evoked by Hatoful Boyfriend of feeling a growing emotional attachment towards something so seemingly overlooked as a pigeon or bird in a video game is one I'll remember. People with no connection or empathy for the animal kingdom my find it hard to swallow the ongoings of St. Pigeonation and won't take away anything of value from this quirky change of pace needed in gaming, but those with an open mind and heart to the topic will come away with a new found respect and admiration for a species generally viewed as insignificant or often misunderstood.If you're the type who isn't too concerned with artistic and strange new takes on old genres, or you're one of those gamer types who enjoys the same-old-same-old while fearing changes to the industry then by all means skip this and play what you usually play. For people who want something new in the medium and want to see differences to gaming that allow a wider variety of people into the world of interactive experiences we call games then Hatoful Boyfriend is something you'll want to check out.

												Went in assuming this was some sort of satire on visual novel culture. Surprised to see it is a fully serious visual novel with enjoyable characters. Individual paths are short, but have an over-arching story to uncover as part of the whole.10/10 birds			"

My Hatoful Boyfriend AdventureBefore playing: Haha, goofy bird-dating game!San's ending: Haha, I dated a goofy bird!Ryouta's ending: Haha, I-- oh, that was quite touching actuallyNageki's ending: o-ohYuuya's ending: oh, er, that's a bit-Shuu's ending: ...blimeyBBL ending: h-hold meIn all seriousness- and I know there's no point saying it because however sincere I am, I won't be believed- Hatoful Boyfriend has one of the darkest plots I've ever known. It's a shame there's a lot of repetition to get through before you get to the real meat of the game, but it's worth it for the character development and laughs you'll have along the way. Laughs and tears. Mostly tears.			"

												The creators of Hatoful Boyfriend made a huge gamble.Most of the people who buy this game just play it for the LOLs and to be able to brag about playing a dating simulator with birds (it's a great conversation starter, alright). They enjoy the derpiness for a bit, reach one ending and then move on to another game, some of them maybe a little bit disappointed.Well, it takes a few more completed routes to notice there's something really weird going on - you know, besides the whole bird-ruled society thing, and it takes ALL the character endings for the game to really start!Finally, all your questions will be answered! Why are the birds in charge? What happened to humans? Why was a human girl admitted to this super prestigious birds-only school? Why do the courses served in the school cafeteria have such morbid names? Why does the math teacher smell like bleach?If I hadn't decided to get all the achievements before being done with this game, I'd never have known how interesting it really is. As I said, a huge gamble on the creators' side, but in my case it paid off.Now, for those who are planning on playing this game, can you promise to actually complete it?>Yes>Yes>YesWhy thank you! I knew I could count on you!			"

												Every once in a while, you run into something that challenges your expectations in ways you couldn’t have possibly expected. It wears the surface layer like a wolf in pigeon’s clothing, promising a few quick laughs through the trappings of a dolled up Visual Novel featuring an all-bird cast. And if you were to think of it as nothing more, what with all of the pink upholstery and hearts surrounding every element of the game’s outward presentation, then no one could blame you. But it also counts on this charade to drag the player into something beneath its skin. Hatoful Boyfriend is indeed a game about attending an all-bird high school as the only human in the academy. Yet, if one cares to look above, they’ll see a murder of crows circling overhead.Hatoful Boyfriend will appear familiar to anyone who has played a Visual Novel or two. Once you’ve started a new game, it will ask for your name, introduce you to the majority of characters in a warm and friendly environment, and generally settle you into daily life at St. PigeoNation. Navigation works similarly to the thousands which have come before it. You progress forward by clicking or hitting enter as a dialog box completes to display the next one and advance the story, occasionally make a selection to build your stats or guide which bird you will chase for their affection. There’s also the option to save and load, as well as alter some basic settings, and a convenient fast-forward button in the upper corner, should you wish to skip over dialog you’ve already seen. And of course, branching paths which all lead to their own endings, all depending on choices you make.The first trick Hatoful Boyfriend pulls out of its hat is how short a single run can last. The very first run I completed took me about an hour in total, which draws the player in, promising quick trips down alternative paths to collect all of the pigeon husbando~ hearts. This is exactly what it wants you to do. Only going through the game once wouldn’t allow for the seams in the feathered costume begin to show, so it pushes you towards seeking every han- er, wing, you possibly can. With every successful unique ending, you’re rewarded with curious snippets in the “archive” section in the main menu. Between the diary entries and newspaper clippings, it’s trying to warn you. Only, we’re too occupied as players staring at the plumes of tail feathers to see the forest for the trees.And it’s hard not to. The game’s use of standard visual novel/anime characterizations intelligently manipulates the player into wanting to chase down the Tsundere French transfer student, the plucky best friend you’ve known since you were both younger, the goth kid who speaks a language all his own, and even the creepy one who mutters statements under his breath that would be admissible evidence in court. Down each path, there’s plenty of humorous dialog and heart-tugging character development. The fact that they are all birds instead of humans or anime portraits just pulls the covers over your eyes when the real drama finally hits. They’re all entertainingly written, even if they stay extremely close to the tropes that birthed them. Let’s not allow the down comforter to be pulled over our eyes though. Several of the paths lean heavily into exposing Hatoful Boyfriend’s big secret, which is given to the player after certain endings have been cleared.BBL mode, known as “Bad Boys Love”, is what Hatoful Boyfriend is really building towards. All of the characters you meet, all of the interactions you have, they all lead down the path towards BBL mode’s story. To explain what exactly BBL is would be to spoil the true meat and potatoes of the game, and thus I can’t in good conscience actually explain it to you. Even if I did tell you, in great detail, what it is and what happens during it, there’s no way you’d actually believe me. It is a much bigger bird than the others, with secrets tucked between every feather. I’ve seen many reviews not even mention it in fear of spoiling it but I feel as though that isn’t enough to truly entice someone into playing the game. Much like Hatoful Boyfriend’s tricks, I have spent most of this review building up to BBL mode simply to get you interested in what lies beyond that cage door. In order for you to discover the truth, however, you’ll have to spread your wings on your own.It might just be because I let my guard down from the pigeon-centric cast but Hatoful Boyfriend left me feeling shaken. What I’d gone through was both hilarious and frightening at the same time. Just keep your wits about you, reinforce your constitution, and carve it into your soul. Hatoful Boyfriend is not just a dating sim where your boyfriends all have winged limbs and beaks. It’s an example of playing to the strengths and comforts of a genre while turning convention on its head to have the stork deliver a story so full of twists that it took me 3 sheets of paper and small handwriting to keep track of it all.Did you enjoy this review?

What a great game.If you're wondering on whether to buy this game there are a few questions you should ask yourself:1. Do you like visual novels?2. Are you ok with text-heavy games?3. Are you ok with psychological horror and descriptive violence?4. Would you like to date birds?If you answered ""yes"" to all of those, then you should play this game! On a superficial level Hatoful Boyfriend looks like a silly game that's not worth the money, but undernearth all those routes where you date your cute bird boyfriends, there's an underlying plot which will keep you wondering. And once you reach the BBL ending + epilogue, you won't regret buying this game!			"

												Lunacy! Madness!This game. This game right here.At first it comes as your typical senseless japanese otome game with birds only good for dropping a few laughs.Well just let me kindly point out how WRONG you are.You might as well know at this point what it is about. You are the only female human in a school for birds. You make friends, you follow the different routes, you have different endings. We get it.BUT THOSE ENDINGS.This ain't no game for kids. I'm not saying bestiality takes place, but those endings will stick with you for a while. Some more than others. Some WAY more than others.And once you have reached all 14 endings....The real game startsAnd I'm by no means exaggerating in here. You have not started playing Hatoful Boyfriend unless you have unlocked the BBL storyline. If you found the previous 14 routes to be superb, this one will make them all look like prepubertal school girls. And man it's ♥♥♥♥ing worth it. This game is absolutely great. Plot-twists everywhere, laughs, tears, angst, fear... you will certainly find playing with talking birds so natural it will not mess with the plot and game experience, trust me on this. Confound you if you are yet hesitating on acquiring this masterpiece!			"

												At first glance, it looks like a silly dating sim with birds.At second glance, it still looks like a silly dating sim with birds.Play a few hours in, it STILL looks like a silly dating sim with birds.Play more than a few hours in, and suddenly it becomes something wonderful, something beautiful, something that actually helped me fight the depression I've been struggling with for years.It's like My Little Pony or Monster Girl Quest, people take it at face value and wonder what the hell is wrong with humanity. But only little kids will say that they don't like carrots without ever tasting them. It might take a while to find, but this game has Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons levels of story and emotional content lurking within. All you need to do is try it.Some proof:

												To be entirely honest, I got this game as a joke. I mean, really, who seriously buys a PIGEON DATING SIM? I thought this would just be a lighthearted, funny game I could play for some kicks and giggles. Don't get me wrong, the actual romance storylines were pretty hilarious in nature, like the part in Ryota's romance where you get a peek at his job (if you've played the game you'll know what I'm talking about). Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from this though besides the joke about it being a pigeon dating sim... until I got to the BBL storyline. Without spoiling anything, let me just say the BBL storyline/ending has nothing to do with romance. It gives you a huge insight on all the characters, their pasts, and how they're all connected. It's rather long compared to just romancing one of your bird companions, but well worth playing through. The BBL storyline/ending does not give you much choice options and is more like a visual novel, but I really appreciated how the developer chose to make it. For me, it turned this simple pigeon dating sim into something far more complicated and intriguing. It is also the reason that this game has become one of my favorite games I've played in a long while.I give this game a 10/10 purely for the BBL storyline/ending. 11/10 for being a pigeon dating sim :p			"

												To some, Hatoful Boyfriend is a game.To some, Hatoful Boyfriend is a fandom.To me, none of this amounts. It does not even come close. Let me tell you how my adventure went...A little background on me. I used to be a human soldier for the United States. I lost my legs in Afghanistan (Landmine+Humvee=Not Good). After coming back home to a wife who cheated and wanted a divorce, I fell into a deep depression. I thought my life was over and my existence had no purpose. That was, until I found this game. I thought this game was a joke. A bird dating sim?!? This'll be hilarious. It was even on sale! I invited some close friends over, we needed to kek together at this glorious joke. We booted up the game and set the graphics quality to ""fantastic"" Upon hitting play, our lives were changed forever. The screen lit up with the radiating energy of the sun, accompanied by the roar of 1 trillion lions. The angels of heaven rode down from Valhala one the backs of giant white doves, singing ""Hallelujah"" from their based lungs. Our eardrums deafened as the intertwining storylines of this gift from god put our minds on a new level. My computer exploded, but the game didn't stop. Because... we were the game.We were the game... and the game was us...Hatoful Boyfriend ascended us to a new state of being.A voice descended from the sky.""Coo!""(My children, it is time.)We were sucked into the world of Hatoful Boyfriend. The game is the way it is today because of us... we fixed the sins of this previously hellish world.It was time. We cured cancer, we ended world hunger, we stopped the birdocracy of the government. It was over... Everything was right in the world. so please, buy this game and let my hard work not go to wate... You won't regret it. 10/10 Would travel interdimensionally again. pros:-weaving storylines-multiple endings-funny dialogue-clever writing-better graphics than crysis -better music than Final Fantasy-runs at 420fps on my gameboy-Fixed my missing legs issue-I grew wings-I am a bird-Coo!

												I appear to be the first negative reviewer to have completed the game in its entirety.  This game has two distinct parts, the dating sim and the Bad Boys Love secret route unlocked by romancing every bird possible.The first part is simply too short to be entertaining.  Any route can be read in about an hour going at a relaxed pace, but there is significant overlap between routes, including sections that have no effect on the particular route you're playing, so I found myself skipping more and more as I replayed.  This also caused me to inadvertantly skip content I hadn't read before, because some sections have multiple outcomes but start out the same way regardless of route.  There is no way to go back to content accidentally skipped without reloading or starting a new game and it simply wasn't interesting enough to worth bothering to find out why I was faced with the choice of telling Okosan ""convenience store"" or ""grocery store"" and I could infer it had something to do with pudding anyway.Consequently, there just isn't enough time to give any character depth and there's no challenge to complete a route.  By the time you finish a route, you feel like you were merely introduced to the character.  Picking routes are also very obvious and there is never any difficulty in seducing the various birds, unless you can't figure out that picking every opportunity to spend time with your desired bird is necessary to romance them.  The routes I enjoyed most, Okosan, Shuu, and Anghel, stood out because they were simply the most oddball.  For a game that is billed as a comedy, most routes utilize stereotypical melodrama.  Bird puns and pop culture references abound, but there's really nothing laugh out loud funny in Hatoful Boyfriend and at best you'll smirk a lot.  There is a very simple stat system, raised by choosing between three elective classes at regular intervals and in a couple of events that likewise present three choices which raise a stat.  The stats serve one purpose, which is to determine whether you get a normal ending or an extended ending.  Extended endings require you to raise one stat to maximum and reward you with an extra scene that was implied in the normal ending anyway.  Each ending has a separate achievement and you can't get both the normal ending and extended ending achievements in one go, so you have to play the same route twice in order to get all the achievements and unlock the Bad Boys Love extended ending.  I wasted part of my life to get the BBL extended ending and it was just as disappointing as the other extended endings.The second part of the game, the Bad Boys Love secret route is much more interesting, but by the time I unlocked it I was already tired of the game.  I trudged on in hopes that it would be good and it was, kind of.  The game suddenly takes a much darker tone, reveals how the world came to be dominated by talking birds, and becomes a mystery story.  It seems interesting for a while, but as all the threads come together it becomes a soap opera for the ages.  Characters are revealed to be secret brothers, secret childhood friends, secret enemies, secret agents, secret terrorists, secret weapons, secretly superpowered, secretly alive, but, alas, there are no secret comas to complete the cliche pantheon.  I got the distinct impression that the first half of the game was written primarily to introduce the characters so that the meandering mysteries wouldn't simply baffle readers.All in all, Hatoful Boyfriend wasn't an altogether terrible game, but it just wasn't worth the money and I got it in a 50% off sale.  I will likely never read it again and would forget about it entirely if Steam didn't keep it in my library forever.  As some consolation, the trading cards were surprisingly valuable and I was able to quickly sell them for about $1.50.If you don't mind a lot of repetition, love every visual novel no matter what, and really love silly gimmicks, then buy this game.  Otherwise, pick up just about any other visual novel on Steam.  Even some of the free ones are more entertaining than Hatoful Boyfriend.4/10			"

												Hatoful Boyfriend is more than just a silly dating sim. It doesn't have an overwhelmingly positive score due to joke reviews.If you have the patience to go through each character route (dating everybirdie), which has the role of introducing the birds, you will discover one of the most mind blowing stories ever written.Recommended to visual novel lovers and people who look for a good story.

												After seeing this on Gamespot's Random Encounter, I was hooked! So purchased the original Japanese version with the English language pack along with the Holiday Star sequel/expansion.Since purchasing this game on Steam I can honestly recommend it as a deep, compelling tale of a group of birds, and a human, who attent a school named St Pidgeonations. You follow several storylines with various options to improve your stats and become close to one of your feathery companions.On the outside this game may just seem like a joke, it originally was! However don't be fooled! This game will pull you in by the wing and you will not be dissapointed. Hopefully Holiday Star will come out on Steam too. Just be careful when explaining this game in public to those who have never heard of it... You will get some strange looks.			"

												This game is not a satirical parody of visual novels in any way whatsoever, contrary to how it appears.Going into Hatoful Boyfriend you can't help but think ""Damn, this is going to be one hell of a weird game"" and although you're right in saying that, it's much, much more. Although it's hard to review this game without spoiling nearly everything I can truthfully tell you that it's well worth your time and that you'd be missing out if you passed Hatoful Boyfriend up.Despite each playthrough being short (around 45 minutes to an hour and a half per route) there are fourteen total endings, following the usual visual novel fashion of ranging from happy, lovely fairy tale-esque endings to extremely dark, likely traumatic endings. Things escalate QUICKLY. Eventually you'll reach the point where you can experience the true ending, which lasts a fair bit longer than usual and is actually an incredibly suspenseful and fascinating mystery/thriller. It alone is worth the price of admission.The characters, although they're well.. birds are actually fairly well designed albeit a little basic due to the short, concise nature of the game itself. Artistically the characters are beautifully drawn and are, admittedly, very good looking.The soundtrack is solid, fairly run-of-the-mill for the most part with a few tracks that really stand out.All in all, despite being mediocre as far as visual novel gameplay and writing goes, the game's charm makes it entirely worthwhile, and hey, who doesn't want to tell their friends that they've been playing a bird dating simulator?

												Don't be fooled: this game is not hilarious. The first two runs are the most funny because of the concept; after that, it's still is a bit funny sometimes, but only because of the writing. You even forget it's a dating-sim, since it's not that focused on flirting. However, don't let that repeal you! It is an amazing visual novel. If you get to the Bad Bird Love route (an alternative story you unlock by finishing the game with some key characters), you'll be rewarded with an intriguing and surprisingly emotional story. Seriously, the scenario of this route is one of the most memorable I've ever seen in a game. Scratch that: it's one of the most memorable, all art forms taken into account. Oh, and also: Nageki for husbando.			"

Did I mention their human portraits are cute too?But knowing me I looked over those birds and went for the psycopathic doctor. <3TL;DR: You date a bunch of birds but there's a much darker story behind that silly dating sim. Just do it.The only con would be that the story's just the same thing over and over, that is if you're trying to get all the endings like me. But if you have a massive amount of patience, you'll love it.10/10 just go get the game			"

												I pre-ordered this game for the lolz but after playing it for a good 10 hours, reading ALL the dialogue EACH time it started to get really deep. I've never expected a game to move me so much. Definitely not from a dating simulator :/ but this game, even if you pay $10 for it when its not on sale it's 100% worth it. It is an amazing game with one of the best endings to it, yes its a bit grindy to get there. But once you've gotten there... Well you'll find out ^^ I highly recommend this game and I have to say, its one of, if not my favourite game of ALL time. This is a game that is looked at by some people and disregarded instantly. But please, I insist, give it a go. If you aren't ""into"" emotional types of games you probably wont like this. I shun those who look at this game and disregard it straight away. Give it a go. From start to finish, this game will probably take you about 10 hours to complete (completely dependent on whether you read all the dialogue or not)			"

												Hidden under what looks to be a joke, this game is actually great. You take on the role of the only human student at St. Pigeonations. Why are you the only human? This might seem like a silly joke to further enhance the meme factor of the game. However, the story is much deeper than what you might at first think. The game has many unique characters, all with their own distinct personalities and stories. As of writing this, I've played through three characters. I enjoyed them all, however one in particular, Nageki, had me in tears by the end. This was defiently not what I was expecting when I first started up a pigeon dating sim.All in all, if complex romance stories, or visual novels is something you enjoy, give this game a fair chance, despite what it might look like at first.

Sadly, I'm not really super crazy about the main heroine's personality, but at least it isn't the cliche type that's helpless all the time.			"

												Hatoful Boyfriend. A game that when I murmur its name in the cold wind of a winters morning - I almost hear a reply. When I play it i feel as though I, a small part of society and the world can actually achieve something greater than myself. This is what this game does; it comforts me, protects me, acknowledges me. It's like the older sister i never had.Inspired by ""Pigeon, the untold story"" and the fantasy adaption of the manga ""Hatsui Fantabolian"" this game delves into the struggles of the kawaii female heroin <insert chosen name here>. She's in pursuit of senpai - the buff hot pigeon who's got all the girls interest. But will it be too much for him to bear?Pros:+Fantastic graphics+Engaging subtitles+A good plotCons:-Senpai is often unattentive-Pigeons can be overzealous at times-No DLCOverall this game is a breath of fresh air in the shoujo and reverse harem genre - giving its fanbase a new perspective on love, life and school in all of its glory. 9.4/10			"

												If you like visual novels and/or dating sims, or are willing to try playing one of those, I cannot recommend this game enough.I know this sounds weird. Dating pigeons? This is obviously some kinda joke that has no right costing as much as it does.But I can guarantee that playing the old version of Hatoful Boyfriend back in 2012 was one of the best experiences in my life. I thought, ""Hey, I like dating sims and the demo is free, the worst that can happen is that I'll hate it and delete it"".No, the worst that could happen was getting my heart crushed into a million pieces and falling in love with a game about birds. I mean, I don't even like birds!But what this game really did was teach me that you can't judge a book (or a game) by its cover, that being open-minded and looking past your preconceptions is important, and that it's nice to try new things once in a while. You might be surprised by what you find.If you think the very concept of this game isn't reason enough to give it a try, I'm not sure what to say. Come back and try again later?This less-than-ten-bucks game that looked like nothing but a silly joke, with only one picture for every character, that used mostly free resources and stock images, managed to be so much more immersive and interesting than any other high-budget visual novel I've played.The game does play like a parody of dating sims for at least half of the game, but even then, the characters are very fleshed out and well written, so if you're looking for something nice to break away from the generic high school girls with the same old no-plot dating experience, this is it.If you're familiar with dating sims (or harem anime) you'll recognize the character types right away: you have the childhood friend, the teacher, the quiet one you're not sure how to approach, the ladies man, the spoiled one, and the list goes on. But there's a lot more to these characters than what you can see at first glance, and figuring out their stories and why's and how's is half the fun.There are many funny moments, yes, oh so many. Hatoful Boyfriend fully embraces its weird concept, which makes it very enjoyable and fun to play. It's not just the birds - the player character is also a very funny character with quite a few gems in her dialogue.But as you play you can easily notice there's so much more going on; there's always that hint of something deeper and darker on the back of every route. The game doesn't just take things for granted - most questions raised during the game will be answered. For example, why you're the only human in a school for birds. Yes, this is addressed in the game, and you might be quite surprised by the explanation.The storytelling in this game is incredibly well done. It's not just what's expected of a visual novel, but a step above.There's not much more I can say about it without getting into spoiler territory, so you'll just have to see for yourself.TL;DR: There's something for everyone in this game. If you're not afraid of new experiences, give it a try - you may be surprised by how easy it is to get absorbed into this game's odd, comical atmosphere. Once you're into it, you may want to go all the way in. The routes are short enough that you'll find the time to play more of them. If you don't like it, well, at least you can say you tried - brag to your friends about how you didn't survive the pigeon dating sim!			"

												I played the whole game with all its possibilities an little (or even bigger) bird puns.I never NEVER thought that any dating sim or especially a PIGEON dating sim can ever do something like this to me.The closer I got to an end (There IS eh..something like a story. Veeeery important!), the more I became upset, nervous and excited. (Okay sometimes I was about to cry, or thought ""♥♥♥♥ no. NO, PLEASE!"")An odd but amusing humor mixed with.. birds. And more birds.HATOFUL BOYFRIEND REALLY TOUCHED MY HEARTPlay this game and you'll understand.			"

												I'd heard about Hatoful.  I'd laughed at the premise. ""A DATING SIM ABOUT PIGEONS?! HA!""  I held out playing it for so long because it just seemed to hilarious to be true.  And then.... I downloaded the demo.  Let me tell you, at first, I was just, ""Oh, this game is so cute!  Look at these adorable interactions!""  I completed the demo with Yuuya and was completely enamored.  I /needed/ the full version.  Enter Steam, releasing it in HD.Dear Puddi, I never expected this game to give me what I got.  There's so much going on that you cannot glean from just playing one or two routes.  Play the whole thing.  Then play the BBL route and cry a million tears.  Cute game, yeah right.  More like vicious emotionally destructive game.  And I don't regret buying it--I regret laughing at it and putting it off as some dumb game.  Why there isn't more light on Hatoful is beyond me, because it's a beautiful game.  Does it have its errors?  Of course, doesn't every game?  It's well put together, though, and any errors in the script don't detract from the game (they may make you read the segment a few times, but it's definitely not game-breaking).  I've played a dating sim or two in my time, but this one is probably the best.  These are well-written characters, with feathers, of course.  It's easy to develop a connection with them because they are so well-written with hidden histories and pasts that you can find in Moa's mangas (available on Amazon!).TL;DR: If you have any preconceptions about this game, FORGET THEM.  Buy it and try it for yourself.  Don't watch someone else play it, and don't just brush it off as some dumb game, because it's definitely worth the hours it takes to play it fully and completely.  Happy Birding ♥P.S.: If you buy Hatoful and you enjoy it and want to put yourself through additional pain and misery, there is a sequel called ""Holiday Star,"" available in English (i.e.: you don't need to patch it) for about $3, if I remember right.  Just visit Moa's wordpress and you can get it!2016 Update:  I still love this game.  I still feel crushed every time I think about the true ending, and everytime I see an image of Shuu.  Definitely worth the money and time spent.			"

												Hatoful Boyfriend is a game where you go to bird school, which is for birds (and you, a human), and you date a bunch of different pigeons (or quails, or even a java sparrow) over a series of eight different routes. The game is relatively short in this aspect! I was surprised by how quickly I was getting through each route--even with fourteen endings to get (some sweet, some sad, some downright horrifying), the game itself feels surprisingly short.However, this is likely because completing specific routes unlocks the other ""half"" of the game, as such--a more straight-up visual novel that reveals the secrets behind St. PigeoNation's (the school that you attend) and exemplifies some pretty excellent worldbuilding for what, on the surface, appears to be a game about dating birds. It also delves further into the backgrounds of each of the main characters and will emotionally destroy you.The game has a few typos and questionably built sentences, but it's overall an enjoyable playing experience. The background art is pretty nice to look at and some of the music is so great I sort of regret not buying the collector's edition to get the soundtrack.10/10, would let pigeons emotionally destroy me again.

												Most reviews promise something unique and they are right. There is a lot of enjoyable writing in this ""game"" but to me it is worth neither the time nor the money needed to uncover it.The setting is hilariously absurd and the graphics are quite minimalistic (hand drawn backgrounds with a total of about a dozen photos of birds for the foreground). I quickly got used to both. What really spoils the experience for me is the horrible interface. This game is basically a novel where you click through lots of dialogue. One would assume that it provides a pleasant interface for that. This is not so:- The save function does not work when facing a decision - a natural point to save - and the saves seem to be broken at times.- There is much overlap between subsequent playthroughs so it is very tempting to use the fast forward function. However, that function does not stop when encountering those scarsely scattered bits of new dialogue. Also there is no rewind function so more often than not you miss some content. Why can't I just jump back and forth however I like? Even novels on paper have that feature.- I really miss an overview of the characters with full name that is always accessible. The game uses first names or nicknames most of the time but occasionally a character is refered to by last name and you only ever see these in the initial introduction.- Two of the endings have absolutely obscure trigger conditions and it took me a guide to get them.Finally, be aware what you're getting for the price: After watching the trailer and looking at the screenshots on the store page and you have seen a good part of the visual content. Apart from that it is a couple of thousand lines of entertaining text in a flawed ""engine"".			"

												It's 6:30 AM.I've been playing this for 3 hours straight.My eyes are soaked,my lips are salty and my fingers are shaking...Let's start a story from it's beginning,shall we?I bought this game without any thoughts about it,unless my girlfriend telling me it's freaking fun and epic.Even though it's orientated for females,I decided to get it and play.My first run,I decided to date my math prof.Loved how he always felt asleep,and since my girlfriend watched me play,we were giving hilarious voices to everybirdie.I ended up managing to date him,and after this success I rushed back into the game.Next came Nageki,and there we both were shocked at the issue of this relationship.I ended up dating everyone,and especially loved Okosan's and Anghel's endings.Laughing at it's maximum,especially when you're with good company.After a while,I couldn't stop playing.And one day...they gave me the choice to fullfil a promise.I looked at it wierd,and decided to not do it yet because I had endings to do still.Finally,I decided to go in and fullfil those promises this night,on my own,without anyone else.I started the game and decided to date Ryouta just to see the difference.Even though there was some wierd messages from time to time...The run went as usual.Until one day.../! SPOILERS FROM BAD BOY'S LOVE FROM NOW ON!/Until the day Ryouta found my head in a box,while every other classes found parts of my body in others.It was a shock to see that this adventure got bloody.With extreme shock and thirsth of knownledge,I decided to keep going,and find the truth...Everything went so fast,yet so slow.This dating sim has transformed into a dark thriller.Every seconds I was awaitting the Scarecrow to appear.Every seconds I was questionning things but never did I answer them.After 3 hours in this run,I reached the end of Bad Boy's Love.I now know the truth behind this storyline. And here I am,tears to the eyes,salt to the lips,my mind questionning restless...I was wrong about this game.When I first bought it,it looked funny.When I first played it,it was hilarious.When I played a lot,it grew tiresome but always so perfect.When I discovered the truth...It wasn't so funny anymore.I didn't know anymore who was evil,who was good,or who should be killed.I only know that this game is not any dating sim.This game...There is no words.My tears are still flowing,even after the 20 minutes I spent writting this.I still ask myself questions,and answered few.

It's cute and clever but also has a great cast of characters and a suprisingly dark backstory which you find out over the course of several playthroughs. As you get enough endings a full, much longer addition to the story is unlocked, taking it from a cute story about what beans to buy your date to a full-on political murder mystery. However weird you think the game is, I can promise that it's much, much weirder. And I love it.			"

												I, uh, I c-can explain! J-just give me a sec; it's not what it looks like! I got the game for t-the, um, story! Just listen, I'm going somewhere with this okay? *sigh* Okay, without further ado, I present to you...LASTING IMPRESSIONSHatoful BoyfriendGENREDating Simulator/Visual NovelSTORYIn Hatoful Boyfriend you take the role of Hiyoko Tosaka, a human going to a prestigious highschool for birds. The school in question is St. Pigeonation’s, and it's known mostly for being the world's greatest gathering place for birds. You're a sophomore now, but you haven't done much to adjust to the atmosphere of Pigeonation's just yet. You're not entirely lost though, as you also have one of the several woo-able birds with you, your hardworking best friend Ryouta Kawara. Along with him you can also bond with narcoleptic math teacher Nanaki Kazuaki, bashful aristocrat Sakuya Le Bel Shirogane, distant bookworm Fujishiro Nageki, suave ladies' man Sakazaki Yuuya, enigmatic doctor Iwamine Shuu, and hyperactive track star Okosan. With so much romance in the air, it's hard to believe the school holds so many dark secrets...GAMEPLAYEver read a book online? It's like that except every once in a while the books asks which choice you want to make. The choices you make will determine which bird you end up with, along with which ending you get for them. [Provided you don't get indesicive and go the way of the dodo, of course.] Each day you will be asked which class you want to take; this decides which trait will be leveled for that day. As previously mentioned, this will affect which ending you get for your desired bird.VISUALSNot much to say. It's pictures of birds with various backgrounds. The backgrounds look very nice, and there's quite a large amount of them. You also get a little end card pictures for your gallery after the end of each route. They're gosh darned cute.SOUNDTRACKThe soundtrack is a delightful mix of royalty-free, classics, and original [I think?] tracks. All of them fit perfectly with any of the situations at hand. [Except maybe when Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy plays, that's always just plain silly.] There's many tracks from Kevin MacLoed and SENTIVE; the sexy, suave Dispersion Relation, Simply Blue, Daybreak [Personal favorite.], and tons of ones with gibberish for names. The collector's edition is worth is just for the beautiful OST.SEQUELS [SPOILERS]Hatoful Boyfriend is the quintessential example of an idea that I've had for a while now; some games should never get sequels. While it's obvious that a bad game shouldn't deserve a sequel; I'm of the opinion that if a game is GOOD enough it shouldn't HAVE a sequel. If a game does all that it wishes, if a game provides a fulfilling, complete experience; it would be insulting to continue where the game left off. You may be thinking 'How does a game about dating birds provide a fulfilling experience?' I'll tell you; it's because the entire dating sim portion of the game is a mere facade. Once you've completed all possible routes at least once, you have the option to unlock BBL; a grim narrative that reveals the lore behind this game's world, the motivations and sins of characters, and completes all story arcs. The dating sim part of Hatoful Boyfriend is there simply to set up characters so that you know who this story is centered around. You know how they act by then, what their situations are, and this only helps to greatly strengthen the story. It's a fantastic conclusion, and it's one that left me speechless. Which brings us back to sequels. As I've said, a sequel to this game woud be a downright insult; a direct sequel that is. A direct sequel would be insulting, as the game would have nowhere to go with the current story; all arcs are completed. However, an indirect sequel would be a very, very smart idea if done correctly. By merely taking the characters we know and love and putting them in a different kind of story; the game has somewhere to go. Oh, and it did go somwhere, as an indirect sequel exists. [Holiday Star is its name if you were wondering. Not yet on steam though.]FINAL THOUGHTSI dove this game. To say that this was a pheasant experience would be the understatement of the century. While at first glance, it may look like quite the bad egg, it's surely a narrative you'll never forget. I'm talon you, it's all here! Great soundtrack, amazing characters, bird puns; it's just a quail of a time! The price ain't nothin to go squawkin' about neither, no need to worry about some ludicrous bill. This is the defenition of the phrase 'more than meets the eye' and you'd have to be some hard boiled individual not to enjoy the humor at the least. I know I'm gushing, but I just can't recommend this enough! While you're at it, make sure to kill two birds with one stone and buy the collector's edition with it. The soundtrack alone makes it worth it. Alright, I've egged you on for far too much now, I'll sparrow you of any more. Hatoful Boyfriend has left a resounding lasting impression; it's not what the source material is, it's what you do with it that makes it a golden goose egg. You've got your ducks in a row MediaTonic, keep it up.And now, in Japanese tradition, a haiku.Hatoful Boyfriend,A dating sim about birds.I was not prepared.			"

												I bought this game on a warm, sunny day back in May of 2015. Then I only played it for a few minutes before laughing it off and giving up. I didn't understand what it meant then. When I returned to the game a few months ago, I realized what it was like to need to 100% complete a game. I knew that I had to do all the endings to understand the masterpiece that was this game. I got sucked in. They didn't tell me how emotional this game would get. No one warned me about how far engrossed into the fantasy I would get. Sure, it's a game at first, but eventually it consumes you. These Pigeons just aren't images on the screen anymore.

 Hatoful Boyfriend	So my friend and I bought this game to have some cheeky giggles. And cheeky giggles were made. I aimed for Sakuya first, as did my friend. I succeeded, he died. It was good.When I got this game, I read the reviews.People said it got deep.I was like psh, nothing I cannot handle.I played through the first story.Some parts actually got me. I was like wow, this is deep. Ryouta's mother's death, Nageki's backstory, definitely hit harder	The game however, had a few laughs here and there and certainly did not look like it would be deep.However, there is a second story, a much longer story.This was a surprising turn on what the game looks to be.The story was very interesting, very well constructed.It was especially refreshing being able to play as another character, albeit not being able to choose. The length was great.The content was not only interesting, but deep and immersive. I don't entirely agree with the price, however I got this game whilst on sale, which was a great price.Regardless, I would definitely recommend this game to everyone, friends, family and random strangers. Even birds. the doctor is mine	 "

												Finally after years of being unsatisfied with the typical dating scene, I was ready for something new. That's when I found this game. My entire life has completely changed now that I can simulate dating pigeons. I don't have to stuff my feet into high heels or wait in line at the clubs anymore!  I don't even have to wear shoes at all! Or bathe! Yippee!!Thank you Hatoful Boyfriend!!			"

												In Hatoful Boyfriend, you play as Hiyoko Tosaka (or whatever you choose to name her), the only human in a school of pigeons. You can even get yourself a birdy boyfriend! There's Ryouta the childhood friend, Sakuya the fancypants, Yuuya the ladies man, and many more amazing avians. It plays out like a regular otome/visual novel does, read the text and make some choices. I bet you're thinking ""omg so random, dating pigeons lol"", and that's a natural response. But if you were to look up the definition of ""don't judge a book by its cover"", I'm pretty sure there would be a picture of Hatoful Boyfriend there.You see, the pigeon dating sim premise is just a cover for the real story. After you unlock certain endings with different birds, you can start a new game and the true story will reveal itself, aka the Hurtful Boyfriend (or Bad Boys Love) route. In BBL you will learn why Hiyoko is the only human at the pigeon school, why the pigeons can talk, why she needs to form a bond with the birds, and much more. I can only say so much without spoiling it, but be prepared for a mental meltdown. It is filled with drama, tragedy and unsettling content. After seeing certain endings in the dating sim part, you'll probably be thinking ""well, I've already seen some disturbing stuff... This will be a piece of cake"". LOL NOPE. The dating sim endings are nothing compared to the true BBL route. To put it simply, this game is like one of those sweet & sour candies; it looks and tastes sweet on the outside, but once you delve deeper in you'll reel back in shock and wonder wtf happened to the sugary outer shell.

												I purchased this game a while back, but didn't end up starting it until recently, on a whim.The characters are pretty basic at first glance, and the fact that they're, y'know, BIRDS makes it hard to play the game seriously at first.However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this game is NOT what it seems at first glane. Despite it starring birds, I quickly found myself investing my time into finishing every single character route in the game- and they were all GOOD.I'm serious, the birdiness of the characters stops hindering your investment in the story after a few playthroughs.And if not then, the 'BBL' route will garuntee your interest. Things get... complicated.TLDR: Definately worth 100% completing. Never thought I'd cry (twice) over a bird dating sim.			"

												This is the funniest VN on Steam right now. It features lots of funny little bird puns + a colorful cast of characters.It's a bit lacking as far as options and skip features go but each route is somewhat short so it's not really a major issue.I encounted 2 small issues over the course of 2 hours. The game would get stuck when you load a game right after viewing the gallery. Loading a game in the middle of playing a route also does not update the date immediately. It fixes itself upon reaching the next day.That was a weirdly entertaining VN. I'd give it a 4/5 for the bird theme combined with being vanilla (not to mention a good and awkward long route mixed with completing the game). If you like VNs that have a good sense of humor, I definitely suggest that you try Hatoful BF.			"

												GET THE GAME they said, FUNNY TO KISS BURDS they said.I thought it was dating simulator parody with pigeons, so decided to try it just for fun. After completing one character ending (appears to be not the most sad one in the game) I found out it's not just a funny game to promote original manga.Even if you don't like typical Japanese visual novels, you may like this game, because the story is interesting and looking at birds is fun. Each character has serious and touching backstory, and really good musical theme. Many tracks became my favourite.Though this game is quite serious, especially it's full ending, there are some funny jokes, and ""birdy"" versions of words make me smile too. ^.^Even the most funny characters of this game have not so funny stories, and some endings make you cry like a baby. Anyway, I'm glad the story is serious and interesting!			"

												One of my favorite games!  Or rather, one of my favorite stories.  This is a visual novel and real, game-changing choices are limited: you will follow the tracks you pick like a choose-you-own-adventure book, with fairly limited endings.  It's a great ""book"" though, and one I encourge you to read through!It helps if you've played at least one ""traditional"" dating sim (or watched a harem anime) before.  I think it might be more enjoyable if you know the tropes and character archtypes that are being played with here.The ""true"" ending of the game is unlockable after completing romantic routes with the main dateable cast.  I try not to talk about it with those who haven't played the game because it really is best to go into it unspoiled.  It is a very intense story that will answer some questions about the setting.  The main game plays with no worldbuilding, assuming you (as the character) have lived in the world your whole life and do not need the history of the bird world explained.  The true end (titled ""Hurtful Boyfriend"" or ""BBL"") opens up and tells you (as the player) what's really going on.  The whole truth, however, you'll need to discover for yourself, as information is given piece by suspensful piece as you realize how the characters are connected in a complex web that you probably won't expect.I bought the original version of this game a few years before the steam release, at the recommendation of a friend who LUVED it.  I only played a few routes on that version, but I liked it enough to purchase the updated version for sale here on steam.  The steam release is an updated version of the original game with newly drawn graphics, higher quality pigeon pictures, and most importantly a smoother, easier to read text box.  This version also includes a new side route to romance Azami.  I think it says something that I happily bought this game twice.Then, if you like the game and want more of this story, check out the sequel (Holiday Star), the manga side stories, and the drama CDS.  None of which are essential to enjoying the game, but are also very enjoyable in their own right!			"

												Hurtful Boyfriend is one of those games where even if you don't really care too much for the genre itself (this being Dating Sims/Visual Novels), it's still a wonderful and heartbreaking experience. At first the game seems light and funny, and it is depending on what path you take. But, the more time you spend learning about these characters and their sometimes tragic backstories, you grow attached to each of them in a different way. I really recommend this to anyone, Dating Sim fan or not.15/10 would search for Ultimate Pudding again.			"

												As you play the normal routes you receive clues that not everything as it seems. The characters are ACTUALLY birds, and you are ACTUALLY a human going to a Japanese bird school. This isn't played for laughs in the writing, even during the normal routes.There's no ""good end bad end"" endings but ""non-canon"" endings where, quite simply, you survive and successfully romance a bird (Except a few endings but you'll find those if you play).The BBL (Bad Boys Love): Hurtful Boyfriend ending unlocks when you've received all fourteen endings. BBL tells the canon story of the Hatoful world, explaining WHY you, Hiyoko Tosaka, are a human coexisting with highly evolved birds.It's a long convoluted story, taking approximately four hours to complete. The BBL ending plays like a normal route until about halfway through the school year, when Hiyoko is murdered.Sh*t hits the fan, and you don't have choices like a normal route. The game turns into a visual novel, only requiring you to click along to continue the dialogue and reveal the story.I think Hatoful's only real flaw (besides some typos, notably in Nageki's BBL ending) is the monotony if you're trying to unlock all the endings at once. Luckily there's a fast forward button.This is a good story. The Planet of the Apes scenario works well, and you become less concerned that this school is for birds, and more interested in the characters and why things have been a little weird this whole time. It takes dating game tropes and turns them into its own.Hatoful completely flips the direction of typical dating games, to tell a good story, and remains self-aware the whole time.I really like this game and encourage people who enjoy strong writing to play it. 10/10. Would attend birb school again.			"

												I know what everyone who hasn't played this is thinking; ""A dating sim for BIRDS, are you crazy?"" I've already seen remarks like ""Why does this even exist?""Well, I'm here to tell you why. It's wonderful, hilarious, uplifting yet simultaneously heart-wrenching, and sometimes even TERRIFYING. No one takes it seriously at first glance, but they /learn/. It's a carefree experience where you pursue a pigeon boy of your choice and everything is sunshine and rainbows. But, you quickly start to realise that Something Isn't Right. There's something going on at this school, and it's not just Okosan's search for the perfect pudding...So here's my recommendation. Play this game. Play through every route. Start a new game, and then, then you will understand why this game is amazing. Trust me, I dated birds before it was cool.Edit: I forgot to add, this game is also hilariously self aware.			"

												Do you like dating sims? No? Yes?Well, that doesn't matter, because ""Hatoful Boyfriend"" is hilarious, and deserves a playthrough either way.I know there's tons of reviews for this game already, so there's not much else I can say that everyone hasn't said before, but what I can say is that I walked in blind, and it ended up being one of my favorite games. It's a treasure with a surprising amount of (dark) meat hidden beneath its little avian heart.You will get attached to the pidgeons. Even if they are popular otome game stereotypes, each one ends up having tons of heart. (Some much more than others--LOOKING AT YOU, CREEPY DOCTOR SHUU) My personal favorite routes were Ryouta and Nageki's, along with Yuuya. Still, there's something for everyone, with some of the routes becoming surprisingy poignant.The translation, despite a few typos, is delightful, and the writing was very clearly done with love. Even if the art is quite literally stock photos of birds, don't let that dissaude you: It's actually a very well-made game.The special route, the ""Bad Boys' Love"" Route, also deserves a mention, as it elevates the game from ""fun gimmick"" to ""wow this is actually really well-done"".And for those who want more of the fun (and pain), the Christmas sequel, ""Holiday Star"", is a nice addition to the franchise. All in all, while I'd wait to get this game on sale in a combo pack with the sequel and some bonus material, it's worth a playthrough no matter what.It's birdy-ful.			"

												Hatoful Boyfriend is a visual novel about birds. It is actually a parody of visual novels, with the classic character archetypes you'd expect in a school setting in an anime/visual novel: the childhood friend, the snob rich guy, the athletic guy...What differentiates it from other visual novels is, of course, the fact that these characters are all birds. That makes many normal situations inherently hilarious. However, do not dismiss it as just a comedy game. Beneath all the ""haha, birds"" is a strangely compelling and engrossing story. There's a surprising attention to detail, from the random bird facts it throws out sometimes to the well-thought-out world full of interesting characters.I have few complaints about the game, but the main one would be the lack of an ""auto-skip only seen text"" option. To get all the endings you need to replay the game multiple times, which is immensely helped by the auto-skip button. However, the auto-skip will also happily skip over unseen content if you let it be. That can lead to missing certain scenes.Still, I really like this game. It was far, far better than what I expected and is probably one of the best visual novels I have ever played. I also hate it. Because now nobody will believe me when I say that a game about birds is so good.			"

												I wasn't really appealed by this one first. But I don't know why I've put in my head that maybe the character was dreaming. She wasn't at all. Nope, you're living with birds that developed their brains to the points that they do what a human can do. Being the only human into a prestigious school, how will your girl choose her life?Because there is some romance in it but also humor (with San's quest for pudding) or horror (Shuu's human portrait never gave me a hint about his... destructive personality). Anyway, if you can't ""blend"" with your birdie, you're dead. Yes. You're being killed. Well, it's the bad ending. But between staying and living with birds like San, Sakuya or Ryouta or living the way of the sparrow with the only female bird or asking yourself why you're following Anghel into a surnatural plot and many others...Anyway, Hatoful Boyfriend is a fresh game: as not everything is revolving about dating, as there is mysteries too and with all the humor inside... Even the characteristics are minimal: wisdom, charisma or vitality. The graphics are also colorful and as the characters are birds... they're just good pictures. The soundtrack is also good: I never imagined a Christmas-themed horror tune for the doctor....But I do think that the best story inside is the hidden one, where you're investigating a real mystery inside. It was really elaborate and you see that Hatoful Universe is more complex than what you could have imagined.I don't regret to have changed my mind about this game. It's really a good one in the VN universer, so, go for it!			"

I even enjoyed going through all the endings. Usually doing that just feels like all I gain from doing it is achievements, but it did also put me in a good mood and I don't feel like I wasted my time.Also, I never thought I'd cry an ocean for a bird.

												My previous review seriously didn't give this game the credit where it was due. This game is seriously by far one of the most rollercoaster-y experiences I've ever had.I'll admit, I bought this game because I thought it was a joke of a game; you start off by dating a menagerie of birds, all with differing personalities and different endings. Some are pure humor, others are tinged with sadness, and still others will make you question what the hell you just played (and even then, there's two ways you could go with this). I had some knowledge of the backstory beforehand, but I wasn't prepared for what came next.The endgame takes the main game's rollercoaster of feels and turns it up to 11. Once a happy, satirical dating simulator, the game shifts to a murder mystery with one simple stroke. Over three hours worth of dialogue to digest, and over three hours of sheer emotional WTF; springboarding from utter despair to stifling a giggle at Okosan's antics is a bit jarring, but the game pulls it off rather well.And the true ending?If people take this review seriously and get the game, I just gotta say that it is by far one of the most touching endings I've experienced. If nothing else, this game should be played JUST because of the endgame. The main game is a comedic and incredibly well-constructed setup to a tragic, emotionally charged ending that's satisfying in its own way. I completely, 100 percent recommend Hatoful Boyfriend as a game that everyone should experience in their life, as soon as possible. ps yuuya best birb "

												Take my word for this, the story is very deep and interesting. It's not what you think it is. Get the Collector's Edition for the great desktop wallpaper. I've played this game for only two hours, and I already feel immersed in this VN's universe. It's like you think it's just a joke and all, like Goat Simulator 2014 or something. But then you read and keep reading, and the story reveals itself. Trust me, if you bought this game as a joke or something, spend some time with it; you will like it I guarantee. Especially if you are not into otome specifically, but are just interested in a very intriguing and fascinating story. Make sure to finish all story lines to understand the depth of the VN. The puns and references too, they just push this game overboard to one of the best visual novels and dating sims on steam.			"

												The year is 2187. Birds are powerful. smarter. The war between birds and humans is suposedly over. You enrol at St. PigeoNation’s, as a mediatior between birds and humans. Can you a find love to save your life?? and even then...is it all for naught?This game usually is bought as a joke, but the game can not be any more serious. The endings will make you gasp, cry, and question your life choices. The ""true"" ending is like reading a visual novel, connecting all the endings of all the other birds to get a good background of the horror of whats really going on and leaves you at the edge of your seat, wanting more.Hatoful Boyfriend hides behind the facade of cute birds and pretty pictures, but in reality, the story is truely wonderful and deep and heartbreaking.

Posted: September 7, 2014
												Let's be honest: we all buy Hatoful Boyfriend for the sheer absurdity of what is, at its core, a visual novel pigeon dating game. And, on its surface at least, Hatoful Boyfriend is a shallow dating sim where the human main character is enrolled at St. PigeoNation's, a school for pigeons. She takes classes, she goes to festivals, and she romances and falls in love with various species of birds. However, Hatoful Boyfriend's stereotypical high school romance exterior is only an entertaining and light-hearted charade that covers up a plot full of politics, intrigue, mystery, and sorrow.The first half of Hatoful Boyfriend is quirky and humorous, filled with various pop culture jokes and absurd situations. Players find themselves romancing one of several standard character archetypes: the childhood best friend, the lazy professor, the haughty aristocrat, the womanizing jock, the bullied library nerd, and so on. The scenarios are cute and heart-warming, with each character having their own separate little storyline. Every short playthrough of the game—which frequently take under an hour even if you read all of the text—ends with a primarily sappy romantic ending.As players go through multiple playthroughs of Hatoful Boyfriend, however, a more insidious underlying plot is slowly revealed. Every romantic plot line will unveil more pieces of St. PigeoNation's dark history and the tragic cast of characters that attend classes there. These pieces on their own add spice to an otherwise bland dating sim that seems to cash in on its unique and somewhat ridiculous premise of a human girl dating pigeons. And, if one were to stop playing Hatoful Boyfriend after only a couple of playthroughs, that would be the feeling that one would be left with: Hatoful Boyfriend is an amusing dating game to spend an afternoon on, but nothing remarkable.However, players that choose to stop playing Hatoful Boyfriend after only a few short playthroughs are missing out on the part of Hatoful Boyfriend that makes it an excellent game. If the first thirteen playthroughs of Hatoful Boyfriend are an amusing way to pass an afternoon, then the last playthrough is a gut-wrenching ride through a twisting plot that ties together everything the player has done up to that point. The short of it is this: this isn't just a game that you should play, it's a game that you should strive to complete 100% of the way.			"

												Well, this was probably the most surprising game I've ever played. I thought I'd just be sitting down for maybe an hour or two to play a parody of those saccharine Japanese dating sims we all know and love, and get a pretty good laugh out of how I'd actually be dating pigeons *plot twist*.But man oh man....this game was so much more than that.Amidst the amazing bird puns and language puns, what I thought would be a cute and slightly disturbing story about falling in love with a bird was actually a much darker, very complex and enigmatic story that just got curioser and curioser upon the playthrough of each route. And the final playthrough, the *complete* route was maybe twice or thrice the length of a normal route? And omg the plot twists. The plot twists.Basically, this game was the most pleasant and life-scarring surprise I ever received. Totally worth 7 hours of my life. By the end, which pigeon you'll date will be the least of your problems!			"

												This game isn't entirely bad, but I don't think it's worth the money.On the plus side:The game is unique.The secret ending that you can unlock is fairly interesting.On the minus side:The writing, especially for the non-secret parts of the game, is quite poor and does little or nothing to attach you to the characters, and the jokes are rarely funny. The decisions you get to make are not all that interesting.Only a minority of the text is different between the various non-secret paths. The majority is exactly the same, so you end up seeing the same text repeatedly.The UI lacks the features one would expect from a game in this genre, and generally seems a bit shoddy. You can't save at decision points. There's no way to easily skip over the text you've already seen to get to the new stuff, which is especially egregious given how much duplication there is between paths. (You can fast-forward, but it skips right over the new text too.) And there's no way to review the dialogue if you accidentally miss a line.There are some bugs. At one point, the game became unresponsive to input and I had to kill it, losing my progress since the last save. At another point, my saved game became corrupted and I had to start over. These were rare enough that they weren't really a problem, but they happened. Just save sometimes and use more than one slot.The secret path - which is really the only reason to get this game - has effectively no interactivity. It's just an exercise in tapping the space bar and reading text for an hour. That said, it's at least fairly interesting text.The non-secret paths are short and the game as a whole will probably take about 7-10 hours if you have the patience to go through it all.As somebody else said, it seems like the whole rest of the game is just a setup for the secret ending. It was something of a slog to get to that secret ending, but I did enjoy it once I got there. But I can't recommend this game at full price. You're basically paying for several hours of banal ""play"" in order to get the reward of reading a non-interactive but fairly interesting short story. For the money you can buy much better full-length books, and there are plenty of fascinating short stories to read online for free. But if you really want to read a short story about anthropomorphic pigeons, Hatoful Boyfriend might be for you.			"

♥♥♥♥ Her Right In The Cloaca - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com]Everyone just wants to find love in this wild, crazy world of ours. Everyone just needs a shoulder to lean on, or an open ear to whisper their darkest secrets to. That's all anyone really wants. Even the ones that don't seem like they want love, they're the ones that need it the most.Some people find love in family, or camaraderie. Some people find it in romance, or art. Some might find it at the bottom of a family-size bag of Cheetos while they jack off to pictures of girls with tails. Hey, everyone has their thing. Everyone is entitled to their own form of love. Unless they're humping their dog or their child, in which case it's illegal and they can find love in a prison shower.People can find love everywhere and anywhere. Life finds a way. Even if you must go beyond your comfort zone. Beyond your race, your culture, and your people. Love knows no limits. Not even the sky. Because who wouldn't ♥♥♥♥ a bird?I know I sure would. And if you don't think you're up to it, you haven't played this masterpiece yet. This isn't just a game. It's a journey. A life-changing experience. Prepare to have your eyes opened to the truth.Hatoful Boyfriend actually falls under the category of visual novel, as it's a Japanese otome game. Otome is Japanese for sausage fest. You're playing a girl getting aggressively humped by every guy in the immediate vicinity. Which, in this case, are all birds. And you get to make the exciting choices that will determine not only who's eggs you'll be laying, but the fate of the world as we know it.Hatoful Boyfriend was originally developed for the PC in 2011, later seeing multiple rereleases and upgrades before getting an HD remaster that released on Steam, PS4, and PS Vita.Hatoful Boyfriend is, simply by existing, worth checking out. No where else can you experience the excitement of being the only human girl at an all-birds high school. It's the only of its kind, and simply the premise itself should warrant at least a single playthrough.Not only is it relevant simply because of its premise, but it also works rather well simply on its premise alone. If you're picking it up simply because ""LOOK, BIRDS"" you'll get exactly what you're looking for. It's wacky, zany, kooky bird fun. Good stuff.But underneath that simple premise, a surprising amount of depth is layered. Spoiler alert, dating birds at an all-birds school is not something people usually do. Usually. It's not quite a mainstream way of life yet, but we're rallying for our lifestyle to be recognized by the masses. Someday, human-bird relationships might be accepted. Birds don't even have access to public schooling yet, so we have a ways to go.Shockingly, Hatoful Boyfriend is a parody dating sim. A joke game of sorts, satirizing the otome genre. All of the cliches, all of the character stereotypes, they're all here. You can expect all of basics to be here. Maid costumes and all. It's tasteful satire, not in an overbearing ""LOOK GUYS WE'RE MAKING JOKES HERE"" kind of way. The writing is hilarious, and carries a sort of ironic whimsy to it. It's fully aware of its nature, but runs with it regardless. It is a visual novel, which means reading, which means no this is not an action game or anything vigorous like that. Unless you wanna dip your little parakeet perch in honey and bird seed so you can stick it through the bars of grandma's lovebird cage while you play. Those HD character portraits are pretty feathery.It's not only poking fun at otome visual novels, it's in fact written well enough to be a competent example of the genre that it's making a mockery of. The characters are interesting and compelling in their own right, even if they are just caricatures of otome stereotypes given bird form. They're fleshed out with a surprising amount of detail, given that the nature of the game didn't require much to begin with. Just ""look, they're birds that you can date, this one is the jock bird and this one is the nerd bird"" would have sold just as well. If you happen to fall in love with the excellently written birds and words, a lot is in store for you. They've done a beyond fantastic job of rewarding the player for dedication. As a dating sim should, there are multiple endings. At least one for each character, and sometimes two. One ""true ending"" should you flawlessly woo them, and the just okay ending. Where you confess your love and they say ""thanks"". Going the extra mile for more endings will reward you by unlocking even more endings. Better endings.And should you stick around long enough for every single ending, you will be generously rewarded with the best part of the game. There's a lot of tough choices to make, but if you make them all it will be so worth it.Fantastic writing, characters, atmosphere, and a stunning amount of depth and meaning really make Hatoful stand out among other visual novel games. But it's not without issues, though they're more to blame of the genre itself than anything else.After you've played through the game for the first time, regardless of which bird you hope to woo, much of the game remains the same. You'll be going to the same classes, seeing a lot of similar dialogue, and riding the fast-forward text button a ton. That's the biggest flaw with the game.The other being, as I mentioned, the game rewarding people that stick through the game until the very end. Because it's a really big reward. Like, possibly the size of the rest of the game itself in its entirety. I can totally understand why they did it, because the reward itself doesn't carry quite the same impact and meaning until you've played through every ending. It's a steep hill to climb, with a pay-off to match.To go any further would spoil just how perfect the ending is, but it stays true to its absurdity all the way to the end. It honestly blew me away how much depth they put into it. It's really not a one-trick pigeon, as it might lead you to believe.People might dismiss it as ""that weird bird game"" or ""creepy Japanese♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; or ""memes"". They might play it purely for the ""look at me lol I'm so random"" factor, or the jack off to those luscious, feathery bodies. But you realize you're dismissing, stereotyping, and fetishizing a way of life. There's more to it than that. There's depth here. We're more than a stereotype, and I'm tired of needing to hide who I am.Educate yourself, open your mind, and accept that some people have a different lifestyle than you. Some people want to have a nice family with kids in a suburban house. They want that white picket fence life. And some people, they really like birds. Not that there's anything wrong with that. And if you think there is, I think you need to check your privilege. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												I came here to laugh, not to feel. And however, i liked it. Hatoful Boyfriend, beyond his WTF aspect (which is totally assumed    ) has a really deep story  with many caracters and endings. Some of them are predictables, some others... less, but each is a delight to discover. I didn't expect that at all, especially when you talk to pigeons. For a first Visual Novel game, i have to say that i chose wisely. I don't know if it's worth 10 bucks (or 8€ here) since it's still a Visual Novel but in sale for 2€, i totally recommand it. Plus, your friends will look at you (h)awkwardly when you'll say you're into birds. And that is the best part of this game.			"

												This game. This is the game that got me started on visual novels. It is one of the best.There are very few words that can describe this game, to be honest. On the outside, it looks like just a game about dating pigeons - a weird concept, to be sure, but hey, we're not judging.Once you start to play the game, things get different. Hatoful Boyfriend is a story-rich, emotional game where you just happen to date pigeons. The character development is deep, the storylines that are behind each love interest are engaging, and more than once I have found myself sobbing because pigeons.If you're a fan of visual novels and want to try something unique, this would be the game to try.

The payoff if you get enough endings to unlock the hidden story route is well worth it.  This is a game with much more going on under the surface than it would at first seem!			"

												If you've enjoyed games like the Tokimeki Memorial or the Princess Maker series, give this one a try! If you have never touched any of the genre or are doubtful to try, let me give you a piece of advise. You can't really say this game has a high replayability value, but rather the replayability is the game! Gathering all the ends is just the way you go through an intro to all the characters, just to have the real story (BBL ending) unfold upon you, so don't trash it after the first try: if you plan to get to the credits and uninstall the game, don't even bother buying it. If you plan to actually read the dialogs... congratulations! You're gonna love it :DPros:- fresh new approach - awesome RP value!- nice music- hilarious gags- skip button for all those known bitsCons:- stats values in this game have virtually no effect- main stories are rather short and dull compared to similar games- your input is rather limited so endings are rather easy to access, makes it too linear  "

												Honestly, this game is just great. Obviously, if you don't like visual novels/dating sims, this isn't the game for you. The game presents itself as very humorous, which it is, but underneath that you'll find an actual story that's really interesting and great. It does a great job of parodying the dating sim genre. I've played a couple other dating sims before, but I've definitely enjoyed this one most of all. The routes aren't cliche, and present items to the story rather than gooey love plots. I reccommend playing all of the routes, and then playing the extra route (also play all the routes first, or else you'll have to play bbl again to get the special ending, and bbl is rather lengthy.) I cannot praise this game enough. If visual novels (or dating sims, but honestly you don't even have to like dating sims in my personal opinion to enjoy this game) with an interesting story are your cup of tea, I'd recommend buying this game.

Hatoful BoyfriendA game by birds, for birds, of birds.  What can I even begin to say about this game? What can anyone say about this game? Is this even a game? I can't really tell much anymore.  So, if it isn't blatantly obvious by the big blue thumbs-up right over there to the left a little bit, I like this game. A lot. In fact, it has surpassed, to me, the likes of Undertale, Borderlands, and my previous favourite game in existence (Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky, which I would absolutely recommend you try via emulator if you haven't played it already), to reign supreme above them all.Why?Well, I'm glad you asked. That's what this ""Review"" feature on Steam is for. It's a really handy little thing.TL;DR Review  So, first off, the short version for all of you who'd like to get a general consensus on my feelings about this game and why you should have bought it already, and then bought it for a friend or seven immediately afterwards, and for those who want to avoid knowing much about it. Trust me, you really do want to go into this game knowing as little as possible.  Hatoful Boyfriend is a dating simulation game about birds. Pigeons, to be exact. It has you play the only human girl in a school full of the things, and it's your job to get one of them to like you enough to have beautiful, mutated half-bird/half-human hybrid children a couple years down the line with.    Of course, you've got a wide selection to choose from. You have your typical tropes that can be found in most of these sort of visual novel-style games, such as the ""best friend"" character and the character who thinks they're above everyone else, but there's also some more varied personalities, including a creepy doctor and someone who thinks they live in a JRPG.  If you're a fan of these sorts of point-and-click narrative-driven experiences, then you'll adore Hatoful Boyfriend, as it both combines a legitimately enthralling narrative with a grand amount of humour, wit, and a tendency to subvert the tropes the genre is based on.   It plays great, it looks great, and if you find that you like the characters' personalities, which are the driving force of the experience, then there is not a doubt in my mind that you will find yourself having fun when going through, even if it's just for the first couple of routes you decide on. Which, by the way, there are a total of sixteen of spread out amongst the game. It's honestly pretty impressive.  Alright, now that that's out of the way, please play the game before reading any further. I'm dead serious. I do not spoil anything directly other than the personalities of each individual character and a couple other minor things, but I assure you that the experience is much better suited to play absolutely on your own. Go buy it right now, sit down, get a couple endings, and come back if you so choose.Or just ignore me and keep reading. Whatever's your cup of tea.The Actual ReviewTake this as a secondary line of caution even if you don't need one, but I cannot quite fit the full review on here. Instead, I've made a Google Document containing the rest of it.If you really want to slog through all of my detailed opinions, you can do so here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O9psrhGKXXMgyj4W_GMLPY_5jq0LQl8koUbumt1PyM0Long story short, though, buy this game.

Some of them are ridiculously dramatic, and they're made better when you remember that these are all pigeons. I still don't understand the whole only human at the school thing though.

												I was originally gifted this game in jest, and one day decided to further the joke by making this a 'perfect game' on my account. What's ironic is that without gunning for all the achievements on this, I would never have played Hatoful Boyfriend past the first one or two endings. Why? Well, the surface dating sim is fun enough - but unless you're using a guide or are very skilful with your save points, it can get tedious working through each bird's story branch as you're left sitting through a lot of repetitive text again and again.Now don't get me wrong - some of the storylines are truly adorable Ryouta! <3, a handful aren't afraid pull hard on your heartstrings Nageki ;_;, while others are legitimately insane and make me worry for the developers Shuu and Oko both take the cake (or pudding?) on this one. But after a while, the number of new choices you make in comparison to the amount of old text you have to skip through skews unfavourably, and has probably stopped thousands of people from perservering with getting all the endings. It's just a bird dating gimmick, so why play any more - right? But it's a real shame, as by dropping out early they miss the actual end to the game... which is where the real meat of Hatoful Boyfriend lies. What was once a bizarre, fluffy visual novel turns into... well. I don't want to give too much of the game away, but what I can say is this; the final ending for Hatoful Boyfriend masterfully elevates a goofy gimmick into one of the most breath-taking segments of in-game storytelling I have ever come across. What the developers have managed to do with a few still shots and some bird photographs is spectacular, and I will never be able to sing enough praise for the range and depth of emotion this final chapter hauled me through. I also love how skilfully all the other endings feed into the story being told, and after completing it you'll completely understand the developer's decision to make it inaccessible until you've seen everything else first.TL;DR: Hatoful Boyfriend is simultaneously as much of a car crash as it is a masterpiece, and if you are a fan of gaming classics then I cannot recommend this little gem of a title enough. There's a long, hilarious, bizarre and eventually boring lead-up to the real meat of the game, but if you can stay patient and let yourself warm up to the crazy cast of characters the game has to offer, your efforts will be rewarded with a level of storytelling that puts many bigger titles to shame. If you were actually after a dating sim then don't expect anything too romantic or racey - the storylines are fluffy at best and heartbreaking at worst. 'Dating sim' might be the cutesy pink wrapping paper, but it's the emotional journey you are taken on which lies at the heart of this wonderously endearing game.Eleven out of ten... would cry my god damn heart out for Ryouta again.

												This is not the game you might think it is at first sight.It is a dating simulation about a Highschool for birds which you go to as the only human.I bought this game, because I thought it was some kind of joke and just wanted to be entertained by the concept of dating birds.But after I played a little bit more, I realized how good this game actually is.The first ending that I encountered genuinely blew me away, I don't want to spoil anything, but the tone shift that happens there is really intriguing and wanted me to experience the other endings.So I played further and I wasn't disappointed at all, even if the first one is still my favorite, I really enjoyed all the other endings and the slowly revealing main story of the game.So play it already!

												This isn't just a pigeon dating sim, there is a lot to this visual novel with plenty of choices and deep storylines. I may have gotten a little too emotionally invested in a few of the storylines and cried on more than one occasion. For those wondering about the achievements, they're fairly easy to get, and the game has a skip button which is helpful if you find yourself selecting similar responses and remembering how the story went (though do be careful because it's a fast skip and you might miss something).The extra ending that you get is worthwhile reading through, with a run time of around 2 - 3 hours depending on your reading speed.

												Easily in the top tier of bird dating games, this remastered version of the first game in the series has many story paths ranging from lightheared and funny, to dark and eerie.  With many birds to take your fancy and additional bonus features, I hope the sequel also gets the HD treatment as it's also very good.  Quirky enough to make you interested, and just deep enough to keep reading while not taking itself too seriously.			"

												This game isn't even a dating sim.  It's not some joke game about screwing birds.  It's not even a parody of dating sims.This game actually just has the best story in a game since To The Moon.  At a first glance it's just a joke of a game, but the simplistic outlines lures you into getting to know the characters.  Then once you've begun to understand them, sudenly this option shows up that wasn't there before.Next thing you know you're thrown into a heart wrenching story about the conflict of this crazy world the game takes place in.  You learn more about how these characters backstories were intertwined, and it helps you determine the fate of humanity to come.Don't take this as some sarcastic review making a big deal out of some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.  This is an honest review about a game that I honestly love.			"

												Hatoful Boyfriend went from a cute little joke to being one of my all time favorite games. I didn't think much when my friend gifted me a Pigeon dating simulator- BOY WAS I WRONG! The path's were the basic cliche's that all dating sims have, I thought that was the basis with a pigeon motif. Further on in the game I began to piece together a few little surprises, and let's just say the final puzzle piece is a big one. This isn't your average date!....it's an experience...I think the only bad points I had with the game were with the skip button. If you're not smart with it you will skip over new diologue so you usually will have to play through the whole thing each new birdie which can get tedious. I missed a few cute moments with this so be careful before you skip!			"

												I never expected my first game review to be about dating pigeons, nonetheless,My brother bought this for me as a joke, which, it was made for April Fools day (not very suprising).I began playing a few days later, closed it out after a few lines of dialogue. I went back to it a few days later and began actually dating the birds.At first, I made jokes, but a few routes in, I, a bit disturbingly so, was enchanted by this weird little game. I really enjoyed the characters and their quirks, and was actually into the story and how everything played out. (I was a bit annoyed at the loose ends on some storylines.) Then it came to the Bad Boys Love storyline (which, I wanted to do last, but not following guides I believed it to be Anghel's storyline (due to his options showed up around the same time)). This one went from cute bird dating sim to psychological horror/murder mystery quickly . This is when I started to get into it more and have a much stronger connection to the characters. Without spoiling, this route is what left such a positive impression on me, because it built on previous routes and tied up things that were not yet mentioned. After finishing that route (and epilogue) , I was restless because I just wanted more.Now, I'm in a game slump, not wanting to play other games, waiting for the sequel, Holiday Star to be released.Now my computer background is pigeons.10/10			"

												Initially, Hatoful Boyfriend struck me as a purely comedic otome game. Like many who chose to play it, I decided to go through it for kicks. Eventually, I learned that it is not what it seems at all. The more I progressed through the game the more immersed I became in it. I forgot all about the fact that it was meant to be a dating simulator where you court birds. I learned that it possesses all the trappings of classic visual novels. It is rife with plot twists and angst. The story is surprisingly deep, something I found to be a relief. As you go through the routes you obtain more and more pieces of the proverbial puzzle. They fit together pretty nicely at the end. I was glad to know that it is more than just some silly thing.Although it has many elements and troupes that are common in such games it presented them in a unique way, I think. However, my taste for it was admittedly acquired. After having went through a route in its entirety I became bored of many of the jokes and scenarios which had been scattered throughout it. For a time it was a bit of a chore to go through. Thankfully, the skip button helps you rush through the things you have already read, cutting out unnecessary game-time. You definitely need to be patient when going through Hatoful Boyfriend. I personally feel that in order to get the most enjoyment out of it you should go through one route at a time. That way you will have plenty of time to reflect on what happened as well as keep your interest in the plot fresh.PROS:> Overall, Hatoful Boyfriend is short and sweet. A basic route can be finished in an hour even if you are a slow reader. This makes it a great thing to play before going to bed or when you just need to kill some time for a while.> The art is soft, and the scenery colorful, making the backdrops pleasant. It is simple, but is still able to add to the mood.> While many of the characters and their stories are tried-and-true they are still ones you can get attached to (for the most part, anyway).> There is more than one unlockable route.> The story becomes more advanced as you progress through the game.CONS:> The protagonist is simple and impressionable.> During the main routes you do not get a lot of route-exclusive content. A lot of the scenarios are the ones you go through during the main story, so you end up having to read through much of what you already have.> The running gags get old fast.> You are unable to save at decision screens and must do so just before you are about to make a choice.> There are very few CGs.> Sometimes your saves will bring you to a backdrop and you cannot do anything at all so you have to exit and re-open the game (save your game in multiple slots just in case!).All in all, I think that Hatoful Boyfriend is enjoyable. I feel that it rewards you well for your diligence. The final, true story that is Hatoful Boyfriend is great. I absolutely love the BBL ending, and think that it was worth all the time I spent working to get it. I believe that it is a fairly solid purchase. "

												Here is a game as joyous and painful, as mysterious and memorable, as high school itself. Hatoful Boyfriend captures the longing of the lonely, the brute insult of bigotry, and the wonder of even the most simplistic actions making the world feel right again in post-apocalyptic dystopian future. Compassionate, dramatic, this is writing that always knows when to take a moment for humor AND pathos. Let the deep and highly metaphoric story sink in over multiple playthroughs or you will be missing out on some of the best divergent storytelling of the generation.As you click through interaction after interaction just know that others are out there are taking time to do the same. Slowly begin to realize that some people can be trusted. It was people that made this game, after all, people finally aware of the  consumer fatigue of space marines and dragons. You may never fully rehabilitate into a properly functioning member of human society by their standards but you understand, just as I understand, that it is people that we do NOT understand. Remember, birds can be trusted, birds always come back. Some people are meant to be with people, and others, like us, are just different. We may not have the shiniest of neck feathers and our ultimate failing is to be aware that we are not aware. But we have finally found somewhere we can live in peace.Let us never forget the healing power of columbidae society but let us always try to remember to wash our berries before we eat them. Our digestive and respiratory systems may be different but blood is pumped into the heart from the body through the veins, the blood then enters the right atrium, then gets transported through the right ventricle and then is moved to into the lungs and oxygenated just the same.""In some things they shame us, by and large. Once mated, they are wed for life, unless forcibly separated. When set to the task, such as a long race, they will persevere and endure through measures of hell that only the best of men will willingly undertake. It might be argued that they are simply, dumbly, following the programming of instinct, that they can do nothing differently. Perhaps that can be said of us as well.""- Where Pigeons Go to Die.			"

												I have been so excitedly telling everyone about this game I actually forgot to properly review it.It's a bit late now, but for the principle of it:This is a perfect parody of dating sims - which laughs WITH fans of the genre instead of laughing AT them - used as a long-form introductory wrapping to a marvelous, intensely emotional visual novel about dreams, friendship and hope.… with pigeons.Although I had heard of the game since its release in English, i couldn't play it and stayd away from spoilers and forums, and I am SO glad I did! The impact of wandering the various storylines is so much more intense when you have no idea what's about to happen… The game manages to surprise & shock you almost every. single. time, despite your probable initial expectations that ""a dating sim with pigeons? NOTHING will shock me any more…"" JUST. YOU. WAIT.I have the deepest respect and admiration for the author, who managed to take a lighthearted April's fools joke demo and turn it into such a well-thought, deep and engaging real story… without sacrificing any of the initial fun & WTFness. This is a masterpiece of storytelling.And yet, when all is over and you're still reeling from the emotional rollercoaster that is the second half of the game (for best effect, play the ""fulfilling a promise"" path LAST, and in one single sitting!), the only way you feel you can describe the game to outsiders still seems to be : ""it's a dating sim… but with pigeons. And then it gets INTENSE, and you will cry.""10/10, would cry again.PS: Okosan is the most precious cinnamon r- err, pudding of all birdies, and deserves all the hugs.			"

												Hatoful Boyfriend is quite a known dating sim, mostly taken as a joke since the people you'redating are birds. On the outside, Hatoful Boyfriend seems like a joke, something that you play with friends and have a few laughs. But once you've actually gotten into the game, you notice that it actually got quite a dark background to it.I found Hatoful Boyfriend through the Youtuber Cryaotic, where he played a bit of it. And after seeing his videos, I decided to give it a go myself and bought it from Steam. I started to play it and went through the common route, thinking that the puns were actually pretty funny and it wasn't a bad game at all, but I didn't see it as a serious story or anyting like it.But then I stumbled onto one of the routes, and I realised that most character routes can be really serious. There's something weird about this school and the fact that you're the only human in a school of birds, and the further I got into the game the darker it got.Hatoful Boyfriend seems like a joke on the outside, but it got a well made and dark story once you're actually playing it.Would I recommend Hatoful Boyfriend?Well, yes. Of course I would.You date birds.			"

												Looking at the other reviews here, I get the sense that many people enjoyed ""Hatoful Boyfriend"" on their first couple play-throughs, but then put it down and never played it again once they felt the joke had worn off.Big mistake.It's advertised as a lulz-y ""pigeon dating simulator."" And it definitely is that, at first. But keep playing, and it becomes much, MUCH more. And I don't just mean ""it'll hit you in all the feelz!""I mean that the game pulls the rug out from under you completely, and becomes something else entirely.Anything more would be a spoiler, so I'll keep my mouth shut. I'll just say this: there's something like 8 different birds you can romance. Keep re-playing the game until you've gotten the ending for each of them (each playthrough lasts about an hour, but you can fast-forward through bits you've already seen before). Then fire it up again, and get ready for a ride......(I realize I haven't reviewed the actual game here. Briefly: the characters are memorable and endearing, the various plot strands come together in a very satisfying way, and even though I rarely play visual novels or dating sims, I loved this game. Very highly recommended)			"

												Hatoful Boyfriend. Where do I begin. This game is without question the best First Person Shooter I have ever played. It reels in the few great aspects of the game Battlefield, and a few of the amazing attributes from the one and only Call of Duty. From red dot sights to grenade launcher attachments. This game has definately set the bar for future ""Next Gen"" games. I am probably the biggest CoD fan out there, but I can tell this game took notes from the best of the best to make something even more innovative. The Graphics are of course created from the newest update of MS paint, along with the engine. There are a total of 6 weapons (batteries not included) and 40,004,321 different camo's. I highly recommend purchasing this masterpiece for it has years of replay value. I can't wait for the next sequel. "

												This game is a trap. It sets you up with its cute moments and characters, but crushes your heart at the end of each playthrough, and I loved it. The replay value in this game is colossal, and each ending is brilliantly planned, with just enough humor, sadness, and a plot twist you never saw coming that was dangled in front of you since square one.This is easily one of my favorite games.

												It's a cute game about birds. What's not to love? You play as a girl, named default Hiyoko Tosaka, a human girl that goes to Saint Pigeonation's, a prestigious academy for the pigeon and by the pigeon. You will follow her journey and meet all kinds of friends and fowls, and maybe even fall in love! However, all is not well in Japan, as you find out more secrets as to why there aren't many humans. Will your high school days stay cheery and fun, will they be full of romance, or is something more fishy afoot? Date a total of 8 different pigeons and meet all kinds of feathery folk in Hatoful Boyfriend!Plays like a game, reads like a story! The gameplay is simple enough: Click a choice, read the story. Unlike some games of this genre, Hatoful Boyfriend doesn't have any gimmicks like buying certain routes (All are included! Hooray~), building stats (They are important, but not super important), giving gifts, waiting for specific times to talk to characters, etc.Hatoful Boyfriend is a VISUAL NOVEL, so you will enjoy a unique story depending on the choices you make. The game has a ton of different endings, good and bad, to get, so there are quite a few achievements to acquire. In all seriousness, Hatoful Boyfriend is probably my favorite Visual Novel for a lot of reasons despite it's unusual subject matter. It's funny, it has likeable characters, and a pretty wacky plot that you would never figure out without doing at least 3 or more routes. However, this game isn't just humorous. It'll also take your heart and rip it apart S L O W L Y on certain routes, especially Ryouta's and the Even though it's not serious like a lot of Otome VNs, especially the popular ones of today (i.e. Mystic Messenger), it's entertaining and definitely a good entry-level Otome game due to its simplicity. Although it's a parody, it's a really well done parody - and I'm glad this was my first entry to dating sims and visual novels at a whole. Do I recommend Hatoful Boyfriend? Well yeah, of course. It's a really well-thought out and equally outrageous game, and Hato Moa is a great writer. Every story is just as entertaining as the last, and even bad ends leave you salivating for more. The translation (This game is obviously from Japan if you couldn't tell) is very nice and free of pretty much any errors. There are no glitches or bugs from what I know. Hatoful Boyfriend is a very good game for the price, especially when you consider the fact that this is an HD remake of the original game. Yes, you heard me right, a HD remake. I've been playing since the original (which is included with the collector's edition! Yippee!) was first translated and the free version was out. I'm very pleased with the HD remaster and the fact that I can play a specific birdie's route that wasn't in the free original and that there's basically way more that the original game didn't offer at all, free or paid.If you're unsure about playing Hatoful Boyfriend, pick it up when it's on sale or hope someone gifts it to you (which I recommend to do after you've enjoyed this game - GIVE THE GIFT OF PIGEON LOVE!). It's not the most expensive game you'll ever play, but it may be a bit pricy for those who are not sure about playing VNs. That's ok though! Even if you get it on sale or as a gift, it's definitely a good purchase. I've poured hours into the original.If you enjoy/enjoyed Hatoful BF, definitely check out the successor, Hatoful Boyfriend Holiday Star, for holiday-themed madness with your favorite birdies.			"

												I have been so excitedly telling everyone about this game I actually forgot to properly review it.It's a bit late now, but for the principle of it:This is a perfect parody of dating sims - which laughs WITH fans of the genre instead of laughing AT them - used as a long-form introductory wrapping to a marvelous, intensely emotional visual novel about dreams, friendship and hope.… with pigeons.Although I had heard of the game since its release in English, i couldn't play it and stayd away from spoilers and forums, and I am SO glad I did! The impact of wandering the various storylines is so much more intense when you have no idea what's about to happen… The game manages to surprise & shock you almost every. single. time, despite your probable initial expectations that ""a dating sim with pigeons? NOTHING will shock me any more…"" JUST. YOU. WAIT.I have the deepest respect and admiration for the author, who managed to take a lighthearted April's fools joke demo and turn it into such a well-thought, deep and engaging real story… without sacrificing any of the initial fun & WTFness. This is a masterpiece of storytelling.And yet, when all is over and you're still reeling from the emotional rollercoaster that is the second half of the game (for best effect, play the ""fulfilling a promise"" path LAST, and in one single sitting!), the only way you feel you can describe the game to outsiders still seems to be : ""it's a dating sim… but with pigeons. And then it gets INTENSE, and you will cry.""10/10, would cry again.PS: Okosan is the most precious cinnamon r- err, pudding of all birdies, and deserves all the hugs.			"

												At first glance, Hatoful Boyfriend may appear to be a parody of the visual novel dating sim games which have gained popularity recently.  And upon completing your first playthrough and finding a pigeon to be your soulmate, this would be an entirely accurate assumption to make.  However, the real depth of this game surfaces with each continual playthrough.  Something far more sinister is happening at St. Pigeonation's.  You will eventually find out the answer to almost any question you may have had when you first heard of the game.  Why is everyone a bird?  Why are you a human?  Who is the Hatoful Boyfriend?  The path to this knowledge will take a lot of perseverance, but you will be surprised by the outcome.			"

												First and foremost for those that fail to read the information above this is a visual novel. That means the majority of the content is reading. If you dislike reading turn back now.Alright. For those of you still here yes this game is satire, but it can also take itself quite seriously. While playing this you have the amusing routes(which can overlap), the tear-jerking routes(which can overlap), the childhood friend route, the jerkwad routes, the senpai route, the sensei route, and the reformed thug/female route. Additionally there's the secret plot-heavy route that will not be spoken of for the sake of spoilers. The gameplay is much like you'd expect from a visual novel. Make a few choices. If you select the correct ones and have the proper stats congrats. You just landed yourself a good ending. Speaking of stats they aren't used as much as the other games of the same read-and-select format. An amusing game at the core for the most part.Now what this rerelease was mainly supposed to fix was the engine. You see the previous engine back before the steam version was riddled with bugs and made playing it rather difficult. While this engine does run much more smoothly than Famous Writer did it does, in fact, have some bugs too. There have been reports of freezing on a white screen during the loading process before getting to the menu, crashing when loading human portraits, and likely more that have yet to be reported. Thankfully these aren't as numerous as the previous iteration. Still annoying, but some have reported fixing it by restarting the game. As per the others... Well this is a custom engine. Perhaps there will be patches in the future to fix the problems.As per double the original price... Moa used a lot of open sourse content to make the game as cheap as possible at first, and this remake gave the game its own look background-wise as well as replacing that outdated freeware engine. The music is the same and the birds are higher resolution, but more or less the same. That said some of the birds are higher resolution than the other birds.All in all I still do recommend it since it is less likely to backfire on you than the original and does provide a good deal of amusement.Edit: It slipped my mind earlier, but the collector's edition does hold true on its claim. The original game is included if you feel like owning both renditions.			"

												I have a love-hate relationship with dating sims. I love almost everything about their writing, the nature of the narrative slowly unfolding non-linearly with each replay, and the exploration of character and testing the player's understanding of character. I love also how it critically looks at various staples of love-interests in romance in a way that romance novels rarely do. We have more than just the standard alpha-male. What I don't like about dating sims is that I have yet to find one which lets me just skip (not fast-forward - SKIP) scenes I've seen before and the sheer amount of grinding involved in stat building. Sometimes I want to do-away with stat-building completely and take a page out of Moacube's book where you have other types of decisions which advance plot define your character's character and ""stats"". Hatoful tries to make stat building more connected to plot by actually providing you with a unique scene along with each stat building time point. However, I still found the stat building unecessary. I also found the needing to romance a character in two different ways in order to unlock the epilogue really...arduously boring. That said, Hatoful Boyfriend improves on a lot of other dating sim mechanics and really invests in taking the player's preconceptions of whimsy and istead offers a genuinely good science fiction story. There is a lot of depth in this game should you commit to seeking it and a lot of heart. I still await the day where we work towards dating sims that remove grinding, whether that's re-doing vast stretches of story to get to new scenes or improve (or do away with) the stat building. Sadly, Hatoful Boyfriend still suffers from both, though to a lesser extent than the average dating sim. This detracted from my experience. I still heartily recommend this game as amongst one of the top games you can play in its genre. (Seriously.)			"

												Got the game expecting a hilarious twist on the silly visual novels that I enjoy reading. The first stories that you read through where you pursue a relationship with each of the birds is pretty well what I expected.Finish all of the main stories; some hilarious, some a bit surpising, some so outragously punny that I had to hold my breath, but all enjoyable. Enter stage left, abruptly: The ACTUAL, ACTUAL real story of the game that ends up being incredibly deep, rather mysterious, with lots of soul searching and some truly soul crushing moments. Just.. God..  One of the best stories I have read in several years and I read a lot.It takes time to get over the fact that everyone is a bird of some sort but by the time you've finished the first ""otome"" style stories you've pretty well accepted the madness completely and you only see the characters rather than the feathers. Which was clearly done by design to crush you even further when the real story plays.  I highly recommend getting this and going through it. Look up a guide if you need it to get through the first part of the game but when you start to ""Fulfill the Promise"" drop them like a bad habit and just experience it. Because it is an experience.			"

												I have a love-hate relationship with dating sims. I love almost everything about their writing, the nature of the narrative slowly unfolding non-linearly with each replay, and the exploration of character and testing the player's understanding of character. I love also how it critically looks at various staples of love-interests in romance in a way that romance novels rarely do. We have more than just the standard alpha-male. What I don't like about dating sims is that I have yet to find one which lets me just skip (not fast-forward - SKIP) scenes I've seen before and the sheer amount of grinding involved in stat building. Sometimes I want to do-away with stat-building completely and take a page out of Moacube's book where you have other types of decisions which advance plot define your character's character and ""stats"". Hatoful tries to make stat building more connected to plot by actually providing you with a unique scene along with each stat building time point. However, I still found the stat building unecessary. I also found the needing to romance a character in two different ways in order to unlock the epilogue really...arduously boring. That said, Hatoful Boyfriend improves on a lot of other dating sim mechanics and really invests in taking the player's preconceptions of whimsy and istead offers a genuinely good science fiction story. There is a lot of depth in this game should you commit to seeking it and a lot of heart. I still await the day where we work towards dating sims that remove grinding, whether that's re-doing vast stretches of story to get to new scenes or improve (or do away with) the stat building. Sadly, Hatoful Boyfriend still suffers from both, though to a lesser extent than the average dating sim. This detracted from my experience. I still heartily recommend this game as amongst one of the top games you can play in its genre. (Seriously.)			"

												The game is pretty entertaining because the writing is good and the idea of dating pigeons is funny.  The characters are great, all with distinct personalities, including the main character.  Unlike some other dating sims, it doesn't branch off into a separate route for each character you date --instead, the new stuff for each character is interspersed between scenes common to each character... expect to be hitting the skip button a lot.  The amount of new content for each character is pretty good, though.The real meat of the game is when you unlock the final route after completing all the other routes.  To put this in perspective, there are 15 endings (not counting an epilogue).  I read all of the dialogue out loud with my friend, using the skip button for dialogue we already saw before.  It took 10 hours to do the 14 normal routes and 6 hours to do the final route alone-- that's how big the difference is.  So make sure you do the final route, since it's a huge amount of the game and it really ties everything together well.Where the game fell short for me was in the implementation.  There were a number of annoying technical aspects that really detracted from the game.  One was the skip button, which sometimes failed to skip past old dialogue and would also skip past new dialogue.  Another big one was the save games, which do not work if you have the game installed somewhere other than your C drive-- a real annoyance with the really long final route.  And then there were just some small annoyances like unnecessary extra clicks (such as having to click twice before every choice), the slow speed of the scene transitions, and a ton of typos... which were actually kind of entertaining, but still.Even so, the game is worth playing.  It might not be the most polished VN you'll ever play, but it has some solid writing and is just a really fun experience.			"

												Can't look at pigeons anymore without crying. 11/10---Okay, let's do this seriously.On a list of games which you shouldn't judge by their covers, this one would be my #1.Sure, Visual novels can always surprise you somehow, after all they're often ""just"" simple dating games. Well, that's the case here as well but with pigeons. Or so it seems. But the story behind everything is simply stunning. I just couldn't stop playing - and crying.  Do yourself a favour and play it blindly (or use a spoiler-free guide for the routes), to gain the maximal feels destruction. Trust me, it'll change your life.I totally recommend buying the normal version for the full price, it's really worth it. But if you want the collector's edtion, you should better wait a sale.			"

												Hatoful boyfriend is a game one can never simply forget. True, it looks like a simple joke aimed towards visual novels and the like, however that is not the case. This game has enough to crush a player's heart through various ways but can also reward you with happiness on some routes. All the same, this game is more than meets the eye. The images and art used is high quality as standard, although a couple of birds do seem a bit blurry and pixelated. The English translation has been done well and I have only noticed a couple of minor errors (or what seem like errors) on the BBL ending. This should not deter you from getting this seemingly innocent game and playing it yourself, as the gameplay is superb and of a high quality overall. It was enough to make me cry a few times, and for my heart to swell quite a lot especially for one particular character (out of sadness). Final rating - 9/10 This game is a lot less of a joke than the store page makes it out, so keep that in mind.  "

												""A pigeon dating sim? This sounds like fun.""I bought this game with entertainment on my mind. Instead of entertainment, what I got instead were wasted hours on a pigeon dating simulator, screams that friends and families could probably hear across the world, screenshots of pigeons filling my desktop, angered friends asking what I was doing, and a heart torn and threaded upon by the feets of pigeons. Never did I think I would fall in love. Never did I think pigeons could tear at my heartstrings. Little feathered fiends continously plucked at my heartstrings gently, yet harshly, just to make sure I was still crying.			"

												I'm not a fan of sims but I do love a good story in any form. Definitely a lot of replayability due to each story path opening up more of the overarching plot that goes above bird romance. Seems silly on the surface but is pretty heartfelt once you give it a chance.And to all my guild members reading this and asked about it, no, there aren't any graphic scenes.Would recommend this to everybirdie.Edit: Okay, so I got to the final chapter..

												Hatoful Boyfriend is truly incredible, and for a number of reasons. Not only because the different routes and stories tie together in a far more intricate way than I ever expected. Not because even the parts you think might be boring are surprisingly heartfelt. Not even because it, a visual novel about dating photorealistic birds in an anime school, has brought me closer to tears than nearly any other game.No, this game is really amazing because it's somehow managed to trick 99% of the people who have heard of it as to what it actually contains. Even people who have played it are often unaware of the full depth of its contents. You go into it expecting a light and silly parody game, and that is what it delivers, for a while.

												As an avid player of visual novels and dating sims I was eager to try this game out. I don't think I was expecting too much going into it, it seemed like a novelty game someone made as a joke (PIGEONS!?) but I was pleasantly surprised.If you are a fan of the genre you'll recognize the generic pattern of gameplay. You have to navigate choices to win the heart of your chosen pigeon and discover all their unique endings. Although the plots tend to be repetitive throughout each characters route, the characters are interesting enough to make it worthwhile. The best part of the game though for me was the afterstory. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to other fans of the genre.  The premise is silly, but it's as charming as it is funny.			"

												This game is one of those rare few that seems like its one thing, and then it ends up being something much, MUCH, greater than expected. Going into it you might think its just a weird Japanese visual novel about dating birds. And, well, it sort of is. But what you wouldn't know without playing it is just how much more there is to this game. The vast amount of diversity speaks volumes of the effort put into making this game the experience that it is. Although it is classed as a dating sim, this is one of the few games that tackles many other genres, and actually does it well. Basically, each of the different characters' story lines you can follow are unique to one another. Each character has a very different personality and backstory, as well as their routes have their own uniqe themes and plots that other characters routes don't necessarily have a focus on. This is what makes this such a great game, because it makes you WANT to complete every route so you can learn the whole story, rather than making you feel like you have to suffer through several playthroughs of the same thing to get the end result. Each of the different characters stories are enjoyable and entertaing in their own unique way, be it a sweet romance, or a bone-chilling mystery, they are all very different.Then of course, there is the secret ""true ending"" story route, wheather it can be called that or not, it is one of the most fantastic works of story telling I have ever experienced in a visual novel. I'm not going to spoil anything, as it really should be played without any prior knowledge or spoilers, but I strongly encourage players to play through every possible story route even if some may be silly at times, as that's what gives this game its charm. Each one of the stories you can play through will entertain you with silly jokes, emotion evoking plots, or even suspensful and horrorific secrets. Then after all those memorable events, you will be able to enjoy yet another very unique, very interesting, and very well written and played out ""true ending"" scenario. I could talk for hours about how great all the individual routes and the overarching plots are, but it is truely something that is best left for you, the player, to discover by playing the game for yourselves.If you havn't yet bought Hatoful Boyfriend, or are maybe considering the purchase but are unsure if you will enjoy it, then you have my reccomendation to buy and play this game, and  that it will be something that you'll be able to enjoy playing, and re-playing, for a very long time to come. For the amount of content this game has, it is definately worth buying. Through all of its silly laughs, its shocking secrets, and its heartbreaking emotional moments, Hatoful Boyfriend has become a personal favourite, and hopefully you will enjoy it too.			"

												Welp, you buy the game because you date pidgeons, and that sounds like some weird social experiment that will be hilarious; and you're right. And then you get to the actual heart of the game, once you get to fulfill your promise (that will make sense later, if you get enough achievements), and suddenly you think 'wow, this is messed up', and you're right about that too.  I did not expect to be emotionally invested in pidgeons, let alone the story of the game itself. 10/10, would get aboard this feel bus again.			"

												I first bought this game when it first came out (Sept 2014), on sale, as a gag gift for my friend. I didn't understand why it was $10 for a dating game about birds, so I never bothered with it at full price. Me and some friends had some laughs going through one of the endings and it wasn't touched much since.Fast Forward to the 2015 Summer Sale. I bought 3 copies of Hatoful Boyfriend - again, on a huge sale. I'm the cheap friend - and gave two of the copies to friends, and saved one for myself to play for some small laughs. Get an ending or two, waste some time. But as I got more endings, I learned more and more about the world I was thrown into, and just how intriguing it was. And I learned more and more about the characters I'm around, and how everything fits together more than one would find in a simple dating simulator - human or otherwise. Three and a half hours later:I have gone through eight different endings. I have nearly cried twice, and completely ragequit once. I have been piecing the world together and it is an outstanding place. I have come to understand just why it is worth its full pricetag, and feel dirty having only paid a cut price for this. In short, Hatoful Boyfriend is a top contender to being one of my favorite games ever. It deserves the chance to being yours too.			"

												Look man. Look. I just wanted to date some birds.Seems weird, right? Well. I guess it is. But I was curious! Who could blame me! A dating sim? With birds? I'm no bird fanatic but it caught my interest.And what I believed to be an innocent woo-ing (Or coo-ing, rather) pidgeon dating sim ended up a rollercoaster of emotional pain and deep, story-rich stress.It began cute. Interesting. I live in a cave, a human girl. No parents. At most my closest friend is a kind rock-dove. Nice.I persued birds far and wide. It was fun, at first. A cute, but sad ending. Endings that gave me a little giggle. Sometimes things seemed a little off, but isn't that the fun?Oh, no, no it is not.The choice is yours. Woo the birds. Befriend them. Learn their lives and histories, fall for their tales, tails, and quirks- but at a high emotional priceOr fly, far, far away.Pros: Highly reccomended due to rich chaotic story and fun visuals.Cons: I did not get to bang a bird.

												This isn't just a dating sim with birds - it's much, much more. It challenges the social standings of humans and their place in the world - the world that humans have altered themselves for the greater good, only to have their creations turn against them. It touches upon the existance of the supernatural, and the consequences of mingling with fate and the higher order. The juxtaposition between the birds and the humans is highlighted as you interact with key characters. You will have to face with and debate against (or for) political issues that will directly affect your well-being. The more you, a human, gets involved into these affairs, the more you unravel about the hidden mystery behind St. PigeoNation Institute of Littledove Hachiman City. Would definitely recommend - you will not be disappointed. "

As you play through the routes, eventually you realize that the routes connect to each other in a way to create a singular story and the game manages to keep you interested the whole time and wonder what's going to happen next. There's a lot more underneath the surface of the game that you won't expect, so this is definitely not something you should judge solely on the cover.This game is basically brilliant and you should be playing it right now!!!

But once you do catch on to how to get those birds to love you, the game actually develops some interesting scenarios that will make you think about life a little bit differently than before.  If you unlock the final story, things get perhaps TOO soap opera-esque, but it's well worth the playthrough(s).			"

So, I really enjoyed just dating the birds.But the /True/ ending was to die for. literally lol.The murder investigation at the end of the game was amazing. it was  great & i enjoyed it a lot.    the murder investigation is worth playing even if you have no interest in dating sims. its not at all predictable. and seeing the characters develop and communicate with each other was good to see.10/105/5best bird gamebetter than call of duty.

												This game definitely was far from what I expected. I mentally prepared myself for a comedy to sit down and waste time with. This was far from it.I liked the entire complexity of the storyline and the fact that no two games were exactly the same depending on what you chose, thus making the replays just as enjoyable if not more than the first playthrough. The characters were almost all charming and had their own quirks, and I liked how the game made me feel really involved with each and everyone's individual storylines. Most times I am disappointed in games that are short, but for once, the length of the game was just right. There wasn't much for me to dislike...Except Shuu. I dislike Shuu.			"

												I bought the Collector's Edition so I will do a small review of the game and a look over the extras you get.I love visual novels and when I first got this game I thought it was going to be a very sweet but quite gimmicky. I played the demo on the original site and boy was I wrong. Yes the game can indeed be very sweet but it can also be very dark. The game had a depth and was so well written that I had never expected. Now I will say I have played LOADS of visual novel games and am very finicky about which ones I buy. The moment this game came to Steam I bought it the first moment I noticed it was there. Its well written, the characters are well developed and believeable (with the exception of Okasan and Aghel but that's how they are supposed to be), the music is lovely and well fitted to the areas they are used, it had multiple endings which depended on your stats in some cases, you actually LEARN the birds names which were chosen to represent the men you can be with in this game and its just engrossing. The game itself is a definite recommend.Now I will look at the extra you get with Hatoful Boyfriend Collectors Edition:It comes with the soundtrack which as I said its a lovely soundtrack and it seems to include all of the songs. The wallpapers was disappointing. It just came with two wallpapers featuring the purple heart background and fantail pigeons. The comic is short but sweet. Each character has two mini comics (4 frames) after them. It doesn't add to the story in any way its just quite sweet. Though there was only one that made me laugh.The yearbook. I will say this now its not a yearbook. Its actually just a virtual artbook made to look like a yearbook which disappointed me greatly. I hoped it would be Tosaka's year book with pictures of her class inside and signed with a message from each of the main characters but no such luck. The art work is quite nice but not what I was expecting. The actual game is definitely worth a buy but the collector's edition I'd advise you only get if it was on offer for a £1 or two (three if you really want it) Its not worth its £5 price tag.			"

												On the surface, this game seems completely stupid; something that you would buy only as a joke. After binge playing this game with all my free time for about 4 days, I can honestly say that this may be in my top 3 games for this year. This game actually has a serious story. One that you need to get all of the endings to put together and one that will make you step away from the keyboard after you're done and say ""What the hell just happened?"" This game is amazing. I never once thought I would be attached to any of these characters but there were times when I legitimately almost teared up. This game is funny. It's sad. It's downright tragic. You are doing yourself a disservice by not picking up this game. And you are doing yourself a bigger disservice if you already have it, got one ending, and dismissed it. As someone who has played quite few visual novel type games I can say without a shred of hesitation this is one of the best. 10/10, would attend St. PigeoNation's again.			"

												Like 95% of people out there I bought this because hey, what isn't to love about a parody dating sim in which you romance birds?! But oh boy, let me tell you that it is SO much more than that. I almost ditched the game after playing the first route because hey, it was alright and pretty quirky but nothing spectacular, but I came back to it a couple of days ago and wow was I missing out. This is not a game in which you can gleam everything from a single play - the more routes you play, the more details you begin to see and the more the bigger picture starts coming together.There is very little 'filler' content in this game, no matter how it may appear to begin with.  Excellent foreshadowing, elements of fridge horror which made my heart stop and absolutely, positively heartwrenching storyline. This is a modern masterpiece and I hope this is the only thing to survive the nuclear apocalypse.10/10 would sob over virtual pigeon boyfriends again			"

												Alright, so I lot of the reviews for this game are mostly joke reviews, and you know what, I agreed with them at first. When I saw this game for the first time, I thought, ""What the hell is this stupid game?"" I kept seeing it pop up in the form of lets plays and such, and it looks pretty funny to me. So, I went a payed five bucks for it during the Steam Sale. And I'm not sure I've been more wrong about a game before in my life. Although at first it seems like simply a joke game with no real substance, you realize eventually that there actually is a beautifully written, deep story behind all of it. I will not say too much in fear of spoilers, however, all I will say is that anyone who thinks this game is going to be nothing but ""some crazy Japan bird game"" will likely have their mind changed at least a little after playing.

												The first VN I have played in my life, and one of the more enjoyable VNs I have experienced in my life as well (which isn't a lot mind you). Hatoful Boyfriend is about dating birds, and over time, finding out the events that lead to a human girl attending a pigeon school and forming romantic relationships with them. Hatoful plays with its unique premise, leading the way for pigeon related antics and such. The comedy is great in the VN, the drama fits, and everything works out. The staff even managed to fit in a number of anime or japanese pop culture references into the show as well, which may or may not be your thing (it definitely was enjoyable for me). The second part of the VN, is where a lot of the history of the setting is explained, and trades all of the comedy and silliness for drama. The drama is decent, the payoff is pretty meh, the story and background is pretty well done and fleshed out. The second part is also incredibly long, like hours long, just a warning.Overall Hatoful Boyfriend is an enjoyable experience. Each route is quite special in its own way, and they each have a certain charm to them. Having to perfect this game didn't bother me at all, as I had fun playing it all the way through.			"

Also, there's a fast-forward feature in it, so when you're doing the different endings it's a lot less tedious.EDIT:  Just beat it.  BBL ending is beautiful.  Before playing BBL (you'll know when it's unlocked), I would STRONGLY recommend playing through all the endings so that you unlock the epilogue.  That way, you don't have to play through it twice.

												So far I've only unlocked 3 endings, but I also got the ""Bad Ending"" (and its achievement)! Jeez. It's simple and easy to read, and once you know the main arc you can hammer your mouse through it to get to new content for new boyfriends really fast. High Points:-The story is interesting and there's no shortage of drama, for sure (If you came for anything else in a dating sim, you're in the wrong place).-Lots of variation! My favorite birdie is Yuuya, but I don't think I have a least favorite. They're all super fun and creatively designed.-This game keeps surprising me.Low Points:-There probably won't be a lot of replayability :/-Yuuya's romance was hard to figure out; I got the Bad Ending just trying the first go around, and Ryouta fell in love with me the second time. I ended up looking up the first couple steps to get myself on the right track. I also have no idea how to romance Azumi. This game gives you goals and no instruction manual!-The soundtrack kind of bothers me. It doesn't fade or change evenly, but stops abruptly when scenes shift or ends when a scene times out (I left my computer for a while and came back and the game was absolutely silent). That's par for the course for a lot of dating sims though.If you like anime pigeons and you need something for a quiet evening in, this is a good filler :o) each romance only takes about 30-45 minutes. 8/10			"

												I can't believe I'm about to say this, but I believe Hatoful Boyfriend just might be one of the best games I have ever played. Please hear me out first before you call me crazy! (Warning: spoilers ahead) I believe you are supposed to follow the romances in the order of the achievement list to maximise the effect. It starts out as what you'd expect: a simple dating sim where you can romance birds. But as you go along, the supernatural becomes more evident, with ghosts and weird pudding gods (???) and fallen angels and reincarnations and stuff. And then you get to the highlight of the game. The BBL ending. Whereas the 14 other endings took me about five to six hours to complete, I was staring at my screen for like three hours for this, and I couldn't stop no matter how much my eyes hurt. It's madness. What started as a cute bird romance sim became some weird combination of horror and mystery, with a conspiracy that tied practically every single main character to each other in some way or other. The hints have been there all along, even in the ""normal"" romance routes, but after playing this you'll understand everything, and your mind will be blown away. On a sidenote, I wonder what kind of drugs the makers had to take to think of this kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥ 10/10 would rather play Hatoful Boyfriend BBL ending than watch/read Game of Thrones.			"

												One thing that I can say about Hatoful Boyfriend is that this game is a total rabbit hole. Each of the character routes have little hints at a much bigger plot, and it all comes together in the most unexpected way. When I first started playing I laughed so hard through my first character routes and decided to play it out. By the time I'd finished the game I had actually cried over some of these pigeons. It's ridiculous how surprisingly well written this game is.(Also have tissues ready for Fujishiro Nageki's route he is a precious baby borb that must be protected)			"

												I bought this game out of sheer, burning curiosity thinking it was going to be a light-hearted, silly game about dating birds. I was in a state of turmoil - what had come over me? Was this some kind of mid-mid-life crisis? How far was I going to sink into depravity before finally snapping out of it and coming to my senses? I was embarrassed and didn't want to admit to even my closest friends that I was won over by this charming game.But then I couldn't stop telling them about it. I wanted to tell the whole world what a twisted surprise Hatoful Boyfriend turned out to be. Yes, of course it's ridiculous, of course you can't take it TOO seriously, but it is also so much deeper than just a ""bird dating sim."" It commanded all my attention and free time over the course of four days until I was finally able to finish it. I obviously can't say too much without spoiling it (as anyone who's played knows) but if you're going to set aside reservations for only one game in your life, make it this one.			"

												I picked up this game because it was on sale, I love birds (and have a dove of my own), and, like most of the folks who originally bought the game, was anticipating some cute little love stories, nothing I was going to take too seriously.Boy, was I wrong.There are love stories, true, but it also possesses a far more in-depth and compelling plotline surrounding the dark history of the school and the overall relationship between humans and birds in a dystopian society. Without giving much more away, the characters themselves are very well developed, and while some parts can get a bit repetitive -- you don't get the heavy backstory without a few unlocks -- the main story is engaging in a way I could not have anticipated.If you decide to pick this up, go into it with an open mind. Or don't, and let yourself be surprised. This is a brilliant game and far much more than it presents itself to be right out of the box.			"

												Where do I stat with this? It's difficult to classify this game as something other than a dating sim, because it can become more than that depending on your choices. It's also very difficult to discuss this game without resorting to ""omg look at this wacky game! It's soooooooo random! XD"" Don't let the Pewdiepie hype portrayed by many streamers deter you from even glancing at this due to your disgust. Those people are the same idiots that also scream, ""Dark Souls is too hard! Golly, this is so epic!""I can say, first and foremost, that this is a visual novel. Regardless of sub-genre, that's what this boils down to. It's a very intriguing visual novel. It performs under the guise of a classic Japanese high school dating sim while donning the peculiar gimmick of having birds for the school's students. While this may sound extremely gimmicky, and I won't lie, it is. That is not necessarily a bad thing though! This allows for a different kind of exploration into one's feelings. Can you get emotionally attatched to a bird to some degree? You would not think so, but these birds are essentially people-type characters. They talk, have inner/outter conflicts, and even run in marathons. I can also imagine the same could happen if it was a high school of Super Robots, but it's not. That would be an awesome game. We need that to be on Steam right now.If you're still interested at this point you'd might as well start reading further into this. Let's face it; if you're interested in a dating sim with birds, then you probably have few other things to entertain you at this point in terms of modern gaming.Would I even like a dating sim with birds where I would not be able to even date females? That's how I felt, but I was tired of the typical tropes of AAA games and decided that I would instead let myself fall victim to the cliches of standardized Japanese gaming this time around. I was absolutely correct in the aspect of dating sim cliches remaining intact, but I was not prepared for the fact that there are routes that rip the afforementioned apart. If you're reading through Fate/Stay Night, then of course you'd expect things to become intense and heavy. When you play an average dating sim you're just expecting two people to get together and happy things ensue with a nice ending, save for School Days. That was just depressing on about every level.You won't expect things once they hit you in Hatoful Boyfriend, and that is the true glory of the writing in this game. It just happens to be covered in a feathery layer topped with a beak.I fully recommend this title to visual novel enthusiasts, or anyone who just wants to dive into the visual novel genre for their first time. With a title like this being easily accessible to a North American audience on Steam, there has never been a better time to start!			"

												This was just... amazing. You were probably aware of this game because of its ridiculous premise - a pigeon dating simulator? Crazy, but not sure if it's worth anyone's time.I figured I was free enough to try it; it's only 10 dollars. What I played, however, blew me away. Let's just say there's a LOT more to the game than what it first appears to be. (just looking at the achievements should give you a hint)I would definitely recommend it to everyone who likes visual novels. It's pretty cheap, too!			"

												Guys, I'm crying right now. Just thinking of Nageki makes me feel something strange inside. I guess you could call it ""love"". I'm in love with Nageki Fujishiro. I've lost interest in all guys, besides him. Guys who are considered ""hot"" by the general female population don't cut it for me anymore. Nageki really is all I think about all day, every day. I really do cry myself to sleep at night thinking about how I'll never be with him. If only he knew I existed in this life, if only he knew my deep profound love for him. I know that will never happen though. That is the thought that makes me so sad when I look at him. I'll never be with him, but I'll continue to love him until the day I die.			"

												I bought this game almost ironically, excpecting some kind of weird joke or graphic novel parody.What I got instead was an actual graphic novel, with a variety of routes and characters who just... happen to be birds. The story, although not very long, is actualy quite good at times. It made me laugh, and it almost made me cry as well. Some situations sure were kind of cliche, but not enough to make me uninterested or bored at any point in the game. In the end, the real joke of Hatoful Boyfriend is on me,  for discoverving I was weaboo enough to enjoy the game from beginning to end rather than laugh about it.			"

												One thing that I can say about Hatoful Boyfriend is that this game is a total rabbit hole. Each of the character routes have little hints at a much bigger plot, and it all comes together in the most unexpected way. When I first started playing I laughed so hard through my first character routes and decided to play it out. By the time I'd finished the game I had actually cried over some of these pigeons. It's ridiculous how surprisingly well written this game is.(Also have tissues ready for Fujishiro Nageki's route he is a precious baby borb that must be protected)			"

												I played the demo fo this game many years ago with a friend for a laugh and while it did give us some laughs it also made us cry, scared us, thrilled us and made us laugh again. Hatoful Boyfriend is a wonderful game, whether you only play one route, or complete the whole game multiple times, as i have, with a shockingly deep story line and a diverse cast of characters. I highly recomend it, even if you dont think you can get used to dating birds, it may just shock you.			"

												I started playing this game as a joke.  I expected a good deal of WTF, and got a lot more than I bargained for!  I've never played a dating simulation before (it's not really my thing), so I can't measure Hatoful Boyfriend against other similar games.  However, I will honestly say that I have enjoyed the stories that unfold.  (I'll admit, tears were shed!)The music and sound effects are mostly cheesy.  I thought the premise of dating birds was random and humourous, but to my surprise, the game finds a way to make it plausible.  There's an interesting, hidden underlying story that gradually gets revealed as you play through different birds' stories and endings.In summary, I didn't know what to expect from Hatoful Boyfriend, but it surprised and delighted me.  It's no masterpiece, but I enjoyed the time I spent playing it.			"

												The first VN I have played in my life, and one of the more enjoyable VNs I have experienced in my life as well (which isn't a lot mind you). Hatoful Boyfriend is about dating birds, and over time, finding out the events that lead to a human girl attending a pigeon school and forming romantic relationships with them. Hatoful plays with its unique premise, leading the way for pigeon related antics and such. The comedy is great in the VN, the drama fits, and everything works out. The staff even managed to fit in a number of anime or japanese pop culture references into the show as well, which may or may not be your thing (it definitely was enjoyable for me). The second part of the VN, is where a lot of the history of the setting is explained, and trades all of the comedy and silliness for drama. The drama is decent, the payoff is pretty meh, the story and background is pretty well done and fleshed out. The second part is also incredibly long, like hours long, just a warning.Overall Hatoful Boyfriend is an enjoyable experience. Each route is quite special in its own way, and they each have a certain charm to them. Having to perfect this game didn't bother me at all, as I had fun playing it all the way through.			"

												Like 95% of people out there I bought this because hey, what isn't to love about a parody dating sim in which you romance birds?! But oh boy, let me tell you that it is SO much more than that. I almost ditched the game after playing the first route because hey, it was alright and pretty quirky but nothing spectacular, but I came back to it a couple of days ago and wow was I missing out. This is not a game in which you can gleam everything from a single play - the more routes you play, the more details you begin to see and the more the bigger picture starts coming together.There is very little 'filler' content in this game, no matter how it may appear to begin with.  Excellent foreshadowing, elements of fridge horror which made my heart stop and absolutely, positively heartwrenching storyline. This is a modern masterpiece and I hope this is the only thing to survive the nuclear apocalypse.10/10 would sob over virtual pigeon boyfriends again			"

												Alright, so I lot of the reviews for this game are mostly joke reviews, and you know what, I agreed with them at first. When I saw this game for the first time, I thought, ""What the hell is this stupid game?"" I kept seeing it pop up in the form of lets plays and such, and it looks pretty funny to me. So, I went a payed five bucks for it during the Steam Sale. And I'm not sure I've been more wrong about a game before in my life. Although at first it seems like simply a joke game with no real substance, you realize eventually that there actually is a beautifully written, deep story behind all of it. I will not say too much in fear of spoilers, however, all I will say is that anyone who thinks this game is going to be nothing but ""some crazy Japan bird game"" will likely have their mind changed at least a little after playing.

												So far I've only unlocked 3 endings, but I also got the ""Bad Ending"" (and its achievement)! Jeez. It's simple and easy to read, and once you know the main arc you can hammer your mouse through it to get to new content for new boyfriends really fast. High Points:-The story is interesting and there's no shortage of drama, for sure (If you came for anything else in a dating sim, you're in the wrong place).-Lots of variation! My favorite birdie is Yuuya, but I don't think I have a least favorite. They're all super fun and creatively designed.-This game keeps surprising me.Low Points:-There probably won't be a lot of replayability :/-Yuuya's romance was hard to figure out; I got the Bad Ending just trying the first go around, and Ryouta fell in love with me the second time. I ended up looking up the first couple steps to get myself on the right track. I also have no idea how to romance Azumi. This game gives you goals and no instruction manual!-The soundtrack kind of bothers me. It doesn't fade or change evenly, but stops abruptly when scenes shift or ends when a scene times out (I left my computer for a while and came back and the game was absolutely silent). That's par for the course for a lot of dating sims though.If you like anime pigeons and you need something for a quiet evening in, this is a good filler :o) each romance only takes about 30-45 minutes. 8/10			"

												I bought the Collector's Edition so I will do a small review of the game and a look over the extras you get.I love visual novels and when I first got this game I thought it was going to be a very sweet but quite gimmicky. I played the demo on the original site and boy was I wrong. Yes the game can indeed be very sweet but it can also be very dark. The game had a depth and was so well written that I had never expected. Now I will say I have played LOADS of visual novel games and am very finicky about which ones I buy. The moment this game came to Steam I bought it the first moment I noticed it was there. Its well written, the characters are well developed and believeable (with the exception of Okasan and Aghel but that's how they are supposed to be), the music is lovely and well fitted to the areas they are used, it had multiple endings which depended on your stats in some cases, you actually LEARN the birds names which were chosen to represent the men you can be with in this game and its just engrossing. The game itself is a definite recommend.Now I will look at the extra you get with Hatoful Boyfriend Collectors Edition:It comes with the soundtrack which as I said its a lovely soundtrack and it seems to include all of the songs. The wallpapers was disappointing. It just came with two wallpapers featuring the purple heart background and fantail pigeons. The comic is short but sweet. Each character has two mini comics (4 frames) after them. It doesn't add to the story in any way its just quite sweet. Though there was only one that made me laugh.The yearbook. I will say this now its not a yearbook. Its actually just a virtual artbook made to look like a yearbook which disappointed me greatly. I hoped it would be Tosaka's year book with pictures of her class inside and signed with a message from each of the main characters but no such luck. The art work is quite nice but not what I was expecting. The actual game is definitely worth a buy but the collector's edition I'd advise you only get if it was on offer for a £1 or two (three if you really want it) Its not worth its £5 price tag.			"

												On the surface, this game seems completely stupid; something that you would buy only as a joke. After binge playing this game with all my free time for about 4 days, I can honestly say that this may be in my top 3 games for this year. This game actually has a serious story. One that you need to get all of the endings to put together and one that will make you step away from the keyboard after you're done and say ""What the hell just happened?"" This game is amazing. I never once thought I would be attached to any of these characters but there were times when I legitimately almost teared up. This game is funny. It's sad. It's downright tragic. You are doing yourself a disservice by not picking up this game. And you are doing yourself a bigger disservice if you already have it, got one ending, and dismissed it. As someone who has played quite few visual novel type games I can say without a shred of hesitation this is one of the best. 10/10, would attend St. PigeoNation's again.			"

												Honestly, I think people need to reserve their judgment until they play through the entirety of BBL/Hurtful Boyfriend, the ""true ending"" which is only unlocked after you get all the normal endings (...although maybe many might not have the patience for it, oh well). It takes all your expectations about this game and blows them completely away, and no one really can say much about it without spoiling the entire thing. It really does deserve that 'psychological horror' tag! It's really well-written and miiiiight even make you forget you're empathizing with a bunch of birds. ;v			"

												Extremly unexpected deep story from something that might seem like a dating simulation game with birds. It all seems girly and shallow fun playing the first few playthroughs, but as you play with different birds and learn their story, you'll eventually realise just how much deeper the overall story goes. I can't stress enough how posively surprised by the story I was, when I finished the last part less than 10 minutes ago. There is problems with the game loading previous saves correctly, but it doesn't affect the experiense much.			"

												I personally don't even know why I like this game. I don't know if it's the fact that everyone is a bird exept you, or that it's a freaking bird dating sim, or just the fact that Okusan knows WING ATTACK, but I just really like this game. It has a bunch of bird puns, lots of comedy, and everything is around birds! The only thing that I kinda don't like is the save feature, but there really isn't anything that can be done about that. So, if you are bored and have nothing to do, get this game, as you will really enjoy it.			"

												Hatoful Boyfriend is a cute, charming, and fun visual novel. A sort of parody of sort, the game is full of comedy, and never seems to take itself too seriously.  if you are a fan of visual novels, comedy, birds, or even dating sims, you might want to give this game a try.  sure, its strange, but that's what makes it enjoyable.  As for graphics, the art is nice, though i personally would have prefered the birds to have been drawn, them being images works.  the endings are all vaired and each one is worth it, so you'd definatly get a fair bit of replay value.  your suiters are all interesting and each one is unique in their own way.  As for music, I'd say it's pretty typical for the type of game it is.  the sound track isn't too much to rave about, but I wouldn't mind listing to it while drawing or something.  Also, dispite it's comdic nature, you may acctually find yourself falling for a bird or two.  The wrighting is just that good, and the characters that compelling and likeable.  Either way, i'd give it a 10 out of 10.  It's a classic that everyone should play.Goods:Fun and unique characters to interact withmultiple endingslots of replay valuemade me cry for a certian ending			"

												Let's be honest, the jokes are some times very flat. I guess anybirdie can agree with that? The story is so much of a cliché - it's funny but they could have done better.If you don't have patience, I guess it isn't worth it's money. But if you do, definitely grab the game on a sale!//Spoiler//I know it's funny how super suspicios the doctor is but come on. :D Okay. Maybe that was a double plot twist because I really expected that the big revelation would have been, that he wasn't bad at all. Or something like that :DWhat happend in the after game was really mind blowing for me then. It was clear from the beginning that some endings are very special, coo coo pudding. But the fact there was a multiple hour long story that unlocks only after you have every ending - wow. It even explains every other ending/character story. (Hmm, except for pudding. But pudding is everything, the true meaning of life.)			"

												It's a pigeon dating sim. And it's everything you could ever want from one. While highly self-aware of just how ridiculous it is, and embracing the sheer silliness of everything, there's a weird sort of sincerity that makes it less just a throwaway joke and more of an actively enjoyable running gag. Though the premise is pure comedy and much of the dialogue is humorous, it never gets tiresome and instead actually becomes quite intriguing as you dig deeper into the bizarre fantasy world of pudding-obsessed pigeons. Also one of them is a serial killer. So there's that.			"

												Hatoful Boyfriend seemed so troll AND YET IT IS SO SAD WTF. I played for the lulz and ended up crying fml. Yeah this is a pigeon dating sim.Yeah it's actually funny. But there's more, so much more. First I got the bad ending which means I didn't seduce any pigeon :c Won't tell what happened you should check it yourself haha. So I told myself I would play a little more to try and make them mine hehe. I started with San. He was the only one who didn't have a human form. ""Wtf"" was all I had to say. Then Sakuya.. ""Aww..."" then Shuu... ""OMG!!!"" then Nageki... ..... ........ ;_; Whatever I got so addicted and played until having every ending.And it happened. The ""Fulfill a promise mode"". SO MUCH FEELS UNHHGHHH I CAN'T. NO WHYYYY. WHYYYYYYYYY. ZGHZHOGHQER!! Is this even a review? I don't know. Hmm. It was a bit repetitive sometimes but there's a button where you can speed up the game easily so  it doesn't really matter or affect you/""the gameplay"" too much.If you expect a funny game, you can buy it, if you like crying, you can buy it too.Either way you won't be disappointed for sure!10/10 for Nageki (his ost <3) and Shuu (but that's because I might be a llittle masochistic ehem.)

												I don't know where to even begin with this game. Hatoful was bought for me by a close friend who thought that a bird dating simulator would be a nice joke gift for someone who likes birds so much. Initially, I believed this game would be funny and cute. I was very excited to play it, and the first few introductory pages in the game were hilarious. I absolutely loved it. What I did not expect, however, is that this game is an incredible source of mental and emotional trauma. Never in my life have I been equally terrified of and strangely attracted to an anime bird until now. I am very confused and scared. HB is both absolutely ridiculous and eerily macabre. 10/10, best bird dating sim			"

The Pudding Is A LieMy lady made me play this one.  I did so on her account (hence the time played).  She found all possible endings, some of which I witnessed; I personally completed just one playthrough.  One was enough; thanks, Oko-san.I'm now that much more acquainted with just how strange the realm of videogaming can be, though I'm not precisely elated at the advent of this hard won wisdom.Dating sims are just odd to begin with, but Hato Moa & friends really tried hard to provide eyebrow-raising occasions.  Gotta hand it to them, Hatoful Boyfriend is at times clever & laugh inducing - in the ""what on god's green earth is happening here"" kind of way.If like me this caught your eye because it was published by Devolver Digital, just know it's easily their most ""out there"" title to date.Against the prospect of preserving my already beleaguered sanity, they went & made a Hatoful Boyfriend: Holiday Star Christmas-themed sequel..Silly review for a silly game.

												Steam crashed while I was writing a lengthy review on this game. All I can say is YOU HAVE to play this. Give it a full on play through and support all of the creators. This game deserves all of the credit it has gotten. DO not just start and quit because ""It's a dumb bird game"" or ""I don't like dating simulators"" if you want to claim yourself a gamer who enjoys things for their storyline you will not be disappointed. This is one of the greatest storylines I have ever experienced and every emotion was on point.Would recommend 100%.And that is a recommendation you should carve into your soul.			"

												As weird as it might seem playing a pigeon dating simulator if you give it a chance Hatoful Boyfriend is a thoroughly entertaining experience for a simple visual novel. It makes fantastic use of its quirky premise for humour and for its darker (and slightly unexpected) complex story branches.Watch our full review here -

												Oh boy...I want to say so much, yet I have no words to express my feelings.First of all this is not one game but two. First one is a dating simulator and what an oddball it is! It has both comedy and tragedy in it but in fact it serves only for one purpose. To distract and fool you, to entangle you in lies. And what is the best lie? Yes, it's truth in a small doses. It introduces almost every personage in the game to you, but only fractions of their story and personality are real, that ones which lie right on the surface. It have many routes and their stories are nice but that's not all. All these stories are only a massive distraction and they serve their purpose very well. If you will ever make it to the second part you will be even more puzzled by the unraveling events.The second part is completely different from the first one. It is not a dating sim but kinetic novel and that's where the true and deep story lie. To be honest I got bored before I finally got to it but now when I finished it I have nothing to regret. It worth every second spent in the first part and a lot more.Pudding / 10			"

												Listen, I know.It's a visual-novel-dating-sim thing, featuring birds.It's one of those things that sounds like a game played by straw-man nerd losers in a cartoon.However, it's a surprisingly engaging and deep story, with a level of content connectedness that is truly excessive.Excessive because it all works so stupidly well. I went into this thinking it was going to be a silly, stupid, amusing romp.I emerged feeling 100% on board with calling it art, even to the point of being comfortable actively endorsing people play the game, despite the, uh, unsavory impression it may make to say ""No really, play this game where you try to bone birds""10/10Side note: I played this with a group of friends, and we read the whole thing aloud, in stupid voices. I'm sure that added to the enjoyment, but keep in mind that the game will become increasingly dark and serious, and the voices may rob some emotional scenes of their gravitas(again, I know, I'm talking about the bird-boning game).

												Hatoful Boyfriend isn't just the hilarious pigeon dating sim you see on the surface. Radical political parties, genocide, experimentation, biological warfare, murder, pudding--just to name a few--are all themes you'll encounter in this game.You are a human transfer student in a school specifically for birds. Unbeknownst to you, your mission is to woo every bird in the school, albeit one at a time in separate playthroughs. Each bird has different interests, personalities, and backstories, but the more you play, the more you'll realize that they're all intertwined, and that there's something terribly sinister going on at your school behind the scenes. Once you've seduced every bird and achieved every ending, you are rewarded with a chance to ""fulfill the promise,"" and solve a mystery that will leave you on the edge of your seat for hours.Hatoful Boyfriend is beyond deceptive in its marketing as a joke, and I hadn't expected that it would tell a wonderfully written story that would leave me in tears at its end.--My only gripe about Hatoful Boyfriend is the spotty save system, as so many others seem to have issues with, too. I would occasionally need to load a save only to find that it would load a background without characters, text, or interface, forcing me to Alt+F4 to leave the game. The save file was forever corrupted, and I would have to restart that particular storyline. The dating playthroughs are short enough to finish in single sittings, but the finale can take hours to finish. I would recommend playing the finale only if you know you have a lot of free time ahead of you, at least until the save issues are fixed. I will amend this review should they be resolved.Oh, and the occasional typo or missing word, but that's not a big deal.--Have fun, everybirdie!			"

												I can't believe the day has come when I can unironically recommend a video game about dating pigeons, but to be fair I did also unironically recommend Euro Truck Simulator 2.Hatoful Boyfriend (if you're wondering, ""hatoful"" could be read as ""heartful"" or ""hurtful""; and also triples as a pun to the Japanese kanji for pigeon) shows that no matter how silly the premise, you can still make a great story out of it. What originally started out as a visual novel about dating pigeons, eventually becomes a visual novel about dating pigeons with deep and complex personalities.The game (or should I say the visual novel) itself is nothing complex, the closest thing to gameplay here is making a decision. Though your decision will ultimately decide who you choose to get close with and how the game ends.Speaking of the story, it is quite entertaining. The writing is fantastic, and all of the characters have their own lovable quirks, in fact the route you take can vastly affect the mood of the story. After going on a certain route, you can do the hidden route which unless you've gotten all the ending (which includes both the normal and true ending for every character) you won't see the epilogue. Getting all of the ending means you have to read through a lot of the things you've read before, there is a fast forward button; but sometimes new dialogues could appear in a scene that you expected to play as usual.Overall Hatoful Boyfriend is an entertaining visual novel about dating pigeons...That was anti-climatic.

												A well written visual novel, with all those heart warming moments, and sad endings, only with Birds. Lots of Puns, good humor and a lot of references to other anime and visual novels. Some routes have more comedy, some are seroius, some are romantic. All the characters are interesting and each route was enjoyable. There is a hidden Dark route after completing all the main charcter routes. This one was especially good, a good tear jerker. Overall a very enjoyable game, Don't just dismiss because of the gag with birds, which i think it improves over normal visual novels. If you want to start getting into visual novels, I recomend starting here. Good luck dating those avian beauties!			"

												I have 100% completed the game just now and, to be fair, had I decided to write the review before doing so, I would have done this game a great injustice.But let's start from the beginning, shall we? Why should you buy this game? - Great music (especially the emotional parts),- Interesting and well rounded characters (only Okosan stayed pretty much what he appears to be in the beginning, but it's alright since it's Okosan after all),- Many  very  funny moments- Last ending that explains why everything that happened wasn't just a random events that the writter wanted to include just for laughs (like your character being the only human in the academy for some odd reason). What I thought I was buying: A very funny, crack game that will reduce me to tears because of it wittiness and references. And come on! Romancing  pigeons? Pure gold right there! What I got: A very unique and interesting story with a bit of mystery.  Not that I have realized it even after 6 or so endings, no such thing!I was pretty much convinced that the last ending will be pretty much like the others: short, sweet and funny, maybe tad creepy if Shuu is involved, and definitely sad to a certain degree. Instead I got sucked in 6h+ adventure that kept going on, and on, unravelling new thing at each twist and turn. Soooo... If you want to play a funny visual novel game, and you are also a fun of a bit of mystery from time to time, play it. Just do it.You can thank me later.Side note: I have seen 4, maybe 5 spelling mistakes in the last ending. Just saying!			"

												When I first saw this game, my thoughts were: “what even”. When I bought and played the game, my thoughts were “what EVEN”. Now, after finishing it (in multiple ways!) and reviewing it, my thoughts are “WHAT EVEN”.I just. What. What even?So it’s a visual novel. About dating birds. As a human girl. In a school for birds. And you WILL adore the birds, fall in love with the birds, cry at the birds, and then stare at the credits in disbelief because did all of that just happen in the span of an hour?And then you’ll do all of it again. Seven times.For real though, this game is brilliant. That said, it is definitely not the best game ever. It does manage to be humorous and serious at the same time, and generally at the right times (at least to one familiar with Japanese storytelling conventions).The downside is the length: in terms of raw content, Hatoful Boyfriend falls a bit short. It’s true there are eight character routes, plus a couple alternatives and extras, but each route only takes about forty to sixty minutes to complete, and that time gets progressively shorter each time you play: a lot of the text is exactly the same regardless of route taken. Aside from taking different classes each day – which there aren’t that many – the contents of the game won’t change much until about 3/4ths through, where you’re finally locked into a specific route.Still, the story of the game is very engaging. Though the premise and the world is built on humor, the story takes itself very seriously. Each character is fully fleshed out and their routes just sweep you along for the adventure, and the setting the game builds is solid and easy to get into once you accept the wacky premise. The writing itself isn’t exactly superb, but I dare you to name a VN that has that. What matters is that the humor actually manages to be funny, the emotional scenes are actually touching, and the happy scenes are sweet but not over the top. The final product feels very genuine, and that makes up for its shortcomings.Play this game. You will only regret not playing it sooner.			"

												This game is deeply surprising. While staying true to the genre, it does a fantastic job messing with the tropes, while at the same time adding a unique spin.Then, after getting most of the endings, the game completely changes. The plot is clever and devious and totally unexpected, and the ending is thorough to the point of addressing every loose end and every strange line from the beginning of the game. My friends and I played together (reading out each line) which took a long time, but was totally worth it. We got every romantic option, played every ending, and followed every avenue. You'd think that we'd have bored of it, but this just goes to prove my point that this game is fascinating, even 21 hours in.Hatoful Boyfriend is genius and worth more attention than it has gotten even now. ;)			"

												I recommend this! Well, if you're okay with the basic premise: a light-hearted, mostly-text adventure game (visual novel with several courses) in which you play a human girl transferred to a school of intelligent pigeons. If none of that bothers you, you'll find the rest of the game to be very well developed, with a lot of thought and humor. To enjoy Hatoful Boyfriend the most, you will want to see multiple endings. There's one specific ending that's really great, but you need to play through other endings first to get it. If necessary, look up spoiler-free instructions on how to get the BBL ending. Don't give up on Hatoful until you see that one.			"

												""Ha, pigeons? How weird. Let's buy this game, just for fun."" Most people say this before purchasing this game. I know. I did in 2012 when it first came out on another website. I bought the game and decided to go for the most familiar bird to me. The Mourning Dove, Nageki.  A young boy who died too young. He was put in a medical centre because of his weak immune system. He had a disease, the H5N1 virus. It was able to kill the humans that killed Nageki's family. However, he didn't want to kill the humans. He said he couldn't live anymore, so he threw himself into the fire he lit in the centre's basement.	 This game turned sad when I reached his ending. I decided to replay it, this time going for the fluffball of a partridge, Shuu, or shall I say  Isa Souma.	 His ending made this game much darker. I decided to play the rest of the game. After I played Ryouta's ending, a new choice popped up. I could fulfill a promise. I didn't know it at the time, but I wasn't Hiyoko when I made the choice. I was the Doctor. Shuu wanted to fulfill the promise he made to someone he loved. The game switched genres before my eyes. It went from a supposedly silly dating simulator to a horrifying murder mystery with pigeons. This game, while being amazing, has a few flaws, but they are quite small compared to the pros. The grammar isn't very good compared to some games, but what do you expect from a game translated into English from Japanese. There are also numerous plot holes that aren't solved unless you buy the sequel, Holiday Star. Like  why Hitori bleached his feathers. Most believe that it was to hide his true identity to get revenge on Shuu. While that is true, there is a second reason.Overall, this game is fantastic. It gets you hooked on the eerie and sad twists and then just makes a 360 turn into pigeon hell. There is no escaping now.Rating8 running Okosan's out of 10.			"

												Hatoful Boyfriend is a game that seems like a huge joke, and then it turns out its actually not. When you starts playing everything is fun and games, but then you actually get attached to these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed pigeons and somewhere near the end of routes you forget that this game is about dating /pigeons/. And thats not anywhere close to end, because after you complete every route, a special part of story opens up for you, where you learn that everything was a lie and the author stabs you with a knife. Methaporically, of course. What im trying to say is that Hatoful Boyfriend is going to surprise you. When i first get to play this game i thought everyone was overreacting and this game is a joke people treat too seriously. Well, i was wrong. I love this game, both for the not very serious, you-are-dating-pigeons-for-♥♥♥♥s-sake part, and for the part that is actually a nicely written, serious story about... well, you will see if you try this game.Even if you are convinced its♥♥♥♥♥♥ id still recommend trying out Hatoful Boyfriend, as this game is, well, an Experience. A very good one, if you ask me.			"

												I had always secretly wanted this game just by how ridiculous this game is. Evidently there was good reason, as you progress through the game, making choices, interacting with possible husbandoves, and taken twists and turns, the experience overall is ridiculous.  It is a fun game, and great that it offers a fast forward option when you want to skip sections you have read already (such as the beginning).  Progressing through the story isn't terribly long for most endings, and trying to get each birdies ending is fairly straight forward.  This game is easily replayable, especially when you unlock more endings, and can easily get you hooked.  I suggest buying it on sale, however full price isn't terrible either.My only quarrel is sometimes getting a full ending for a character may not always be clear cut, and thus having to restart a new game may be cumborsome, and one of the endings took a little longer than I would have liked (regardless of how interesting it got).It's a great game and earns and 8 out of 10 stars.Something Everbirdie would love, so go find your husbandoveP.S. I'm putting this game as a nomination for The “I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award” Award.  This game, with little advertising, is actually a very fun game, even for those who don't typically enjoy visual novels. I'll update my review if my nominee changes.			"

I like birds, and what better than a bird dating sim?I quickly grew in love with the game due to the deeper story, and this game is one of the few games which made me cry.I recommend this game for visual novel enthusiasts that like both tragedy and comedy.

												First Part of your Game: Repeating the same story over and over 13 times to get every each unique ending, though very repetitive and can be boring at times, still entertaining and interesting to see their backstory. But that's just the start of the game.Second Part of your Game: A 4 hour + Awesome Graphic Novel taking all these backstories and making an amazing fluid story that's touching EVEN THOUGH THE GAME IS ABOUT PIDGEONS. It brings it into a gem and has achieved its status of the best graphic novel out there.If you are going to buy this game, make sure you experience everything not just the gimmick of pidgeon dating.

Just the ending of it made me want to know lil more haha :) -maybe spoilers for someone ahead, not talking about the story tho-This game has some fun things that i noticed during gameplay.. Like references of pokemon and gurren lagann (this one made me laught sooo much when i saw it!!).

												before I rant off, 10/10 would fly again.okay so I first played this game from it being a thing on tumblr and my friend made me play it.Apparently it hit deep, each background for every character, it seems like all these different dating games in one, and all about BIRDS. All these choices and it's wonderful. I thought it was weird , but then I realized it didn't matter it's all perfect, the way it is. But Complete the game, all endings, do the second story, do it all, and you'll feel heart heavy. I believe hatoful plays on ""heartful"" and ""hurtful"" which is like the first half of the game then the second. UNLOCK THE OTHER, WILL maybe NOT REGRET. I regret nothing. I will fly with these birds until it's stated I can't. Or you know, holiday star. A+ciao			"

												I originally tried playing this game several years ago, but I wasn't able to return to it. I decided to give it a second chance and I'm incredibly happy that I did.Yes, the concept is very silly. It's easy to pass this game off as a gimmick that you'd read about, or maybe play a little of before putting it away and never thinking about it again. I don't think that's the point, however. The way the game deals with having a cast of pigeons is almost deadpan at times, which makes the great writing (especially in ""Hurtful Boyfriend"") take on a delightful level of personality.I still don't like Shuu, though.

This game got really dark, and I was utterly fascinated by it.I wish I could erase the game from my mind and play it all over again. It was really THAT good, even if the whole ""trying to date birds"" bit is weird at first.  I highly recommend this game to everyone, especially if you want a really fascinating story.			"

Hatoful Boyfriend starts off light-hearted and silly, but it suprisingly draws you in. Though all the characters are supposidly based around certain dating sim tropes, I was charmed by their personalities and backstories! ...I might have cried a lot little at points as well.Sure, go into the game with a mindset that it's a laugh, but it'll quickly turn serious with the BBL route. You won't be dissappointed. And with some hope, we'll see the sequel on Steam in the future too :D			"

												Let's see.. I bought this because I was told it was good. I was curious how a bird (!!!) dating sim could be so interesting. I had my sister buy it for me when it was on sale. Avoiding her suspicious gaze, I managed to convince her to get me the game.On my first try, it didn't go well. I thought I could go along without wooing any birds (actually I was hoping I would ""accidentally"" woo one of them while I choose options that are closest to what I would do if I really was the character in-game). Let's just say I can't or I'll end up dead.So I made a resolve to woo one of them. My first 'target' is Nageki. Shy freshman. Always in the library. I didn't regret my decision even tho he was actually a ghost. Finding enough amusement on his ending, I decided to get all  endings and thus get all the achievements.What I love about this game is the fact that it manages to give depth to the characters and somehow interwine them together. I admit I underestimated the game. I thought I, or the player, will be left clueless as to who the birds actually are. I mean, I've never played dating sims before but I assumed they don't have complex storylines. If anything, I never thought the game has a rich storyline on its own (BBL ending). Heck, even the other endings stirred quite some emotions within me (I hate the doctor. He's damn creepy and he killed me).It'll get boring while finishing all the endings (it can get frustrating when you clicked the wrong option and somehow got the ending you weren't hoping for), luckily there's a forward button that speeds everything up. In this game, patience is greatly rewarded.I strongly suggest getting all the endings and eventually getting both the BBL ending and the BBL epilogue. That's when you'll understand why people like this game.			"

You must ford the confusing waters of an international conspiracy. Will you join the track team or the student council? Will you encounter the darkness beneath you all? Will you go to the fair with Ryouta, your friend and ally? Or will you take the arm of Shuu, the dastardly and intimidating physician? 10/10 GOTY			"

												When I bought this game, I had heard about it briefly and was intrigued by the fact that, yes, you are a girl that goes to a pigeon school and you are trying to find love with pigeons.  I thought it was silly and was going to be a joke -- but it was on sale so I decided that I would bite the bullet and make the purchase.I am so happy I did.  This is by far one of my favorite games on Steam and perhaps one of the best visual novels out there.  The characters are dynamic and the story telling is fun and captivating.  With every decision you make opens new doors for new and interesting endings.  With each ending you get, a little bit more about the world unfolds.  It's much larger and more interesting than what it seems to be -- there's a strange dark undertone to this story.  It's hours of fun.Plus, who doesn't want a pigeon boyfriend?			"

												This game took me completely by surprise.Everything about Hatoful Boyfriend suggested that it wasn't anything more than a joke. I expected to play this game for an hour, show it to my friends, have a good laugh, and move on. What I didn't expect, was just how much this game would impact me on a deeper level.The story starts off slow, gradually introducing you to each bird. This is the part of the game where the concept is at its most ludicrous. Bird puns are thrown around with reckless enthusiasm, and you'd be forgiven for assuming that the rest of the story would follow in the same comedic vein. However, there's a much darker tale lying just beneath the surface. I don't want to spoil anything here, but suffice to say that these birds have issues. Tragic pasts, entertwining dramas, bleak outlooks, sinister plans, and a caveat of other unexpected elements in their lives. The sad part is, it's entirely possible not to witness ANY of these plot threads on your first playthrough, and there will undoubtedly be people who miss out on these awesome stories because they were unlucky enough to get a generic, predictable story on their first playthrough, which might turn them off to exploring relationships with the other birds. If you stick with it, and go back through the game seeking different outcomes, you will not be dissapointed. Hatoful Boyfriend is full of surprises, and you'll be rewarded for getting to know its twisted universe, and the characters within it. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I highly recommend this game. It definitely isn't for everyone, which is understandable given the ridiculous concept, but if you can get past that, there's some very memorable, touching, and hilarious moments just waiting to be discovered in this unexpected gem.

												If I didn't really enjoy this game I wouldn't have bothered to recommend it. I got it because it was a decent price, kind of goofy looking and I didn't want something that was going to frustrate the hell out of me and consume my soul. Well, my soul was somewhat consumed for about 10 hours of gameplay because I couldn't stop playing. I was frustrated the first day and ready to quit and wah about what a waste of money it was but after I picked up some of the birds' personalities it got a lot easier to navigate. The only thing I DON'T like about this game is there are a few ""normal"" vs ""true"" endings to some of the storylines (which are annoyingly similar but a PIA to figure out), and you need to get all of them to unlock the last chapter which is honestly very worth all the time you may or may not throw into the game. I think it does make a diference that these are birds and they're not really animated looking which spruces up the whole visual novel thing...and makes the entire story, characters, and interactions that much goofier and entertaining. There is more darker content than you'd expect, but that's not a bad thing at all. Though I've gone through the main storylines a hundred times now to unlock all the endings I would play the BBL ending again because it has high replay/story value. Hope if you get it you enjoy!			"

												With every single bit of seriousness my body can muster, out of every game I've played, this is genuinely one of the best written stories I have ever had the pleasure of playing through, PERIOD. Most people will look at this game, play through maybe one or two routes, write it off as ""jokey birb game"", and, unfortunately, never touch it again. Which sucks, considering the real meat of this game lies in the epilogue, where the genre does a complete 180. This game goes from animu-like dating sim with some hilarious parodies of a lot of visual novel tropes (with the exception of the Nageki route, which deals with some very heavy subjects), to a murder mystery full of twists and turns, with some surprisingly disturbing horror elements thrown in. There were at least three different points where I thought the game was about to end, but it just kept throwing more and more curveballs at me.The core game is full of wonderful silliness and knows what it is. The characters and their personalities are memorable and hilarious.Definitely a must-complete kind of game. Took me around 10 hours to go through every route and get the true ending. :)			"

												I recommend ""Hatoful Boyfriend"" to everybirdie who likes storytelling games.At first I thought ""What the duck? A dating sim with birds, are you serious?"", but I bought the game because I was too excited about the content.You play as a human girl who is allowed to study at a school for intelligent birds. In the end, you can have a relationship with one of the male birds. By studying certain subjects, going to certain places and talking to certain pigeons, the story develops in different ways.You can either receive a funny ending, or a suspenseful one, or a romantic one, or a supernatural one including a bossfight - it depends on your decision. The various stories about the birdiest of birds are more than just some dating-stories: They are really fascinating and I am truly surprised about that. (And, in addition, the pigeons are so cute!)10/10 must now train to achieve true pudding!			"

												I had always secretly wanted this game just by how ridiculous this game is. Evidently there was good reason, as you progress through the game, making choices, interacting with possible husbandoves, and taken twists and turns, the experience overall is ridiculous.  It is a fun game, and great that it offers a fast forward option when you want to skip sections you have read already (such as the beginning).  Progressing through the story isn't terribly long for most endings, and trying to get each birdies ending is fairly straight forward.  This game is easily replayable, especially when you unlock more endings, and can easily get you hooked.  I suggest buying it on sale, however full price isn't terrible either.My only quarrel is sometimes getting a full ending for a character may not always be clear cut, and thus having to restart a new game may be cumborsome, and one of the endings took a little longer than I would have liked (regardless of how interesting it got).It's a great game and earns and 8 out of 10 stars.Something Everbirdie would love, so go find your husbandoveP.S. I'm putting this game as a nomination for The “I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award” Award.  This game, with little advertising, is actually a very fun game, even for those who don't typically enjoy visual novels. I'll update my review if my nominee changes.			"

												Thirteen hours. Thirteen hours in less than three days I have logged into this game. Never have I been so drawn into pigeons.Like everyone else here, I was drawn in by the promise of a silly dating SIM involving birds. I didn't expect this game to be anything intensely amazing. So, when I began, though I had read plenty of reviews, I did not take too many of them that seriously. At first I wasn't overly impressed. The storyline itself seemed solid, though a bit vauge, and the choices that you are allowed in the game are relatively few. It's more a reading adventure than anything, and I quickly learned how to make each bird like me. However, the storyline wasn't nearly so well made as the reviews had spoken of. I had my favorites, of course, but the game seemed a little flat and lacking even at the deepest stories (my personal favorites are Nageki's and Sakuya's), and I disliked the lack of ability to interact with other birds while trying to woo a specific fowl.And then, though tenacity and determination, I got through all 14 endings, and everything changed.I won't say anything about the BBL ending. It needs to be played to be appreciated. But this story? This entire game is a work of art. I sat for three hours straight, playing the ending alone, just gaping at how well and perfectly everything fit together, with all the character interaction I had been missing and the complex storylines and depth that the game has been lauded for.This game is worth every penny.There are some technical difficulties I'm not impressed with. The save feature, for me, was a joke. Half the time the game would glitch and freeze when a save point was loaded, and made me have to go through and replay the game again. I saw the intro at least 12 times, which is more times than anyone needs to be introduced to each bird and can get sickeningly boring. The game also had a tendancy to freeze at important decisions, making me have to replay yet again, so it became a real effort in patience trying to deal with these glitches without throwing it out. All through the three hour ending, I was on the edge of my seat half expecting to have to go through most of it again because it might decide to freeze on me. Thankfully, it did not do any such thing, and I was able to enjoy myself through the massive and bright storyline *ehehe*. I also don't reccomend this game for those who are sensitive to gore and murder. Not because it shows any, because it doesn't, but some of these storylines get rather... descriptive of these things. I wouldn't say it's anything for kids, for sure.Even with these issues, if you're on the fence, tip over and fly. You won't regret it.~Kero "

												A silly dating game where you date birds? Guess again. That is just the beginning. If you dig deeper to the game, you find well written and suspensful story that grabs you by your heart with a tight grip and makes you care about these birds. The story is very complex and I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys anykind of visual novels or just a very good, well written story.  Just be open minded when going to this game; it's more than a dating game about birds. Believe me.But it does require lots of reading the same dialogues again to get all the endings that lead to the very best part of the game. So beware that you will have to work a bit for the hidden gems that this game offers. But think it's a reward. For once completing everything in the game gives you something, not just achievements, but actually more story to dive into. Probably one of the best visual novels I have ever encountered.			"

												Just finished the whole game 100% with all the endings. And i gotta say i love this game. It made me feel many emotions on the way of this game jorney. Great story and gotta say the ""last"" story is just amazing.. it was much longer than any other of these love-stories and i can say that compliting all other rouds is worth it. I do recoment this game, definedly. Especially for ppl that love interesting stories. For me, I love this game. Its great. Just the ending of it made me want to know lil more haha :) -maybe spoilers for someone ahead, not talking about the story tho-This game has some fun things that i noticed during gameplay.. Like references of pokemon and gurren lagann (this one made me laught sooo much when i saw it!!). And then some gameplay moments u kinda already know, like what going to happend and so.. but it didnt bother me at all.			"

Worth far more than the $10 price tag, definitely a good investment. Make sure to play through for all the endings because you won't want to miss out on a single moment.			"

												Birdie lovin' with birds. All jokes aside, this game is a very solid VN. Don't let the pigeons fool you, it's not simply a gimmick, the author honest to god loves birds and it really shows! When I played the original version a few years back, I initially was grinning like an idiot to sobbing uncontrollably and this game gave me feelings I never asked for or expected at all. It's definitely more than what it appears to be on the surface, so if you love visual novels or don't mind text heavy stuff I'd highly recommend this. Plus, proceeds do contribute to the purchase of toys and food for the real life version of some of these birds. You wouldn't want to leave Okosan hungry, would you?If you've already played the game, this adds an Azami route and polishes up backgrounds and for me, the text was much easier on the eyes. If you haven't played before, prepare for a wild ride and an intense urge to hold hands with fluffy pigeons. It's worth every penny and if you love it as much as I do, look into the mini-sequel Holiday Star! (Or wait for it's HD Edition announcement.)			"

												Excellent game, fantastic game - I did not know who I was before playing Hatoful Boyfriend.  I've always felt a strong kinship with birds of all kinds, and this game only expanded upon that.  I was thrust headfirst into the life of high school birds, each accompanied by their own unique personality!  All of my senses were titillated as I lived out my very own bird's entire social life through highscool, culminating in a life-lasting relationship with the bird matched to me via the game's algorithm!  Wow!  What an experience this game was, and I truly wish for more downloadable additions to this franchise.  This game has spawned my own quest to research more about bird social groups and explore more about bird psychology on my way towards developing my inner bird.  These topics fuel my passion for who, ultimately what, I am.  I am forever in debt to this game for the light that it has shown me.  I am humbled.You will be given the opportunity to transform your birds into humans but you will ruin the experience and perpetuate the myth about the misunderstaing of bird cognitive abilities.			"

Wanting a good laugh, I looked up a video on it. What I got was soem laughs from the clever writitng, but I also got characters that, despite the absurd premise of the game, were actually well-written and had some depth. I was shocked that I found myself wanting to see other routes, to learn more about the world. Now that I've seen everything there is to be had, I highly recommend Hatoful Boyfriend. Funny writing, great characters, and just enough hints at a mysterious hidden lore that you'll piece together on your way to a... special route.			"

												Warning: Possible SpoilersI didn't expect a bird dating sim (yes, you read that right) to make me have feelings in just the normal play throughs. As with other dating sims, you pick a character to pursue and follow the story with them. Each story had an ending (and some had a second, ""extended"" ending) and some were sweet, whereas others were... creepy. But all of them had some story that seemed to weave and connect together.Once you play through specific endings (though I'm not sure which ones they are, as I completed all the normal and extended endings first), you can start a new game which will lead you to an alternate ending. And man! The ramifications of that story! It takes a dark twist really fast, and just keeps leading you down the rabbit hole. But the amazing thing? All of the little story bits you've picked up throughout all the dating endings come to a close in the final story.This game is great. I cried a bunch. I laughed a bunch. I said ""NO WAY!"" a bunch. The way it all ties together was mind blowing. That so much forethought had gone into this silly bird dating sim to create something much more than that. There is also an Epilogue ending you can get if you have completed all of the prior endings, and it ties everything else up in a nice little bow, and makes you feel better about the outcome of things overall.

												I didn't know what I was getting into when I first purchased this game. I had heard good things about it, but I didn't know for absolute certain if I would like it. Don't get me wrong, I love visual novels, and I like birds, but a visual novel about romancing birds? That was something different.I went into the game not knowing what to expect. I came out of it completely in love with everything it had to offer.The storyline seems simple: you play as a girl who is entering an all-birds school as the only human. Your life as a high school student is determined by the choices you make, as well as who you choose to romance.The more I played the game and unlocked endings, the more I fell in love with the characters and their stories. Everyone in the game is more than what meets the eye, and are actually deep and well-developed (sans Okosan; he's just comic relief).The story, as simple as it seems, is actually really dark and heartbreaking, especially the ""BBL Route"". I won't spoil anything, but it caught me off-guard. Throughout the character routes, I actually found myself tearing up a bit. Nageki and Ryouta's routes come to mind when it comes to emotional storytelling.Overall, Hatoful Boyfriend is a game I can't recommend enough. It's funny, cute, and still manages to have a story you can take seriously even thought the cast is made up of birds. This game is worth the $10, but if you want to wait for the price to drop, go ahead. This isn't a game you want to miss out on.Pros-+ Funny and charming atmosphere in the beginning.+ Still manages to be taken seriously when things take a dark turn.+ A lovable cast of characters.+ It's one of the most unique visual novels I've played/read.Cons-- The looks on your confused friends' faces when they see this game in your library.- Having to explain to them why you bought the game in the first place.Recommended for:Bird fans, romance anime fans, and those looking for something different and refreshing.Rating:Buy / Wait / Burn?BUY			"

I laughed throughout my entire journey. I cried during some of the endings. I questioned my life towards the end.It was all worth it.Seriously, if you want to laugh, buy this game.If you want to have a good story, buy this game.If you love visual novels, buy this game.If you have money, buy this game.Seriously, this is the best game of 2014 so far.Also the best part of the game isn't a dating simulator so there's that.

												I've known of this game since the first English translation (when it came to popularity out of Japan) and at first I bursted into laughter. Nevertheless, I found myself rather curious for it, so when I knew this got on Steam it was an almost instant purchase.I'm not very fond of dating sims, but wth, I never dated a bird.At first I was laughing when everybirdie was presented to me (Sakuya made me laugh at first, really). Then I thought ""wow, so this character is a very close friend of Ryouta, let's get his ending, that'll be fun"".At the end I ♥♥♥♥ing cried. I cried A LOT.Then I got to another ending where I cried so hard I had to quit the PC and rest for likely half an hour.I think the masterpiece in this game is when you get to know everybirdie, you actually make a bond with them, not just on the game, but you feel sympathy for them. At some points you feel you're there, that everything around you doesn't exists, it's you and the story. And I think that's the greatest achievement when you make a videogame. Suppose you just got from a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ day at school/work and you don't want to think about it. Then you start this game and get absorbed by it. You forget about your bad day and find yourself engulfed in the story.Don't think of Hatoful Boyfriend as yet another dating sim. Don't think of it as a joke. Just try it and you'll like it, I assure you.PS: I ♥♥♥♥ing love pudding.			"

												Hatoful Boyfriend is really a genre-defying work of art. Forget everything you think it is and dive in beak-first to this visual novel romance that hides a suspenseful secret underneath. It's funny, cute, and definitely worth playing, so hurry up and buy it!For a more elaborate description of my feelings on this game, consider my full review at https://shellgamesblog.wordpress.com/2015/10/20/hatoful-boyfriend-review/ "

												The game (more like an interactive book) got several interwoven plotlines with one big picture in mind, all drawn out well with sometimes funny, alot more often tragic colors. As others said: Very dark storyline(s), but well hidden until one uncovers all of it. Compared to most games storylines nowadays, its at the very top. Worth every minute and more.			"

												This game... why didn't I read the reviews first?  I blindly assumed it would just be a funny dating game full of bird puns.  I was so wrong.  I will say this: even if you're not totally sold on your first playthrough, keep getting all the endings, because the BBL ending that unlocks is practically a whole other game unto itself.  The more you play this, the more you learn about the world and the characters, and the better it gets.  ...Am I actually saying this about a dating sim about birds?  This game....			"

If you've the time and want to spend it, I do recommend giving this one a try.			"

												I will admit I found the game weird at first but I bought it during an offer, so I decided to give a shot. Most of the routes were kinda just there, to make me laugh (Okosan's, holy pudding, why?) or question why I was trying to date birds that were more intelligent than my character, but also, others were kind of cute (Sakuya's and Nageki's almost made me cry), and the Bad Boys Love Route was worth all the time I wasted trying to get Shuu's normal ending (I hated him, not his route). And I'll not forget all the memorable lines my character did during the playthrough, she was quite funny, and that helped me to not get bored in some routes (Ninja doctor, seriously?).Believe me, if you are looking for something funny to waste 20 minutes on a day, here is the perfect game, but warning, there's a plot here, and a pretty good one, with really memorable characters, fun dialogue and an ending that will leave you really satisfied, even if it has nothing to do with your character.So I'll say 8/10. It's not perfect because it can get boring trying to get all the endings, but it's a really simple game to amuse you (Get Azami's and Okosan's full ending and you'll understand why) for a little while before making you cry with some really good twists.

												Ohoho, do I love this game.Hatoful Boyfriend gives a very unique experience to anyone who plays it. Not just because you're dating pigeons. It gives you an experience where you can go through silly environments and meet simple characters with a very light-hearted plot and end up in very sad, feels-giving places a few minutes later. Yep, it's one of those games.Let's list the pros and cons of this game to simplify this review.PROS:* Amazing storyline that can be feels-y, entertaining, humorous, silly, and dark all at the same time* Characters that are fun to be around and all very different and interesting in their own way* Beautiful graphics and illustrations, even if the pigeons do look out of place* The soundtrackCONS:* ....uh. * I honestly can't really think of any.* I'm dead serious.I would highly recommend this game to anyone. It's certainly worth your money.I'd give Hatoful Boyfriend a 9/10. "

												Warning: Possible SpoilersI didn't expect a bird dating sim (yes, you read that right) to make me have feelings in just the normal play throughs. As with other dating sims, you pick a character to pursue and follow the story with them. Each story had an ending (and some had a second, ""extended"" ending) and some were sweet, whereas others were... creepy. But all of them had some story that seemed to weave and connect together.Once you play through specific endings (though I'm not sure which ones they are, as I completed all the normal and extended endings first), you can start a new game which will lead you to an alternate ending. And man! The ramifications of that story! It takes a dark twist really fast, and just keeps leading you down the rabbit hole. But the amazing thing? All of the little story bits you've picked up throughout all the dating endings come to a close in the final story.This game is great. I cried a bunch. I laughed a bunch. I said ""NO WAY!"" a bunch. The way it all ties together was mind blowing. That so much forethought had gone into this silly bird dating sim to create something much more than that. There is also an Epilogue ending you can get if you have completed all of the prior endings, and it ties everything else up in a nice little bow, and makes you feel better about the outcome of things overall.

												This game took me completely by surprise.Everything about Hatoful Boyfriend suggested that it wasn't anything more than a joke. I expected to play this game for an hour, show it to my friends, have a good laugh, and move on. What I didn't expect, was just how much this game would impact me on a deeper level.The story starts off slow, gradually introducing you to each bird. This is the part of the game where the concept is at its most ludicrous. Bird puns are thrown around with reckless enthusiasm, and you'd be forgiven for assuming that the rest of the story would follow in the same comedic vein. However, there's a much darker tale lying just beneath the surface. I don't want to spoil anything here, but suffice to say that these birds have issues. Tragic pasts, entertwining dramas, bleak outlooks, sinister plans, and a caveat of other unexpected elements in their lives. The sad part is, it's entirely possible not to witness ANY of these plot threads on your first playthrough, and there will undoubtedly be people who miss out on these awesome stories because they were unlucky enough to get a generic, predictable story on their first playthrough, which might turn them off to exploring relationships with the other birds. If you stick with it, and go back through the game seeking different outcomes, you will not be dissapointed. Hatoful Boyfriend is full of surprises, and you'll be rewarded for getting to know its twisted universe, and the characters within it. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I highly recommend this game. It definitely isn't for everyone, which is understandable given the ridiculous concept, but if you can get past that, there's some very memorable, touching, and hilarious moments just waiting to be discovered in this unexpected gem.

												This is an extremely frustrating game to talk about. Make no mistake, it's very good: funny, heartfelt, and surprisingly engaging, it's just a very frustrating game to discuss in detail (and especially to recommend) since it has a lot of really important plot twists and rug-pull moments that can lose their edge if you've been spoiled to them beforehand. As such, it's kind of hard to review in-depth beyond a very generic ""it's really good"". Which it is, for what it's worth.It's kind of a game you have to take in on good faith; if you've heard the game is good and want to check it out for yourself, or if you don't know anything about it but think the premise is ridiculous enough to want to experience it for a laugh, you should definitely trust your gut and pick it up.

And some well...hohoho that's up to you to find out.I forged on after my first heartfelt ending of the Nageki route which remains my favorite. My one and only true love till the end. Conquering each route left and right, I felt myself growing attached to each bird sometimes without even realizing. Each one opened my eyes even further to the deep plot behind Hatoful Boyfriend all leading up to the BBL ending. And then I was overcome with a spasm of coughs and it felt like my heart was ripped out of my chest and I died.10/10 Game of all years.Would recommend.			"

												When I bought this game, I had heard about it briefly and was intrigued by the fact that, yes, you are a girl that goes to a pigeon school and you are trying to find love with pigeons.  I thought it was silly and was going to be a joke -- but it was on sale so I decided that I would bite the bullet and make the purchase.I am so happy I did.  This is by far one of my favorite games on Steam and perhaps one of the best visual novels out there.  The characters are dynamic and the story telling is fun and captivating.  With every decision you make opens new doors for new and interesting endings.  With each ending you get, a little bit more about the world unfolds.  It's much larger and more interesting than what it seems to be -- there's a strange dark undertone to this story.  It's hours of fun.Plus, who doesn't want a pigeon boyfriend?			"

												Listen, I know.It's a visual-novel-dating-sim thing, featuring birds.It's one of those things that sounds like a game played by straw-man nerd losers in a cartoon.However, it's a surprisingly engaging and deep story, with a level of content connectedness that is truly excessive.Excessive because it all works so stupidly well. I went into this thinking it was going to be a silly, stupid, amusing romp.I emerged feeling 100% on board with calling it art, even to the point of being comfortable actively endorsing people play the game, despite the, uh, unsavory impression it may make to say ""No really, play this game where you try to bone birds""10/10Side note: I played this with a group of friends, and we read the whole thing aloud, in stupid voices. I'm sure that added to the enjoyment, but keep in mind that the game will become increasingly dark and serious, and the voices may rob some emotional scenes of their gravitas(again, I know, I'm talking about the bird-boning game).

												Hatoful Boyfriend isn't just the hilarious pigeon dating sim you see on the surface. Radical political parties, genocide, experimentation, biological warfare, murder, pudding--just to name a few--are all themes you'll encounter in this game.You are a human transfer student in a school specifically for birds. Unbeknownst to you, your mission is to woo every bird in the school, albeit one at a time in separate playthroughs. Each bird has different interests, personalities, and backstories, but the more you play, the more you'll realize that they're all intertwined, and that there's something terribly sinister going on at your school behind the scenes. Once you've seduced every bird and achieved every ending, you are rewarded with a chance to ""fulfill the promise,"" and solve a mystery that will leave you on the edge of your seat for hours.Hatoful Boyfriend is beyond deceptive in its marketing as a joke, and I hadn't expected that it would tell a wonderfully written story that would leave me in tears at its end.--My only gripe about Hatoful Boyfriend is the spotty save system, as so many others seem to have issues with, too. I would occasionally need to load a save only to find that it would load a background without characters, text, or interface, forcing me to Alt+F4 to leave the game. The save file was forever corrupted, and I would have to restart that particular storyline. The dating playthroughs are short enough to finish in single sittings, but the finale can take hours to finish. I would recommend playing the finale only if you know you have a lot of free time ahead of you, at least until the save issues are fixed. I will amend this review should they be resolved.Oh, and the occasional typo or missing word, but that's not a big deal.--Have fun, everybirdie!			"

Admittedly, my experience with visual novels is a bit lacking (consisting mostly of Analogue: A Hate Story, Hate Plus, and various Twine games), but I have a feeling that Hatoful Boyfriend is probably not quite representative of a typical Japanese dating sim VN (and not just because of the birds).I don't want to spoil too much of the story, but it frequently veers pretty far off the beaten path. Japanese High school dating sim VNs have never really appealed to me too much as a general concept, but this game is much, much more than just a dating sim. The stories are wildly varied depending on your choices and what ending you're going for. There is thankfully a fast-forward button to get right to different choices to see how they play out, as well as ample save slots for saving before important choices.And I'd strongly recommend playing through every ending (don't be afraid to use a guide after your first playthrough). Each ending is interesting and varied on its own, but also because it unlocks a special epilogue story that's actually much longer than a normal playthrough. And the epilogue is definitely worth playing through - it gives a lot of background information on how the (evidently post-apocalyptic) society came about, and explains a lot of the backstories of the birds and the world you inhabit. It does drag on a bit near the end, but I'm really glad I played through to the end.If you like visual novels you'll love this game. If you don't like visual novels you'll still love this game because it's hilarious and weird and delightful. It certainly delivers a silly tongue-in-cheek bird dating parody, but it's so much more than that. Buy it.			"

												My GF and I cracked jokes about this game for ages.Picked it up for cheap in a humble bundle to be a smart♥♥♥♥♥Spent next 5 hours playing it.This is funny/sad/crazy/scary, and you truly have not played it until you have played it more than once. I unlocked a new ending which built upon a previous ending where I was murdered, and ended up fighting an end boss to keep the world from being destroyed lol.			"

												The characters are all memorable and well fleshed out. You actually get attached to them and want to know all their stories. It does parody dating sims but it doesn't stoop to poorly written characters and has great writing. It takes a while to get used to the premise but once you do it feels normal. Each of the dating storylines seem independent of each other, but they all contribute to a larger world (minus okosan). The payoff when you unlock the Bad Boy's Love (Hurtful Boyfriend) is immense and all the setup to the world and the characters is not lost. All loose ends are tied up and the characters are fleshed out a lot. Some people might be taken aback by the mood whiplash of Hurtful boyfriend, however the story is so engaging that you will sit there for the 3 hours it takes to finish it. While the dating sims is somewhat predictable (though not fully) the main storyline (hurtful boyfriend) is not and is very gripping. Carve it into your soul, kid 10/10			"

TL;DR reviewWorth the money at half price (or better), but has several drawbacks that do not warrant a purchase at full price in my opinion. If you invest money into the game, be sure to reach the ""BBL ending""; achieved through obtaining endings for all other routes. It makes the game a worthwhile investment, whilst the regular routes are poor at best.   Cons:The majority of the game grinding endings to get to the proper storyline (""BBL ending"") is arduous, filled with ridiculous and often out-of-place dialogue that feels like it's pandering to the common internet idiot of today. Text is filled with ""memes"" and comical-at-best attempts at humour, with lavish and over-the-top hyperbole. Whether or not you ""get"" the references, you will be appalled at how hard the translators (and/or original story-writers, if the translations were properly adapted) try to fit them into as many situations as possible.   Pros• The inclusion of a 'fast-text' skip for the same scenes that will inevitably be repeated is a god-send; makes walking back through the game to achieve the alternate endings bearable.  • The final ending, and the story leading up to it (along with the glimmers of actual storyline in the shallow individual endings), is engrossing, and well worth the time to complete. The tone is different to that of the rest of the game, and justifies this as a purchase, if nothing else.			"

												This game does look wierd the first time but when playing it you actually see that the developers did put alot of work into it and that the story isnt that bad either.Actually the story gets really interestning and there are many different endings and even after plaxing the Main Story there is another extra story which is even longer. So after all the Story is good. (although it gets wierd at some points.)Im a little sad though that the Human displays are only shown when meeting a bird the first time instead of always being shown.Overall while it may seem like a game made for girls (i guess) you can actually enjoy it as a boy even without being drunk.(although being drunk increases the fun factor, i laughed my♥♥♥♥♥off sometimes. :p )I like the Musik and occasional reactions and stuff however some sounds are way lounder than other sounds which hurt my ears.The menu and graphics are good too although the menu could look a bit better but honestly the Artstyle is amazing!Overall i enjoyed playing this game and it was well worth my money.9/10			"

												This game is so intense that it gave my anxiety. This is not your average dating sim, and has a seriously thick and intricate plot. It is kinda lame and dumb if you only play for one or two endings. You gotta try to 100% the game for it to get really really good and for EVERYTHING to finally makes sense. There is actually a reason that you are the only human at a bird school. I cried a couple times. This is actually really well written... and kind of spooky. TL;DR I bought this games for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles and got too many feels and had my mind blown a little bit.10/10 would date birds again			"

												Let's see.. I bought this because I was told it was good. I was curious how a bird (!!!) dating sim could be so interesting. I had my sister buy it for me when it was on sale. Avoiding her suspicious gaze, I managed to convince her to get me the game.On my first try, it didn't go well. I thought I could go along without wooing any birds (actually I was hoping I would ""accidentally"" woo one of them while I choose options that are closest to what I would do if I really was the character in-game). Let's just say I can't or I'll end up dead.So I made a resolve to woo one of them. My first 'target' is Nageki. Shy freshman. Always in the library. I didn't regret my decision even tho he was actually a ghost. Finding enough amusement on his ending, I decided to get all  endings and thus get all the achievements.What I love about this game is the fact that it manages to give depth to the characters and somehow interwine them together. I admit I underestimated the game. I thought I, or the player, will be left clueless as to who the birds actually are. I mean, I've never played dating sims before but I assumed they don't have complex storylines. If anything, I never thought the game has a rich storyline on its own (BBL ending). Heck, even the other endings stirred quite some emotions within me (I hate the doctor. He's damn creepy and he killed me).It'll get boring while finishing all the endings (it can get frustrating when you clicked the wrong option and somehow got the ending you weren't hoping for), luckily there's a forward button that speeds everything up. In this game, patience is greatly rewarded.I strongly suggest getting all the endings and eventually getting both the BBL ending and the BBL epilogue. That's when you'll understand why people like this game.			"

												Oh dear, where do I start.Okay. This game was unreal. I thought I'd get a couple hours of goofing off with a bunch of pigeons and that it would be all fun and games and laughs and then I'd leave and play something more serious.Yeah...this game isn't just for sh**s and giggles. But there are many giggles. This game is as cute as it gets. You've got all these birds and they're all so different. At first glance you might think they're stereotypes come to life, but as it is with most people, there's more than meets the eye. Everybirdie has something special about them.I didn't even think I'd want to complete every single path, but sure enough I did. The BBL ending definitely gives you the most intriguing ending with lots of mystery and lots of Sakuya (eeeeee excuse me while I fangirl). I must admit my favourite endings were the more lighthearted ones though, the ones that were sweet and fluffy. And carve it into your soul, kid! There were many great endings. It's hard to pick a favourite.Also I thought Ryouta's path would be a bit more boring because he's the typical childhood-friend-turned-true-love kind of story everyone seems to love, but I think it was the most rewarding end.I really appreciate how the writer(s) approached topics like disability, status and even teacher crushes. There was never a point where I thought ""Hmm, this seems inappropriate and harmful"". Especially in a ""dating sim"" I even expected problematic moments, but there weren't any. I was overjoyed by that.WARNING: If you plan to do all the endings, this game does have its share of the violent and the gruesome. While you're not going to see blood and guts, trust me, some of the content in this game is very disturbing. There's murder (which I thought would give me nightmares nearly), suicide (which is dealt with quite respectfully) and probably other stuff I can't think of right now.For a so-called dating sim, this game isn't overly romantic. It feels more like a friendship sim than dating, to be perfectly honest. I loved that about this game. It surpassed every expectation.One complaint is the typos, specifically in the BBL ending. Way too many, and it made otherwise hard-hitting lines come off a little...underwhelming. But seriously, don't let that deter you. Just know that it's there, but that's one of my only real complaints.Lastly, I just want to mention the characters, who are all extremely rich and satisfying to learn about. I had a soft spot for Nageki, Ryouya, Sakuya and Yuuya. But surprisingly, the playable character is also super interesting as well! As you go through the endings, you learn about the bird of the hour but also quite a bit on who you're playing as too.Get. This. Game. Do yourself a service.			"

												Ohoho, do I love this game.Hatoful Boyfriend gives a very unique experience to anyone who plays it. Not just because you're dating pigeons. It gives you an experience where you can go through silly environments and meet simple characters with a very light-hearted plot and end up in very sad, feels-giving places a few minutes later. Yep, it's one of those games.Let's list the pros and cons of this game to simplify this review.PROS:* Amazing storyline that can be feels-y, entertaining, humorous, silly, and dark all at the same time* Characters that are fun to be around and all very different and interesting in their own way* Beautiful graphics and illustrations, even if the pigeons do look out of place* The soundtrackCONS:* ....uh. * I honestly can't really think of any.* I'm dead serious.I would highly recommend this game to anyone. It's certainly worth your money.I'd give Hatoful Boyfriend a 9/10. "

												I played this game because I saw the start on youtube and it looked like a dumb game I could get a few laughs out of, and then be able to check ""Date a pigeon"" off of my bucket list.And while this was a little true, it is funny and admittedly a little dumb, I did not have a clue what I was really getting myself into.This game will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will intrigue you, it will creep you out, and then it will make you cry all over again.The full story is much more than I could ever have hoped for in a pigeon dating sim, it has twists and turns and is incredibly clever. But even without unlocking the true ending, the individual routes for each of the birdfriends are heartfelt in their own ways (Yes, even Okosan's :P ) and there's a little something for everyone.I recommend this game to everybirdie who loves a great story. Don't let yourself be put off by the whole pigeon thing, you'll thank me in the end.(P.S Nageki is best birb)			"

												I am not kidding in the slightest when I say that this is the best otome/visual novel I've seen so far.Now, that doesn't mean much given I'm not really into VNs and I usually just watch playthroughs, but honestly? For a game about dating PIGEONS, this is the best I've seen.Good characters, the protag isn't an idiot, no abusive bfs (which seems to be a common theme with foreign VNs for some reason) and the endings were actually pretty touching.There are some translation issues including some minor glitches (I once had an option show up as just game code) and typos, but besides that, there's really not many things I can complain about.The biggest problem I had was my saves acting up if I saved over an already used space, but it's easily fixed.9/10 would date pigeons again			"

												I will admit I found the game weird at first but I bought it during an offer, so I decided to give a shot. Most of the routes were kinda just there, to make me laugh (Okosan's, holy pudding, why?) or question why I was trying to date birds that were more intelligent than my character, but also, others were kind of cute (Sakuya's and Nageki's almost made me cry), and the Bad Boys Love Route was worth all the time I wasted trying to get Shuu's normal ending (I hated him, not his route). And I'll not forget all the memorable lines my character did during the playthrough, she was quite funny, and that helped me to not get bored in some routes (Ninja doctor, seriously?).Believe me, if you are looking for something funny to waste 20 minutes on a day, here is the perfect game, but warning, there's a plot here, and a pretty good one, with really memorable characters, fun dialogue and an ending that will leave you really satisfied, even if it has nothing to do with your character.So I'll say 8/10. It's not perfect because it can get boring trying to get all the endings, but it's a really simple game to amuse you (Get Azami's and Okosan's full ending and you'll understand why) for a little while before making you cry with some really good twists.

												An absolutely wonderful buy! An April Fool's day joke gone way too far in the best way possible.""Quirky"" is an excellent way to describe this game. At first glance, it's easily overlooked and labelled as 'too weird' and 'odd', but rest assured the game itself is much more fantastic than that. (Although, to be fair, the oddity is a part of its charm.) Go in with an open mind and it isn't hard to be sucked into this world and all its shenanigans.The re-release has updated the graphics beautifully and any fan of otome games with a good sense of humor is bound to love this game. The save option in the bottom right-hand corner makes it incredibly easy pause the game whenever necessary and pick up exactly where you left off without having to wait for a check-point or anything of the sort.The routes and birds are all very entertaining and lovable in their own ways. Nageki is my personal favorite and I fell in LOVE as soon as I saw him (  possibly loved him even more after I found out about his tragic backstory  ). They'll make you cry, laugh, scream, coo, and give you a reason to see each one of their endings. Luckily, it's not hard to achieve these endings either seeing as a mistake or two will still typically allow you to complete the route (with the exception of a few birds if you choose to get their ""Best end"" or ""full end"" routes).Another note worth mentioning is that the protagonist of this game is very well done! For most otome games, I personally find the protagonists to lack a little bit of personality and tend to be quite generic (this is usually due to the fact that the player's choices determine what the protagonist's personality is like) but with this game, there is no worry. Hiyoko (if you choose to maintain the default name) is as amusing as she is quirky, and her cheerful hunter-gatherer demeanor will work its way into your heart just as well as any of the other birds in the game while maintaining the ability to make personalized choices.If you enjoyed Hatoful Boyfriend and have not bought the DLC, then I suggest you go do so. The same goes for the holiday sequel, Hatoful Boyfriend: Holiday Star (which has extra content) and is a must-buy if you fell in love with the characters and their stories like I did.10/10 Would buy again. Would play again. Coo Coo!!!(  BBL lay waste to my heart...  )			"

												I've known of this game since the first English translation (when it came to popularity out of Japan) and at first I bursted into laughter. Nevertheless, I found myself rather curious for it, so when I knew this got on Steam it was an almost instant purchase.I'm not very fond of dating sims, but wth, I never dated a bird.At first I was laughing when everybirdie was presented to me (Sakuya made me laugh at first, really). Then I thought ""wow, so this character is a very close friend of Ryouta, let's get his ending, that'll be fun"".At the end I ♥♥♥♥ing cried. I cried A LOT.Then I got to another ending where I cried so hard I had to quit the PC and rest for likely half an hour.I think the masterpiece in this game is when you get to know everybirdie, you actually make a bond with them, not just on the game, but you feel sympathy for them. At some points you feel you're there, that everything around you doesn't exists, it's you and the story. And I think that's the greatest achievement when you make a videogame. Suppose you just got from a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ day at school/work and you don't want to think about it. Then you start this game and get absorbed by it. You forget about your bad day and find yourself engulfed in the story.Don't think of Hatoful Boyfriend as yet another dating sim. Don't think of it as a joke. Just try it and you'll like it, I assure you.PS: I ♥♥♥♥ing love pudding.			"

												This game does look wierd the first time but when playing it you actually see that the developers did put alot of work into it and that the story isnt that bad either.Actually the story gets really interestning and there are many different endings and even after plaxing the Main Story there is another extra story which is even longer. So after all the Story is good. (although it gets wierd at some points.)Im a little sad though that the Human displays are only shown when meeting a bird the first time instead of always being shown.Overall while it may seem like a game made for girls (i guess) you can actually enjoy it as a boy even without being drunk.(although being drunk increases the fun factor, i laughed my♥♥♥♥♥off sometimes. :p )I like the Musik and occasional reactions and stuff however some sounds are way lounder than other sounds which hurt my ears.The menu and graphics are good too although the menu could look a bit better but honestly the Artstyle is amazing!Overall i enjoyed playing this game and it was well worth my money.9/10			"

												""Ha, pigeons? How weird. Let's buy this game, just for fun."" Most people say this before purchasing this game. I know. I did in 2012 when it first came out on another website. I bought the game and decided to go for the most familiar bird to me. The Mourning Dove, Nageki.  A young boy who died too young. He was put in a medical centre because of his weak immune system. He had a disease, the H5N1 virus. It was able to kill the humans that killed Nageki's family. However, he didn't want to kill the humans. He said he couldn't live anymore, so he threw himself into the fire he lit in the centre's basement.	 This game turned sad when I reached his ending. I decided to replay it, this time going for the fluffball of a partridge, Shuu, or shall I say  Isa Souma.	 His ending made this game much darker. I decided to play the rest of the game. After I played Ryouta's ending, a new choice popped up. I could fulfill a promise. I didn't know it at the time, but I wasn't Hiyoko when I made the choice. I was the Doctor. Shuu wanted to fulfill the promise he made to someone he loved. The game switched genres before my eyes. It went from a supposedly silly dating simulator to a horrifying murder mystery with pigeons. This game, while being amazing, has a few flaws, but they are quite small compared to the pros. The grammar isn't very good compared to some games, but what do you expect from a game translated into English from Japanese. There are also numerous plot holes that aren't solved unless you buy the sequel, Holiday Star. Like  why Hitori bleached his feathers. Most believe that it was to hide his true identity to get revenge on Shuu. While that is true, there is a second reason.Overall, this game is fantastic. It gets you hooked on the eerie and sad twists and then just makes a 360 turn into pigeon hell. There is no escaping now.Rating8 running Okosan's out of 10.			"

												This is an extremely frustrating game to talk about. Make no mistake, it's very good: funny, heartfelt, and surprisingly engaging, it's just a very frustrating game to discuss in detail (and especially to recommend) since it has a lot of really important plot twists and rug-pull moments that can lose their edge if you've been spoiled to them beforehand. As such, it's kind of hard to review in-depth beyond a very generic ""it's really good"". Which it is, for what it's worth.It's kind of a game you have to take in on good faith; if you've heard the game is good and want to check it out for yourself, or if you don't know anything about it but think the premise is ridiculous enough to want to experience it for a laugh, you should definitely trust your gut and pick it up.

												The game (more like an interactive book) got several interwoven plotlines with one big picture in mind, all drawn out well with sometimes funny, alot more often tragic colors. As others said: Very dark storyline(s), but well hidden until one uncovers all of it. Compared to most games storylines nowadays, its at the very top. Worth every minute and more.			"

HOLY CRAP, I'M IN LOVE WITH THIS GAMEThis game was such a big surprise in my LIFE, I feel complete after finishing it.I had bought Hatoful Boyfriend only because a friend of mine asked (and it was on sale by R$ 5,00) but honestly, I fell in love with this game. There's a big list of endings and, as an advise, you shall complete ALL of them, because is totally worth it. You can unlock the REAL story, wich is absolutely amazing and surprisingly complex. I cried so badly I could barely breathe. It is such a deep story, besides the comic side and romantic disasters. So, if you wanna have a REALLY good time by conecting your feelings with some good-looking pidgeons, this is the right game for you bro. Honestly, Shuu is my bae.			"

												Absolutely coo-razy. I hadn't bird of this game before I got it, but I saw it on my recommendations and thought, ""What the heck, let's try a pigeon dating sim,"" and what followed was almost half a day of madness, heart- and stomach-wrenching backstory, moulting feathers and a distinct lack of actual romantic and sexual encounters between you and your avian chums. What I got instead was much better and a lot more fulfilling than what I had expected, and for that, I am glad I bought the full version.You can't wing your way through this one (well, you can...) but for a few hours of interactively reading stuff it's a pretty good way to spend your time (and money - though I did get it on sale so I beak-lieve I got an even better deal out of all of this.)  Let's put it this way: I'll never look at ""Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy,"" or listen to it in quite the same light ever again. Yeah, thanks for that one. Seriously though. It's a pigeon dating sim. Do I need to say any more?			"

												Bought it expecting lame puns and not much else. Seven hours later and I'm contemplating getting the DLC. How did this happen to me? How do you even review this game? Even without the bizarre premise, it isn't exactly your ordinary dating VN. Hatoful Boyfriend honestly deserves plaudits just for skirting the blender of meme-game shovelware with a setting like this, let alone producing a convincingly authentic VN with a twist.Let's get it out of the way. Yes, you are a human at a school for birds. The only human. You'd expect this to be handwaved and rarely referred to, right? Bzzzt, wrong. The plot is actually far deeper than anticipated; the real cherry atop this game is the BBL route at the end, which radically alters the tone and veers in a far darker direction than the main game. Themes include: murder, suicide, rejection, dystopia, genocide and human experimentation. Yeah. Seriously grim at times, it manages to combine Sherlock and Under the Dome in fleshing out the main cast far beyond where the main game takes them.Before all that, the main game is actually pretty pleasant. The...birds...are characterised surprisingly deftly, and avoiding the common VN pitfall of nailing one identifiable trait to a character and bludgeoning you over the head with it at every opportunity. These guys are genuinely sympathetic, and each route generally avoids too much repetition beyond the first semester. Your avatar is pretty funny, and seems to channeling her inner Mongol about half the time, as she studies in class and makes choices regarding the secret lives of birds. The foreshadowing for the final route is subtly done.Even if the Bad Boys Love route didn't exist, I'd still be rating this positively...it's a solid VN, funny and polished. The end route only elevates Hatoful Boyfriend considerably above most peers, and was a refreshing departure from the usual themes in dating sims. A murder-mystery whodunnit tacked onto a game about romancing pigeons - why not?			"

												Ironic dating game about getting to know your male bird counter-parts as a 15-year-old female hunter-gatherer human girl. I haven't played very many dating games but this being my first one I was not very highly entertained. Most of the game just dragged you along as getting your prefered choice is just 'Always pick them for everything... possibly study something they like...'. Dating birds was funny and all but still... I foudn most of my entertainment came when I got into the BBL ending which explained how all the characters were connected. And why do i only meet one other female all game and she's not even in the school? Are birds of the post-apolcalyptic age sexist?Easy game for achievments but mostlyu a visual novel than a game.3/5			"

												I stumbled upon this game watching a stream, and decided to buy it for myself. I have never once regretted that decision. This is a wonderfully written visual novel/dating sim with a twist: all of the characters are birds. Yes, you read that right. Birds. Weirdness of that situation aside, the dialogue is phenomenal, the characters are memorable, and the endings are beautifully heartwarming/tearjerking. My only complaint with the game is that the save feature is a bit buggy. I recommend saving multiple times, just to be safe. And if you plan on going for the secret ""true"" ending, make sure you have at least three hours to spare. It is looooooong. I give this game a 9.5 out of 10.			"

												I first wanted to get this game as a gag, a joke. I put it on my wishlist and me and my friends laughed. $20 in my steam wallet, I thought ""Why not buy it? It'd seem like it'd give my friends a good giggle.""I did not know what to expect. The concept may seem silly at first, and it still kind of does, but when you actually play it, this game is not a joke. A lot of heart and soul went into the writing and I can see that the developers did not screw around. My first playthrough left me a little confused, but the more you play, taking different routes, the more you uncover of the story and lore and you see how complex and interesting the world of Hatoful actually is. The characters are interesting and diverse from the creepy Shuu, to the pudding loving Okosan. Going through each path allows you to uncover more and more about these characters and become more attached as you go on.Your first playthrough may take you an hour or so (if you read the dialog you lazy dog) but later, each playthrough may take 20-40 minutes depending on the paths you take.The music sets the mood of the characters and the sound effects can really set the atmosphere.Great, emotional visual novel/ dating simulator full of giggles and tears, would recommend.

												TL;DR: My favorite visual novel game, period. I consider it a must-play for VN/otome fans. ---Overall Impression: It took me awhile to get past, ""Oh, Japan... dating birds?"" to try it out. I had resolved I'd heard enough to give it a go, but it took watching Dodger's (presshearttocontinue) Let's Play to actually buy it. It made me laugh and it made me genuinely cry. It's probably best if you are familiar with otome game tropes, but a good background in anime/manga might do to pick up on all the jokes. Even if you only come at the game for the ""weirdness"", I hope you stay to see its real charm.Content: Don't get me wrong - Hatoful Boyfriend may be silly and weird and cute on the surface and once you dig past it, well, it's still silly and weird... But it also brushes along some really dark and heavy stuff. The list that follows will contain content spoilers, though if you have issues, it's better to have mild spoilers than be upset. SPOILERS: There is violence. Death - lots of death. War. Genocide. Murder (including of children). Suicide. Translation: I think the translation is fantastic. Editing: A few very minor issues, but overall, I had no complaints. I can't even remember any specific issues.Art: Let's get real here... there's really not a lot of ""art"" here! Unlike many VNs, there are no ""event"" CGs. Each character really gets one sprite with no changes of expression and the human portrait you see once if you turn on the human portrait option. In the end, it honestly adds to the absurdity, so I have no complaints. The backgrounds are pretty gorgeous, though. And the ending slates are really cute. The artist has done comics with the gang and sometimes does artwork of the characters, which she posts to her Tumblr and Deviantart accounts. If you want art, check those things out, because they're great!Story: On the surface, you're sold on, ""Oh, Japan!"" - just the absurd premise of a human girl going to a school for intelligent birds and falling in love with one of the birdie boyfriends available in typical ""school romance"" style. You dig a little deeper and you see the tropes being made fun of (gently, and with love).Then you start caring about these ""dumb birds"".Then you're hit with something heavy. If you get to the point of caring, it's pretty much guaranteed it'll hurt. The author skillfully manipulates you to this point and I admire her greatly for it.I honestly find myself at a loss to describe the story in any other way. I don't really see the birds as ""bachelors to be wooed"", though technically they are. They are, however, characters to fall in love with, and I do. I love every one of them, faults and all.The Heroine: She's kind of a meathead, honestly! (The creator also uses a cartoon piece of meat to represent her in the comics.) She's weird and maybe not entirely bright on the surface - but she's probably much smarter than she lets on. She definitely has a personality of her own! (She just has no official character design!) There's something subversive about her that the more I get to know her, the more I appreciate her.In closing... I really, really hope you pick it up. I enjoyed it enough I own the Collector's Edition (something I wouldn't necessarily recommend at full price unless you're already a fan - the comic and yearbook aren't that many pages). I also own all the comics and the sequel game, Holiday Star, from purchasing them from the creator's homepage. I'll also be purchasing a new copy of Holiday Star when it it comes to Steam. I'm a super fan! Complete with fanart! It's often on discount, but even at full price is cheap for such a great game.EDIT: Just adding that Holiday Star is out on Steam and I hope you pick it up too!			"

												So the question is: Which love story will you fall for. It started all with a joke. People laughed and pushed you to a direction you didn't expect. I mean pidgeons, birds, animals. What madness is that. You gave in and went onto a journey, that transformed into a life experience. Is it the bird you follow or is there more to it. Are you the human in the story or aren't you more like a bird imprisoned inside a human. Serously I cannot distinguish where the character ends and where the bird starts. It is the most important experience you will ever experience, if you let the bird inside you awake to its full potential. Never have I ever seen a better game to cross the boundaries between human and bird than this gem of a game. I would never be able to stop it, if my real relationship wouldn't have dragged me out violently. I mean serously this lovestory is insane. And I haven't even seen the dark corners of the world. +HD Quality birds+Well rounded story arc+Deep and well developed characters+well situated and beautiful music+pidgeon jokes at everyy corner-you loose track of time, since you don't want to stop-I freaked out at night and was scared. I hope the birds won't do anything to me now.10/10			"

												You think you're going to get a good laugh from this game.  You think you're going to see some puns, date some pigeons, have some lighthearted fun.  You would be correct!  However.. you will also start to care about these birds.  These characters will grow on you.  And then the story will turn.  Most of these endings somehow caused me to feel more emotions than I care to admit.  Better yet- once you unlock the BBL route you're in for a surprise.  Watch as a dating sim turns into a sort of mystery game with one of the most compelling stories I've seen in a while.  Overall I am plesantly surprised with this game, It's quickly become my favorite.  I HIGHLY reccomend to anyone that loves a good story, the writing is amazing and the character development is great.  Characters aren't as flat as they might seem at first glance!  There is a manga as well as drama CDs out there for this title, along with a sequel.  I can only hope the next game comes to steam ASAP!			"

												Hatoful Boyfriend is a game originally released in 2011 in Japan and has been rereleased globally in 2014 onto Steam.We have seen various dating simulators on Steam which have been pretty mediocre (not that I have played any of them...). However this game should be the No. 1 priority for Steam users if they are looking into immersing themselves in visual novels for the first time. Of course, users can play visual novels that are not on Steam such as Katawa Shoujo (which is exceptionally good by the way), but we should seize the opportunity Lord GabeN has given us, allowing us to play dating simulators on the legendary platform known as Steam. So don't lose this opportunity! Hatoful Boyfriend is a visual novel game in which the player dates pigeons. Although this may sound like an unusual concept, we gamers are always looking out on the market for the latest innovative games which bring new concepts and ideas to the congested video game market. Although the visual novel genre isn't especially innovative, the idea of having a romantic relationship between the protagonist, you, and various male pigeons is certainly innovative. Therefore I am giving this game a thumbs up.This may seem like a review just to laud the game's innovation and creativity. However, the gameplay and graphics are also up to par with the other releases which have come out at around the same time as this game. Even though this game is a visual novel, it provides immersive gameplay which will keep players like myself hooked on for hours at a time. The soundtrack for the game is one of the best in the market, which is why I purchased the Digital Deluxe version of the game, which includes the song's soundtrack! Positives   Exceptional graphics (Can be considered a benchmarking tool similar to what Ryse: Son of Rome was on PC).  Exceptional storyline (Not as good as Barbie Dreamhouse Party but still better than The Last of Us).  Exceptional optimization (Runs better than Assassin's Creed: Unity).  Exceptional gameplay (Combine Flappy Bird and Angry Birds).  Exceptional characters (Especially Okosan). Mixed   No nudity (Depends whether you like nude pigeons or not. If you do, I do not know if there is an uncensored version out there...). Negative   No anti-aliasing (I feel like the graphics could be even more amazing if there was some anti-aliasing).  Not enough pigeons (I need more to suppress my desires...).Even though this game has some negatives about it, I would still consider it to be GOTY. We all know there is no such thing as a perfect video game. The positives heavily outweigh the negatives and that is all that matters. So therefore, I hope that you have carefully read this review and will pick this game up as soon as possible. If you are not overly convinced that this game is amazing yet, I suggest reading the other 1,500 or so reviews on the store page!8/8(I hope you didn't expect this review to be legitimate XD)			"

												At first, your average little wierd♥♥♥♥♥japanese game about some chick dating someone or something It was fairly simple and after spamming mouse1 I was able to 100% the game. The only thing was, I hadn't 100%'d the game. Turns out their was an extra story, which took me a couple hours to finish, but trust me it was totally worth it. Although it was one of the wierdest stories I've ever personally experienced, I was basically playing an anime, the story was interesting and I felt compelled to keep going. At first I felt like I wasted my time trying to 100% the game, but as I dwelved deeper into the BLT I couldn't get enough. All in all I'd say that I enjoyed the game a ton and would absolutely recommend it to anyone who is into anime, or some other type of wierd♥♥♥♥♥shit.			"

												this is a bird dating simulator. you are a human girl and you date all the handsome male birds at the school. i'm into that and i have no idea why. i put 11 hours into this game plus a few hours of just spacing out staring at the screen wondering if i had some deep seeded psychological issues before playing the game and if the particular option I selected would give me more deep seeded psychological issues. i can say with most certanty now having unlocked everything that no more harm would have been done rewatching Alfred Hitchcock's The Bird's for the 90th time. i don't recommend this game to bird taxonomy enthusiasts though as there aren't enough HD bird stills here to keep them entertained. masterful.

												Despite being about birds this game can actually be really sad and emotional.It's hard to think that the player can get attached to birds, but the game manages to pull it off. The story is actually rather interesting, though in order to view you main story you must see all other endings. Some interesting twists are shown in the story and it is something you must experience.This is the perfect game for you to find the bird of your dreams, There is a bird for everyone!			"

												Hatoful Boyfriend has a ridiculous premises....Even for a visual novel. You play as a human student at a school for....pigeons.However, it is oddly addicting. You can choose to see the birds human forms (which I did) or just pass on that and enjoy all the birds as they are. The playthrough is simple. Pick who you want to pursue and pursue them. Click. Click. Click. Some come with complications and conspiracies which add to the entertainment value. This visual novel breaks the 4th wall in humorous satirey way. But it also deals with some pretty adult/heavy issues that were pretty unexpected.  It takes about an hour to playthrough and has replay value as you pursue all available birds. And if you playthrough all possible endings you can play a rather dark bonus level. No longer a dating simulation, but now a in depth look at the world in which this visual novel takes place. Several hours of entertainment for under $10.			"

												You think you're going to get a good laugh from this game.  You think you're going to see some puns, date some pigeons, have some lighthearted fun.  You would be correct!  However.. you will also start to care about these birds.  These characters will grow on you.  And then the story will turn.  Most of these endings somehow caused me to feel more emotions than I care to admit.  Better yet- once you unlock the BBL route you're in for a surprise.  Watch as a dating sim turns into a sort of mystery game with one of the most compelling stories I've seen in a while.  Overall I am plesantly surprised with this game, It's quickly become my favorite.  I HIGHLY reccomend to anyone that loves a good story, the writing is amazing and the character development is great.  Characters aren't as flat as they might seem at first glance!  There is a manga as well as drama CDs out there for this title, along with a sequel.  I can only hope the next game comes to steam ASAP!			"

												I don't even have words to describe how I feel about this game.On the surface, there's comedy. Y'know. Your basic rom-com interactive novel/dating sim with some light-hearted humour cause you're dating ♥♥♥♥ing birds. But don't let that sweet anime bishonen smile fool you.Then outta nowhere the atmosphere gets uneasy. All the characters speak as if they've got something to hide. Small things, at first, but the more routes you go down and the more you play the more you're starting to piece things together and you don't even know if you want to see what the final outcome of this unsettling puzzle may be. Once you complete all 14 'normal' endings, you unlock the secret, ridiculously unsettling ""BBL"" route that explains everything and ties all the individual routes together, and THAT'S where it REALLY gets good.♥♥♥♥♥♥gets crazy. Suddenly you find yourself in a mystery murder novel, then some disturbing horror survival♥♥♥♥♥♥ then comes the angsty backstories that rips your heart out so bad you gotta slap yourself to remember this is a dating sim about ♥♥♥♥ing BIRDS.Hatoful Boyfriend has just the right amount of balance between shock factor, humour, feels and downright horrifying. It's a game that goes beautifully from light humour, to dark humour, then just plain dark with no hesitation and so well written and paced that it will always leaves you at a loss for words. This was much more than I bargained for when I signed up for a silly dating game about pigeons in highschool.Although it starts kind of slow and repetitive (as most visual novels do), I strongly suggest you stick through the happy-go-weird-pigeon dating and go unlock that magnificently grotesque backstory - THAT'S the real deal. So worth it.			"

												So the question is: Which love story will you fall for. It started all with a joke. People laughed and pushed you to a direction you didn't expect. I mean pidgeons, birds, animals. What madness is that. You gave in and went onto a journey, that transformed into a life experience. Is it the bird you follow or is there more to it. Are you the human in the story or aren't you more like a bird imprisoned inside a human. Serously I cannot distinguish where the character ends and where the bird starts. It is the most important experience you will ever experience, if you let the bird inside you awake to its full potential. Never have I ever seen a better game to cross the boundaries between human and bird than this gem of a game. I would never be able to stop it, if my real relationship wouldn't have dragged me out violently. I mean serously this lovestory is insane. And I haven't even seen the dark corners of the world. +HD Quality birds+Well rounded story arc+Deep and well developed characters+well situated and beautiful music+pidgeon jokes at everyy corner-you loose track of time, since you don't want to stop-I freaked out at night and was scared. I hope the birds won't do anything to me now.10/10			"

												I have achieved every route and I STILL play this from time to time. It's that good. The world has just gone bird brained! You are a Human girl priveldged enough to go to a genius academy with amazing winged creatures and you have a chance to fall in love with all of them. The Teacher and Doctor are included in that mix as well as a few surprises. It plays exactly as expected with tons of feathers thrown in the mix. Quirky, fun, and it has one hell of a sub-story. You know what they say... Birds of a feather flock together and I'm flocking and sticking my thumbs up for this game!			"

												I don't know why I bought this game. I'm a bit obsessed by birds, and simultaneously I'm not fan of visual novels though I like to read and prefer stories with complicated plots. And whoa! I got it! This vusual novel has solid storylines and differs from any other one. It made me laugh and cry, but while I was ready to get some fun in this game, I didn't expect that the ironic simdate with pigeons would be so heart-touching on the whole.This game is magic, 10/10 Coooo-coooo!

												Hatoful Boyfriend is the visual novel that got me to start reading visual novels a few years ago, and along with Katawa Shoujo, showed me how genuinely well written they can be. With the absurd premise of dating talking, oversized birds in a high school called St. Pigeonation's, you'd be forgiven for assuming that game was entirely parodical. Yet the stories of characters such as Nageki and Ryouta become genuine tearjerkers towards their conclusions, and the game gradually unlocks more sinister stories as you go, with Iwamine Shuu's being the darkest of all normal routes by far, with some very creepy overtones and disturbing implications. Then you complete enough routes to unlock the ""Bad Boys Love"" (I have no idea why it was called this) mode, which is incredibly difficult to discuss without massive spoilers, but what I can tell you is that not only does its own story go to very dark places, but it gives every other route far darker implications in retrospect. Hatoful Boyfriend's sequel, ""Holiday Star"", was released awhile back on DLSite, and is not a dating sim in any respect. Its main story is almost entirely linear, but it is hilarious and absurd, featuring such nonsense as fangirl powered cannons. Like the original game, its story gets much darker later on. It also dials back the dating sim elements to unlockable extra scenes that are accessed through the main menu. If you can enjoy, or even just get past, the premise of this game, then I wholeheartedly recommend it, because the worst it can be is a cheap laugh. If you give it a chance, you'll find that it's far more than that. In addition, the Steam release upgrades the game to 1080p with some very nice, crisp artwork - although the bird pictures look even more out of place now - and adds some additional content in the form of a route for the awesome Azami. Its Collector's Edition is also a good deal with 2 silly wallpapers, the soundtrack, a copy of the original DLSite version of the game, a Hatoful Boyfriend manga and a ""yearbook"" artbook of the game.

												So the question is: Which love story will you fall for. It started all with a joke. People laughed and pushed you to a direction you didn't expect. I mean pidgeons, birds, animals. What madness is that. You gave in and went onto a journey, that transformed into a life experience. Is it the bird you follow or is there more to it. Are you the human in the story or aren't you more like a bird imprisoned inside a human. Serously I cannot distinguish where the character ends and where the bird starts. It is the most important experience you will ever experience, if you let the bird inside you awake to its full potential. Never have I ever seen a better game to cross the boundaries between human and bird than this gem of a game. I would never be able to stop it, if my real relationship wouldn't have dragged me out violently. I mean serously this lovestory is insane. And I haven't even seen the dark corners of the world. +HD Quality birds+Well rounded story arc+Deep and well developed characters+well situated and beautiful music+pidgeon jokes at everyy corner-you loose track of time, since you don't want to stop-I freaked out at night and was scared. I hope the birds won't do anything to me now.10/10			"

												Never thought I'd play a dating sim.  Then this beauty came along.  Being a the only human in an elite academy for pigeons, it's definitley not traditional.   Some of the stories are fun, while others have a surprising depth.  There are multiple endings for some of the birds, and finding them through making choices has been fun.  Each run only takes around 20 mins, so you don't have to pool a bunch of time into figuring out the different paths.  On top of all it's punniness, the game references are a nice touch.  Definitely recommend, for more than just the sake of being able to claim you've played a ""Bird dating sim""			"

												When I say I was unprepared I mean it completely. Like everyone else I bought the game because I like weird stuff and, come on, a bird school for gifted birds! Totally my cup of tea, also one of that kind of things I totally use as ice breaker, like 'you know how I spent my week end? I found this game with pigeons...' and it's better than the usually weird porn I talk about because it's socially accepted and not rated R. Anyway, I started it and I was (positively) destroyed by little details like 'everybierdie' and so on. I chose the easiest route and I already forgot I was talking about pigeons. I mean, their image was still there, all pigeony, but I knew they were more than that. I felt it in my kokoro. The final shattered me: oh boy, I was so much unprepared! I finished the rest of the routes in like an afternoon??? And it was always getting better and I still don't know how it this possible. Then, the true ending, is just the epiphany of pure genius. I cried, I was overwhelmed by feelings and, idk, stuff. The end destroyed everything I always believed in and now I know I'll never reach that level of utter perfection.graphic9/10; I played it in fast mode, so the graphic wasn't the best, but still is pretty good for an otome game! The human portraits are just 100% boyfriend material (I dare you to pick your favv among them) and the background are really relaxing. Bonus points to the random photos of birds, like the Brian ones that looks like a pigeon itself took them and I love it. plot10/10; I have no words to say how good is the plot. I read a lot, I love cinema, I love every kind of media that bring me new stories, but this is♥♥♥♥♥♥of a different level. No one believes me when I swear how catching and heart breaking this story is, but I'm sorry, it just is. Guys, this plot is deep as ♥♥♥♥ and it's weird, and wrong and utter genius.setting & originality10/10; During the standard routes you catch a few hints of the backstory but you'll be surprised anyway. The whole basic idea is so weird you'll just go 'why not???' and it makes sense in the end. At least for you. No one will believe you anymore, but it will make sense. It is a story that talks to the heart, not to the mind, but still is a complete experience that will change you. Please, buy this game, because it is worth every cent of it.

												I flew into this completely blind. I had heard of its existence some time ago, could not figure out how to get the stupid English patch I downloaded to work, and ended up shelving it before more-or-less forgetting about it completely.Recently, however, it showed up for 75% off during the summer sale. This, combined with my now-twice piqued interest meant it was added to my cart instantly. I am not dissapointed.I will preface this by stating that this isn't much of a game, so if you were expecting plenty of action and mashing of buttons, you are sorely mistaken. It's more of a semi-interactive novel, not all that far from a ""choose your own adventure"" book. You start off,  quite simply, as a teenaged human girl attending a school for birds (because what else would you expect?). The opening presents you with a run-down of the various relevant figures of your school. Every one of these has their own storyline that you can progress through by taking actions or making decisions favoring them. At the end, you get a unique ending specific to that character. You may also be presented with the ""bad"" ending if you somehow fail to endear yourself to any particular bird, though, with one exception, it's not really too hard to figure out what you need to do to charm your feathered fiancee.And that's it. You now know how to ""play"" Hatoful Boyfriend.That may seem like I'm cutting it a bit short, but I fear that getting any more in-depth about plot points is essentially impossible without spoiling one thing or another, especially in regards to a certain event that becomes available once you've received enough of the endings (yes, you do have to ""date"" Shuu). Very much of the game's appeal lies in the fact that it goes from exactly what the description implies (a silly, lighthearted title centered around dating pigeons), to a rather engrossing and intriguing story about how this odd world works. Moreover, there's little to say outside of ""it's a thing where you read a lot of text and occasionally make a decision"". That's not necessarily bad, but this isn't going to be something that appeals to you if you aren't the kind who enjoys an honest-to-god book every now and again.Hatoful Boyfriend is not a purchase I regret, but it's not without its flaws. The most glaring is that much of the text is repeated, between storylines. There's a fast-forward button that will rapidly skip through text, however some scenes have the same beginning but diverge from there, meaning you might accidentally skip some dialogue you haven't read yet with this. A moderate familiarity with how the game goes helps prevent this, but that takes a few playthroughs and still isn't foolproof.There are relatively few blemishes beyond that, and they're relatively minor, luckily enough. There are a few typos, although only one of them is major (you still get the gist of what's being said). There are some odd ""between"" frames of dialogue that are blank and require you to press the enter key, but there's no indication you need to do so other than that nothing is happening. The ""level/stats"" system is almost completely pointless, and I think is only really there for a few very specific scenes which probably could have got by without it anyway.The redundant text is problematic, but it's not game breaking and the other downsides can mostly be overlooked. I question the price point of $10 full price, seeing as how there isn't any way to spend that much meaningful time on the game. I read fairly fast, and have essentially completed the game in well under 10 hours. Slower readers could reasonably expect somewhat longer than that. At sale price, especially as steep a sale as I got it on, it is well worth it.I mean...come on you guys it's a pigeon dating sim. If that doesn't at least get you curious enough to skip out on your next bag of chips to shell out for it, you are sad, and I have no desire to associate with you any further than I already have. Also I just realized what I did with that opening sentence. I am sorry, I swear that was not intentional.I'm not deleting it, though.The ""too long/didn't read"" section:Pros:-It's a dating sim with pigeons-Decent visuals-Interesting reading-No actual bird sexCons:-Not really a ""game"", per se-Relatively short-Reduntant text-Some small technical issues-No actual bird sexFinal thoughts: If it's on sale and you like to read, don't even give it a second thought; ""Carve it into your soul, kid!""

												Never thought I'd play a dating sim.  Then this beauty came along.  Being a the only human in an elite academy for pigeons, it's definitley not traditional.   Some of the stories are fun, while others have a surprising depth.  There are multiple endings for some of the birds, and finding them through making choices has been fun.  Each run only takes around 20 mins, so you don't have to pool a bunch of time into figuring out the different paths.  On top of all it's punniness, the game references are a nice touch.  Definitely recommend, for more than just the sake of being able to claim you've played a ""Bird dating sim""			"

												I had noticed some of my friends, one in particular, was playing this game, and after checking out the game, I decided to buy it. When I first played this, I was surprised how I quickly started liking the game. You'll have to get used to the same beginning every time you start a new game, but once you really get into the game, you will really want to see what happens next. You will really want to continue playing. If you like simulation games, and games that have suspension, then try out this game. If you don't like it, then don't play it, but I believe just about anyone will like this game.			"

												The thought that some people haven't played this game makes me cry at night. This game is a work of art. With alternate endings and a gripping storyline it is a truly amazing experience with great replay ability. You will grow more attached to these virtual birds than you do to your real life acquaintances. The time poured into this game feel very well spent and I can say the same about the money. The price tag is more than reasonable and the collector's edition is totally worth. This game has become my life. I will never see birds the same again.			"

												~~WARNING, THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS, IF YOU DONT WANT THE GREATEST DATING SIM OF ALL TIME SPOILED, DON'T READ THIS~~I first played this game a while ago, on its first English release. I believe that was over 3 years ago now? When I originally heard of this game, I of course reacted like everyone else. ""Wow, absurd crazy Japanese dating sim about... birds??? This is so ridiculous that I have to play it.""A big thing that completely goes over peoples' heads, a conclusion they never seem to come to when they see this game in the Steam store, or when they saw it online wherever for the first time is... could this possibly be tongue-in-cheek? You know, a parody of generic Dating Sim/Visual Novel tropes? Which is kind of crazy to be honest, considering that's what immediately should be coming to their mind - that yes, this game parodies a lot of silly Visual Novels that take themselves far too seriously.The first portion of this game, the ""normal high school life"" routes, a lot of them use very cliché anime/RPG/Dating Sim tropes, particularly Okosan's slice-of-life, non-serious route, Shuu's sort of yandere true ending, and Anghel's downright crazy and completely non-canon route (is it technically non-canon, considering the effect Anghel causes upon those around him?), but they're written in such a self-aware way, a lot of these storylines know fully well how ridiculous they are and they're not ashamed to be so.A lot of the routes do give a bit of insight into each of the characters and you can start to piece things together, but the bulk of the actual plot comes in final route, the Bad Boys Love ending. Hatoful Boyfriend is not a dating sim. The Dating Sim section, in my opinion, was simply a very clever selling point of the game. It is essentially used as such because the devlopers KNEW people would buy something so out there, and for shock value. When you start to realise truly how dark this game is, it's genuinely shocking.If this game was depicted as a serious visual novel about a political faction with extreme racist views, and their goal to rid Earth of the opposing race through means of biological weaponry, even if that requires unethical treatment of their own kind, this game would have been critically acclaimed. Which is funny, because that's EXACTLY what this game is about. There's a lot more to it than that, but that's the basic plot.Albeit the writing is a bit goofy at times, even in serious parts, and there's a lot of unnecessary gore, this game is extremely cleverly written. Despite disguising itself as a dating sim at first glance, and being a mockery to those who haven't played it, this game has pretty interesting politIcal undertones and social commentary, and honestly? I'm awfully more attached to talking birds than I was to any of the characters in westerm, artsy, ""plot heavy"" (but not really) indie games on Steam such as Thomas Was Alone.But yeah, I'd love to give Hatoful Boyfriend a 10/10 for how well marketed and well put together this game is, along with its amazingly witty writing, but I have to give it a 9.5 for being unnecessarily, I guess, ""edgy"" and fanfiction-esque at times.P.S. I've very tempted to figure out a way of rewriting the entire script of this game to be... well, not about birds, and sending it to my friends not telling them what it is. And I can guarantee they'd never be able to guess			"

Eating isn't a necessity. Where am I? How long has it been? My friends aren't concerned. I am. Or am I? My body is composed of feathers, star dust, and love.

												Both as a serious game and as a joke I got for Xmas, I love this game for the weirdest reasons. The story has a lot of twists and turns the first time you play it, but after running all the routes it got a little tedious to repeat such long series of dialogues without any choices between.What really got me was the commitment from the design team and the developers. It's well animated, if a little generic; the soundtrack fits well with every scene; the pigeons are all different, personality and voice wise, and they put a lot of effort into the game. And it shows! :D It's not the sort of play over and over game once you've gotten every one of the routes complete, but I wanted to see how every story played out and that's what makes me so pleased with it. Normally a game won't keep my interest but Hatoful Boyfriend kept me for hours.			"

												When I say I was unprepared I mean it completely. Like everyone else I bought the game because I like weird stuff and, come on, a bird school for gifted birds! Totally my cup of tea, also one of that kind of things I totally use as ice breaker, like 'you know how I spent my week end? I found this game with pigeons...' and it's better than the usually weird porn I talk about because it's socially accepted and not rated R. Anyway, I started it and I was (positively) destroyed by little details like 'everybierdie' and so on. I chose the easiest route and I already forgot I was talking about pigeons. I mean, their image was still there, all pigeony, but I knew they were more than that. I felt it in my kokoro. The final shattered me: oh boy, I was so much unprepared! I finished the rest of the routes in like an afternoon??? And it was always getting better and I still don't know how it this possible. Then, the true ending, is just the epiphany of pure genius. I cried, I was overwhelmed by feelings and, idk, stuff. The end destroyed everything I always believed in and now I know I'll never reach that level of utter perfection.graphic9/10; I played it in fast mode, so the graphic wasn't the best, but still is pretty good for an otome game! The human portraits are just 100% boyfriend material (I dare you to pick your favv among them) and the background are really relaxing. Bonus points to the random photos of birds, like the Brian ones that looks like a pigeon itself took them and I love it. plot10/10; I have no words to say how good is the plot. I read a lot, I love cinema, I love every kind of media that bring me new stories, but this is♥♥♥♥♥♥of a different level. No one believes me when I swear how catching and heart breaking this story is, but I'm sorry, it just is. Guys, this plot is deep as ♥♥♥♥ and it's weird, and wrong and utter genius.setting & originality10/10; During the standard routes you catch a few hints of the backstory but you'll be surprised anyway. The whole basic idea is so weird you'll just go 'why not???' and it makes sense in the end. At least for you. No one will believe you anymore, but it will make sense. It is a story that talks to the heart, not to the mind, but still is a complete experience that will change you. Please, buy this game, because it is worth every cent of it. So, I'd suggest this game?> YES> YES> YES			"

												It's a pretty standard visual novel, with all the feelings and emotional attachments, relatively quick not very involved....Oh and you're seducing birds.The game was originally created as a joke, but was so popular that the creator and developers released it on multiple platforms, because the only thing to brighten some of the deep feelings you have from trying to get that special someone to notice you is to turn everyone except for you into a bird.If visual novels are your thing, this is a ridiculous game that is well worth your time and energy.  If they aren't quite your thing, you will probably be confused.  This game is still ridiculous, and a fun way to get introduced into the genre, without having to deal with actual humans. It really is just as ridiculous as it looks, and that's half the fun. The other half is trying to figure out how anyone would allow the school doctor near students.  Let alone set him as a romance option.  You'll laugh, you'll stare confused at the screen, you'll laugh some more, you might find yourself attached to a birdie character. And that's okay.  Because it's fun, and funny, and no one talks about why you're the only human in the game.			"

												I first wanted to get this game as a gag, a joke. I put it on my wishlist and me and my friends laughed. $20 in my steam wallet, I thought ""Why not buy it? It'd seem like it'd give my friends a good giggle.""I did not know what to expect. The concept may seem silly at first, and it still kind of does, but when you actually play it, this game is not a joke. A lot of heart and soul went into the writing and I can see that the developers did not screw around. My first playthrough left me a little confused, but the more you play, taking different routes, the more you uncover of the story and lore and you see how complex and interesting the world of Hatoful actually is. The characters are interesting and diverse from the creepy Shuu, to the pudding loving Okosan. Going through each path allows you to uncover more and more about these characters and become more attached as you go on.Your first playthrough may take you an hour or so (if you read the dialog you lazy dog) but later, each playthrough may take 20-40 minutes depending on the paths you take.The music sets the mood of the characters and the sound effects can really set the atmosphere.Great, emotional visual novel/ dating simulator full of giggles and tears, would recommend.

												I stumbled upon this game watching a stream, and decided to buy it for myself. I have never once regretted that decision. This is a wonderfully written visual novel/dating sim with a twist: all of the characters are birds. Yes, you read that right. Birds. Weirdness of that situation aside, the dialogue is phenomenal, the characters are memorable, and the endings are beautifully heartwarming/tearjerking. My only complaint with the game is that the save feature is a bit buggy. I recommend saving multiple times, just to be safe. And if you plan on going for the secret ""true"" ending, make sure you have at least three hours to spare. It is looooooong. I give this game a 9.5 out of 10.			"

												First of all, don't judge a book by its cover.I played through this game mostly because it was on sale.  But after playing it to full completion...I am utterly surprised that I actually enjoyed it.I'm not spoiling anything, but this is a game worth completing fully.  There IS actually a legit story and it isn't all rainbows and smiles.NO.  OH HECK NO.It isn't just a dating sim with birds, it can get twisted.  Scratch that, it WILL get twisted.I really encourage getting this game.  It's great all around.  Sure, the stories for each character a relatively short, but you will get to know a lot about them.  And it's worth it to get all the endings each character can give you.  Yes, even the incomplete endings.If you get all endings, the game gifts you with a lovely true ending that will send you on a roller coaster of emotions.  And some new emotions that you probably don't experience with many of the bachelors...except one.My only problem is that there is a fast forward option that will often skip over new scenes if you're not expecting it.  Some routes will add new pieces of dialogue to scenes you may have seen many times before, but if you don't know when they appear, the fast-forward option will just keep going.  Some games like this will stop for you when theres a new string of dialogue or take away the option to tell you that there's something new.  Not this game.Be warned!  The story is fantastic and you'll want to read every bit of it.It's strange, but I grew to like it!  Besides, the human versions of the birds you date are kind of cute.  :)			"

Hatoful boyfriend is a game that surprised me in various ways starting with its visual aspects and taking me through a beautiful journey that left me completely overwhelmed with its cuteness and simplicity. I never thought I could love so much a visual novel with and about pigeons!At first I thought this is a parody but the graphics were so cute and the pigeons so friendly that I decided to keep playing it. I don't want to spoil it, but it can take a sad, even dramatic turn depending on which path you decide to follow. I have to admit that the endings involving Nageki and Ryouta made me cry like a little girl and at first I didn't see myself getting emotional over a game... with pigeons. ♡ The novel also contains cute little jokes that will make you giggle and will brighten your day. And oh... the pink menu and illustrations... definitely my type of fun.To sum up, I love this game really much! It is worth buying and spending quality hours in it trying to find all the endings. It doesn't get boring and to me it didn't seem repetitive + that the trading cards you get are adorable! ❤❤❤			"

												Hatoful Boyfriend is the visual novel that got me to start reading visual novels a few years ago, and along with Katawa Shoujo, showed me how genuinely well written they can be. With the absurd premise of dating talking, oversized birds in a high school called St. Pigeonation's, you'd be forgiven for assuming that game was entirely parodical. Yet the stories of characters such as Nageki and Ryouta become genuine tearjerkers towards their conclusions, and the game gradually unlocks more sinister stories as you go, with Iwamine Shuu's being the darkest of all normal routes by far, with some very creepy overtones and disturbing implications. Then you complete enough routes to unlock the ""Bad Boys Love"" (I have no idea why it was called this) mode, which is incredibly difficult to discuss without massive spoilers, but what I can tell you is that not only does its own story go to very dark places, but it gives every other route far darker implications in retrospect. Hatoful Boyfriend's sequel, ""Holiday Star"", was released awhile back on DLSite, and is not a dating sim in any respect. Its main story is almost entirely linear, but it is hilarious and absurd, featuring such nonsense as fangirl powered cannons. Like the original game, its story gets much darker later on. It also dials back the dating sim elements to unlockable extra scenes that are accessed through the main menu. If you can enjoy, or even just get past, the premise of this game, then I wholeheartedly recommend it, because the worst it can be is a cheap laugh. If you give it a chance, you'll find that it's far more than that. In addition, the Steam release upgrades the game to 1080p with some very nice, crisp artwork - although the bird pictures look even more out of place now - and adds some additional content in the form of a route for the awesome Azami. Its Collector's Edition is also a good deal with 2 silly wallpapers, the soundtrack, a copy of the original DLSite version of the game, a Hatoful Boyfriend manga and a ""yearbook"" artbook of the game.

												A wonderfully endearing visual novel. Despite its seemingly strange premise, the game quickly hooked me with its intriguing characters and plot. From the funny to the horribly, depressingly sad endings, the game had me from begining to end. A beautifully written script, nice art, and lovable (and/or detestable) characters to go with them. I recommend this to anyone with a beating heart.			"

												The best pigeon dating sim I've ever played!  10/10More seriously, this is surprisingly good.  The initial joke wears off quickly, but luckily there's enough heart left over in the game itself that by that time you've gotten drawn in.  The story paths are all rather short, but each provides clues regarding a surprisingly dark backdrop.Also, this game made me get a lump in my throat in sadness from hearing a button quail's backstory.

												People told me I would never Goat, but I did! People told me, I never 'll see a lass dating pigeons... And who's laughing now eh?Tell whatever you will, think whatever you desire; But this VN rules! It's bloody perfect, fun, but not dumb. It may look like a standart dating sim, with doves, pigeons and other birds on serfice... But it also has some disturbing moments, and a few paths are even bloody terrifying. Espechialy true path. It may not be very controllable (you can't rewind dialogs), and not pretiest of art style. But it is a decent game overall. Art style may not be perfect, but it's pretty, controllability may be lacking, but game has a LOT of branching ways and multiple endings (some of them are quite tricky to discover). What is awesome though: are musik and dialogs.At the end... I don't care what me mates think, or tell. I love this one. It helps to relax... to throw some weight off shoulders without including too much effort in it. And for that I ready to give some :Dosh: to people who created this masterpiece. Do I recomend it? If you like silly VNs and ideas that way beyond sane -- play it! If you somehow feel embaresed by playing dating sims, if you afraid of birds, if you don't like female heroines... In short -- if you one of those God of War, Call of Duty etc fan -- then... you probably never heard of this, and even if, -- never bothered with even a idea of buying it.And I mean c'mon lads and lassies, we all here a lil bit insane.

The storyline is so immersive, and i felt like I couldn't stop reading!! (apart from the repetative scenes after playing over the game 10+ times :"")!!7.5/10 would reccomend for anyone. Although  I do feel as though it should have a gender option at the beginning, because immediately assuming that all players will be female is a little dodgy! :-).			"

												TL;DR at the end.I first played Skyrim at its initiall release in 2011, and after many years I feel I am finally ready to write this review. What I can conclude from my many hours of play is that Skyrim is much more than meets the eye. The game's main quest can be terminated or disregard at the libertine's choice after the first stage of the quest is finished. NPCs may allocate the player additional side-solicitation, and some side-expedition have parameters adjusted supported on nearby dungeons which the player has yet to explore. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an action role-playing game, playable from either a first- or third-parson perspective. The plan is determine two hundred years after the events of Oblivion and takes office in the fictional province of Skyrim. Should the gambler be stopped by a guard, they may wipe their bounty with gold or jail time, or may resist detain which will trigger an aggressive pursuit. Stamina determines the gamester's effectiveness in combat and is depleted by sprinting, performing heavy ""power attacks"", and being struck by frost-based attacks. The player may choose to join factions, which are organic groups of NPCs—for example, the Dark Brotherhood, a band of assassins. Skyrim retain the open earth folklore of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any era, and to sink or procrastinate the main-hamper storyline indefinitely. Skyrim was acquit to critical shout, with reviewers particularly mentioning the independence development and setting, and is considered to be one of the top video games of all era. Each delay their character levels, the players may choose to select a expertness-specific address exhort a perk, or accumulation perk stage for latter use. The player may readily roam over the deposit of Skyrim, which is an open earth environment consisting of waste expanses, dungeons, cities, towns, fortresses and villages. Players may sail the Olympic world more rapidly by riding horses, or by utilizing a fast-travel system which assign them to warp to previously detect locations. The lame was developed using the Creation Engine, rebuilt specifically for the game. The brood opted for a unique and more diverse Pancratium world than Oblivion's Cyrodiil, which crooked director and executive maker Todd Howard considered less interesting by comparison. Non-player independence (NPCs) populate the world and can be engage with in a number of ways; the idler may bespeak them in conversation, match an eligible NPC, kill them, or retain in a nonlethal ""brawl"". As in previous The Elder Scrolls crooked, killing certain NPCs can make some quests or term unobtainable. Some NPCs cannot be quell. If witnessed, crimes like murder and theft accrue the player a bounty, which is vestige independently in each of Skyrim's nine holds. Skyrim's capital story roll around the player describe and their stimulate to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the circle. The game pay over seven million copies to retailers within the first neptad of its quit, and has sold over 30 million copies across all five platforms. Some NPCs who are favor or hired by the player may deed as coadjutor who will accompany the libertine and foresee aid in oppose. Each of the factions has an combined quest path to progress through. Each burg and town in the Pancratium world has jobs that the player can engage in, such as agriculture. Players have the option to uncover their character. At the prelude of the game, players create their character by selecting their sex and choosing between one of several family, terminate humans, orcs, elves and anthropomorphic cat or lizard-like creatures, and then taylor-make their character's manner. Over the course of the Olympic, players improve their character's reason, which are numerical representations of their address in certain areas. There are eighteen adroitness divided evenly among the three college of resent, magic, and stealth. When gambler have drag reason enough to meet the demand exercise, their handwriting horizontal up. Over the manner of the game, the libertine completes search and evolve the character by improving reason. Earlier entries in The Elder Scrolls series used a character set system to limit which reason would contribute to the resolution's leveling, but Skyrim allows players to tell preferred art as they play the project and rewards them with more share when a frequently used aptitude is leveled. A headdress-up expand (HUD) appears when any of the player's three might attributes (health, magicka, and strength) are being depleted. Attributes reproduced over season, although this process can be accelerated by second-hand potions or regenerative spells. Magicka is depleted by the use of spells, undoubting vitiate, and by being struck by lightning-based assault. Health is depleted primarily when the player takes impair, and the privation of all sanity terminate in gangrene. However, some quests found on the might storyline being at least partially completed. The idler's inventory can be accessed from the menu and items can be survey in 3D, which may prove essential in explanation puzzles found in dungeons.TL;DR: The fact that so many books still name the Beatles as “the greatest or most significant or most influential” rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art.

												There was one pigeon, a beautiful bird, pure white with light grey tips on its wings; that one was different. It was a male. I would know that pigeon anywhere. No matter where I was that pigeon would find me, when I wanted him I had only to wish and call him and he would come flying to me. he understood me and I understood him. I loved that pigeon. Yes, I loved him as a man loves a woman, and he loved me. When he was ill I knew, and understood; he came to my room and I stayed beside him for days. I nursed him back to health. That pigeon was the joy of my life. If he needed me, nothing else mattered. As long as I had him, there was a purpose in my life. Hatoful Boyfriend is a rewarding game that uses a friendly approach and healthy humour to apply great lessons useful to anyone longing to live in harmony with their loved ones, it can be anything from a  pigeon, human, ship, airfriend or even a rock. A game that can make you think about what is in front of you and about standing for what you believe in before you lose everything you have. It has indeed a spicy price for it's short play time but, if you're used to this kind of game and want to try to find some meaning on it by yourself, you should get it if you can.-My humble thanks to the staff behind this work, Nikola Tesla for the short story seen above (which is incomplete) and the dear friend who gifted me this game to sink my broken soul in a abyss of despair. Thank you, bird ♥♥♥♥erI knew she wanted to tell me- she was dying. When that pigeon died, something went out of my life. Up to that time I knew with a certainty that I would complete my work, no matter how ambitious my program, but when that something went out of my life I knew my life's work was finished.sucks			"

I'm kinda sorta sure that they are just regular sized birds and not giant ones too incase you're wondering about that (Also they have precision grip somehow???)  ANYWAY after a certain point tweest happens and the story gets WAY too good for a game about getting up in some pigeon cloaca.  There was a point I got so invested I actually forgot everyone was a bird apart from there being birds absolutely on screen everywhere at all times.The music is ace, the plot rly gud! So many birds to love and enjoy. What you think you're too good to play some dumbo game about avian love? No u ain't who u foolin'#Shuu Route Reppin'>yes>yes>yes			"

												Place chicken in a Dutch oven. Add water, carrot, celery, onion, 3 sprigs of thyme, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 1 hour. Remove chicken from dutch oven and transfer to a bowl; set aside to cool.Increase heat and bring the stock to a simmer. Skim off any chicken fat that appears on top of the stock and reserve in a bowl. Combine 2 to 3 tablespoons of the reserved fat with flour in a small bowl; stir to make a paste, adding more flour if needed. Add the chicken fat and flour mixture to the stock. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes.Remove chicken meat from the carcass and add to the stock. Season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper to taste. Continue simmering for 10 to 15 minutes.Whisk creme fraiche, milk, 2 teaspoons of thyme leaves, and eggs together in a large bowl. Stir in self-rising flour until almost entirely incorporated; do not overmix.Scoop large dollops of dumpling mixture on top of the chicken stock. Increase heat slightly to medium-high. Cover and simmer until dumplings appear light and fluffy, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 10 to 15 minutes. Serve garnish with thyme sprigs.			"

												First of all, don't trust the 'average' review score - the topic of this particular game (pigeon dating) has attracted droves of people trying to be funny with one line review quips.Simply speaking, the positive rating has me very very very confused because this is a terrible VN for the price.Story aside, there are some major issues with the game itself:1) ""Maximum text speed"" actually means ""scrolls a bit faster"" so you need to click twice to clear every message if you are a decent reader. Extremely annoying.2) No setting to skip only scenes you haven't watched. You either skip or you don't, and if you miss new content too bad. This is made worse by how some of the endings are very similar (ie, basically the same ending except for an epilogue) but you need to replay the entire game, not knowing if there are new nuggets in the game. 3) Loading glitches, many times when I loaded it would not work and just show an empty text box. Needed to exit to title and load that way.Main problems with the plot/art:1) If you are like me, part of the allure of VNs is looking at some cool anime characters. This game has virtually none of that. The teaser shots you see at the top of the store page are basically all there is, the rest of the ""art"" you can find by going to google and searching for ""pigeon."" Maybe spend some effort drawing characters in different poses? Nope, just the same cropped pigeon picture from google. In certain parts you may be lucky and get uncropped pigeon pictures when the game devs were lazy.2) There is a severe lack of development for all birds. It is not that uncommon, but ""the bachelor syndrome"" of going on 2 dates and falling in love forever for no apparent reason is alive and well. As such, the birds are super one-dimensional, from the mentally challenged pudding bird to the psycho daydreaming bird - they just rehash the same joke over and over, not changing or developing other sides to the birds at all.3) To build on #2, the game is generally not funny. A couple jokes initially could elicit a chuckle, but the joke rehash gets very tiring. As this game is a quasi-parody of dating sims, I don't think that's a good thing.4) The relationship scoring system is at best hidden, at worst useless. This is one of those games where the relationship stat is hidden and you need to guess where you stand with everyone. One of the major systems, where you pick your classes, is 100% useless in over half the endings.5) True ending - without using spoilers, this game tries to tie everything together in a grand true ending that answers all questions. You want to know why pigeons talk? Why there is a school for pigeons? The ending tells you! However, because the premise is so preposterous, the game just throws twist after twist at you, all of which are not coherent. From daddy issues to orphanages to secret agents, the game throws all the stereotypical tropes you could possibly dream up in one jumbled mess. To be fair, the ending does actually flesh out the characters somewhat and probably takes a solid couple hours to get through. Of course the content in the true ending is probably more than the content in the rest of the game combined, see #2.Long review for me as I rarely disagree so much with popular opinion. Bottom line is that I would NOT recommend this game unless it was 90% off or something, it is simply a poor example of a VN. Of course if you want to write a one line quip of a pigeon dating sim then you have no choice?			"

												I would not buy this game unless it is on sale. For me if i bought this at full price i would have payed $1 for every hour i           played, but if you buy it on sale its $2.49 plus you can sell the trading cards to make it just $2.                                            This was my first dating sim / anime type game i played and i very much did enjoy it. The game does not have much freedom of choice sadly you will have a game over if you make too many wrong decisions. There is many endings and i enjoyed every single one of them and each ending you pursue is unique has funny and sometimes sad dialogue.  You will have to skip through quite a bit dialogue for the first 10 minutes as its the same as before if you intend on getting another ending. 8/10 game stay until the end			"

												As I cuddle Sakuya and caress his soft, luminous, white plumage, I move closer to his gaping beak. My heart is racing, and after what seems like an eternity, our tongues intermingle at last. Never before have I experienced something like this; I was truly blissful. After hours of this, Sakuya decides to take the initiative as he spreads his tailfeathers, and looks back expectantly....Needless to say, by the night's end, Sakuya is cooing happily on his back as I finish inside his tight, illustrious cloaca as he instructed– until he realizes it's overflowing with my bird seed, making a mess of the fine feathers he's so reasonably proud of. He looks upon me with disdain momentarily, and sighs.			"

												This was, very unexpectedly, a really awesome game. I first started playing expecting a hilarious and absurd story just for the fun of it, but the game really sucked me in and kept me fascinated. Hell, I even bonded emotionally with the birds (especially those with more heartbreaking endings). The bonus ending (the BBL route) was one of the more compelling game (and VN) stories I remember reading made from such seemingly simple and ridiculous premises. I don't even know how they made all the story parts so intervowen, when at first they seemed so random. It was worth unlocking all the slightly repetitive playthroughs to get to it. For anyone wondering why this game is interesting - wait until you get to the last part.I'd recommend it to anyone who lacks prejudice against the obvious ridiculousness of the game and wants to try someting different. It's really funny, sad, and awesome all at the same time.			"

												Absoultuely my most favorite game in a very long time, the soundtrack is great, the visulatization is great, and the story is just beautiful. When you first see it you think: ""Werid Japenese Pigeon Dating Simulator!"", but when you get into the game it's just awesome! You get attached to the characters with their stories so deep with emotions it's like The Walking Dead (game) + The Last of Us + Okami + Okamiden + Every Other Game That Gives You The Feels. I'm very glad that this game has been remastered and put on Steam, I was oringally going to buy the orinigal version, but then I heard of the remastered version and I was like ""Here's my money!""I'd give this game a 9.5/10:Pros: great story, heartwarming characters, beautiful soundtrack, birdy puns, rememerable characters, the idea that Okosan is awesome everytime you Hear ""pudding"", plus there's manga sidestories (that are on Amazon!)Cons: too short, text misspellings and grammar issues here and there, and too many people say ""Ugh! Weird Japenese dating sim!""Either way, this game is awesome, I recommend everyone to buy the collectors edition for $15, trust me, you won't regret it.			"

												This game starts out as a normal dating sim. (Well as normal as you can get when you date an all pigeon cast.) You date all the birds, get all the endings. Pretty run of the mill for a dating sim. But then the game comes out and asks you to fulfill a promise. This is the BBL ending, or Bad Boy's Love. This is when the game switches from Otome dating sim to murder mystery psycological horror. I won't spoil it, but if thought some of the normal endings were dark, this blows them right out of the water. The characters develop greatly during the course of BBL and many questions are answered, so its worth playing however.I would greatly recommend this to any visual novel fan and also would be a great starting point to people wanting to get into the series. It has a suprising amount of depth for a game like this and shouldn't be taken at face value. So yeah. Buy it.			"

												I signed up for humor and bird jokes and all I got was a 9.1 hour emotional rollercoaster.I didn't even get a T-Shirt.Still, was worth waiting 4 years just to see all the endings and experience it myself outside of Youtube.The only thing that was spoiled to me in that timeframe was Shuu's ending.Pretty remarkable community.

												On the surface this game looks like a damn joke and through most of it, you'll see this is going to be a joke. But, surprisingly, the characters are nice (despite being ♥♥♥♥ing birds), the story arcs can actually be interesting (shocking), and some pretty easy achievments that'll boost your steam level if wanted.TLDR: Date the birds			"

												Okay i'm going to be serious about this. I don't usually play visual novels/dating sims but this one really peaked my interest. Maybe because it was about birds and I really do like birds and i've heard about this game when it wasn't on steam. When it got on here it was my chance to finally play it!This is a very good game, personally I love the characters and the story. The main character is really funa and you'll enjoy the game. you would get really connected with the characters. I don't have much to say now, I don't want to spoil the rest because it's really great.			"

												Hatoful Boyfriend is a joy: it's fun, brief, and doesn't take itself too seriously. Its embrace of the absurd was a refreshing break from standard dating sim fare.Storywise, underneath the lighthearted, ridiculous exterior, there's a lot more to the plot and the world of Hatoful Boyfriend than meets the eye. My first playthrough was amusing, but as I played again to get more endings, more details about the game's overarching story were revealed. Making new discoveries about the plot became genuinely rewarding, and by the time I got all the endings it felt like a whole different game. As far as gameplay goes there's not much to say; it's purely a dating sim. The best part of the interface was the skip button, which makes replays take 5-10 minutes max instead of 30 minutes. Overall a fun game with great replay value, would recommend to anyone who likes dating sims, visual novels, and surreal games.			"

Though the music is forgettable and the time spent with your newfound avian friends short, the humor, distinct characters and bonds forged with the birds will bring to back to play the game again and again.

												This was, very unexpectedly, a really awesome game. I first started playing expecting a hilarious and absurd story just for the fun of it, but the game really sucked me in and kept me fascinated. Hell, I even bonded emotionally with the birds (especially those with more heartbreaking endings). The bonus ending (the BBL route) was one of the more compelling game (and VN) stories I remember reading made from such seemingly simple and ridiculous premises. I don't even know how they made all the story parts so intervowen, when at first they seemed so random. It was worth unlocking all the slightly repetitive playthroughs to get to it. For anyone wondering why this game is interesting - wait until you get to the last part.I'd recommend it to anyone who lacks prejudice against the obvious ridiculousness of the game and wants to try someting different. It's really funny, sad, and awesome all at the same time.			"

												If you're ready for a game that will make you laugh and tear your heart out - Hatoful Boyfriend is the game for you!Though you may be looking at the game skeptically, wondering 'why on earth is this game about anime birds so popular?' you're not the only one! But here's the basics:+You go to a school for birds, where you interact and date birds.+The plotline can go from sillyness to romance to interestingly creepy in an instant.+The backstory is way more interesting than what the game is labeled as.+Remember to keep tissues by your computer!+This game is 100% worth buying. Look for it when it's on sale!+You will not regret buying this game. Ever. Trust me.I awoke the Pudding Lord who engulfed the world in pudding 10/10			"

												It's funny, you'd think this game is just ""lol dating sim"" its been out for a wile and thats what you think…playing only two endings so far…the story is rich. Much richer than many other dating sims that have been ♥♥♥♥ing fludding steam lately. Its wacky kooky silly but its your money's worth because it dose what a game novle should be, It tells a great story, but just in a waky non-predicting way.			"

												This was probably one of the best games I could have decided to play today to get in the spirit of Valentines and all. I had never heard anything about this game until my friend recommended it to me and while I should have known to expect pigeons I still didn't. This was also my first visual novel style game I had ever played so that was an interesting trip for me.Anyways, I made a valentines special lets play of this game if anyone is interested!

												Played this for a bit, got a few different endings and didn't really like it. Thought I was done, but was convinced to push forward and discover more of the game. So I did. Got the true ending . Still didn't like it. Something about it just rubbed me the wrong way - perhaps it was the weird melodrama, the abundance of anime tropes and reliance on amnesia narratives. I don't know. It has got a degree of charm and parts of the plot were... interesting, but the writing was just bad and shallow. Maybe I had unreasonable expectations, but the total lack of gameplay probably made me extra critical of the narrative, as the whole game hinges on it.			"

												A pigeon visual novel sounded exciting, so I bought this game. I had of course forgotten that visual novels are usually pretty damn boring. For all the jokes and absurdities and wonderful strangeness of Hatoful Boyfriend, I simply can't get into it due to the fact that you won't make decisions for a good majority of the game. Verdict: If you want to play a game about pigeon school, don't get Hatoful Boyfriend. If you want to watch a stream of dialogue from pigeon school, get Hatoful Boyfriend.			"

												Full disclaimer: I got this in a gaming bundle. I did not pay full price.Some people were raving about how funny this game is. Since I found it cheaply in a bundle, I wanted to check it out. I should have just watched a let's play. For a visual novel, it is awkward to read and I don't mean that purely in the conventional way. Sometimes it's hard to understand what's going on from the weird grammar and syntax errors. I feel like more effort could have been put in.			"

												It was cute and interesting for about an hour or so.It was after this point that I realized everything seems to end the same no matter what I do, the game forces you into select decisions otherwise the game abruptly ends and you can do nothing to stop it.It was good for a few brief chuckles, before the reality that the game is a decension into an unavoidable trajedy, woe is the target goal, success is only for those following a blind selection of options. Learnign from your mistakes is hard, because the cause of said trajedy often has no hints, such as your own death, is determined simply by what kinds of beans you buy at a store.That being said, if you want a brief chuckle, and do not want to take it seriously, you will probably few a few short hours of enjoyment.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------After playing it again, it has some nicer endings, neat plot twists at times, although it really does end very quickly each time no matter what. It's very funny and has a bit of wit to it, I don't like the price tag for how short it is, but its definately replayable, so I will give it a thumbs up, but I would look for it on sale.Special thanks to ""Birds are cool"" for gifting me this and letting me try it.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Palyed through most endings now. If you approach this as a game, you might be disappointed, however as a story that just has a few minor interactions and some pictures, with a few funny refrences and easter eggs here and there, it is a deep interwoven story that provides a few hours of entertainment easily.7.2/10			"

Yup, that's what it is - over the top, silly, and loveable for its absolute satire of VN/dating sim traditions.  I mean you're a human girl dating pigeons, the concept is absurd and the game's happy to play with it in absurdity.And then when you have come to love it and your heart is exposed, it will stab it.  Repeatedly.  When the satire and humour is cast away, be prepared for a great many feelings because of pigeon boyfriends.			"

What's not to loveI wrote a poem to talk about the gameTo be the pigeon or not to be the pigeon, that is the questionwhether you date Ryoata, or Oko San I know notand their is also Sakuya and YuuyaOr hey you know, I can date that creepy fat doctor bird who will kill me, if I try to date himMaybe my homeroom teacher or that nutcase anghel who calls me edel blau.But Bascically, what i'm saying is this game makes no sense, but is the best game of 2011, even though you think it's stupid get it			"

												My friend bought this game for me, presumably as a joke, and I went along with it, of course. I played and got to know the characters, choosing which one to focus on with each game. Not only was I pleasently surprised with the depth of some of these characters, but I was also manipulated to feel an array of other emotions which, with a game like this, I would never expect to feel. Their stories made me feel heartbroken, happy and even sick. A game that is good will make me feel emotions intentionally and will have me hooked like this.Now, I am not usually ones for visual novels or games like this, however, the amount of love put in to this game, whether it was for a joke or not, is really something. The puns, the emotion, the references - they all balance out and you don't feel like you're being drowned by anything.Then there's the BBL. After completing some of the stories, you'll get the option to do this other story. After playing normally for a bit, you'll then see it from Ryouta's view. It was tense and I loved it. I won't say anything else.Thanks for buying this for me, Luke.			"

												As of right now at this moment I have 100% completed this game. I must say that I thouroughly enjoyed it's marvelous features and storylines. With over 14 different endings this game was a masterpiece. I think that the Hurtful Boyfriend addition to this game was intense, thrilling and beautiful, it made me laugh, it made me cry and it made me permanently afraid of robotic scarecrows. This game will forever be in my heart and in my mind <3 67 watermelons out of 67 watermelons.			"

												Definitely one of my favorite visual novels. Don't worry, this is NOT a dating simulator -style game, but a VN with with a story that involves some romance.If you can get past the wacky pretense, the game is genuinely funny for the ""regular"" endings, and surprising genuinely good for the penultimate ending.

												Ok, you wanna play a game? A goood game? Well, you ain't gonna get none of that here.Now if you are still here, let me ask you another question: do you want to experience a wacky, surreal, snarky, comedic and touching tale? Well, you've got one here!Yes, the game has a girl dating pigeons; and no, there is no nudity nor lewd scene nor hentai of any sorts.Yes, the author did use pigeon pictures because she wasn't in the financial state of using animu characters;and no, you cannot swap just the characters with animu-cutouts; Moa Hato had worked the pigeon angle into the story.Yes, to many this isn't even a video game.and no, steam is no longer for video games only store, and you can be entertained by just reading a graphic novel.Yes, it's $10;and no, even if it were a 200 pages graphic novel it weren't over-priced.This is a refreshing, if not innovative idea; the story takes the pigeons theme with just the right among of silliness and seriousness. It's a surprisingly well written story based on oh-so-many clichés, yet is still able to take you completely by surprise.			"

												Hatoful Boyfriend is a fun spin on traditional otome visual novels. Of course, that much is obvious from the very premise of the game: a dating sim involving pigeons! What really made Hatoful for me was how weird and/or creepy a lot of the endings were, especially the ""true ending"" in the form of the ""Bad Boys' Love""/Hurtful Boyfriend path that you unlock after achieving certain normal endings. I never expected to get this freaked-out by a game about dating pigeons! And on the happier side, Okosan's and Anghel's routes are amusingly weird, each in their own way. Still, some of the standard routes - including Ryouta's, Kazuaki's and Sakuya's, ones you need to achieve the BBL ending - are typical otome game stuff and don't have much to offer beyond that. But they're worth suffering through to get to the quality routes and to learn more about Hatoful's distinctive post-apocalyptic world. Give it a whirl even if you're not a VN fan.			"

'I don't want to speak to commoners!', said that bird. A bird. Doesn't want to speak with commoners. Oh my.Anyway, I really love this story. I bet not many games have such great plots. So, maybe, even knowing all the story I'll play it again some time later, lol. Was playing it last two days as a crazy, lol (I'm not such a gamer, though, usually I don't play much). Most routes have unexpected ends, thats why I love this game even more!			"

												Since this is on a game site, I am rating this as a game. The first playthrough...actually the first SEVERAL playthroughs I could not even get through this. The main reason I bought this was because of how much fun I had with the similar looking ""Long Live The Queen"". But this isn't much like that at all. Once I committed to the story and had more petience I did make it through, reading everything. There just is barely any game here. I see this touted as a visual novel....well there really isn't much story either. Dialogue is so generic. It's mostly a lot of awkward pauses and people being rude to your character. Reminds me of your most people play tabletop roleplaying games and what they say to NPCs when they do. The stats you have and build on....don't seem to do anything. You get to select what class you are taking as an elective a lot and each time that choice determines which of 3 stats go up (unlike the 18 that LLTQ has), But your stats really don't do anything. They need to DO something. THe elective choice really determines who you spend more time with. As each of the other characters in this seem to ONLY spend time in one place the entire game....thus making the world seem unrealistic. I like that you CAN steer yourself toward relationships with certain people and that is easy enough to do. After one playthrough I got the hang of the goal....""end up with someone"". But a lot of time that goal isn't actually finished. BUt at least they wrote an ending for each person and that is satisfying. And your choices DO have effects on other characters. That too is rewarding. But there really needs to be much more of a story. More weaving and intertwining of characters. Since there really is no gameplay there needs to be more goals. Other games add collection type of goals...like Batman even amidst the fighting, has riddles to solve and question marks to collect and plenty of achievements to do. This game needed more achievements and other little things to accomplish on a meta level to go along with the story and that would have easily produced more ideas for sidecontent. But as is almost all of the achievements are which endings you get...aka who you end up with at the end.The bizarre idea of being at an all-bird school as a human is just so weird but cool and makes wyou want to just start dating birds. But that part of it is really underwhelming. The biggest problem is that almost all of the birds are white. So it's like...oh who's that bird? isn't that the other one? Haven't I met him before? Oh wait this is someone else. Is this a woman or a man? I have no idea. I thought my roommate was a girl. YOU CAN'T TELL! IT'S A BIRD.  Making things more complicated is that it uses all Japanese names. Why? It had no reason to. Maybe if the whole bird idea was dropped and it was just a human dating sim story, but there really is no reason for that. Because having Japanese names mames it harder to distinguish if it is a boy or a girl (I almost typed bird or a girl). I guess that's just picky since it is FOR anime fans so I could let that slide but it does complicate matters. The other thing that completely subverts the whooole bird idea is that it provides the option of giving you a portrait of each bird AS A HUMAN. It does this when you meet each one. WHY DOES IT DO THIS? This completely ruins the immersion of being in an allbird school. Why bother with birds then? The thing is....the dating birds thing is the ONLY hook this game has and then it ruins it with that idea. And even while it is breaking the bird immersion it does it poorly because not only do most of the birds appear white but their human potraits look mostly the same too. Thin anime characters with different colored hair. I only used that feature once and never again because it was so wrong for the story and the game.I did like the characters and their simple stories. I wanted more from ALL of them. If you are going to make a dating sim...why not allow you to go on MORE THAN ONE DATE. Why not let you date multiple people. It's like once you go on one date, then you find out a brooding secret about each person and then that's the end. And therein lies the only actual satisfaction. Trying to get each ending. And it is fast enough to play through the entire game very quickly until you get to a part you haven't seen before. And this is the best gameplay feature. With the simple click of the mouse button (or keyboard type), you can skip through the current bit of dialogue that's scrolling on the screen. That is SO IMPORTANT. Great. So just multiple click through the parts you've seen before! Hold on! there's an even BETTER button. They have a fast forward button! Click it and it zooms through whole sections until you have to make a choice or until it reaches a new chapter. That is so WONDERFUL. They need to use this format to make another much longer and more intricate story because that gameplay suits this kind of game perfectly. However, the amount that it actually has to skip before you get to even your FIRST choice is VERY VERY telling on how few choices you actually have.			"

												this game LOLseriously.COO COO Recommended.EDIT: WOW. This minx of a game is hiding the REAL game inside of it - the BBL ending. Once you've unlocked an ending for each character, you can choose to 'fulfil the promise' and then your opinion of the game can't help but expand. What happens next is a murder mystery of reasonable predictability but with 1 or 2 surprising twists and an ending with plenty of room for a sequel. The character development really opens up in this mode, and we at last see all the pieces fall into place.On the whole, the game is full of comedic zaniness which makes it quite difficult to take seriously but charming in its execution. There's a lot to take in for players who don't like to read, and it does have a flair of the quintessential anime-plot quality (tonnes of expose that gets dished out in huge bursts nearer and nearer the end) which doesn't appeal to everyone, but it's enjoyable on the whole, even if it contains not-so-subtle self-referential advertising at one point lolIt's a lot to take in, but it's worth a look, especially if it's for sale on offer during a sale!!

YouTube™ Video: HATOFUL BOYFRIEND | Pt. 1- Pigeoto-san! 

			Views: 102		

			Let's make this a group effort and pigeon in to watch my new gameplay, Hatoful Boyfriend! Join me and my pigeon homies in Pigeonation as we discover our inner bird and date some sexy man-birds.		

Not too bad, you just have to have the time and patience to invest your time in a dating sim in general. Other than that, hell yeah, the pigeon life.			"

												This game made me cry twice.This game... I played it mostly by accident, influenced by the reviews and English-Japanese version. In the end, though, what I found was much more than I expected.The game is excellently written, the music and the imagery are very good. If it seems like an April Fool's joke, it is because at first it was one; but while the game starts like a joke, it can get quite serious. There's a variety of endings, depending on who you date, some will bring an unexpected wave of <feels>.The game reveals more of itself the more you play it, you get little glimpses of everything that's really happening.I can only recommend you play it.

												Hatoful Boyfriend is a wonderfully bizzare RPG/Dating sim game, Not one normally for the Dating RPG genre I picked this up during the summer sale and was very plesently surprised it's quite different from the usual plod, with 13 different endings and a 14th ""Final end"" ending, the main 13 range from the utterly obsurd to actually quite moving which I thought was a nice touch and really added range to what felt possible in game, it's quite wittily written at times though the amount of Egg and Bird Puns does begin to wear a bit around about the 7th or 8th playthrough...its a pretty solid build of a game with my only gripe being the 14th ending known as the ""BBL"" ending. your milage may vary on it. but you'll either see it as A wonderful Amplifier that greatly adds depth and further character to what on the surface is a fairly light hearted game. or a very over played bloated add on to  the game that only seems to add a small book of texts worth of story with little to no choice in the matter... I personally saw it as the latter but I know there are some people out there that like that kind of detail.Also everyone is Pigeons...			"

												Alright then..I finished this whole game..at first I just played this as a joke..Dating all the birds and getting all the achievements..when I started with the story line from BBL..I got a bit..terrified..It kinda turns out in a horror game for me xD..im not gonna spoil anything..but the whole idea of this game will kinda chance..The game is actually pretty fun, for me it kinda got bored after a little while, because there was soooo much talking.I got to say, there are a lot of feels in this game, you got sad moments, happy moments, scary moments etc. You will find out every story behind the birds, and so you get pulled in, in a story you didnt even know it would happen.I would totally recommed this game, if you love a good story, like to read much and love some plot twists.

												There is alot more to this game than meets the eye. However as not to spoil anything too much I will say that the story is well written, memorable and sometimes very humorous, there are some cliche moments but the overall experience is a great one. Be prepared for a ride full of emotion and deep plot.This game really goes to show that even something as silly as talking birds can be made clever and deep with well enough writing.If you do plan on getting this diamond in the rough then I recommend you get every ending to fully experience everything the game has to offer. ""Carve it into your soul kid!""TL:DR 8.5/10 Well developted story that has much more to offer then it seems.Some Information to answer possible questions-A single ending is roughly 20-30 minutes-All endings totaled should be about 8.5 hours-You can save at any point.(useful for getting multiple endings)-Human portraits are optional and will only appear once per playthrough(during character introductions)			"

												This is an Otome game, which means it has a girl as the protagonist for the Visual Novel as she has a plethora of guys to develop romances with while she explores their story. Just a little thing to note, which is that all of the guys are pigeons in this Bizzaro world you play in. There are multiple routes to take with the different pigeons. I've only done one so far, but it was written alright. Of course this is not a game that is the most serious in the world. If you like Visual Novels as a medium this is a fun one for the changes it makes to the formula. I'll update when I finish all of the routes.			"

												This game has attempted to use humour and the visual novel style but really, with how badly it was made, I feel like it should have been free. The conversations you have with the birds are superficial and lacking any sort of depth, all of the characters are just boring archetypes with little to go on. You jump from conversation to conversation and it isn't made clear how the stats impact gameplay. The sprites are very lazy and honestly, the dialogue makes me think that I am talking to a human, but while looking at a picture of a bird. I don't think this game is even worth the $10 they are charging and given the chance to do it over, I wouldn't have bought it.			"

												At first this would seem like a joke one of those lame brained flash games someone made in a weekend  with a few tweaks here and there but the more you play hatoful boyfriend the more you realize this game isn't a joke...this game actually has a deep story to it and as you obtain each ending the story gets progressively darker and more horror themed in tone to the point where you wonder if this game knows it's not suppose to be taking itself this seriously.....regardless it's probably one of the strangest and most unique games on steam this year and worth looking into if you aren't afraid that is "

												Pigeon Dating Sim. If that doesn't turn you off immediately, then you are the target audience for this game, and will enjoy it.Surprisingly deep and meaningful during the final route, despite it's initial silly premise.			"

												A cute game with an interesting premise that unfortunately doesn't subvert the genre enough to make it not feel like an actual dating-sim.Dating sims are one of those really untouchable games for me, I think they are dumb, weird and creepy. Yet, Hatoful Boyfriend seemed like it was going to really appeal to the masses through a bit of satire, parody and commentary. I guess it does do that in a way, if not much, which is probably why it's had a radiating but mild success in other demographics. But I expected more, like some more gameplay, or branching interactions to really throw the competitors of the genre in the mud since they rely only on horrible anime pseudo porn. If it were to be a great parody AND to also include some legit gameplay, animations or more story depth and length, to really show others how to really make an interesting 'dating' sim at the same time would have elevated it to a great GAME, not some cheap feeling visual novella with around 10 input screens. Hatoful Boyfriend on the surface seems to only jest at the dialog of the genre in a very absurd  'lol dating games amirite?!' sort of way. Sure, some of the writing is silly, a bit fun, sometimes humorous and sometimes dark. But that's all you get, it still feels like i'm just playing an odd dating simulator after a few playthroughs.  Call me crazy but if there was a hint of a descent into madness, I would have liked to have seen a glimpse of it within the first hour of playing so I would be enticed to keep on digging deeper.Maybe I was expecting something along the lines of The Stanley Parable or (more hoping) Frog Fractions from what I heard from other people. But alas it doesn't. If it does, however, devolve into an exciting madness, I did not get that impression during my time playing.As a side note: It would have been nice to remember your username each time you played through but this is just nitpicking.Anyway, maybe I'm wrong about the whole thing and everything I said actually exists and things get crazy and engaging or even quite long. But it never seems to, and it never did.It's a shame really, I hope someone does revisit this type of game again and really make it into something odd, slick and compelling.			"

												What a waste of time this was.If you like my went into this thinking ""Hey, an otome game where you date birds? That's gonna be interesting."" Don't. It is not. Under thin layer of novelity lays a rather dull game with a lot of problems. It's not bad enough for me to drop it outright, but it just gives you expectections and never delivers.At the start game takes a pity on you by giving you an option to show you a human version of a bird when you're first introduced to them. It's like developers new people wouldn't be able to relate to expressionless birds so they gave you a glimpse at what anime cliché they were going for. And yes, birds have no expressions. It's always one picture of a bird unchanging. Everything is expressed through a dialogue.Story feels flat. Sure at a first some events may seem interesting but then you realize that all of them are based on cheap tricks to induce emotional response. All of these events are not properly explored. After a while I just felt indifferent. It doesn't help that to get to the true-true ending you have to play it like 13 times? Half of those endings differ only by the fact that there is a few additional scenes. It's like reading a book with last page missing. You're like ""that's it?"", and then someone gives you that last page and you're just left disappointed.You can't even save to see branched paths because they don't branch. Most of those ""missing page"" endings are based on your stats. In order to see them you have to play the whole thing again, choose the same options but rise different stat durring classes.True-true ending has a terrible pacing. Story drags on and on breaking suspension of disbelief every time it speeds up a little. And even if you unlock everything to get the epilog you're left with a huge gaping plot hole and ending that's basically a cliffhanger which explains nothing.Music is just bad. It's just a handful of generic elevator music tracks. After my 10th playthrough it was just driving me mad. It made me actually glad for these few moments where there was no music.As for technical aspect, it's terrible. A lot of features you'd expect from a visual novel are missing. There is no history log and there is no skipping of read text, you can only skip on scene by scene basis. This combined with a fact that a lot of things happen in a common path makes it really easy to miss text. There is no way to tell at the beginning of a scene if you've seen it already or is it a variant of the scene with some events added to it. It's also far from bug free. More often than not, clicking on choices not register properly and you have to wiggle mouse pointer around for it to start working. Saving in some cases can also produce a save point that freezes a game when loaded from main menu (you have to load from a working save as a workaround and even then it sometimes doesn't work). Sometimes I wasn't even able to exit from save menu. And on top of that text not always fits on a screen.Overall do I recommend this? No. After novelty wears off all you're left with is a very short, hollow, buggy VN with a lot of grinding. I almost want to spoil it to you (which wouldn't be hard as there is not much to spoil) so you wouldn't have to play it.			"

Product received for free
												I got this game as a gift from a friend and I have to say. The game has nice gameplay. Guns are balanced as well as the effects. This game comes with a lot of balanced maps so this game is much better than Call of Duty and Battlefield.9/11 Best FPS ever.			"
