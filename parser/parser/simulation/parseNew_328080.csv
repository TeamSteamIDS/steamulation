								Oh where to start...Retro-Pixel Castles is like what happens when you get a large cluster of ants, put them in a glass enclosure, and watch as they go about their business almost completely unaware of your motives. Your little guys are ants, and you're nudging them to build, harvest, and survive in the best of ways. The game itself is a simple gods-eye view game where you take charge through basic orders. Shows quite a bit of promise for the future and honestly it's really easy to just get lost time-wise while playing. I can't wait to see what happens with this game down the line but you better believe I'm going to be watching for a long time.			"

								This game is like AOE x SIM CITY x SIMS.Food and shelter are the two most important thing in the game. No food, the villagers will starve to death, no shelter, they will sleep on the street (however, there's no monsters currently? Therefore, they are kind of safe).I enjoyed playing this game. First of all, it's like AOE, you need to get your villagers to do work and collect resources. It's like SIM CITY because you have no direct control on them. It's like SIMS because they will level up (probably they will have special skills in the future?)The most interesting thing in this game is that villagers will have babies!Score: 8/10As the game is still in the development process; however, I will be giving a 10/10 when the game is done as it's super awesome!

								Difficult games fall into two catagories: Those that are challenging, and those that are frustrating.  This game, alas, falls into the later category.  My main issues:1.  There is no good way to control overheating in summer.  Especially when the 1200hp Zombie is fighting them all in the middle of the day.  They stand and fight and die of heat exhaustion.  2.  The monster difficulty seems to grow exponentially.  On day 3, it's not uncommon for 700 to 800 hp monsters to waltz through my defences.  By day 5, they're close to 1500 hp.  I've never made it past that point, so I can only guess how vastly overpowered they become.3.  The inability to rotate buildings.  When most buildings are rectangles, it helps to compact your base.4.  The monsters just break through the walls, rather than going through the killing maze.  It's impossible to concentrate enough fire when they come through whatever wall is inconvenient to them.5.  What it boils down to is a tower defence game with a focus on the infrastructure behind the towers.  It's not what I was expecting from a village simulator.  I'm not a big fan of tower defence games to begin with, so this was a rather sad realization.6.  There are no guards or soldiers.  You get golems who can't stand a chance against anything but a slime.  It would be nice to have soldiers who could sortie out and soften up the monsters.EDIT:I am changing my review to positive.  The developer is prompt and courteous, and there seems to be a lot of changes in the works.  I kind of forgot the game is in alpha still because of how well it looks and, aside from the frustrations mentioned above, works.  I suppose, deep down, I'm afraid of getting burned by another Towns.  Thankfully, I don't think that's a concern here.  I look forward to the continued development of what portends to be a great time waster.			"

Early Access Review
								So, how do you go about reviewing an Early Access Game?I think the best way is to measure the improvements to the game over a course of a few weeks.When I bought the gameIt was little more than a tech demo with a lot of bugs. It only had 3 or so ressources, awkward villager management and not many things to build. I was constantly overrun by zombies, there was little balancing.Now that I´m writing this reviewOver the past weeks the game has been updated on a regular basis, bugs fixed and content added. The community is being involved in the developement process.The game has a much more differentiated interface and villager statistics. A ressource refinement system has been added, the magic ressource 'crystal' is now usable and powers some of your buildings. The balancing has improved a lot in a way that you actually have a chance to survive. Monsters have been added and others balanced. Most of the ressources are renewable now. You can already call it a game at this point, it is playable up to end-game without major disruptions in the gameplay.What to expect from this gameYou get an indie survival game with tower defense as well as rpg elements. Build up your medieval fantasy village and try to survive the neverending undead onslaught.Still being early access, the game has a lot of potential to go in many directions.More towers could be added, like electric or acid, dealing splash/aoe damage, or to target specific monsters with weaknesses to certain damage types.A crafting system could be added to bring out the rpg side, allowing armor and weapons, or a profession system like warriors, mages, archers.What I´d really like to see are more maps. Maybe a community map contest?PricingAt the current stage, being in early access, I find the price a bit high, since the user doesn´t get the finished game yet. In my opinion early access games should reward buying it/taking the risk in this stage.If the game continues on it´s path the price will be justified for the final release.			"

								I like RPC, I really do. At the moment there's not much to it, however. If you like building villages, micro-managing resources and villager needs, RPC has a few good things going for it, but there's also a lot holding it back, including the word ""castle"".It's tough; really tough actually, and if you screw up, you pretty much have to make a new profile to try again, you can't just pick a different area on the map. This is a minor annoyance given that you can easily screw yourself over, especially while just learning the game.I like that there's enemies to defend your castle against, but they -easily- overwhelm most defenses, and at the moment, the only way to defend is tower-defense-like mazes you have to build, where half of the towers are pretty much useless. I found the fire towers to draw way too much power to be useful and the rock towers near useless since they have to be out in the open,(can't be behind walls) right where enemies can easily swarm it, making the point of it, to roll a rock down a line of enemies, useless. Real castles didn't work this way, they had gates, moats, walls you could sit on and shoot down, etc. I really wish there was more ""castle"" in this game. There really isn't, it's more akin to Retro-Pixel Villages.It's a fun little game, I like the aesthetic, and I like most of the resource managment and crafting system, but I'm gonna wait and come back to it later when/if/hopefully they add more ""castle"" elements like walls with gates and such, I'm tired of making mazes and getting overwhelmed, and when more later-game content comes in. Very nice so far though! I will revisit and re-review it in the future.			"

Early Access Review
								A magnificent attention to detail went into the textures for this game! With several variations for each object or tile, nothing in the map looks quite like the copy-and-paste wireframe you usually expect to see in other 2D pixel games. Down to the last blade of grass, there seems to be a nice variety of different shades, shapes and directions each individual block displays - with every texture having a decorative secondary layer for its own material type. Complementing the game's surprisingly vibrant and lively textures is an amazing, hand-crafted lighting system ruled over by some of the other textures and objects, and a fully functional day-and-night cycle. Torches provide a light source, lava illuminates a small radius of land around it, and crystals glow in the dark like fireflies. Every wall and object has a dynamic and intricate reaction to which direction the sun is in relation to the world below (as well as other light sources), which changes gradually as the day cycle goes by. Even the water shines in the night as the moon reflects down on it! While this may not sound like much to most modern gamers, for a pixel-based game, the way this is handled is extremely impressive, and adds a clever illusion of 3D with a very nice shadow system. Even some of the world textures are crafted with certain curves around the edges and changes of width that add a realistic sense of direction and angle. This is most visible in the game's own main menu, with the stone-brick wall trim which boxes us in the game's window. The game currently is still in a very early alpha stage and offers no enemies or immediate dangers beyond the starvation of your villagers who wander around aimlessly like hilarious morons until you lay out the foundation for a town hall and send out vague and indirect orders for different resources - a feature true to its own advertisement. This game is definitely no standard RTS, as you have much less control over what happens within the world, instead treating the villagers like ants in an antfarm. You give them basic instructions and a general goal in life, and they immediately begin deciding amongst themselves who works where and who gathers or builds what. Villagers marry and house themselves independently (assuming there had already been homes built, by your command) and have their own unique set of attributes such as Strength and Dexterity, which increase depending on how hard they work or how long they travel. If they are over-worked or if a spouse dies, a villager will become extremely depressed, and lose the will and the energy to continue working at full capacity for a short period of time. Eventually, the villager will find relief in rest or another lover, and so will continue on with his or her life.  The lack of direct control over your villagers is a very welcome and unique change of flow from your average city-building sim, as it gives you a very relaxed and non-competitive or war-driven experience. While I'm sure more threats will be introduced further down the line, the general concept of the game so far is very interesting and humble. I personally have never seen a game concept quite like this, and despite my lack of interest in pixel-based games, I found this quite enjoyable. Even with its current lack of content. This is still a very early build, with a lot of features and content to be added as time goes by. As for right now though, in the state it's in at the time, it comes with a refreshing breath of life in the world of sandbox sims.  Where other games force linear and challenging objectives  or goals, this game's only real objective is survival, and determining how to best accomplish this, with strategy. The gameplay itself reminds me somewhat of Lemmings and Black & White, two gems from Lionhead Studios and Team17. One an objective-based RTS sim where you give general orders to minions in order to help them escape a maze, and the other a god-game where you do your best to keep a strong and stable economy and gain control over other villages. All in all, Retro-Pixel Castles comes with an /exceptionally/ nice soundtrack which really helps set the mood and clear the mind, and a surprising amount of detail and clarity in its world textures which promises a great deal of polish in the final product. The lighting and 3D-like illusions shown in 2D textures makes the game almost remind me a little of Don't Starve, with its ability to turn a simple 2D world into something more like a pop-out storybook. To know that all this comes from such a small dev team is very thrilling, and I would definitely like to see what direction this project takes in the future.  "

Early Access Review
								EDIT 4/2/2016: Updated review, the game has improved.I won't bore you with insanly long reviews, so i'll get right to it, here's my list of pros, and cons. Pros: All art is hand-drawn from the coder, and sole developer (other than bibiki, the musician.) The look and feel of the game is very immersive. A very nice assortment of resources to gather, food, wood, crystals, stone, to name a few. Map editor is amazing, going to be even better at some point, as he has stated a few times he'll be adding options. The style and look of the menus are amazing, and fit so well. (especially since the 16x16 update) Little bugs, and all that are found usually resvolved, good or bad, ray helps. DRM Free An also nice selection of enemies, and jobs, adds a good bit of depth. Recent changes to the way things work has made the game a lot better IMO. The new towers for defense have greatly improved playablity. Ray's got some strange talent at making maps, and lots of them too, plus they all last ages so that's a good bit of fun.Most of the cons are minor, may not look that way by the amount of text but that's just cause of my choice of wording.Cons: The game is more-that-slightly-less-than-rather intensive, but that's not bad coding, it's just the particles are everywhere. No undo/redo in map editor, Most likely will be changed. Can't rotate in map editor. Not sure if it will be changed because that might be on purpose. Winter is perhaps a bit too hard to survive late game, but i've only gone into it once since the update. The AI can be a little stupid, like often when i put enemies in forests they broke their way our, causing wood to drop on the floor and that was miles away, my people then go to pick it up. But, gernally the AI pretty good.Overall rating: 8/10Alright, that's all for now, join me next time on this steam reviews to find out if weight loss is a lie. "

Early Access Review
OVERVIEWNote: Rise to Ruins is currently in Early Access. The version reviewed was InDev25d.Rise to Ruins is a village simulator with some god game elements, from indie developer Raymond Doerr. It was previously titled Retro-Pixel Castles.In Rise to Ruins, you're given a group of settlers with whom you have to found a village and survive for as long as possible. Like most games of this type, there's no real end goal -- or at least none that I'm aware of -- instead you tend to play until your village is wiped out (or nearly so) and then you start again and try to do better next time. The game includes seasonal climate changes and a day/night cycle, both of which present further complications and challenges, but which are great additions to the game.GraphicsThe game is played from a top-down overhead view, with characters (people and monsters) drawn from a three-quarter perspective to give them a bit more personality. You can adjust the zoom from a functional-but-not-quite-far-enough minimum, allowing you to see a fair bit of the surrounding area, up to a chunky-pixel maximum, where a single villager takes up a fair portion of the screen. At minimum zoom the game looks quite nice, with map tiles being well drawn, and characters looking like colourful ants. At maximum zoom the characters look a bit too blocky for my liking.There are no real graphics detail settings, though there are particle and shadow settings, and the obligatory windowed/full-screen options. (ProTip: Don't play in full screen; it's very buggy.) It's not a graphics-heavy game by any means, but it chugs along nicely even with a hundred or so villagers all going about their business.SoundMusic has a nice fantasy/mediaeval theme that suits the game well in my opinion. Sound effects are functional, but nothing special.GameplayRise to Ruins begins with an overhead map of the game's continent, from which you select a region in which you want to settle your first village. These locations differ in available resources and, I think, climate, so choose carefully. (You can found multiple villages in different regions, but you only have a limited pool of villagers, shared between them all.)After you've chosen a region the game takes you to the region map, from which you'll play the game proper. There's no real tutorial at the moment, but the game gives you some help in the form of pop-up tips. These are a bit lacking, though. For example, I had no food growth and no food, but nothing in any of the tips told me I should build anything until it was too late, and even then I didn't know the best place to build it. An in-game tutorial would really help; the youtube tutorial video notwithstanding. Still, although you should be able to work out the very basics pretty easily, it's a steep learning curve when things go wrong and you don't know why. The Steam Discussions are a useful resource.Anyway, you choose a section of promising looking land -- water, rocks, trees, and wild food, if you can find it, are all good -- and build a camp. That then lets you build other buildings, too, and before long you're harvesting resources and growing your camp into a little village community.As is common to many god games, you don't have any direct control over your people; you can assign them to tasks -- builder is the only one available to begin with, but as you build more buildings, more jobs become available -- and that's about it. To harvest resources you select and highlight them on the map, and your people are supposed to harvest as many as they need, and no more.You very quickly need to build up some basic infrastructure, including housing, food growth, water processing, and some rudimentary defences, the latter being required because you never know when a wandering monster might wander into your village and start attacking your people. Combat seems to be stacked against you, too; you don't have any really good 'troops' of your own, and the tower-defence style of defence doesn't quite seem to work: monsters bash through walls rather than being funnelled to your 'kill zone', and it's sometimes hard to even notice them in the first place, with no ability to automatically focus on important events.You also have a small collection of god powers, which you can use by spending your collected essence: another resource, but one that's harvested by you rather than your people. I was a little disappointed in these, as I'd been hoping for a bit more range and depth to them, but what's there is useful and well thought out. I guess it would be fair to say they're more like Populous than Populous II.Rise to Ruins has been in Early Access for about two-and-a-half years, so you'd be forgiven for worrying that it had been abandoned. It definitely hasn't, though: the developer releases regular updates and is active in the Steam Community for the game. As you'd expect from an EA title, though, Rise to Ruins does have some bugs. My first hour with the game consisted of about 15 minutes of playtime, followed by 45 minutes of trying to recover from a crash. The game just wouldn't restart and instead sat there spinning Windows' blue wheel of doom until I killed it. I eventually manually edited the settings and turned off full-screen mode and after that it worked again.You'll encounter minor issues, too. Even with many idle people I found that building would often stop due to no resources being available, so the automatic resource harvesting seems to need a bit of adjustment. The UI is a bit wonky and controls aren't what I would choose, either, but they're functional, and the developer has stated that he reworks the UI every now and then, so what's here now may not be here forever. There's a big message reminding you to press the middle mouse button to cancel whenever you're in the middle of an action, such as designating resources or using god powers; it's lucky it's there, since middle mouse button to cancel is not intuitive at all.PROS AND CONSPros:+ Detailed and in-depth simulation; there's a lot to learn+ Different game modes from casual and explorative (sandbox) to VERY challenging (survival)+ Solid design with a dedicated developer+ Nice music, nice graphics at lower zoom levelsCons:- No proper tutorial, making for a very steep learning curve- Some bad bugs, especially in full screen- Some awkward controls- Combat isn't that greatCONCLUSIONI've only just begun to learn some of Rise to Ruin's intricacies, but I can see there's a lot here. It still has plenty of rough edges, but the developer releases frequent updates and is always responding to comments.If you have the time to invest in it, I expect you'll find Rise to Ruins very rewarding.Super SaveSaveSave for Later - 70 / 100PauseQuitRage QuitNote: I received this game for free for review purposes.

Early Access Review
								I'll do my best to keep this review updated as the game progresses. (2/1/2015 - Current Ver: Indev12c, Indev13 roadmap announced)I'm recommending this, but I have a few caveats before I get to my review. If you're expecting a game that is 100% or even 80% realized as of (2/1/2015) then you probably haven't had much experience with Early Access and you probably shouldn't buy this game YET. Or if the feedback-and-support thing doesn't appeal to you, the $15 pricetag might seem a bit steep. Even then, if you're afraid of vaporware (I know I am), read the store page thoroughly as Ray (the dev) has done his best to put your fears to rest. Still mistrusting? I'm here for ya, or go to the website (or any of the links provided on the store page) and form your own opinion Official Website[retropixelcastles.com](main website link on store page seems to be broken). I know it's some extra effort than you would normally spend, but Ray is very active on his official forums and he will certainly answer any questions regarding his vision and the current state of development before you make a decision on purchasing.That said, I feel with the risk of vaporware and rushed products, opinion on the dev in an Early Access review is just as important as the game itself and I'll address that with my opinion first. If you don't care, scroll down and read the game portion. I'll remove this once the game goes Full-Access.Review of Indie Developer Raymond Doerr(scroll down for game review)This man has earned my respect among a slew of Indie ""Developers"" (Opportunists) that started with Minecraft (Jeb had made a lot of promises like our Alpha/Beta contributions entitling us to free Xbox copies before it was so popular -- didn't happen) and continues to this day with practically every Early Access game on Steam. So much so I've learned to type the simple little word ""dev"" with a bit of spite in my mental voice. Ray is not that man. While this is an opinion, and one I cannot garuntee in the future, I very strongly feel this way. Just talk to him, you'll see.Little things like his naming of his updates Indev12-13 versus 0.12.02 (this is no race to the magic 1.0! it's just a progress report) to his efforts to ask/require your input and support when so many people are so rightfully afraid to give it through an otherwise legitimate manner set him apart.When I was younger, Independently-Developed games were practically non-existent. To be a Beta Tester, you had to send in a resume to a big name company and you had to be hired, it was a job, before your voice ever mattered in the gaming world. I have a job so that's not an option, but through Ray and his SixtyGig Games (and with $15) my voice is heard. That is what Early Access, Independently-Developed games, and Raymond Doerr is all about.(had to be cut short for the actual game review, the lengthy praise is warranted though, I f-ing hate vaporware and the only way around it are honest reviews)Review of Retro-Pixel CastlesCurrent Version: Indev12c(Pro/Con lists are not my style, hope you like to read)InfluencesOn the Steam Store Page, the game is marked as having several noticable influences, but in its current version, I mainly  agree with three of them, and I'll try to break them down.Dwarf Fortress: This is the most obvious influence in my opinion (and also the closest game to ever touch upon what I want in a DF-like game), You have practically zero control over your villagers. You can place buildings to be constructed when your villagers get to it (although in a generally predictable manner), set resource harvesting tasks, and assign free (random) villagers to work at certain buildings. That's about it for control right now, and where most of the DF influence stops. P.S. ""Losing is Fun!"" theme is well-intact in Retro-Pixel Castles.Banished: You start the game on whatever map you choose with nothing but a bunch of villagers and are free to choose where you place your Village Center (required before you can build anything else and serves as radial zone for where you can place other buildings at first, so choose wisely!), unless someone (or you!) has made a map where the Village Center was already placed (you only get one, this ain't no 4x). Also, when you build your first farm, you have to collect wild food (carrots only, so far) before they can start growing them in the farm (this is a one-time deal, a working farm can populate a new one). While it is ultimately a village sim and has buildings, food/energy requirements, I'd end the tracable influences to Banished there.Tower Defense: This is a big one, as it encompasses the actual challenge of the game. I spend most of my time on Peaceful, because I'm a casual grow-and-love city builder type gamer, but this is one of the rare few games where I'll switch off peaceful and play the regular game because A) Peaceful at this stage is -super- low on content and extremely easy being locked on Day 1 difficulty (you really only need/will ever use 2-4 of the available building types) B) Instead of devoting my city to raising a military, in Tower Defense style, your buildings do most of the work for you (your villagers will fight mobs, dumbly, and you will lose a lot of them, but that's the point! ""Losing is Fun!""). Also, currently, you get to have one save, per mode, per map, per profile (you really only need one profile, unless you have a family or RL friends -scoff-) so I can come back to my peaceful cities when I want. So far (more buildings planned in the next update, expect this to change), the only offensive building is a Fire Tower (you can also build walls for defense/mob funneling) which will TD-style automatically fire at mobs close enough. All living things die in a burst of pixelated blood and green ""essence"" which serves as mana/power for your Fire Tower (and an Essence Collector, which is essentially a battery for the Fire Tower). Every day that you survive, the rate that mobs appear increases, and so the difficulty.Most of the game and its mechanics are covered above.Atmosphere:Pixels!: At this point, you either love pixel-art or hate it. If you love it, this game does it very well. There's even an option to smooth out some of the pixel animation like essence flowing to an Essence Collector/Fire Tower(which looks gorgeous and well-fantasy-themed even for pixels), but I like pixels so I haven't even bothered. I'll edit this next time I go into the game and look (which may not be til the next update).Music/Sound: Music is a nice, calming fantasy-like tune that fits well into the pixel-art world. I've never had to turn it down or off after several hours, but that's really all I have to say about it, as I tend to not notice game music anyways. Sounds come mainly from birth/death of villagers and are just a quick happy or sad tune that fits with the music-style.Maps:You can make your own maps! Saved in whatever, and however many, folders you'd like. Ray is currently not very focused on (or very impressive at - sorry man) making maps for the game himself, which brings me to a special point.If you buy Early Access and you make a good map and post it on his forum, Ray may add your map to the game before final release! This is, as far as it stands now, an Early-Access-Only feature. I've seen those threads pop up, and I've seen maps get added, and updated. Be a real contributor to the game!Maps are 1-z level (no digging down DF fans, these are humans!) but give a vague impression of depth as dense resources appear ""taller"" than their regular counterparts and is a nice touch to the aesthetic without complicated mechanics needed.Currently, Ray is experimenting with map size in an effort to reduce code/program efficiency, so if you get in now, there might be changes.

Early Access Review
								This review was originally posted July 2016 for your informationIt's a village management game where you're doomed to lose, what else can I say. It's pretty fun, especially if you acquire it at the price of 5$ like i did. It reminds me of banished in its' managment style, yet its' objective is (like i said before) to get you killed. Needless to say I have my fingers crossed for a difficulty setting or even an adaptive dificulty. Hopefully the DEV wILl see this as he seems pretty involved.24 Hour updateI totally believe this game is worth its 10$ price point, in fact I plan on buying it for my brother.What I SeeSurvival mode provides a satisfying challenge, after each raid by monsters you feel some relief having survived the night. But after you have built up there is not much to stress on defenceP.S. build tons of wood golem generators, it's the way to go.What I wantHoping to see the upcoming inventory update and how its implemented.Plus I think it would be cool if there was some type of levelable character like a hero atached to your profile, though I don't know if this is really the place for ideas. whatever75 Hour updateContent has been added at quite the swift rate, updates come and go and its very much appreciated.THE GOODAs mentioned the updates come at a decent rate and the dev is still quite involved with the game. He also nerfed my wood golems so indefinite survival is no longer a go. The challenge is back boysTHE BADHE NERFED MY GOLEMS, I mean it had to be done as life was much too easy but the lack of a good medium is present again. Survival will probably please the hardcore players and peaceful will please some of the light casuals but I still can't find the right mode for me. To put it more into view I spend a couple of hours in each gameplay and near the end you helplessly accept your fate and it's frustrating. There is no out of game rewards to help you next time and you probably won't experience late game features do to your unfortunate circumstance. THE OTHERSome things that I think I would like to see- Controllable hero WASD style, not too strong to were it changes the game broken but to add some flavor to the game, limit him on stamina and strength or something and make him       semi-autonomous- Better leveling on the golems or regeneration at spawn so they survive to level up as they cant match with the skeletons !!!

								""Retro-Pixel Castles"" is a village simulator that is a bit rogue-like in the sense that you'll be trying to grow and prosper your town for as long as you can before your little uncontrollable villagers succumb to whatever hellish death awaits them.  In short, you can't win...though you can learn from your mistakes and see how long you can last the next time out.  It's got a while before release (a year or more), so there's still a lot of work to be done.  I myself see a lot of potential here, though it's all very basic right now.  The lack of a save feature is probably my biggest gripe with the current build, though a fast-forward button would admittedly be nice too.  Still, you can browse the Internet and the like while you play as it is able to run in the background.  With no price increase planned at launch, you can safely watch this one until you feel comfortable with buying it.

								This game is worth it, plain and simple.  Constant updates, attention to detail I could only say is due to a real love for what he is doing.  This game is the whole reason why early access exists.  If you like village simulator games and want to support a truly awesome game then spend the money on this.  Again, this game is worth it, plain and simple. "

Early Access Review
IntroductionRetro-Pixel Castles: The Godlike Village Simulator is developed by Raymond Doerr and published by SixtyGig Games. While still in Early Access, it shows promise and it is by no means a small feat, given the fact that this title is the dev team’s first Steam project. GameplayEven though there’s not one playthrough similar to another, Retro-Pixel Castles does offer the necessary tools and assets needed for both the survival as well as thriving of the miniaturized society being simulated in our case. If there’s one good thing that comes out of such random scenarios, is that boredom has a hard time setting in provided you are familiar with the god game formula. It’s definitely harder than economic simulators/city builders that are more abundent on Steam. You have to constantly keep an eye on your villagers and protect them from natural hazards and foes, while also having a clear expansion pattern as the resources on the maps do encourage some planning ahead. The game’s tutorial felt a bit thin on content and tips, but there’s still room for improvement. While it may seem rather difficult for beginners, once you know how to prioritize your building projects and manage the initial small population, things become much easier. The audio-visual department is the one that might require some more tinkering from the developer’s side. Music and soud effects seem quite repetitive while the fonts have a slight resolution problem. Zooming in or out would be nice touches as the pixelated graphics don’t bother me at all. In such a game which features enough gameplay complexity as it is, the eye candy can be safely overlooked. Pros+ Randomly generated assets+ Freedom of choice with an open-ended storylineCons- No Achievements or Trading Cards- Still in Early Access- Sounds are repetitiveResult / Final thoughtsIt is truly unfortunate that we have such a limited selection of god games on the Steam Store, but we must make do with what can be found already as well as the newly released ones. Retro-Pixel Castles is just such a title, both promising and with a charm of its own. More than enough to stand out and not be considered just a shout-out to an often neglected genre.Rating 7/10 This review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA titles.

								Hi there.  Are you in your 30s?  Do you like building things?  Do you remember when Warcraft meant RTS and not an MMO?  Than have I got a game for you.I dunno, maybe its just me.  Back hWen (cool hWip), I liked RTS games like Warcraft III or Age of Mythology when I could build up my base and THEN go murder the enemy.  But thats just me-I digress.Retro Pixel Castles hits you right in that build up and kill em all itch.  The Dev is active and responsive, which is more than I can say for my ex-gf.  Good god Im funny.  I should probably go out and make some friends  rather than posting on Steam for validation.  Im so lonely.UPDATE: Liquor-soaked self-loathing aside, the biggest problem that I have with this game is that the constant updates and new builds render my saves useless almost instantaneously.  The dev releases new content so quickly that I barely have time to figure out the ~new~ mechanics/additions before the NEW stuff is added.  So...stop?This is the only review of any game I've ever written, and that's because I truly believe that the Steam community should support devs like Rayvolution-committed to their product, active in the community (toxic swamp we can be) and committed to seeing their vision through.  If every game that came out as pre-release of Project Greenlight'd had 25% of the follow through that Rayvolution or the guys from Stonehearth do, none of us would be cynical about pre-release games on Steam.  Soooooo, Retro Pixel Castles is a great openworld pixely city builder, the dev is active and awesome, and I clearly still need to go outside and make some friends.			"

								I got to spend a small amount of time with Retro-Pixel Castles before it's release to steam so please note my opinions may change after spending more time with the now released steam early access version. I beleive this game has great potential. To select an area for harvesting you use a sort of paint brush system changing the thickness and shape of the brush and simple ""paint"" an area to be selected to harvest. I found this system strangely enjoyable. Workers at the start work as a giant collective until you start to produce more building to seperate them with jobs. Your people have relationships and gain skills based on the work they have done and I found the short time I spent with this game simply great.I will update this review once I've played a decent amount of time on the latest release. I will also be looking into making some videos on this game now it is released to steam. I have one video currently avilable from Retro-Pixel Castles Tech demo here -

Early Access Review
								Edited on Jan 29 2015So this game has been updated, and i've been asked to check the game out again since there is now more content, and this does TECHNICALLY qualify as an early version of the game, rather than simply being a tech demo as it originally was, dumped on steam with no warning that the game wasn't practically playable any more than starcraft 2 with only command centers and scv's would be.But i'm not impressed. My problems with this game comes down to  - Terrible ""village management"" - Sketchy bussiness practice, not necessarily malignant, but the dev is inexperienced and it shows - Lack of direction - There is no way to make interesting maps (All current ones are garbage) - Even at 10€ the game is heavily overpricedI don't want to go into little bugs and irritants, although they are not in short supply, this is early access and these are expected, but the above problems aren't something you can fix with a little patch, they require major reworkings of the game or the way the development operates.By far the biggest issue here is the way new villagers are aquired; the game borrows the double dumbass approach of towns where you will only reproduce if your people are happy AND your people will only be happy if they aren't doing anything. I really didn't want to add this sentence but if you look in the comments for this review it's obvious i'm going to get called on it if i don't so yes, technically you CAN aquire new citizens even at 0 happiness, but the odds of that happening are so abysmally low, i've played 4 games now and i've seen 1 new person appear at <25 happiness, so it doesn't matter.This is made far worse by the game's approach to combat. I expect combat to change a lot as new features are planned for it, but it is still taking the approach of high volatility combat; you're going to lose people defending your home. Compare this to Towns and Dwarf Fortress; in towns you also have this stupid villager approach to population growth, but you're very unlikely to lose people in combat, so it doesn't completely shut down your village even if you're frequently in combat. Dwarf fortress has frequent, massive genocides with scores of dead characters, but population growth is tied to the value of all items your fort owns, and looting enemies gives you lots of weapons, armor and clothes of good value, so you typically get lots of new migrants coming in to refill the ranks of your military.This game has you attacked about every 30 seconds right now, there is practically no breathing room, and it starts immediately. The game seems more like an RTS than a village sim, but with an extremely slow process of replenishing your forces. This could work in the same ways as custom maps for starcraft and warcraft have done, which was awesome, but when you can't expand your population you're just stuck, unable to do anything.Tying happiness to idling is another total failure for the game, especially with the constant aggression. You basically turn the whole game into ballancing workload vs free time; too little workload and you won't be able to build the defenses, too much workload and you never get enough people. This could work as a component to the game, but it just becomes the sole focus, and all you end up doing is unassigning and reassigning people in a neverending circle of tedius micromanagement.Speaking of tedius micromanagement, the villagers are terrible at carrying out tasks efficiently. If you order too many houses/defenses/farms (read: more than 2) they'll start building the first house, then when it's halfway done, they apparently switch to the next, with just a few people working on the first. The result is a collage of unfinished structures littering your town, and if you're building defenses while they're being attacked, the builders will drop their materials to fight, then carry them of to the wrong building, leaving a single unfinished tower for up to 20 minutes was the worst i had, with the little idiots running back to pick up their wood, then drop it as a zombie got close, run over to punch the zombie, then pick up the wood and haul it to another tower under construction. (I queued 4 towers, silly me)This isn't really a big issue to work around, just don't queue up constructions, right? Sure, but this is more micromanagement on top of giving builders their mandatory vacation time, and on top of the next issue:Villagers apparently gather resources from completely random places. This means if you're building something in one place and you assign them to gather wood/rocks nearby, they'll gather it there, but if you then build the next building somewhere else (Why would anyone want to keep their farms and defenses seperate...?) you have to unassign where to gather resources, or the idiots will run halfway across the map to chop down a tree, instead of the one assigned right next to them. All this combined means you don't spend your time organizing defenses, planning your town or anything you'd expect from this game, you're just babysitting these idiotic villagers; go chop here, don't chop there, don't be a builder, don't mine there, mine here, be a builder, don't be a farmer, etc. etc. and this is what the game is; it takes hours to build anything because of this nonsense, and you need to leave the game running without building anything to get new villagers.The other major issue with this as a village sim is that there are no different resources; just food and construction materials. Wood and stone are just different colours; no buildings/tools/tech needed for extraction, take the same time, trees don't regrow, what's the point?The game's bussiness practice also smells bad. The game was initially kickstarted successfully, and IMMEDIATELY after that it was dumped on early access, despite being nothing more than an abysmal tech demo; no combat, just farms and houses forever; 30 minutes and the game ran out of things to do. My problem with this is how eager the dev is for cash. Why wasn't the kickstarter enough to at least make a functional game before throwing it out here? He'll happily charge full price for a tech demo, and the ""game"" has even been on sale. I hate old sayings, but ""Don't sell the skin before shooting the bear"" seems apt for once.The other problem the dev has is the game's lack of focus. This game is NOT on early access to get feedback, because there are so many features missing it's practically impossible to give any worthwhile feedback. What the dev seems to want is ideas for where to take his game, and early access is a terrible place for that. Maybe you want a village sim and this turns into an RTS? Well then, jokes on you. It's impossible to satisfy everyone, but you're still charging them for it. Like i wrote at first, the game has elements of an RTS and a village sim as the dev advertises both on the store page and here: http://retropixelcastles.com/index.php?/page/key_features.html but they don't work together. You can't have the volatility of an RTS combined with the slow growth of a village sim; one has to dominate. The game also touts this ""inevitable failure"" part, as if it has any benefit; If you're building a village you want to see it grow and expand; what's the point of that if the village doesn't matter and you're just playing for high score? I don't mind the ""see how long you can last"" thing, but its fun in an RTS, where you build things only because of their immediate value to your survival, not in a village sim. Apparently we're supposed to unlock stuff after we die, because grinding for necessary unlocks is everyone's favorite thing about videogames.The game also claims to be ""unique"" which is nonsense; stronghold and majesty has done ""defend and grow village"" over a decade ago, and MUCH better. TL;DR: This is an RTS where all you can build is farms, houses and towers, and you can't control or replenish your units.			"

Early Access Review
								Here my honest opinion,I really like the idea of this game. The problem is, it really is an early access game, means, the automaticely moving villagers sometimes dont finish buildings, which can mean you will lose in the coming next 10 minutes. In my situation it didnt finish the crystal farm which is necessary to finish turrets and also the energy generators to power the turrets. To just build a second farm you wont have enough time. Mobs become strong and many pretty fast. I also have no clue how to solve the food problems you get after a while. As far as i know, the food ressources arent infinite, so you starve if you dont get full map control. Which btw i never got.Pro+ Awesome concept+ Simple mechanics+ A challenge+ You suffer with the villagers (at least I do)+ Nice additional content promisedCon- Balancing- Bugs(- Early Access)tl;drIf you want a simple strategy game keep an eye on it and buy it when its on sale. Otherwise buy it when its released.			"

Early Access Review
								I love my little people!  I consider myself a more casual gamer, and the peaceful mode allows me to build up my colonies without the risk of being wiped out.  For those who want it, there is Survival mode.  I did enter Survival mode by accident and found it very challening.  Peaceful mode is not completely without enemies, which gives it a little zing.  I got my main colony up to 381 people.  Over winter only 3 people starved to death!  I was aiming for none, but 3 isn't so bad.  I am currently working through the challenge of balancing food stores to farms to population growth.   Once you get to a certain population level, those little suckers just keep popping out new babies!  I admit I get a thrill every time I see a birth announcement!I really like the roads and paths in the game.  I haven't ever seen that.  When the people walk a certain direction back and forth long enough, they make their own paths.  You can make paths for them, or upgrade the paths they have made into roads.  There is a data screen that will highlight those paths for you.  Once my population was wealthy enough, I upgraded all my roads, which also gave my people a reason to keep chopping down trees and mining rocks.  Work, my little peoples, work!I love this game.  There is not just one way to play it.  My aim is to see how large I can grow my population before it destroys itself. "

								This is a great game, simple yet elegant in a way that the old school RTS games embodied before everything was a competition for better graphics, higher command rates and one dimensional UGC instead of a serious challenge from the game.It takes a while to properly master the resource chains and plan locations and manpower accordingly but the result is more than satisfying once you have mastered the secrets of proper balance.It is hard to get used to workers having their own decision making processes but thet are always getting smarter and better thanks to awesome Dev support, and it is relaxing not to have to micromanage once you are adjusted.If you are looking for a new DOTA keep moving, if you remember the RTS games from the 90's and early 2K's then this is for you.Also, awesome Dev Support again.

								One of the most entertaining gaming experiences I’ve had recently.Considering this is still in early access with phenomenal support and communication from the developer I suspect that I’ve gotten a complete steal at $10USD . I’ve already invested ~50 hours in the game and I although some aspects of the game still need some refinement   there is a clear development path with tons of feedback from the devs. I only wish more early access dev’s put this much effort into their work. I’ve been able to figure out the majority of the gameplay mechanics without in-depth research and though it’s taken me dozens of attempts I do not feel the least bit frustrated when I restart to “do it just a little bit better this time!” – I’ve recently subbed to the “unstable” build am enjoying the new almost daily updates, even if it means the difficulty curve is sometimes completely out of whack.Huge thumbs up and looking forward to the next major patche(s). RPC has already earned a place in my heart :) "

								I will leave a simple review. Ill let the Dev describe the specifics. I will keep playing.Game: allot of fun. A very nice pace to it. replaced Civ5 as my going to sleep time game(meaning i play it when i want something a bit more relaxing). Very challenging. always enjoy loosing and trying again. The combination of things in Retro-Pixel-Castles......it is a bullseye. Just solidly enjoying the whole thing.The Developer: Pritty much all over his project. Im fairly sure if i posted a issue here, he would still find and address it.very accesable.One man indie project. I believe he did his own music for the game also, which fits perfectly. very awesome. (edit: as i read things.......he has someone else do the music. its good)over all, completely reccomend for anyone who loves city building/survival/godlike thing. or anyone in general.GG.P.S. my hours played is not accurate. i play offline most the time.P.P.S. the dev just kicked out pile after pile of new content. just had to say so.

Early Access Review
								The sole developer, Raymond Doerr, is offering up a first class Early Access experience. He seems to be astoundingly active, quickly answering messages on twitter, Steam and the dedicated official game site, which is itself well maintained with an artful attention to detail. Updates come thick and fast, with a casual little suggestion of mine turning up in a patch a day later. Very gratifying! You can really see how determined he is to make this something great, accounting for every piece of feedback. So I'm fully reassured that, even though it's almost two year's since the successful Kickstarter, Retro-Pixel Castles will eventually reach a proper, full release, however long is need to make it a really great gaming experience.As of the current version, inDev22e, I'd say that the game alone is only just about worth it's price tag. There are a couple of nights worth of obsessive play in there, building out your village and defense setup, provided you have a modicum of patience to get into it. After failing initially, I personally watched the handily linked 'tutorial' video, to get the gist of a few basics. The in-game tips were very helpful too. But having figured out how to survive the initial onslaught, the excitement does trail off... The transition to starting a new village map is currently a little rough and without any campaign mechanism in place yet there's no particular motivation to go through the motions more than a couple times.However, it looks like the game's meta is due to change with the upcoming monthly major update and there are a lot of promising additions lined up. Really looking forwards to the future of this project. :-)Bear in mind that while this game is the same genre as Rimworld, it's pretty distinct from it - it's more like supervising a colony of ants, with no capacity or need to micromanage each little person. I feel the villager AI works pretty well, but it's best not to worry too much about the fine detail, just plan out your build strategy and keep an eye on those monsters. Also, there's a significant (and hopefully growing) tower defense aspect to the play, with it being possible to build little mazes for enemies to path through while getting shot. Quite a novel marriage of two of my favorite, most addictive game genres!Also be warned that the game can run a little choppily under certain circumstances, but is getting better optimized with each update and refinements are also due that should help avoid overly demanding conditions. Likewise I experienced a couple of crashes initially, but the frequent auto-save meant I never lost any progress and I've been unable to replicate the problem after recent updates. Continuous improvement.			"

Early Access Review
								Being a fan of Dungeon Keeper and resource-gathering and structure-building games like Startopia, let's just say I really wanted to love this game. I don't even like it.There's just not much game here. All buildings seem to be lackluster and blatantly 2-tier right up front. Little is hidden. Want wood? Lumber jack or advanced lumberjack. Want stone? mason or advanced Mason. The buildings are rather bland and show little innovation or setting/theme.Basically you set your people to work by painting resource gathering areas on trees, stone, etc. Then you construct buildings to process these resources so you can make a defense tower or two and some magic makers.You have a set of spells, once again all presented up front with little in the way of unlocking or earning their acquisition. Fireball for killing. Healing aura for ... healing. You can guess the rest. You've seen them in just about every other god-game.My point is, re-hashing all the tired old god-game concepts from the 90's to now in a cute little pixel style doesn't show much originality and doesn't necessarily make the game fun. Grinding through several hours of this in attempt to enjoy it I finally realized, this simply is not a fun game yet. I hope, sincerely, to update this review later upon release, praising it for it's clever spell set, tiered growth and scaling, intense combat mechanics creative buildings, hearty and lore-filled setting and my attachment to the characters I'm leading. Right now it just has none of these features.			"

								9/10. Retro Pixel Castles has been on my top 3 since he rewrote the AI ground up, reading other reviews here it seems people havent played recently. The dev has been tuning and perfecting his ""creatures"" behaviors for months. they are advanced and work like little bulldozers.Goodies.1. Mechanics are pinpoint (game has an amzing tip system to teach you if u won't touch tutorials. (im looking at you)2. Recently updated resolution (moar pixels)3. Relaxing music and great art is better than 4k resolution right?!4. Super powers! you can regrow forest, send and take creatures and resources from ""limbo"".... its so interesting to use a cullimnation of assigned work, magic and good ol' fashioned city building to survive the increasing hordes.5. Developer is super active on steam forums and his twitter and his website. always pushing updates almost MONTHLY!The Bad.1. Beta, waiting for the good stuff isnt fun!2. The occastional glitches, every game has em.3. Having trouble with bad stuff here.... primarily It is an easy game once you understand the mechanics, but it's still so much fun. He found a sweet spot between simple and replayable.Finals words, The best features of this game is its ""creatures"", beautiful music and a town to build.. looking at the Road map in game he has so many features planned, this game is in the act of tuning its brain. i promise if u have ever played any village simulator this one is for the record books. BUY A STEAM CONTROLLER, This game is next level on a tv with a good controller config (will upload mine soon, Mercy has his uploaded and i built my own off his)			"

								I picked that game up on sale at 50% off and I must say I'm very happy with Retro Pixel Castles.  It offers pixelated graphics, which has been kind of hype for a couple years now.  I like those graphics a lot... Characters are literally like 8 pixels tall and when they battle against ennemies the blood sprays everywhere on the grass, it's awesome HAHAHA! Orchestral soundtrack is awesome.  It's a hard game tough!In the first gameplay hour, I was a bit overwhelmed with all the functionalities, buttons, menus and I was a little bit confused about how to play the game, until I grasped the concept.  Retro Pixel Castles is like Majesty, not like Warcraft, so basically you do not control individuals, you only control where they build facilities but other than that, it's 100% AI.The other thing I didn't use (and why I constantly lost) is the god powers.  Just like in Majesty, you can instantly cast spells anywhere on the map and one of those is particularly helpful (or should I say *required*) in order to win some maps: the ""Motivate Land"" spell.  It makes plants and food instantly grow up.  Without using this spell, my would villagers always die from starvation in the middle of summer, even if I had built 2 farms and picked up all the local wild food patches :PI find that this game takes 1 to 2 hours of initial gameplay to learn the basics.  It's fun because you learn a trick or a strategy every time you play, making it addictive.  Overall, it's a very			"

Early Access Review
								The game is very good, and shows a lot of potential. However, it IS an Early Access game, and there are of course some issues in gameplay balance and other areas, namely in how unreasonably difficult the game can be to control. The 2 games I can most relate to are Banished, and Dwarf Fortress - though it clearly distinguishes itself from both of these.The game itself is very challenging on its own terms, in a way that inspires you to continue learning and strategizing despite many failed attempts. The gameplay is very fluid (though the framerate sometimes isn't) and is structured very intuitively. My other thoughts on this game so far are as follows:+I love what there is of the soundtrack so far, somewhat reminds me of Runescape.+Love the interactive Main menu+The visuals of the game are so crisp and well designed, but I wish you could zoom out a little more, and zooming in as much as is available just hurts my eyes.+Lots of variety in maps so far, but I wonder if there will be more - or even procedural generation.+The map editor is excellent.------------It would make sense to lower temperature in rain and at night, and to let seasons affect gameplay differently depending on the area climate (ex. summer is hotter in the desert, not as bad in the tundra or mild areas)-The villager info panel needs to be better. When looking at the only panel that lists all villagers, I can't tell hardly anything about any of them besides their level. Seeing any other information about them on that panel would be incrediblly useful, as would be the ability to sort them differently or click their names as links in alerts.-Children (though they are agood game mechanic) currently make understanding your population difficult.-Some god powers are difficult and/or confusing to use.-It is very difficult and frustrating to attempt to navigate combat, or any other situation where a large amount of villagers and/or other creatures are stacked on top of one another - it's so hard to have an actual grasp on how the fighting is going, or if a villager needs healing because you it's so difficult to select them in the chaos.-I really wish I there was an option to disable the screen shaking so constantly.-----------That's all I've thought up for now, but I'll try and keep this relatively updated.

								Don't get me wrong, It's a good-ish game, but there is painfully little in the way of gameplay at this stage of development, it's really barren, after maybe an hour you've already pretty much got everything up and running and there's nothing left for you to do.it does have quite a bit of potential for modding it seems, just like rimworld this could become a thousand times what it already is if some modders were to set their eyes on this game.

What I liked:  Challenging survival game  The music is soothing( despite the game being and hard)What You Need to Know:  This game is far from a great early access game atm, it feels very content poor atm.  You get attacked non-stop unless you turn on peaceful mode  AI is stupid, they all will stop doing anything to attack mobs across your base( they will rarely pick up the dropped resources, WTF, even when it's a foot from the building that needs it)  The amount of options for defending or upgrading your village is still not even close to what it could be. ( So hold on to your money till it gets more content)  This game has potential, just not yet. If you want this style of game. Get RIMWORLD!!!! It's so freaking awesome  Will revisit this game when the developer puts more content and makes the AI more usable  Sadly this game will fall into the ether of other medicore EA titles, because the content and issues with the game are too strong to have any fun This game had 2 hours of content. No unlocks or research to get better stuff. Just basic builidngs and uniteresting survival mechanicsMy Score:DPaid:$10 Main reason for dislike: Too few content atmThe best game of this style:   Rimworld!!!! not on steam yet :( "

								It's a good start.Shockingly enough the trailer makes the game seem more intresting and exciting than it is. Not to say I didn't enjoy it, it's just a very slow game. No time speed ups so get used to normal game time all the time. The game is enjoyable, but nothing that would keep you on constantly. This is something you can best play while writing a paper or cleaning your room. ""You guys go this, and I'm gonna read /pol/ posts until you make a ding"" Was pretty much the game plan. A couple time's I took a nap and woke up with doubled population (and one time when everyone just starved to death)A lot of the god powers are pretty useless depending on which play mode you play (Survival or Peaceful). Like in survival, I found the only useful tool was the pickup button. When ever a hoard would come I woild pick off one by one and toss them on the other side of the map.At first I would keep checking the Alerts button to see what I can do to help my people, but after a while it became something to be ignored. A lot of problems that I faced I can do nothing about. >""So n' so is on fire"" >Picks up person and puts in water. >He walks out and keeps being too hot.Also, and this is my big problem/ reason for writing this: In peaceful mode I got my pop up to about 230 and now whenever I load up the game and open that map the game crashes. Before when I was at a pop of like 190 I noticed things got laggy, then I feel asleep again, woke up, turned the game off (saved and all) and now I cannot get back into my file. I checked out the whats next on 1.9 and all, roads can wait. Games like these gave to have a large pop cap on them, it's the whole point in doing a game like this. The goal and over all satasfiaction with something like this is seeing that your once 32 pop village a now 320 pop city!Overall, it's a fun game and I'm really looking forward for future development. It's just really, slow.			"

Early Access Review
								I played it a while and i have to say it shows promise.What i missed from similar games like Banished was a challenge from monsters or enemies. Like other tribes trying to kill my people or simply wild animals. Banished couldnt fulfill this wish but Retro Pixel Castles does. Although till now it is limited to Slimes and Zombies (more to come).Obviously it is Early Access and not finished, it is in many ways very barebone, has at the moment no saving function (end 2014) and misses many other things in terms of controls, layout and look.But it also is very playable i have to say. There is something you can get out and giving you some fun. Maps are available from the developer (although they are a bit ugly) or you get a community created map (looking much better).Steamworkshop is missing till now, which makes these a bit ""harder"" to obtain, but they are there.The game goes a similar direction Banished goes. You start with a bunch of people, you create a Towncenter, harvest ressources and build other buildings to support your people or get defenses against Monsters up.You cant control your people directly, which often is a bit painful because you also cant give other commands like a rallye point or make a priority to a building, so you cant influence till now which building they start to build or where they shall group up to fight and defend their town. Also a more direct control over single townsmen/women would be a good addition to decide who is going to be a builder and who will be a farmer (or maybe a guard later on?).But even while there are things missing and flaws at the moment, it is very fun to play. Different maps give a good feeling of what the Dev can come up with and besides that spice the experience up. Playing on one map is very different than on the next one. Even playing several times on the same map is a variety in experience because the starting points are randomized.Currently in: -are different basic buildings like a farm, different kinds of housing (tent and house), lighting, defensetowers, walls, structures to earn ressources-a mapeditor to create your own maps (is kinda easy, just the dev is doing some very ugly ones)-different profile without any use at the moment-a settings option menu-2 types of monsters (zombie and slime)-1 type of food-2 types of usable ressources (stone and wood)-3 types of non usable ressources at the moment (3 different crystaltypes)-a kinda good soundtrack (sounds very pixely)-a very sweet pixel look, zoomable camera (although a bit clunky in performance then)Note: you can enter a beta branch with going to properties of the game, which gives you access to a ""unstable"" version of the game with more features. I highly recommend  to do this, i experienced no crashes on the unstable compared to the basic version which crashed often and got more content from it.How to do this is described on the forum.My review is based of the Unstable Version 2 InDev12 on the Beta Branch.I can recommend this game as an early access game. Even unfinished it is very playable and has enough content to get fun out of it and be creative with the editor to get even more challenge or just experiment.I bought it for 7.49€ and i think it was worth the price. I think 15€ are a bit much for the content at the moment and if you want to wait till it gets cheaper or has more content, then wait.But i think it will definetely be worth this price tag with a bit more content or even when its finished and for an Early Access Game, it delivers more than others do. Its one of the good Early Access Games.			"

								I'm not a professional reviewer, so sorry if this isn't good.This game is a mixture of tower defense, survival and strategy. I picked it up on sale for 5 bucks.Pros:-Art style-Variety of starting areas-Survival mode is challenging (this could be a pro or a con depending on if you have a ""losing is fun"" mentality when entering this game)-Active development and friendly, understanding devs.-Accidentally dropping a rock on a villager, knocking him out cold is hilarious.Cons: -Again, if you don't go in with a ""losing is fun"" mentality, Survival mode may seem far too difficult. I highly recommend that new players try Peaceful mode first. Update 1/16: After asking the community for tips, I was finally able to git gud and survive a year.-The spell system is pretty bad. As of Update 24, they've slightly remedied the mana issues, but some of the spells are redundant (multiple torch/light spells), and some still cost far too much mana. The attack spells are too weak against mobs/mob spawn points, and too effective in friendly fire. One dev has said there is a spell rework in the plans, so I will change this when that rework goes live. -Game stuttering. I have a middle-of-the-road PC, not a complete pos, I can run Witcher 3 on medium settings, and I find that during periods of combat, building destruction and thunderstorms, the game will randomly stutter.Suggestion:-I think that the amount of buildings needed to create items and perform functions for other buildings could be more streamlined. Example: Eliminate the Tumbler and put that function into the Stone Cuttery.Overall, I do think this game is worth the 10 dollar price tag (I waited 'till a sale because I'm a poor bastid), and I highly recommend it if you want a challenging experience.

								A nice little village simulator... just don't get too attached to your villagers or they will die. And it will be your fault. When they starve you  learn that you need to start your food generation earlier, when a zombie kills them, maybe you realize your defenses should have been started earlier. Walk away without pausing the game... don't expect survivors when you get back...Cool game... the dev is responsive to feedback and is actively improving the game.Well worth the money.			"

								Old school is best school...I used to be impressed by flashy graphics, back in the PS2 days. Not anymore. Now all I care about are mechanics, and I love this game, incomplete atm though it is. The production chains are solid, the micromanagement is simple yet as involved as you want to make it, and the inventory system for each and every little peon is awesome. I also have laughed hard enough to set my dog to barking several times at the names of nomads joining my village. I may have once recruited Kanye West, just sayin'... it's fun, the campaign settlement mode is boss, and I love the variety and intensity of the monster spawns. PS, if you wanna get rid of monster spawning structures, build fire pits near them, and your golems and peons will go hack them up. Enjoy, worth the price by a wide margin!			"

								If you love Sandbox building, strategy, survival, sims, and pixels, then this game is for you! Even though it is in early release right now, the game's mechanics work really well and there is a healthy amount of depth into the game (eg. Zombies have names!)It also has an active auto save feature that may briefly glitch the screen (just a heads up), but it is functional and handy. The sounds and music are fantastic and immersive.Things that I look forward to in the update:- an active tutorial that helps point out buttons and functions (the current tutorial available is fan made and is accessable with an in-game link. It is a helpful tutorial, but might be slightly confusing to some)- More food sources (deer, rabbits, wheat, corn, etc)- more monster typesSo far this game is so good :D			"

								i can definitely see the promise in this game. It's no where close to being finished (in fact i'd venture to say it's barely started), but i have a good feeling this is going to shape up nicely. Villagers seem to have some stats raised by their jobs, some of the job flow is a little confusing at first mostly because it is more simple than i was expecting (that deceptive retro look). I'm really looking forward to playing this one while it develops, and if you're a fan of supporting works-in-progress, medieval rts, and want to be a part of the direction of the game, you might want to give it a shot as well.

Retro-Pixel CastlesRetro-Pixel Castles was made by an amazing developer called Rayvolution. R-P Castles was based at pretty old genre what died years ago like Warcraft, Starcraft is something like Village Simulator where you can build almost everything what will help you survive hordes of enemies of course for that you will need resources like wood,stone,crystals and even food! For your villagers!The good+ Lots of maps!+ Some Enemies! (Soon will be more!)+ Lots of buildings+ You can all the time change everything around you like Chop trees, build wall...+ Day/Night system, Raining, Thunders and More!+ Is not boring!

								Early Access Review:It took me a couple sittings before the game finally reeled me in, but boy has it given me that ""one more turn"" feel like Civ or Empire Earth. tl;dr at the bottom.So what is Retro-Pixel Castles?Right now it's basically a sandbox survival village building / god simulation game. As it's Early Access the content is currently limited, but there is enough to get a good idea of how great this game could be should it continue to go the direction it is currently being developed.What do you do?You can build a village, collect resources, expand your population, defend your land from monsters that attack at night, and then expand your control beyond the current map and export units/resources to ""Limbo"" where you can access them on other maps as part of the World Map system.What can't you do (yet)?Currently there are no animals, as noted by the dev. Building diversity is also very limited; you can see one or two variations of defensive buildings that use each resource type, there is essentially only one gathering building for each type of resource (wood, stone, and crystal), only one resource ""refining"" building for each type of resource, inventory management is a bit awkward--no ability to to prioritize what resources get stored in large storage buildings. Also magic buildings are limited to a portal to Limbo, an essence collecter (used to power magic defense structures), and a crystal motivator (regenerates your natural crystal deposits so they can be harvested sooner.), and a few defensive buildings.There is also currently only one playable race/faction. I would love to see different races / tribes that have alternate methods of collecting resources and different technologies/structures. As someone who grew up with Warcraft 2 and 3, I really fell in love with the base building. (I loved how the Undead didn't have to travel to collect gold, and how the Night Elves could collect wood without destroying trees, thus allowing forests to exist as walls where-as the Humans/Orcs eventually destroy every resource in their path to find each other.)Music is simple and satisfying, but I think it could use more variety as with most of the rest of the game.I hope the dev keeps on improving this game because I'm hooked, I want to see more but I'm afraid even when I expand to my second base there won't be anything but new terrain to see.tl;dr:This game is a fun mix of Dwarf Fortress and Warcraft 2/3. The graphics are colorful and bright. You can build a maze of walls for the monsters to run through turning it in to a real survival tower defense. I recommend it to anyone who likes retro village building.			"

								One of the worst name i've seen so far but Retro-Pixel Castles is an excellent game. To put it short it's a survival city builder with tower defense components.It's in early access and i can confirm the team is right behind their game and players. Patch comes out pretty often adding   substantial content & features (please don't trust me and check the changelog by yourself as you should always do with early access titles). If you're not into too much reading they have an interesting Dashboard ""Map"" in game where you can actually follow very precisely what will come out sooner or later.Back to the game. Retro-Pixel Castles current state is pretty good. Everything is working so far (pathfinding, building, villagers levelling) for you to try it and the gameplay gives a nice feeling of pressured Banished which i was really expecting. Indeed, you'll have to develop a village strong enough to resist against roaming monsters. Developping a village consist in farming, harvesting ressources, building new homes and keep all those guys (and precious girls) happy so they can mate. Life is beautiful. Except for kids who keep running out of town. But it's no big deal for the god you're playing since you can use powerful spells to try to help this zombie mate a young meteorite.The soundtrack is simply awesome and you may want to get it. It gives a perfect chill & relax feeling which contrast with a tense gameplay.Good gameplay, good music, promising concept & well supported indy game. Go get it now			"

								9 Janurary 2015: Shortly after my last review, enemies appeared! They're zombies (and shlimes and stuff), which spawn.. round the edge of the map I think? Some just stand about, others come and attack in ""waves"". I'm getting my butt kicked a little - but not unfairly so. I can survive a few nights, and my mistakes have always been overreaching, trying to build something or harvest something too far out. I suspect I need to wall myself in, and funnel the zombies to a well defended hole before expanding... something I will try in coming days. The steady challenge I wanted is certainly there now, so, still recommended, and more so now than before. I'll update (if I remember) when I've played some more/with future updates.17 Dec 2014 : There's very little to do here, but everything that can be done is roughly in balance, and is ""easy"" to do, which is very good.  Right now there's no ""ongoing"" challenge - in many games of this genre, growth brings new problems (or revisitations of the old). I'm extremely interested to see how that will go, as everything here so far is rock solid and ongoing steady challenge is the only ""thing"" that prevents this becoming a time consuming pastime. I assume this will come in the form of ever more challenging waves of monsters... how this is balanced will probably be the make or break point for me. A tentative recommendation, let's see how things go!			"

								No more chances, I've been coming back to this game so many times, and every one of them was NOT FUN, despite many updates. I don't believe this game will ever be good anymore. The biggest problem with it, it's EXTREMELY UNFAIR.I bought it very soon after it first showed up on Steam, it was crude, with few features. To this day it received A LOT of updates. The problem is - this is how gameplay always looks like:- build camp, build basic structures with very high resource cost, that takes some time- build basic defences and wall - oh, monsters will just go through the water if you surrounded with wall from 1 side. And they can destroy forests and mountains! either build wall from all sides, keeping all imporatant resources inside (impossible) or... build a maze with walls, so monsters will take longer to enter and you will have more time for towers to shoot them- monsters get stronger and stronger with each night, forever, you can't just have defese, you must CONSTANTLY build more towers and after short time they make so little damage, that monsters easily destroy them- all over the map enemy bases show up, you can use spells to destroy them - this will drain all your mana- what the hell are farms doing??? why they give almost no food? oh, you must use motivate land spell, to get enough food - choose: food or destroying enemy bases that spawn infinite enemies- villagers constantly die, because they don't ran away from monsters. You are building some stuff and suddenly ""VILLAGER WAS KILLED BY SLIME (lvl 3)"" - wtf? they were near 3 working towers, I didn't even know we were being attacked (eh you always are in this game, day and night), why couldn't this villager run back?- you finally get most basic buildings and now enemy attacks are so strong that you have to focus almost entirely on defense- spells are a JOKE, there are only couple good ones and all offensive are piece of SH IT. You want to help your villages fighting? What you gonna use, meteor from the sky or fire on them all? all you can do is GRAB enemies and move them to far part of the map (they will come back, sooner or later), so you move map back and forth, grabbing enemies like crazy, so they don't kill your people. Sometimes they all stand on same square, so you can't select the enemy and you just watch as they kill villagers.- attacks on your base get so big and constant that game slows down, bad optimization- the enemies waves get so large, they will get to your base, destroy all towers, all buildings and kill everybody, that's what happens every time, no matter what you do- then you got this awesome feature (that could be good if game was fair), were you only have 50 villagers per world (profile) - if you didn't throw your villagers to cullis gate, before they were all killed, you have to start new profileNot fun, unfair, not rewarding, it's all about defense, buidling base is secondary.

								This is the perfect game for relaxation. Just see how your villagers work by themselves, listen to the gorgeus music, watch the beatiful drawn map... Or, you can play in survival mode and focus on zombies not getting to your village!Also, you have access to updates, with a lot of content in each of them. That's what I love of the game. I can be playing hours and hours without getting bored, and because of the updates, I get to play with new features.Another thing I love about the game, is the game modes: skirmish and world map. You can play the classic skirmish, where you play in one map, or you can play in the world map, where you get access to a world with different maps. In world map mode, you have access to the limbo, where you can store villagers and resources. The game also features a tip system, magic towers, resource gathering... And the main purpose of survival mode: defending your village from the monsters and keeping your villagers alive (Or watching your willagers harvesting food in peaceful mode...)I guarantee you won't get bored with this game, and I recommend buying it. You should also buy the soundtrack. It's fantastic.			"

								Do you remeber Stronghold? Mix it up with the feeling of Lemmings when you watch the villagers work (you can't give them orders), the feeling of Settler 1-4 when you watch the villagers carry ressources to houses and construct them (yes they are not magically all over the island but have to get hauled), and Tower Defense games (all kinds of monsters come and try to invade your small settlement, defended by guard towers and the bare fists of the souls you want to protect), and you have this gem here. The game is as of now (31.07.2016, indev 20) allready fun to play and has no buggy edges and balancing breakers you normally find after the first 4 hours of playing an alpha or early access game. And you will feel, that the developer knows whats fun. There are this and those little features that really show some love to game design. Ofcourse it only costs 10 € atm, so dont expect big unit and building lists or a really long motivation curve of 40 hours.I strongly recommend it, because I really love Tower Defense and Economy Simulation games. That is one of the games you can allready play in alpha and still call it some nice time.Btw. I got stomped at the 6th day of summer on an easy start map, and you are expected to survive the winter when there is no food and the zombies are tripple the forces.			"

								Retro-Pixel Castles is a city-builder mixed with fantasy RPG elements like monsters, experience & leveling, and magic spells.  Be aware this game is very much in Early Access so there isn't a whole lot to do right now, but there is a lot of potential for more features.  It is still fun to build a village, gather resources, and defend from monsters.  I found the difficulty to be a little harsh as I felt as though I was swarmed with enemies far too quickly.  It's still fun and I still recommend it, especially when on sale.PROS+ Unique take on Banished-style city-builder mixed with monsters, magic, and God powers+ Large continent with multiple sites to develop+ Many modes to experiment with including Peaceful and Sandbox+ Nice little touches like paths that appear where settlers frequently travel+ Includes world creator and developer tools+ Lots of potential for additional featuresCONS- Normal mode is overly difficult (too many monsters too quickly)- Early Access: Lacks content and depth (can see everything in a few hours)- Generic graphics			"

 -1 Retro-Pixel Castles requires OpenJDK8, thus thus the minimum requirements should state ""Java 8 or Higher Required"". I had to update my java...an eternal task that if there is an afterlife I surely will still have to do. -1 Mouse scrolling on maps(worldmap and micro) was inverted with no way to fix it. Think dragging an icon on your computer and the cursor goes the opposite way. There is an option to toggle ""Invert Map Scrolling"" but it did not seem to do anything. Perhaps it is a bug. Keyboard scrolling for the worldmap works fine though. I suspect if you are a filthy mac user you might not find it a problem (natural scrolling?). I am not sure though. -1 Learning the game is not painless. There are tooltips that are very useful but still lacking. For one, the game continues to run while you are reading and trying find the things the tooltip talks about. For this reason time (hunger, monsters, etc.) are disincentivising you from reading and understanding. The UI is also unexplained. I had trouble figuring out how to build a farm and defensive structures (icon on right of the screen by the way) until it was too late. -1 I found the font not easy to read. Fancyness work against a font if it is not easily readable. +1 neat concept of certain God-like abilities to replenish resources on the map, set the earth on fire, heal villagers, et cetera. Spells/abilities require a slowly replenishing mana. +1 Retro-Pixel Castles is 60FPS. A high FPS does not make a game great but great games generally have high FPS. It is like how successful people get sleep, rise early, and don't sleep in but doing these things don't make you successful. +1 Available on linux +1 no burdensome DRM such as online play required or registration. +1 is a nearly complete game [Early Access] -1 is a nearly complete game [is being sold] +1 Developers active +1 game is not abandoned.

								[EDIT]: April 18, 2016Let me make this incredibly clear when I tell you that this game deserves your undivided attention if you're into simulation/survival types.  No mercy but fair in its progression, the developer has been nothing short of a welcome from early access titles.This game went from simple mechanics but with an intuitive UI, limited of course; but throughout its development, more is added, fixed, and updated for better.I purchased this game  some years ago now, and I'm still smiling when I play.Give this game a go, it's worth your time.[EDIT] Came in to make a couple changes to the reviewThis is being written towards the end of January and I have to say this game has done incredibly well in regards to the development and additions it never had way back in June when I first wrote this small review.The game has a rather difficult learning curve, but once you get into the idea that slower builds, resourse gathering and making informed decisions on village center placements, the game becomes much more enjoyable.The audio is still lacking and the ""events"" that happen are so barely visible I rarely know when someone is born other than by audio cue.  Same goes for death.I'd like the music's tone to change during an upcoming attack, to get my ready...or maybe a visual notification such as, ""Reports claim a gathering of monsters was making its way towards our camp...""Still an amazing game for the price.**********Well, I wasn't expectng this.This game, in its current state, is just fantastic.I want to see more music, better implementation of some early-stage mechanics and am excited to see the new stuff down the road.Pick this up if you are a Gnomoria fan or felt like Towns was missing something.

								Retro-Pixel Castles is a great mix between a resource management game and a tower defense. It has that streak of difficulty that I love, similar to games lke Banished or Dwarf Fortress where you can always improve how you get your base set up. It has regular ongoing updates and seems to be well maintained by the developer.I reccomend it for sure.			"

								It's a good game, but still early access, you can only progress so much before you hit a wall where you can't progress due to enemy strength vs your own. Around day 7 things are going south fast. The game looks very promising, I have played, and failed repeatedly, I continue to enjoy seeing my own demise. Energy seems to be my biggest issue, You generate it extremely slowly farming crystals, and from enemy kills, but the difference between what you make and what it costs to kill a mob is considerable. I think that could use some balancing and maybe energy generation methods, I spammed the only building that is capable of producing power and even that didn't do the trick, they just run out so quickly. So all in all, I like the game, I think it will continue to get better as the Devs put more work into it. It plays like Gnomoria accept it's all above ground and you can't use the surroundings to protect yourelf (mobs hack through trees), However you have god powers and can interfere with what is going on to some extent, you can warp villiagers to safety or mobs away, but these are extremely expensive ""influence"" wise, this is the games form of mana, which is generated based on happiness. Fireballs are great, accept when you throw them into crowds of your villiagers because you panic when a hoarde of mobs get in... RIP 1st village. TLDR: Still in development, needs work, I still reccomend it.10/10 Would fireball my own settlement again.			"

Early Access Review
								Pros:-Love the pixel art style of the game-Tower defense aspects set it apart a bit from other Dwarf Fortress-likes, combat is an extremely core part of the game and that's not a bad thing at all.-Totally reasonable price. I got it on sale for $5, but even the default price of $10 is reasonable. I bought this less than a week ago as of this review and I already have over 24 hours put into it. The dev is also extremely active so I'm confident in the game's future.-Plenty of content already - a lot of resources, items, and buildings to create.Cons:-Slow pace. The dev has already expressed he has no plans to include a 2x/3x speed option like in games such as Banished or RimWorld, however he will be including a Haste spell to speed your workers up. From what I can tell, this spell will really only be truly useful in the very first 2 or 3 days, because after that you will want to save your mana to blow up enemy spawns. So I don't think that the Haste spell will really solve much. The dev has stated higher speeds would be unnecessary because of the pace of the game, but I find myself with tons of downtime at every stage of the game. If it is a problem of implementation, I can understand, but I see no reason why an optional 2x or 3x speed button shouldn't be added.-Difficulty does not continue to scale. Now that I've done a few runs and I have a strategy for early-mid game, I'm completely ironclad and unstoppable by around day 11. More enemies will probably need to be added (remember you can always do resizes/recolors of existing sprites, nobody gets too upset about that as long as it's not rampant) that can add to more of a late game challenge.-Defense is pretty easy. All you need to do is make a large perimeter for your base and include a single choke point. Because of the enemy AI, they will walk across the entire map just to get to that choke point. I would recommend adding a certain distance threshold for enemies so that if they have to walk a certain distance to get around a wall, they will instead attack the nearest wall. This will force players to maintain multiple points of defense instead of one easily defended chokepoint.Misc suggestions:Quarries like in Banished - on rock floor areas, maybe you could add a building that allows villagers to mine a set amount of rock and iron from a 10x10 spot or however large you'd deem it. My reasoning for this is that I often run out of stone toward the end of the second year, and this would add another way of getting some. It's basically like they're hollowing out that part of the ground.Diagonal roads - just make it so that when roads are connected to another road by only the corner you use a particular diagonal-road sprite. This is for both aesthetic reasons and because diagonal roads are obviously useful given by their automatic creation by the NPCs' pathing.Alternative food sources - domesticated animals, fish.Towers that induce status effects (slow, bleed, decrease armor, etc)			"

Things will go better, as I hope.for people who dont know if they should or shouldnt..

								Pixel Castles is a fun and interesting game. It offers a very useful video tutorial for first time players or you can go straight in. It's a little hard to get going but that makes it more of a challenge, right? I am feeling puzzled however as the game was working fine until today when I tried to play it, it crashes on start up. I'm sure this is an issue that will be solved in future by the game developers and that's IF it is the game itself. I am not yet sure of the cause but if people do have the same issue it will be helpful to know :)My overall thought- A brilliant game and the perfect boredom breaker, I highly recommend.			"

								My Review so far....... The game is self is really enjoyable and you can play for hours, there is a few buildings and few different ways to go about playing the game, the only real problems is the village lagging when you get 200-300 villagers and it just gets to much for the game to handle, someone like my self i would love to expand over the whole region but i cannot because of this bug. The game is only in early access i understand that but i believe the buildings are too easily given to you, i think there should be a technology system implemented into the game, a way for science to be brought into it. Overall i love the game i think for the upcoming updates its going in the right direction and if it keeps going it can be one of the top village simulation/defence games out there. Myself i just like to keep expanding defending and creating loads of little villages to then collect for my limbo more villagers and have one central, lets say a captital region. keep up the good work witht he game its really coming together love it.

Retro-Pixel Castles is a Good Game Retro-Pixel Castles is really a nice game. I won it as part of Malletspace Studios giveaway. But, I've ended up buying this game for friends, because I want them to be part of the fun of watching this game grow. Now, here's how I've come to enjoy the game, I watche KingdomGnark play the game on the YouTube Malletspace Studios channel. It was still in very early stages (and still is, a bit) at the time, but it looked like a lot of fun. At the end of each episode of his plays, he advertised a giveaway on twitter. I participated and won.When I received the key for the game, I started playing, and I got very excited. It's a real-time strategy game, all about building a village that will survive the onslaught of zombies, skeletons, and slimes. Unfortunately, after the update InDev 12, my graphics chip could no longer support the game. I'd try starting it up and it crashed time and time again.Fast forward a few months, I get a different computer and a new nVidia graphics card. I realize that I can run the game, and am quick to download and play it. I come back to InDev 14, and wow was it a joy. I essentially rediscovered the game, and so much had changed and been added to the development, that I was playing a very fresh game. I think that the fun of watching the game grow has been the best part of Retro-Pixel Castles so far, because it is a good game, and it has a lot of potential that I'm seeing put to use. This is worth the Early Access, indefinitely.			"

Retro-Pixel Castles is one of the best buys I made in a long time and it is defintely worth the money. The gameplay is still developing and although only in development the content matches some much more expensive games in the market today. Theres something reminiscent of Towns yet completely fresh that makes Retro-Pixel Castles a joy to play. A definite must pick up for anyone that loves this genre.

								Loving it!  In an era where everyone is rushing to put out ""click like a dummy"" games, RTR takes some effort.  That's a great thing.  The solo dev is awesome at addressing concerns and working with feedback from the community.  The game is pretty good on it's own now in EA, barring a few tweaks.  Anything else added is just icing.  If you are looking to be a zombie, point and click and ""win"", you won't find it.  If you are looking for a challenge and fun, you will find it and more here.  There are two modes however, peaceful - which is as it sounds - where you don't bother with mobs.  That is fun as a builder side, you just learn the creation and transport (which I recommend starting with anyway).  Then you have survival, where monsters come for you in the night, rustling your warriors and testing your boundaries... and it's fun!			"

								Retro-Pixel Castles was the first thing I have ever funded on Kickstarter, and I am very happy to see that it made it to steam. The work the developer has put into the game so far is clearly shown and although unfinished, the game runs well, and the UI looks awesome even in its unfinished state. In addition the only crash I ever saw while testing the game before it came out here on steam was one the dev had already identified and was working on. The main concept of the game is that you cannot win, it simply gets harder and harder to survive as time passes. building choices are limited right now, and none of the planned mobs are implemented as of yet, as such I don't recomend buying the game right now unless you wish to help with bug finding and testing. Ultimately I would definitely recomend purchaseing this game when it releases.			"

								Retro Pixel Castles, High Potential.This game is perfect for a relaxed or rainy day. This is a peacful Pixely Wonderland that only you can carve by forcing villagers to work for you and grow.The best thing I find about this game is the high replayability. Allready in its EARLY stages this game is beautiful. I would defilently recommend this game to ANYONE who likes tower defence or building games. This is the kind of game I would love to see finished in perfection. What I would find as a great addition to this game is the ability for more weather at the current moment.Like Snow,Or even a Meteor shower. But all-in-all this game is great and allways keeps you on your toes as the days progress the enemies also get harder to kill,you just never know when you will be attacked or when your next villager will die.I hope this game gets finished. 11/10			"

Early Access Review
								This game is very well made. Even though it´s still in development, it looks very promising.It´s a combination of a management game and a godgame, where you have to build, maintain and protect your own village(s). And those two genres have been merged together very well in this game.I recently bought it as I saw it in the store and it caught my attention. It looked like a simple management game, indie style. I have played Banished before, and it looks a bit like it, but this game has it's own characteristics as well. You have an ""influence bar"", which acts as a mana bar. With this influence, you can cast godly spells to improve land, fireball land/enemies/enemy buildings and much more.The game itself is very simple: You start with a global map with a couple of locations where you can start your first village. When you've chosen your location, you can start building! But you have to be fast. Just like other games, the night is very dangerous. The first night will remail calm, but the second night things go down... quickly.The game has a season mechanic. You start in the spring, the easiest of all 4 seasons as food grows the quickest in this season. You have to stockpile food to make sure you can get through the summer, where food growth is significantly slower. The autumn is the second best season, where you can recover from the summer. Though not optimal, it's still good enough to re-establish your food stockpile, as the next season is the harshest: winter. Food growth is almost at a halt, so you better have some food stored. However, with your godly abilities you can grab food from over the map and drop it in the village, to make sure you'll get through winter... if you even get there.Because when playing the regular game, survival mode, so-called ""graveyards"" and ""slime spawns"" spawn quite often, spawning many enemies. Eventually a lot of the map is covered with these graveyards and when the night comes, they can assault your village. If you haven't prepared your defences before that happens, it's pretty much over (RIP me :( ).But if you want to take it easy, there is also a peaceful mode, where almost no enemies spawn. It's a good way to learn the mechanics, as it's way more forgiving if you are a bit slow. If you don't know how to play the game at first, at the main menu there's a button which redirects you to a youtube video, explaining some of the basic mechanics of the game. It's quite helpful. You'll get tips on how to make your defences as good as possible and how different defensive towers work.It has some performence issues (at least for me) when autosaving, where your screen freezes for the duration. It isn't that bad, its usually for less than a second. There isn't however a way to decrease graphics so you have to play with a lot of particles all the time. And it's a lot, because there has been a lot of attention to details, which I absolutely love.The soundtrack is cute and athmospheric. It makes this game even more cute than it already is. That, which the sometimes corky and sometimes sarcastic pop-ups when you lose a villager or at the splashart of the main menu, makes it a very cute product over all.I'd give this an 8/10. It's very cute, it shows potential. However, it is a bit repetitive as you cannot develop a lot with for example a tech-tree or something. It's more like when you can process your wood and stone, you can basically build everything, which makes it somewhat less exciting rather quick. Yet it's a good game to kill some time with. You'll fall in love with the cuteness!			"

								7/19/2016 - They're still planning on adding new things to the game, like inventories.  So if this isn't updated by the time that's added disregard or remind me to update this review!!!In it's current state I'd say yes the game is worth it.  For $10 you can go see a movie that you will enjoy for less time.  Having said that the game starts getting boring after you've built your crystillery.Suggestions for dev (not sure if this is the best place):- Chill out and take a step back from the crafting system and adding all that in.  You gotta work on some basics before forging ahead with the crafting system and additional rare resources.  Below are just a few problems that could easily be fixed:- Make controlling the builders queue easier - i.e. allow us to reassign or side-track a worker to a specific task by right clicking on the target (a right click for a building being built will automatically assign them to work on it, etc, but only if they're already a builder or whatever task is associated with the object you clicked on).  This would save so many villagers, and give me more control to survive...  from there if it becomes too easy it would just be a matter of adjusting monster values I would think.- Fix the worker pathing alrogithms because currently I cannot create a zig-zag fortress entryway of Tower Defense without my workers being unable to service my towers.  UPDATE**** this appears to be an unintentional side effect of walls not having any influence.  If you wall your structures (towers) into a tunnel before they are built your workers will forget about them because they fall outside of your zone of influence, which is dumb because obviously they ARE within your zone, but your walls are lifeless, zoneless blocks of zombie blocking goodness.  That was confusing.  I think I need to go see a therapist now.- Allow workers to alter terrain in a more advanced town.  Getting sick of having to build around mud pits, bah!- When you instruct a worker to DESTROY a resource... shouldn't that resource fall to the ground anyway instead of disappearing?Big ideas:- Expand the magic side of the game (how it's used, collected, saved, etc).   Allow for someone to differentiate a town to specialize in magic or non-magic.  Tired of waiting around for my influence bar to recharge just to get more essence to throw just a few more fireballs..			"

								I love this game for the music and the fact that you have godlike spells to assist your villagers with. It can be a challenge at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's quite fun to play with all the various maps. Learning to prioritize your buildings and harvesting and making sure you're ready for the next season ensures that you're staying on top of everything. My only complaints would be the set number of maps (a random map generator would be interesting) and my game seems to slow significantly when I hit around 120 people, but that's more likely due to my computer. I'd love to see more variety, like  more elementals, friendly/neutral mobs, more map objectives (like treasure), and some sort of light defender position for villagers (not as hardcore as a knight, but maybe something like a watchman that would be supported by a sentry tower and supplied with tools/weapons).

								A simple, but enjoyable game. It's still in need of a lot of improvements, but that's to be expected when playing early access. So far, I've been impressed by the improvment in the game mechanics and the vision that the developers have showed us for the future. Although the shift to the world map might seem trivial to a lot of people, I've found it to be quite interesting. The developers seem to be heading in a good direction with the game, and prioritize actual mechanics over pretty graphics (the exception being the the current graphic overhaul that's underway, which *is* a priority if they want to use a different resolution scale for the new buildings).I have high hopes for this game in the future.

Early Access Review
								So I picked up RPC a couple of days ago, having kept an eye on it several years back on TIGSource, and I have to say that this game is one of the best I've played in a long long time. Combining my two favourite genres, TD and RTS with a pinch of Roller Coaster Tycoon, I have so far had an absolute blast. The game starts you on an island world map with the choice of your settling point - You can even go in and look at the maps first before setting up. Once you do that, you've got to balance the livelihoods of your population whilst being besieged by armies of monsters. You begin by gathering the basics - Food and Wood, but over time becoming accustomed with a diverse collection of structures and materials. Production lines form, your civilisation grows, squeezing in between valleys and digging into the safety of bedrock, rather than risking expanding outwards. In turn, beyond your bastions, holes open in the ground in increasing number as more enemies spill onto the map, slowly colouring the minimap red. The gameplay remains perfectly in flow with a fluctuating day/night cycle and on top of which 4 seasons that constantly mix up gameplay with various weather and effects on your settlement. You really have to stock up for winter (And the first year I massively over prepared, but better safe than sorry!) HINT - MAKE AS MANY FARMS AS YOU CAN - 28 farmers was a sustainable number for me (Whilst enriching wild food collections at the same time!).Most tower defences suffer from the same issue over time that they become tedious as you perfect your strategy. The twist that has hooked me for RPC is you have the option to send units to ""limbo"", essentially a menu screen where you can dish out your settlers to a variety of different lands on the map. I spent an hour just surveying the various maps and looking for potential choke points, weighing up the different collections of resources in each area, hesitant to send my villagers to certain doom after such a firm foothold on my first settlement.To add to this, I found myself grappling with the dilemmas of logging regulation (Do I flatten the forest to supplement my bow towers with arrows, but deal with the long grow back time and pathways destroying the treeline opened up) and I found myself picking single people to inhabit my future settlement to avoid breaking up my many many married couples (170 villagers so far!) Another fantastic mechanic is the line of sight for defences - Punishing players who box themselves in by preventing them from expanding beyond their walls. There were many times where I'd tear down a couple of the inner walls to frantically assemble some lines of trenches further forwards whilst fighting off hordes of monsters then patch my defences back up before nightfall. It puts a lot more risk in expansion and forces you to avoid greediness.The game has such depth that I've sunk over half a day into the Retro Pixel Castles over the weekend. It's just such a good game! I can't put it any simpler than that, haven't felt so transfixed about a strategy game since I discovered Age of Empires 2. Admittedly, the lack of a built in tutorial is something that could do with addressing, but obviously with Early Access I'm sure it's something that'll come about in time. The video that was linked in the game did provide me with enough information to get started with, so thank you for providing that. Having said this, discovering the functions of the game over time has been quite satisfying in itself - I'm still unlocking the mysteries of essence!It's a bit of a far fetched request (Especially with the number of units and stuff going on at once, but I would adore a co-op mode for this. Either way, amazing work, and I look forward to any approaching updates for the project.			"

Early Access Review
Edit (2/17): Review is quite outdated. A lot of dev work has happened. At this point, I have no intention of revisiting the game, but I did spend the time originally to play and review, so my review stands. Such can be a consequence of long development cycles, and releasing software early. ---I *love* citybuilders and population managers. I think Gnomoria and Banished are two of my most played games on Steam with about 60 and 30 hours respectively. I put about 40 hours into Dwarf Fortress, and quite enjoyed it. While RPC desperately wants to be like these titles, it is very far off - in a bad way.First thing everybody should know is that there is no below-ground mining. Your world consists of a small-ish 'asteroid' that is one layer of ground thick, floating in space. There are frequent areas of the map that are just 'holes' where you can see the space behind the one-layer thick ground. I am certain that this strange mechanism is a result of limited money/resources/programming ability (idk), and was not intended. The allure of the games cited as inspiration (listed in first paragraph) was largely because you could take 'stuff' out of the ground and organize it above ground! When you take that away, I am significantly less interested.You cannot rotate buildings because it would take too much effort to redraw the images. I get it - prioritize developement, but this is something very basic that needs to be mentioned. It further hints at where this game is going. I would imagine these images could be done in a long weekend, am I right? I am not trying to be harsh, but potential buyers need to be aware of these things.These are the main two issues I have but there are a myriad of others such as map and individual person custimazation that I will not go into fully.There are also very few buildings at this point. Otherwise the music is quite good, and the artwork is pretty cool. This game probably was released on Early Access a bit too early. I got it for half price, and am fine with it because I want to try any and all citybuilders/population managers. To my Steam friends: if you haven't played Gnomoria or Banished yet, go for those! If you are like me and have exhausted those, this *might* quench your thirst for a bit.I don't believe any of the issues I put forth will be resolved (I mean its one guy working on this), but if they are, I will alter my review. Thanks for reading,-Ryan			"

								I play a lot of simulation and world building games. This is one of my favorites. On peaceful you can just relax and play.. On survival you'll want to murder your computer. I love that about this game. I love the godlike powers and the attachment you'll develop for your little pixle people. It is in development, but from what I've seen it has plenty of potential and is well worth the money spent. As long as development continues. BTW, if you can handle bugginess, I'd suggest the unstable mode. It is a bit buggy but it is little enough that it is worth trying it out at the least.I like the game and would definitely recommend.			"

I currently have a map that will soon be completely free of monsters due to the village spreading that far.If you think you'll like this game from looking at and reading about it, then it's definitely worth the $10.

								Day 30, first successfull game with 65 population review. The first couple times you play through, even if you watched a tutorial video, You will probably end up dieing to monsters like i did. I went in with what i thought was enough farms, and i still believe it was enough at the time. and walling myself off relatively fast with those wooden walls. Trying to create a focal tunnel for the enemies to path through using bow towers to attack. By day 5 i have lost too many villagers for the upkeep of progressing and deemed the save, a failure. It was a good 1st game learning curve. I realized that this was no simple village simulator game and that it was actually pretty hard. I thought i was helping out with my god powers when i probably wasn't doing much at all. the tutorial video said you will start by needing tons of wood, so i put 6 workers to it which i don't recommend, Maybe 0 or 1 to start off with ;)Eventually i got past the hurdle on the 3rd game, when i decided not to build wood walls, but stone walls. And not allocate any specific people to specific jobs until i had a suitable defence built. That is when i was able to slowly build things up, build every building and learn the rest of the game.As of this early access review, I can't wait to see what comes in the upcoming castle updates to further my thoughts on this  great game.

								I've been playing this game since it wasn't even in Steam. I'm one of the backers of the kickstarter campaign, and so I've seen the game development since, almost, more than a year now. When I first knew about this game, was a very poorly game, in the aspect of resources, AI, mobs, or content. God knows how many hours I've spent learning how to survive more than three days. And then the mobs appeared, first the zombies, next came the slimes, and following the skeletons. God! The skeletons, they are the most difficult enemy I've fight against in this world. One day we knew how to build towers for self-defense, we’ve got refined resources. The game accomplish very well with his original goals, it's a Rogue-like game, it's nearly impossible to survive, it's funny, and it's a very good village simulator. Actually I can say it's one of my favorite village simulator game. And on top of those reasons I think this is a good game because of the developer, he is a good guy who is implicated with his gamers community, he is one who listens to the community and their suggestions, and with those actions he is able of improve the game. So in the end, maybe it could have bugs, maybe it could be little in this moment, but even if those things are true this game is really a good purchase, and above that you are buying a game in Early Access state, with a strong set of politics of no DRM and 100% free updates. So, if you guys, think this could be a good option to spent your free time and support a great guy take advantage of one of the many times this game is in sale. "

YouTube™ Video: Takin' a Look at... Retro-Pixel Castles Again 

			Views: 384		

			We take another look at Retro-Pixel Castles. It's changed a lot since the first time we checked it out. We manage to build a small town that is trying to survive against the creatures of the night.		

Retro-Pixel Castles is a great game that's being created by great developers.In the game you have to manage a colony of people as you fight against evil zombies and creatures of the night that are trying to end your colony. You assign jobs, build buildings, and have god powers to control some things. It's just a great god game.The game is hard, but doable. The devs have made clear that they want the game to be difficult, so do keep that in mind if you're looking to pick it up. Your main issue will be making enough food for your people to survive the off seasons.The aesthetics are simple, but quite enjoyable. Everything is easy to differentiate and keep to a pretty consistent standard. The music (which is most of the games audio) is mostly good. I find that some of the tracks are annoyingly happy, feeling out of place in a difficult game, but it's never too bad.The devs are great. They have made consistent updates for the entirety of the time that I've had the game. They take the communities recommendations into account and are really making great and significant changes to the game.Overall, I can't really say much that's bad about the game except the difficulty. It's still in early access, but the game is consistently worked on and it's only getting better. This is a game that you should check out.P.S.In addition to my above video, I made a video WAY back about a year ago. If you're interested in seeing how much its changed, you can check out the older video here:

Early Access Review
								This game was good till like 50 enemies swarmed my base. Sucks starting up. I was enjoying the game till there was no way I could kill all of them. I sarted to play another game after words and one zombie was killing half my village before I could even build a Village center. Then I made a map and found out what everthing is for and haw it works. Finally I had a decent game for once. So as far as I see it you have to get as much Essence as you can so you can fight off the enemies. Hard game to start but good onces it's going. if you don't keep up then your villagers will be fighting and not do any of the work, Then you diev lol			"

								I get a lot of lag and the game is pretty basic. Buy this when there is a price reduction, not at full.As for gameplay, with the early access nature of this game its subject to get more in-depth over time, or it could become like Towns and end up being dropped.  I won't make too much of a coment and my review is subject to change as the game gets more development.Edit:While my review is subject to change, one of the things I will note to everyone reading this is that the developer seems to be really cool and looking to add more content and updates.  This is a good thing and this review may change cause of it in the future.  This is only the second time I've come across a developer wiling to respond to fed back, so while the game itself is still waiting for more tuneups, I DO reommend people consider supporting the developer, if not by buying the game, then at least by giving him a shout-out so those who are interested in seeing where his project goes do find him. ;-Dnd even few seem to want to help solve something that is to do with a gamer's hardware.I hope I can rereview this in the future and change my verdict on this game when its further along then it is right now.

								This game is perfect. It's a lot of fun. Yes, it's true that you get bored of it and stop playing it. But here's the thing: Another update, which are quite frequent, drags me back in. Yeah, it's pretty simple, but it still is awesome. Rayvolution, the dev, puts his heart and soul into this game, and it has paid off. I got this game quite a while ago, though I still find myself coming back everyonce and a while. If you really do get bored, make up a challenge, like, for example, only golem combobulators as defense. Overall, this game is pretty darn awesome. "

								The game is very good and could be feasably released as it is. I see many people comparing it to Banished - which is a fair comparison. However, in my opinion, this game has already overtaken Banished with its mechanics. Banished was released and forgotten by its developer, has no end game and no requirement to expand unless you want to go until your village collapses in on itself (though I do like the game very much and you'll probably enjoy it if you enjoy this). This game also has no end game, but it recieves updates, tweaks and there is a rapid difficulty curve with the incoming mobs that forces you to expand. Something else I've noted in the negative reviews is that NPCs fail to pick up items on the ground - which is not true. They do not pick it up immediately, but they will do so when an NPC of the appropriate job comes along and is empty handed. NPCs also do not ""cross the village"" to attack mobs on a regular basis. Some wil break off from their job when nearby a mob or fight - potentially to fight or run. In general, there is no major issue with the AI, assuming you have everything needed for it to function. The most notable frustration is that when they are attack in the middle of a task they will drop their item to fight or run. Once they calm, they are confused and it's hit or miss as to whether they'll continue their job or start again. You may want to use your Godly powers to aid them.Pros:Nice musicFunctioning AIUpgrade systemNPC progression systemSmoothe gameplayAbility to move desirable resources to another worldGodlike abilitiesExisting difficulty curveCons:Difficulty curve is very steepLack of a variety of buildings Lack of a great variety of resources to handleEasy to get mobbed by the exponential increase in monstersCannot rotate buildingsTents take up a 3x3 space when they're more suited to 2x2 <- surprisingly frustrating to me Can take a long time to rack up your numbers of boards and cut stones when the buildings are first built. They appeared to make them much faster when I didn't need them despite having logs and lumberjack shack available.			"

								I understand how this game is not for everyone, but I am simply in love with it and wish to give the developers my most sincere thanks! There are definite kinks that need to be worked out (not to say this is unplayable; far from it), but, by the amount of time the creators of this game are putting into adding conent and fixing bugs, I am sure this is a game I will keep coming back to. If you enjoy games like Black & White, Populus, or any other casual (yet simultaneously challenging) civilization-creating games, I'm sure this will be a sheer joy for you to spend time with, as it has been for me. Based simply on the amount of work that's been put into improving the games since I (admittedly, very recently) purchased it, I am thrilled to have found it and hope to see it thrive. Many thanks to the developers. Keep up the fantastic work!			"

								This game, THIS GAME! It has a lot of features soon to be added, the art style, as the name suggest, is very retro but fits it well. Especially since the developer revamped the art style from 8bit to 16bit. This game has a LOT of potential and its being fulfilled. Gameplay wise the game is challenging, but offers an easier mode. So far the only way to defend yourself is though guards and placing firebolt towers. The ammo for the firebolt tower is my favorite, enemy essences. For a game in early access this is great, still has minor flaws but slowly and effectively are being fixed.			"

								This game many fun. Is liek Mincraft but so many more features like a the game goes to nighttime after it is daytime for so long. and you have to get things like wood and stone unlike minecraft were you just punch things. this gaem is super realistic. it has features like blood and water but its not just blood. like it spreads its cool..Congratulations, you read what it would look like if a 12 year old wrote a review for this game. I will now enlighten you with my actual review. For the record, this is build 10-31-2014. Currently this game is very limited in the features. Before you ever start a game it lets you know that there is just the core game to play with a few things added. You have some maps to pick between, some of them are test maps which narrows down the ""usuable"" maps even further. When you start, you get 24 villagers and have to build your village center. To do this, you must collect wood and stone from nearby sources. Once the village center is completed you gain access to more buildings; however, this too is extremely limited. You can build storage for food, wood, and stone. There are three different sizes of houses you can build, two sizes of farms, torches for light and walls.  Walls currently serve no purpose other than to look cool and to really make that retro looking pixelated castle feel that you wanted when you bought this game.  The villagers will marry and have children which causes the need for more food and shelter. This may feel slow and boring but once you start getting around 90-100 villagers it becomes more demanding. I managed to get over 410 villagers but due to lag and food shortages, the best i could do was simply let people start dying. Despite the numerous deaths, the villagers, or vermin, were breeding out of control and continually increased in numbers until my game crashed-- it is early access after all. Currently the game simulated building a colony and watching them thrive or spew blood across the canvas as they starve to death due to your incompetence as a pathetic god figure.  Either way, this game is already fun in its current state and if what they already have announced as future plans are promises and not just ideas that are never implemented, this game will only ever get better and I anticipate its official launch.  All I ask is that saves are added so my vermin(oops, I mean, people) infested islands can be saved before the villagers feel the wrath of torment of not only being starved to death in the midst of a famine, but instead, the excruciating pain of being.... deleted.

								This game, for an early access title, is one i can support. Here are some reasons...       1: The dev adds and improves stuff vary often, and listens to the community! Have an improvment           idea/suggestion? do put them up on the forums!       2: The game itself pulls off god-game and village/city builder vary well. I've played a good few hours           to see most of it right now. While the game at the moment doesn't have a huge amount to do, you can           find yourself stuck in sandbox mod for a couple of hours, exploring the different maps, and seeing           where a good place would be to set up camp in survival (Or do like me, creat a map in your favor ;P)       3: For beeing an Early Access title, Retro-Pixel Castle has a vary low amount of bugs at the moment,           tho as mentioned before, reporting one is pretty easy! :)There's not much else to write in a review for this game, and i'm sure ain't a professional at it. But i recommend trying it out if you're interested. The price isn't unfair if you ask me!                                                                                                                                                                       xoxo -Spaxter  "

Considering the massive roadmap for the game's future, you get a lot for what you pay.			"

								As an EA game goes, this one is probably the best case scenario. The dev, Ray, is very active with his burgeoning community, and very active in creating updates, be that new content or bug fixes or optimizations. Activity is great, but it seems like he has a giant whiteboard filled with circles and arrows and charts and scribbles--I'm imagining a mad scientist--and he's following that haphazard genius plan to create his dream game, for surely that's what RPC is for him. Even so, he actively listens to his community to tweak mechanics, stats, and so forth, or even introduce entirely new ideas.I can't get enough of this game, simply because I want it to be fully completed with all the depth and craziness it will surely have in the end.Even now, hours of play under my belt, when I think I know what I'm about, I start a new map and suddenly can't seem to quell the hordes of zombies and skeletons. Because it's EA, RPC can run out of content, but that drop has steadily become smaller and smaller in the few months I've been watching and playing this game. The game, nonetheless, possesses a level of challenge that can still be surprising, even in its very unfinished state.Hop on this train! It's going to be a good ride.			"

								Early Access Review:  Even at it's simplest during development, this game has been worthwhile, and I anticipate that the developer will bring more features and changes that will improve upon the solid foundation.  While the gameplay concept is basic, the challenge of ever-increasing mobs means that the learning curve involves a lot of restarts in order to get in the rythym of pushing the amount of days before your village dies.  I'm sure others can attest to peaceful mode settings, but without a robust village dynamic, the mobs are a much needed focus at this time for me. "

								Okay so I have played 12 hours of this game. I say its a good game, in weird mixture of god game and tower defence though with limited towers which I dont mind since it is an early access game and they frequently update it.My major issue with this game is, once you hit the mark of 250+ villagers, god dang the fps just drops or freezes specially during the night time with the hoardes of zombies coming to the villages. And I couldn't do anything because of the lag. I mean the fps dropped even before 250 but it was still playable/managable so I was cool with that. But now it's got the point that even when i try to load the village it takes a long time and its kinda of unable now. Just really annoying.I have other minor issues:- The frozen water thing doesnt make sense, my villagers died of dehydration instead of starvation during winter. Like shouldnt you be able to get water from frozen lakes..? This one is dumb issue beause I guess I am trying to find logic in a game. idk you can ignore this one.- The sending resource/villagers to the Limbo influence points is a bit expensive. When you have a mass population and you want to reduce it but sending them to limbo quiet isn't too helpful since the points doesnt generated fast enough to compete with people moving in and birth rate.- The storages could do with a bit more space. I built 3 large storage, 3 nornal wood/stone storage and it still was enough. Considering they were taking the precious building slots.Hopefully they will balance out some of the things/			"

								This game has incredible potential to be the greatest god game of all time. I really hope the name is not how the dev feels about it, because this has the best ui and graphical interface for an amazing rewarding experience. I love the influence mechanic and the way its been tailored for this game. I really want there to be more subtle improvements to the townsfolk's efficiency, or general intellect by way of schools, teaching things like to lead the wounded away. Perhaps work in a way to graduate certain people to Heroes after many days of study. Maybe a tailor to make nice clothing for posher folk once better housing is acquired for honest hard workers. Maybe more magic crystal infused studies that Heroes could work on to become spellcasters in their own right. I believe that the magical and mechanical defenses are great early game mechanics. However I think that after perhaps 30 days there should forever be a very low maybe 5% chance that you get a warning that within a week a raid of some sort might appear. Giving Heroes, and perhaps some ground troops a chance to add to their kill count. All entities should tally all of their kills, even towers. Maybe tally how long people spend in any given job as well, and then if they've worked like 10 days straight they qualify for good clothing, then rarer fancy clothing or armour as their theoretical reputation might advise. On a very personal note there was always one feature missing from all god games ever. The ability to talk directly to a king. Since history has taught us that the king was gods man on earth, and his will was tantamount to that of god, why have we never been able to communicate with any of our people ever? I believe that a very wise person, or their naturally gifted offspring because posh people inbreed, could have potential to skyrocket working in a school for so long, that by the time they hit day 100 they might just have a lot of people under their influence, and perhaps its time to build a viking style throne room, banquet hall. I'm a viking personally so I envision him going to a smoke tent with some kinda shaman and then asking something stupid trivial. And then you have a choice to personally intervene, maybe kill somebody over a farm animal! Or whether to send resources that another region direly needs.  So much potential. Awesome game. I'm gonna play it till I die.			"

The developer Rayvolution updates the game a lot and is also very active in the retropixelcastles.com forum as well as on steam and twitter. The game looks great with a pixelated style and impressive particle effects. The music is a matter of taste. I personally like it, but I wouldn't buy the soundtrack extra. The game can be very intense and you will probably need to start over a lot, because the monsters like slimes, zombies and skeletons get stronger everyday and you need to become stronger and faster everytime. The game has a lot of potential and for just 10€ or even less when you buy it on sale you will have a great game that is fun from beginning to death of your last villager.			"

Also, you can make your own levels.One problem is that the monster spawn rate is WAAAAy too high and the villagers take forever to reproduce and it takes them a long time to build defenses.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is beautiful both mechanically and aesthetically, but at this point it is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hard. As soon as you start getting your perfect setup of buildings, you start to get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I've only gotten to day 11, and thats with my last villager running with a couple hords gathered behind him. At about day 7, hordes of monsters will start to appear and there is no chance of survival. Its just depressing when you see them come in and hear the repeated sounds of slaughter. Even with three fire bolt towers constantly fueled at both of my entry points, monsters would still get through or just cause a massive heap of blood and flames that would consume anything that gets in it. It really sucks :( I know that its still in development, and I'm really excited for all of the stuff thats in the drawing board, but seriously this game becomes very frustrating at a certain point because there is nothing you can do about your villagers being brutally♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by the evil masses.Some suggestions: Building priority - some way to make sure that villagers will actually build the structures they set up. I've gotten very fed up with how they'll drop all the resources at the buliding, but then just forget about it even though its the only thing queued up to build. So a firebolt tower might be fully set with resources but won't actually be usable for a whole day or two because the villagers get distracted. Maybe make sure that as soon as the last one drops resources on the building, he starts to work on it. Specific land motivation - instead of just motivating the land in a general circle, maybe motivate certain resources. Its annoying having to either destroy or wait for my villagers to eventually chop down all the trees around small patches of food that I want to expand. If you try to expand without doing this, the forested area will just overrun the food, making it useless. Healing aura towers - monsters are quite overpowered and they outnumber your villagers easily. It'd be nice to have a slight but steady flow of health to them in certain areas. So you could set up a couple towers near the points of regular conflict and it would give them a little flow of health. This, or just making the healing aura more powerful would work. After about day 8 you need to drop a minimum of two healing auras to even make a dent in the damage that monsters do to your villagers. Thus using up a lot of your influence. Differentiating between friendlies and enemy health - maybe its just me, because i'm slightly colorblind, but I have a hard time telling the difference between the health bars when theres one of those massive heaps of blood and fire. It'd be cool if the health bars were drastically different in the color, or if a colorblind mode was added so you could have complementary colors, making them complete opposites. In conclusion, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. When you get that flow of essence to your cullis gate, essence collectors, and firebolt towers... it just feels and looks amazing because theres all this power cycling through the map. Its a great way to show how everything is being fueled and refueled. After a successful night without any casualties, you feel like you did your godly job well. But its hard to get that job done because the people you rule are morons. Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend getting this game just so you can master your setup and understand whats most important. That way, once the devs to add in more complicated mechanics, you'll have all the basics completely down. Otherwise you'll just be thrown in later on with a LOT to learn. 9001/10 stars.			"

								This game has incredible potential to be the greatest god game of all time. I really hope the name is not how the dev feels about it, because this has the best ui and graphical interface for an amazing rewarding experience. I love the influence mechanic and the way its been tailored for this game. I really want there to be more subtle improvements to the townsfolk's efficiency, or general intellect by way of schools, teaching things like to lead the wounded away. Perhaps work in a way to graduate certain people to Heroes after many days of study. Maybe a tailor to make nice clothing for posher folk once better housing is acquired for honest hard workers. Maybe more magic crystal infused studies that Heroes could work on to become spellcasters in their own right. I believe that the magical and mechanical defenses are great early game mechanics. However I think that after perhaps 30 days there should forever be a very low maybe 5% chance that you get a warning that within a week a raid of some sort might appear. Giving Heroes, and perhaps some ground troops a chance to add to their kill count. All entities should tally all of their kills, even towers. Maybe tally how long people spend in any given job as well, and then if they've worked like 10 days straight they qualify for good clothing, then rarer fancy clothing or armour as their theoretical reputation might advise. On a very personal note there was always one feature missing from all god games ever. The ability to talk directly to a king. Since history has taught us that the king was gods man on earth, and his will was tantamount to that of god, why have we never been able to communicate with any of our people ever? I believe that a very wise person, or their naturally gifted offspring because posh people inbreed, could have potential to skyrocket working in a school for so long, that by the time they hit day 100 they might just have a lot of people under their influence, and perhaps its time to build a viking style throne room, banquet hall. I'm a viking personally so I envision him going to a smoke tent with some kinda shaman and then asking something stupid trivial. And then you have a choice to personally intervene, maybe kill somebody over a farm animal! Or whether to send resources that another region direly needs.  So much potential. Awesome game. I'm gonna play it till I die.			"

								The message at the begining of the game warns about not being complete but it is most definatly very playable & enjoyable in its current state.  And I see sooooooo much potential & room for so many extra things that I see & hope the Dev will add to it.  Ive already spent several hours in game & even though it is missing quite a few other features & game mechanics & other things you would want; what it does have so far is more then enough to feel satisfied with & want to keep progressing & expanding.  I had no problems with this game at all until a few hours ago when my game keeps crashing every 10-15 minutes.  I dont know if its cuz my base is too big now or what...but for now Im going to definately give this game a thumbs up as even for early access its very well done & Im sure the Dev will fix the any bugs as the game progresses.  Out of all the other games like this that are out there; early access or even a completly done game; this game is one of the few that are at the top of the list.  Being an avid gamer for about 30 years now...lol... I know a good game when I see one & if you like these kinds of games, you cant go wrong with this one & you should be most happy with what it has to offer.			"

								A very quaint (although brutally difficult) strategy game with an old school look and a refreshing nostalgia trip to the days of warcraft 1/2 and command and conquer. Expect a strong asthetic theme and challenging play across several official maps, with the opportunity for you to create your own in a fully featured editor. While the game has a lot going for it it needs to be said that the game's systems are incredibly unintuitive and require a great deal of practise to master. A lack of clear and explanatory tutorials really hurts this game.All in all, while it could be better, this game is still in beta and has a remarkably responsive dev. I fully expect to see this game become great if the dev keeps his head on straight and listens to the saner members of his/her fanbase. 8/10Ps, as a note to the dev, it would be nice to be able to insert custom maps into a world map somehow. Perhaps creating room for custom made 'campaigns' and worlds to be shared amongst the community.			"

If you like Simulator games where you direct your minions, but that's all, ti's a crapload of fun.

								This game has a lot of potential, but I wouldn't say it's worth buying yet. The tiered resources are shallow with only two tiers. The monsters escalate quickly. You have to play a few worlds to understand what you have to do and how efficient you must be. I find it to be a lot of fun, even if it does get frustrating sometimes. But I just can't recommend other people to buy it at this time.Check out a few videos on youtube from a few different gamers and see if its for you.			"

Early Access Review
								I know that this is Early Acces, but the game is in desperate need of content.All there is right now is three different resources, with their respective extractors and refinements, houses and towers. To be a village sim you might need a little more than that, honestly.You are constantly attacked by monsters, day and night, without breaks. You can't tell your villagers to defend, you can only build towers (that are inadequate for the amount of monsters you receive), and hope for some villager to try and defend and not die. Because if they die, the only way to have another villager is to give free time (aka, stop building your village defenses) to your workers and wait a loooong time before a new one is born, while in the mean time you have less defenses and even more monsters.The AI is very lackluster: building two or more buildings at a time really confuse builders, with the end result of having both of them unfinished for minutes. Gathering resource is dumb too, with villagers going for random sources instead of the nearest ones. Attacking enemies seems random too, with villagers attacking once, then starting to flee, then attacking again, then fleeing in the middle of other enemies, then dying.On the art side of things: the graphics and UI are gorgeous. The sound track is quite good, although it isn't contextual: you can have an happy and reassuring track while the village is getting slaughtered. Particle effects are really cool and really add a lot to the presentation of the game.For now I absolutely cannot recommend this game in the current state. I hope new content and new mechanics will be added to the game and the AI refined, so that this game will actually be about managing your village, not an endless cycle of building and rebuilding towers.

								This game is absolutely enthralling. I want to get back to it every second I have free time, even though I have already lost...how many was it...5 villages in only 8 hours? I seem to not be the best deity for these people...This game captivates you with its unique design and the music in the background only further emphasizes this--I feel as if I were transported back in time to when these villagers lived.Perhaps one of the best parts of this game is that it give you a very brief intro, and then throws you into the game with only the most basic knowledge--trial and error is essential to this. Not only do you consider how to manage/assign your villagers, but you also have to consider building priorities, landscape, potential areas of threat from monsters, and of course, managing your resources.In considering any downsides, the one thing I might have an issue with is that often times when I want to hover my mouse over a fight between my servants (ha) and the monsters, all I am able to see is a health bar of one person, especially if multiple entities are in the same square. All I really want is to make sure my people's health bars are still doing well. Maybe add some sort of way to view the villagers’' health bars outside of hovering the mouse over them?All in all, great game, and I will continue to try to prevent the total and inevitable destruction of my people!

								This is a fun base building game with zombie apocalypse overtones ;)  It's quite a challenging game, you really need to get started on building your food production and population from the first minute in order to survive for any decent time.  The position of your base is also critical.   It's important to try to use natural barriers (water, rocks, forests) as protection from zombies.  You can wall yourself in, but building even wooden fences can take a decent amount of resources and time. The game/developer seems to be of the opinion that losing should be ""fun"".  In other words it's a base builder game in the sprit of roguelikes such as Dwarf Fortress.  It's far easier to just pick up and play than most roguelikes, but if you don't like that style of game you may struggle with this.   Then again, if you haven't tried a similar game before, this would be a great intro. It's still in early access, so some of the building choices are a bit limited, but the developer seems to be adding features every few weeks which is great.  A few suggestions:An in game legend (easily accessible), with text explaining each of the small icons (emoticons) that appear above villagers and enemies would be handy.Needs a pause option.Maybe a bit more personality for the villagers and enemies would be nice.      This is a fun game and has the potential to be even better.			"

Early Access Review
								And I'm buying Raymond's next game, because he did so damn well!Early Access Performance 10/10 ; Gameplay 8/10 and climbing ; Gleeful Godly Gameplay 9/10 ; Retro 10/10Normally, I expect Dev's to tick down a list to completion and general compatability, not spend time updating and cooroborating with the community. Updates that matter with great changelogs and an idea of what the hell is going on in what is essentially my investment. At a brisque pace none the less. Gameplay:  It's fun to be God, but still challenging in the face of a survival world.  "

It seems there is already enough content to get a good amount of enjoyment out of this game, while the developer's plans (that he actively talks about and makes constant progress on) give real hope for a fantastic game in the future. Great game to pick up if you like watching as a game improves over time.			"

								The game is challenging, If you dont get a decent amount of territory and defences set up quick enough; Monsters tear through your buildings and people like paper. Down goes your village. But what about the food? Spend too much time worrying about defences and you forget to feed your people. Down goes the village. Forget to build homes or not enough? People start dying of Hypo/Hyper-thermia. Down goes the village...Albiet slowly but eventually.I loved RTS' and I loved challenging games. I also loved Towns and Dwarf fortress! Hope this games gets far and has a good run through early access!Shame that the villagers are stupid enough to build the walls so they are outside of the village.BUTSTILL. Great game, Buy it now. :)-Rayllumen			"

Early Access Review
								Updated review to be based on Indev 13 unstable 4. Unfortunately I must still leave the review as it is, while the patch has gone a ways towards balancing the game but has also taken a step back in many aspects it still needs more work.I know this is a EA game and I really hope things improve down the road, but at the current point I can not recommend this game as even a game.AI Is glitched, you still have to micromanage how much wood you set to harvest and how much stone you set to harvest as attempting to build multiple buildings leads to all the buildings tending to have all their stone or all their wood delivered, instead of balancing the delivery,the bigger issue is that if your building multiple buildings it will attempt to deliver the last piece of stone but get distracted by a zombie and drop the stone, after that the builder will then go and start working on the other building leaving the building uncompleted for a fair while, sometimes even until the other building is finished.Death Trap is still there and even worse since the removal of essence generation from the towers and collectors, now you can't even build effective defences, to even get defences in place you have to build all 3 havesting camps, collect and build the upgraded resources and then finally can build defences, but those are useless without collectors, you build those and you have to continually stock them with crystals, all that takes time away from building the essentials like food and housing.  Towers can't even seem to fire over walls which is major source of annoyance... You either limit your towers ability to fire or you have no way of containing your viliagers who will wander out of town for no reason and just idle in ""zombie land""Indev 13 Stable 4 must be substantially bugged, change notes state that spawns have been substantially reduced yet somehow I got a hoard of 14 !! zombies raiding my tower... on DAY 2! not even end of day but end of dawn.Villagers are smarter but still not there, as above they will walk away from the town or the farthest building into the middle of no where and just idle there... until they see a zombie and then they will rush to it, and then rush to the next and the next and the next... until they die.  Yes they will run away but that only lasts a couple steps and then they will see a zombie and run and attack, it's a game of ping pong now with the run, attack, run, attack action... the game really needs a way to contain the villagers, either walls with gates or a ""no go"" zone that you can mark villagers to not cross.Defence buildings are useless, zombies heal faster then the buildings can regenerate, spawn faster then the buildings can regenerate and it appears the more you build, the more zombies you bring.Once you mark a building to be built you can't pause it (Being worked on but the button doesn't work still), you can't lower it in the queue and you can't cancel it, you can only dismantle it, instant if nothing was delivered to the building, but if the building had even 1 item delivered to it a builder has to go to the building to dismantle it... Looking forward to the next patch but the game is still too unbalanced to be enjoyable			"

								In the current state this game is incredibly frustrating to play.I am a huge fan of games like Gnomoria, Banished, and Rimworld but this game is nothing like those other than the presence of villagers and buildings. I tried for 4 painful hours to make this not seem like what it is, which is a glorified tower defence game. The spells are absolute garbage. Want to help your villagers defeat waves of mobs? Well you can either burn every ♥♥♥♥ing thing around your cursor, or call down a meteor and blow up then burn every ♥♥♥♥ing thing around your cursor.I hope there is a drastic rework to this game.			"

								Tedious. It's nothing like Dwarf Fortress as it claims to be inspired upon. You cannot build freely. Buildings are preset, nothing creative at all. It is a low-budget version of Banished or a slow-paced tower defense. Not recommended at all.In reply to @Versionbest:The developer explained the limitations very well. I bought this game hoping it can be a roguelike type of village management like Dwarf Fortress, but it turned out to be more of a tower defense RTS at the current state. You build a village - attract monsters - defend and expand the village. That's about it.I like that the player is sort of a god / guardian to the people. You can drag&drop villagers and critters around, and cast a limited selection of magic in the game. This reminds me of older games like Black & White. However, I feel the current game lacks an objective. I like that they changed the name to Rise to Ruins, which is literally the objective of RL games like Rimworld or Dwarf Fortress, but this game currently is pretty much just about expanding and defending a village. Every run of the game is pretty much the same so it gets boring quickly once you have tried all of the buildings.			"

								Enjoyable game, similar to Dwarf Fortress for me, but with a job/person interface with useful feedback. The god-style tools also let you 'micromanage' small but important things you may have overlooked until it it too late to use your minions to resolve, like weaking an impending hoard or growing emergency food.

								This game was not necessarily for me, but it might be for you if you enjoy lording over the pixel like peoples of Rise to Ruin. Every night it seems as though the indomitable hordes get more powerful, more of my citizen are eaten or fall to their doom in a similar way. Building things and progressing is relatively straight forward, gathering power to cast powerful spells, sending the pixel plebs out to gather wood and stone for houses, and just generally attempting to survive.I personally did not find the learning curve to be very steep; you create a continent, pick a starting place with its own bonuses and drawbacks, and then to go forth into the unknown. There are better titles out there that do a better job of God-like control, this felt a bit too tedious for my liking.Oh well.			"

								Previously I had left a negative review for this game, but a year went by and the developer entreated me to try again now that many of the negatives in my review have been addressed.  I am very happy to announce that the game is SOOO much better, and that at the present moment, I don't really have any complaints about the present version of the game, except that it is sans husbandry of any sort, which I feel would be the next step in a game like this.Its a very chill sort of roguelike, in my experience.All in all, a decent buy for what they're asking, with attentive and diligent developers.  I would reccomend this, because I anticipate it becoming much better when it is already a good game.			"

								One of, if not my favourite game. Can't wait to see what the dev does with this. Its one guy btw. And Rayvolution (the dev) has chosen to use LWJGL. Which is a Java game library :) As a Java guy myself this really peaked my interest when almost all games that come out these days are cut, copy, paste, Unity crap. This guy is clearly a REAL developer, not just some kid who knows his way around the unity forum to download other people scripts and hoping to get rich on Steam.The LWJGL isnt some pre build engine doing a lot of the work for you, no, you have to do 99.9% of the work yourself. This fills me with massive amounts of trust for this dev. Couple this with the content he knocks out on a weekly basis and you see a rock solid candidate for Early Access title of the year :)It's titles like this the Early Access system WAS made for.-------------------------------------------------------------------edit (08/10/2015)The dev has been working really hard on this, and its getting updated what seems like every day, or every week :) TONS of new stuff to do.-------------------------------------------------------------------edit (13/12/2015)Another amazing update. The whole tileset used in game has been upgraded from 8x8 to 16x16. and believe me its a massive improvement.I was blown away by the level of detail now on the maps (its still pixels though obviously).The dev has shown time and time again he is dedicated to the future of this title.-------------------------------------------------------------------			"

								Fun game if you enjoy the base building type of games.  (I do so I loved this game.)  For the most part, the gameplay and buildings are fairly straightforward.  There's definitely a learning curve to this game, though.  You will most likely have to start over at least a couple times. However, once you figure out your strategy and build a solid defence, the only struggle may be to have enough food during the winter.  As it's not finished yet, the game is still lacking, but I got 15 hours of good gameplay out of this game in it's current state. (Owned it for about a week as I write this).  I got it on sale for about $5 which is already well worth the price even without the fact that it will be updated.  My personal check for games is that it's, at least, satisfactory if it provides enough fun game play for one hour for every dollar it cost.  (So 3 hours/dollar so far is pretty good.)Quick tips if you want them:-Focus on a good defense ASAP. There's always room for improvement. Like dont even worry about having all the necessary housing.  You start in spring so the villagers can go a few nights outside.  Just build a good wall and defense towers (and ammo supply) ,  And use natural barriers to your adventure (forests and mountains.)-Don't spready yourself thin, too fast.  You start off with only so many people.  If you start building and employing all the different manufacturing and refining buildings, Your people will be spread thin among all them and it'll take forever to get more important things dones.-Edges to waters aren't as defensive as you think.  If you build a wall ending perpendicular to a body of water, monsters can still swim around the edge (Depending on what the quickest path is.)-Destroy spawners asap.  Use the Fireball power on any spawners that pop up (red squares on minimap).  You don't need to destroy them completely.  If you hit them, they'll slowly burn until they're destroyed (unless it starts to rain.)			"

								Very bare bone game. Not much to do. It basically seems monsters are just there to try to wipe you out before you manage to build everything possible.Several very basic things are still unimplemented. I had lots of weapons for instance, but no way of recruiting soldiers or guards or make other workers pick up weapons.I will check back in a year and see if it is better. For now, wait and see.			"

								Suffers from a an obtuse, cluttered interface that feels more like a version of Excel from the 90s than a game. There's some mid-game drag; a certain lack of choices that decrease flexibility.However, the core mechanics are fun. I feel this game has a lot of promise.			"

								This is a great game. It's very addictive in the just 5 more minutes sense. Even though the game is in early access, the content is plentiful with steady updates. The developer is very active in community and works with community feedback. The price is more than fair and if you like management, village building or semi-tower defense games  Rise to ruins is highly recommended.			"

								It's an alright game, but after you get past the first year there is nothing to do. Suggestions: more control over the villagersplaces that you can raid more buildingsmore spells other than fire (maybe a system where you have to fight certain monsters with certain spells)a way to create terrain animals traderssome kind of hero that you can completely control and make a bunch of different items for maybe the hero could lead an army of people to fight or somethingalso noticed that the villagers don't need water, but people usually need water. So maybe some kind of water system?idk just some ideas  "

								This is a type of game that challenges you in ways you never thought of.Your people need food and water to survive, and to begin with this might not seem too much of a challenge but fret not, you're still on day 1. Day 2 people start getting thirsty and you still have some way to go before that can be taken care of properly. usually on day 3 people die of dehyration or by monsters roaming into your village.The learining curve is quite steep and you evenually learn to take some time to learn the speed of the game. (by dying and trying again) Personally i've reached autumn and things are looking somewhat good, my peeps haven't died from thirst in the last 3 days. So most things are going quite good. But for now let's go over the pro's and con'sPro's:Game is fun and fluent to playNice music to lull to while you playChallenging gameplay of village simulating and tower defence (don't make the maze out of towers)Godlike fireball rainCon'slearning curve is steeper than mount everest.people don't mate when they're busy,Food and water(mainly) is a ♥♥♥♥♥paths everywhereoverrun by monsters sooo many times....10/10 will be overrun again at lightningstrike.

								I like this game, so Im probably masochist or something. :)Im not going to recommend this. It is extremely unforgiving, especially for new players, almost unplayable without watching some tutorials. If you start wrong you basicaly lose in 3 days.Units AI is not very good, witch makes your life easier, while defending, but not so easy, when your villager travels half map away, to take carrot you picked manually 3 seconds after the villager departed or when he is boiled alive, while working, because cool down in his house for while, is way too much effort.It runs on Java. If you try using spells in short succession its going to lag your game for about 10 seconds every time. Java is garbage and only reason, it still exist is minecraft.With settings: survival (very difficult so far), peaceful (no monsters) and creative, it is game for limited audience.			"

								Don't let the simple non-isometric graphic throw you off, this is both a cute game and one that has some gameplay depths. It reminds me of old-school Populus, the original, and an rpg'ish city building game with what seems like serious obstacles (and enemies) to overcome. Overall I've had very fun so far (and almost burned my food, was just going to ""do one quick little thing"" in the game, time flies!). That said, the game is still in early access and there is both room for, and plans for lots more for the game.			"

								Ok, it seems the game is in development and could be buggy at times. That's what happened with my first attempt to pay it. It made me actually write the review due to my frustration - I like the concept and the art style of the game and I badly wanted to play it when I bought it. But I ecived some strange crash message about Java Error of a kind.My firstthouhg was to report a bug but I couldn't find how to do it (and obviously I also missed the forums as an option ;) ). This made me post a negtive review hoping it will grab someones attention (yep, not the fairest way to deal with an indi dev but still better than refund).I'm glad I get a very fast response asking for the bug. Which made me re-install the game... which now just starts normally (damn, sometimes you need to uninstall and re-install the game to fix it) so I cant recreate the bug but I'm happy the game is running normally now.The game is definitey proissing with lots of options in it. The UI is not the friendliest one but the tutorial popups are quite helpful and you don't feel lost with so many controls.So my first encounter with the game was harsh but once I manage to start it I like what I see and feel and it is promissing even more.This is a first impression comment (not a real review) and I will add my real one after I put some more hours in the game - for now just wnated to change my recommendation to positive while also warnig of this potential bug I have experienced.

								Building your base feels like a grind, you are always waiting for your villagers to catch up and finish a build, sometimes your villagers wander off and leave something half finished. It always feels like you are waiting for the action to start, you need to build several buildings in order to make the most basic defense, then most of the time your villagers do the fighting, then they never build anything because they are busy fighting. It's a great concept, with nice retro graphics, but the gameplay feels so unsatifying, clunky, and with a combat system that doesn't leave you feeling like you killed anything.			"

								Tower DefenseThat is what the game is. At the end of the day your main goal is to make a path with walls for the enemies to run down, and line that path with things that do damage to them. Sure there are some village sim concepts, and you can't save the game except when you exit. So I suppose that makes it rogue-like. What you really end up with is a glorified tower defense game. There is nothing wrong with that, but I wish that was part of the description. ""If you could imagine a roguelike village sim, that's what this game is all about!"" That doesn't mention tower defense. This reminds me a bit of the mistake I made by purchasing Secrets of Grindea. It acted like it was one type of game, but when the time came for it to deliver on a good boss and engaging gameplay, it used bullet-hell shooter mechanics as a clutch. It was a good dream, but short lived.			"

								This game's place as an 'early access game' is very clear.  While I didn't experience any bugs, I didn't experience any fun either.  There's no tutorial even if there are hints when you first start the game ... the view is either too close and you get blockiness galore or too far and you can't really see anything.  Buildings can't be rotated to fit into locations, you seemingly have to manually control (for a god?) whether or not people are working (so they don't get unhappy) ... and if you don't have a starting location near rocks, wood, food, and water, you're pretty much screwed (excluding most of the map for settlement; no means to use one resource to compensate for another, like exclusively using stone instead of wood, at a cost of time, to build structures).While I'm sure to get the AI working must have been terribly difficult, it doesn't pass through to make the game enjoyable at this stage.

								It's not complete enough. It feels like your people dont know how to do anything and it's hard to make them do what you want. Maybe buy later on, but I recommend just buying Banished instead.			"

								Ok so.  This game has a lot of potential but it has a realllllly slow pace.  It needs a global speedup real bad.  I read that the game dev said he doesn't think that a speed up option needs to be implemented because players will have too much to do but I dont find that to be true.  I played starcraft at a high level and I find that I am often watching a movie while waiting for my workers to do stuff.  Really cool concept but games take FOREVER.			"

								It's pretty bad actually. I love games where you have to build something but this is pretty boring. Everything takes forever and there is no real feeling of progress or accomplishment. After some time you have finished your first settlement with stone walls all around and just a tiny gap for the monsters to come in (otherwise they will just attack some random wall). A lengthy path behind it for all your towers to shot at them while they try to get to your stuff. While you might have been perfectly fine the last night they are gonna storm in the next and steamroll everything and you are totally ♥♥♥♥ed and the game is over. That and making sure your villagers don't starve to death.Pros:- looks interestingCons:- slow- boring			"

								An interesting idea and while it may be good in the future it has some frustrating flaws that just make it simply not fun right now.   The AI for one is frustrating, there is no way to set priorities so you're forced to place one build order at a time, and un-mark things from being harvested so your guys dont sit there harvesting wood forever ignoring the stone you need to finish building your defenses, it also has a weird love of wandering off and suiciding into large groups of zombies, and there doesnt seem to be any way to keep them from doing this unless they constantly have a build order, which unfortunately prevents you from raising your population as it's suicide to not have everyone building or harvesting at all times. My second primary frustration in currently implemented features is the limited ammo on your only base defense, the fire towers, they run out of ammo so quickly even when backed up by an essence collector that they're borderline useless, even a large group of them has a hard time taking down a single zombie. While you can build a full wall around your base and use build orders to help make sure all your guys are trapped inside instead of outside it will crash the game as the zombie buildup hurts performance badly if you're not constantly killing them.

								Not yet.Font is painful. Cannot mute the music on launch - and the music is bad and loud. Cannot rotate structures and the dev thinks this is not very important. Seemingly cannot exit the game back to the main menu - 10 minutes of looking around and I finally hit alt-f4.The hints that stand in the place of a tutorial are woefully inadequate. You're trying to build a structure, eg, and you need to wait 20 minutes for the appropriate hint to show up to tell you how to acquire one of the resources.I like the aesthetic, and I'm a huge DF and Banished player, but this one needs more cooking.

								Good ideas but the game feels not ready to me and just is no fun after few hours.The game seems to be rather limited in the number of Objects to build. Even the few objects seem to be ""permutations"" of each other an contain functions of other buildings. I personally did not like that it seems to be rather ""fighting"" based (zombies etc.) and  i would rather like to see economy of my village grow and spend more time on that... As i said, the idea looks nice but i would have it rather in the dwarf fortress direction (which is rather based in economy than fighting). I did not want to bash your game and will definitely come back to reevaluate it, but currently i would not recommend it, because everyting seems rather limited and not like its worth 10 bucks. No offense but currently i would say that there are free games that give you the same fun and depth and the game rather seems like something you would get for free on a pc-magazine (back in the old days when they gave you CDs with it). An example that would be comparable from the style is clonk which is roughly 10 years old ! Another (also free) example is the latter named dwarf fortress which seems like 10 time the depth of this game.I know that it is hard to develop a game and please dont get this review wrong ! But if you sell a product for money you have to stand up for it no matter if its early access. And my personal opinion is, that in early access the product should not develop much from the content, but early access is for getting the flaws and small bugs out of the game. Not to actually develop it. I know that most game developers do it like this, which does not make it right. This particular game has a lot of potential, but currently i would not spend money on this.Its easy to only beef about something without giving advice on how i would like to see it develop. An example: Crepper world evermore. The first two parts were completely free and the third part came to steam without any early access thing and for a decent price. I personally experience it as a ripoff if the content of the game is developed in the (paid) early access since that is not what it is about. The early access is for fine-tuning the game and get some feedback from the comunity. Its about giving the game its last 5-10% not its last 50%. Sorry that all of my all of my bottled-up displeasure about seemingly half-ready games got into this review. I hope that you get point.			"

As of right now, its just not good enough.- Needs more buildings (should be able to add 1 every week).- Needs more mobs (again 1 per week should be easy to achieve)- Needs equipment for guards- Needs more towers (one that uses wood, and one that uses stone?)- The graphics are just to hard on the eyes, its needs an entire graphics revamp.

								For those looking at the Early Access lable and wondering if this is ever going to be finished, this game is constantly updated, new mechanics added with each update, no update with DRM, and no love in your updates. Yeah, no love. You might as well have your villagers go on blind dates with the local undead with how much they procreation they do themselves. So if you were getting this game for the 8-bit pornagraphy, sorry, the villagers never feel to be in the mood.But the developer has a lot of love for this game. It's more like a parent-child kind of love, so if you're into that kind of thing...			"

								now that I have played the game and have become more acquainted with it I can create a list of things I like a lot and things i would like to see changed (people reading this review please see that this is all in my personal preference and is not to be taken as a review from a professional)-	Really cool stuff* The game has a grate retro feel and even though it is incomplete the stable version feels solid * The game is quite challenging and even though certain things might feel unbalanced at the beginning as you become an experienced player they you begin to understand way they are that way* The pixel art is great to look at* The programmer is truly interested in you opinion and is relivily quick to respond to your feedback (Way to go programmer! I respect you!)- Not so cool stuff* Probably my biggest complaint with the game is that when your units are fighting monsters it is very hard to see which is your health bar and which is the opponents (perhaps you could have a hot key or something to toggle on and off opponent hp bars or an option for a symbol when one of your units health gets below 25%)* The only other complaint I have is wood becomes almost quite useless in later game and that a larger need for would in late game should be implemented-	Cool stuff I would like to see * A way to clearly see when it is your unit that is getting low helth (preferably at a quick glance)* More types of building ;)* God powers that boost fighting abilities of your units * More types of opponents (sum with specialties like necromancer that summons skeletons or something)* Quests or goals to accomplish			"

								Retro-pixel Castles is a neat little game where you have to build a village whilst defending it from creatures like zombies and skeletons. While it is a very good game to pass the time, it does get a little repetitive and boring. I found my first game quite difficult to understand how everything works, but after a while I figured it out. Unfortunately, by the time I've started building the most advanced structures the enemies are so strong and quantitive that my village is ripped apart pretty quickly.The game is only in early access, and it looks promising. The pixel graphics are very neat and the music is very fitting for the game. I'm sure as the game is developed further it will include more variety and keep your attention for a longer period of time. I actually spent about 5 hours today playing this continually, and although a little bored towards the end did not want to stop until the game was fnished and my village was destroyed.In it's current state it's a fun little game to play to pass the time, but I'm sure it'll be improved to keep your interest for longer.

								I remember buying this game while it was on sale since it was an early access game, but after sinking about 22 hours I regret not being able to pay the full price so that I can support the dev. That being said there are various pros and cons with RPCPros:- Graphics: This is a more personally pro for me, but I love the graphics on this game. The retro style is easy on the eyes and it's not hard to differentiate various things. That being said, if you expect crazy graphics from this game, this ain't the game for you- Controls: The controls are very easy to learn and get used to. Granted, I would like more hotkeys for various buildings/spells but I'm sure that they'll be implemented later on. Nonetheless, the controls are easy to learn and master- UI: The information that you need are so easily presented/accessible that you can see whatever you want either immediately or with a few clicks- AI: Except for a few hicks, the AI is pretty solid. Your workers will prioritize the buildings without fail and your guards will defend as best as they can. There really hasn't been a point where I've raged because of silly AICons:- Long Term Playability: The only real problem that I have with RPC is the lack of content in the late game. Once you're able to get to the late game harvesting buildings, there's really nothing else to do. However, I see this as a short term problem as this game is early access and from what I can gather from the dev's plans, this issue may be resolved- Difficulty: Similar to the problem above, once you get to the late game there really isn't anything that can threaten you. Is it impossible to fail, no. In fact, if there is a huge wave of monsters, you can and will fail through either poor management of spells or poor AI. However, as stated before this is mostly short term as this is early access and could be fixed through variety or increase in difficultyOverall: RPC is a great game, its retro style graphics and simplistic menus can lead towards hours of enjoyable gameplay. However, the lack of late game buildings/progression as well as the lack of difficulty past the initial phase of gameplay does bring the game down a lot. There has been quite some times where I would be bored since there was no new goal for me to reach or no new threat for me to fear. However, if these issues were to be fixed, this game would be extremely enjoyable and challenging. "

								*FYI - original question has been addressed quickly - changed form negative to positive review - thank you Mr. Dev!*Alright, well first of all, RPC stands for Remote Procedure Call(from website), yet I cannot create my account, therefore can't figure out how to contact Mr. Dev,With that out of the way, I love the game and have spend around 4 hours on it already, but it's a thumbs down(for now):  Came back on Steam to get more info, and find out from description that the game cannot be won...Now, although the concept is kind of fun, I want to point out that if I would have seen this, it would have be a no sale for me, right off the bat.  Suggestion:  maybe two modes - 'Story'(or something else) and 'Endless' (Many games include those already).  I'd definitely be a happy camper...I mean, not being able to beat a game is kind of fun, but seeing the map layout and the fact that you can transfer untis and what not to other locations does show a lot of potential - but I'm not willing to build for 20+ hours only to see it swarmed by a horde of mini-aombies......and, well, I don't know what RPC could ever mean, other than the programming term...frustrating!  :)			"

								Thumbs up for concept and game direction.  I wish I could play more but at this time I am unable unless the UI is addressed.  (future update?)  The UI icons, menus, text, and overall style is entirely too small to play long periods of time for people with moderate to poor vision.  Perhaps if you sat with your nose to your computer screen it would be better or perhaps I just haven't found a workaround yet.  But as it stands right now they are just too small on a 1920x1080 display screen.			"

								Well, I had to rereview this after a year of waiting for the game to get out of SUPER EARLY ACCESS and now that it is, i can say this game is definitely worth 10 dollars. it wouldn't be worth 15 right now; but there are other features still down the pike; and to the best of my knowledge the 10 dollar price is here to stay. this is worth it.

Early Access Review
								Summary: If you enjoy dwarf fortress, city builders, or god sims this game may be for you.I saw it a while ago and thought it looked interesting so I put it on my wishlist. Got a notification telling me about the (current sale) price of 5 dollars. Thought why the hell not.I skipped over the tutorial video because I didn't feel like watching it, so I mostly learned from experimenting and reading the tool tips that would pop up. Certain game mechanics were pretty straight forward, others seemed to be slightly confusing or not explained very well.Easy to grasp: Trees make wood, you chop trees, you get wood.Confused for the first time playing: Farms make food, but you have to gather food to plant in them? First thought that the farms just made food so I wouldn't have to scavange what was on the map, but I realized I was mistaken when my villagers began starving to death.Another example of something not explained were the ""Ancient Radiance Pools"", which I had to google to figure out what they did and decided that I wanted to destroy them. Was it a good idea? Who knows, what they really do and their purpose still isn't 100% clear.But pretty much all of these things can be fixed or adjusted along the way because this IS an early access game. After a good five hours of playing I feel that my village is mostly complete. There are still things that I need to build or modify to make it feel complete, but I am not afraid of monster invasions, starving to death, or homelessness (However winter is coming...).Overall I have enjoyed what the game has to offer so far and will mostly continue to play it until I burn myself out on it and then pick it up when the next major patch is released. The dev says they will not charge for or release any support DLC for the game, but in this day and age I don't trust anyone anymore. None the less, I look forward to seeing how the game will develop. *And if you're reading this while it's on sale, five dollars is a pretty good deal for what is currently a fun and cute little god-sim-villager-building-RTS-defense game.*			"

								I purchased this in sale for less than £4. Still in beta but fully playable and in my opinion fun (especially for the price). Essentially similar to a tower defence game but also with town building (settlers) and god powers (populous). The game has different modes but the base survival mode sees your settlement constanly attacked by monsters (more at night) so you have to balance keeping your people alive and happy (for god powers) vs building the town and defences. The pace of the game is quite fast and the monsters get stronger and more numerous seemingly with time. Your no.1 resourse is your people who if looked after and fed will breed and increase your population (lots will die to monsters though!) and also feed your god powers. It works well and the balance is good for such an early game. For the price give it a try if you like thse kinds of game.			"

								Seemed like a lovely little game, but in the current Early Access state you quickly realize there are some flaws. Once work-stealing is implemented things might improve drastically. Anyway, there is a review by ""ZëL"" here that very accurately describes my thoughts on the game, so I won't repeat what they said. For $5 I had fun trying it out, but won't play it again until it releases in a ""final"" version; however, I can say that I am looking forward to revisiting this game in a year.Do I recommend this game at $10 in the current state? NO.Would I recommend this game at $5-10 in a year if it keeps improving? YES.			"

								This game is a great time passer. Ive put roughly 30 hrs into this game at the moment, and i highly recommend. The game can seem a bit overwelming and confusing at first, but highly worth it. The price is low and probably because of the lack of contact. (understandably, because it is still in developpement). Once I strated playing this game i nver wanted to stop. The only thing That took some getting use to was the pixel graphics, but once you get over that and start playing the game for its content, It will leave you craving more. I hope in the future there will be more water based buildings, and an easier source of food.Over all i commend the developer(s) for this fantastic early access. I hope this game goes a long way.

								How may I put this. God simulator, prepare to cry edition. OR Pixel village manager 2014+2: I can't figure out how to winI cannot state how much I have fallen in love with this game. Starting out you're like, okay, pretty intuitive gameplay, build this build that, finish that building. Oh night time came, cool. Then Day 2 starts.Day 2 and onward, it's no longer a sandbox, it's a fight for survival. Do you build walls or do you build towers? Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ I forgot to build a bowery. RIP 4 villagers.  Then comes summer. Prepare to lose some people if you're trying to rebuild. Night time comes and you're like ""oh I'll be fine"" then the monsters come. LOTS of them.  TL;DR: This game gives you false hope then rips the joy from your hands like a bully taking candy from a fat kid.11/10 would play god again "

								Retro-pixel Castles is a neat little game where you have to build a village whilst defending it from creatures like zombies and skeletons. While it is a very good game to pass the time, it does get a little repetitive and boring. I found my first game quite difficult to understand how everything works, but after a while I figured it out. Unfortunately, by the time I've started building the most advanced structures the enemies are so strong and quantitive that my village is ripped apart pretty quickly.The game is only in early access, and it looks promising. The pixel graphics are very neat and the music is very fitting for the game. I'm sure as the game is developed further it will include more variety and keep your attention for a longer period of time. I actually spent about 5 hours today playing this continually, and although a little bored towards the end did not want to stop until the game was fnished and my village was destroyed.In it's current state it's a fun little game to play to pass the time, but I'm sure it'll be improved to keep your interest for longer.

Early Access Review
								I enjoyed the first 30 hours of this game in a binge, struggling to learn the mechanics to stave off hunger or dehydration for my villagers, and defending the town from mobs.  Now surviving several winters, I am impressed with the engine feed/stock dynamics, the balancing a complex system as strategy feels satisfactory and time-pressured.  Losing track of many hours of the day is a sign of good enjoyment for this game.  The particle animations and amiga-like pixel art are also super and pleasing.Gameplay reminds of other games like the original Warcraft, dwarf fortress, command & conquer, castles, and simcity classic. All great titles!At this time, I'm not so sure that the ""late game"" -- cross-pollinating to more difficult territories -- will keep me interested to play much longer, as there isn't any kind of reward in sight. I am hopeful as an early access game that the end-game will become more compelling and rewarding at time of release.  Maybe by introduction of unique map features for each village, or some kind of overall crusading plot. I look forward to development updates and highly recommend this title.			"

								Survive a harsh world with only the strength of your settler’s backs, well not really.RPC has many layers to it. It manages to bridge game elements like god-like, tower defense and city-building and survival into one game and it does so with great finesse. To this day the game is not finished and this will have an impact on the amount of time one can enjoy playing it. Once you figure out how to survive and which strategy will make your village prosper the game does not provide more challenge. However this is surely something that will be tackled with additional content and from what I can gather the dev is devoted. Buy this game and have a moment of fun (it is certainly worth it)! Then wait to see what it will become. I have no doubt it will be great.			"

								The game is really cool and highly addictive, the only problem is that it lacks a sort of clear indicator as to how well you're handling resource management until your peons are dying of hunger or are freezing to death. Additionally, once you hit around 500 people the game starts to lag heavily. The first 3 hours consist of learning how to play the game correctly and the last hour is trying to avoid doing things that slow down the computer too much until it can't continue.			"

								Early access games have received a lot of attention lately both good and bad.  Some people are disappointed if a game doesn't turn out as they'd hoped, others are excited to be an active part of game development.  I played through the indev 23b version of this game and it is one of the best early access games I've tried yet!  This is because it is already fun, and the developer (Rayvolution) is bar none the absolute most active developer when it comes to communicating.  Seriously, check out any single forum post and most of the reviews, there will be a thoughtful and thorough comment from Rayvolution.Even incomplete, the game is awesome.  After multiple failed villages I finally figured out how to (barely) be successful.  After claiming the majority of the map, my villagers had nothing to do and massive amounts of housing and resources, and they all decided to start babymakin.  My population exploded from around 100 to around 280 in a season or two, and  summer approached.  Knowing that during this barren season my entire village would starve, I began zapping villagers as fast as I could into limbo (where they could survive) leaving behind all earthly posessions.  To this day I am in a race against time, zapping villagers at not-quite the rate of their reproduction as they continually starve to death.  I know that this isn't exactly how the game was designed to play, but it is still fun to just imagine the stories of these little pixelguys as they struggle under the inpet leadership of their god.  Varied and unpredictable scenarios like this play out all the time and make it a real thrill!			"

								This is an awesome game!!! The game is still in development, so it needs a little balancing and a bunch of other stuff, but it is an awesome game already! Survival mode is quite difficult, as it should be, but gives a fair challenge, so you have to be really good to actually survive. Peaceful mode is a good way to practice, and learn the game mechanics.It kind of gives me a RuneScape-ish feeling, when it still used to be fun, because of the old graphics and the awesome midi soundtrack. :) I bought it a few days ago and I already put 21 hours in the game, it is very captivating! :DDefinitely worth every penny, even without a discount!

Early Access Review
								The game is still in early access and I can tell the devs are putting a decent amount of work in order to improve the game but 10$ is what we should be paying for the full game unless we have at least double the ingame content - I hope they will take that in consideration.The game is a mix of tower defense and city building. You do not directly control your villagers but 'guide' them to get the structures built. As you can see, I put in a decent amount of time considering the how long I bought the game. I'd say if you do not have the patience to keep restarting a few times, this game might not be for you. If you have managed to survive past 3 seasons you will realize there is not much to do except to improve your base and expand. This is normal considering it's an early access game and does not have all the content necessary.			"

								In 15h, there's a new help system that's pretty awesome. The game detects a large number of problems and explains them to me. This can tell me about things I haven't noticed or explain game mechanics I wasn't aware of. It's pretty awesome -- the games in this genre I've played rely on you inspecting each villager in turn to find problems instead.This system will hopefully augment eventual per-villager details. For now, it's enough to make me feel like I know what's happening in my village.The recently added spells are pretty neat.There are plenty of things I can't yet do, like forbidding areas or assigning guard patrols. There are rough edges, like having difficulty discerning zombies from villagers and a hard-to-read font. But it's still fun and quite playable.			"

								now that I have played the game and have become more acquainted with it I can create a list of things I like a lot and things i would like to see changed (people reading this review please see that this is all in my personal preference and is not to be taken as a review from a professional)-	Really cool stuff* The game has a grate retro feel and even though it is incomplete the stable version feels solid * The game is quite challenging and even though certain things might feel unbalanced at the beginning as you become an experienced player they you begin to understand way they are that way* The pixel art is great to look at* The programmer is truly interested in you opinion and is relivily quick to respond to your feedback (Way to go programmer! I respect you!)- Not so cool stuff* Probably my biggest complaint with the game is that when your units are fighting monsters it is very hard to see which is your health bar and which is the opponents (perhaps you could have a hot key or something to toggle on and off opponent hp bars or an option for a symbol when one of your units health gets below 25%)* The only other complaint I have is wood becomes almost quite useless in later game and that a larger need for would in late game should be implemented-	Cool stuff I would like to see * A way to clearly see when it is your unit that is getting low helth (preferably at a quick glance)* More types of building ;)* God powers that boost fighting abilities of your units * More types of opponents (sum with specialties like necromancer that summons skeletons or something)* Quests or goals to accomplish			"

Yeah, no love. You might as well have your villagers go on blind dates with the local undead with how much they procreation they do themselves. So if you were getting this game for the 8-bit pornagraphy, sorry, the villagers never feel to be in the mood.But the developer has a lot of love for this game.

								...to all those people claiming the AI was oh so stupid and how hard it is to not be overrun within the first ten days... Learn to use your godly powers! Use your grab ""tool"" to split enemies between your towers, have towers within range of each other so at least two can always attack an enemy close to them... and use your fire blast to wipe out all the spawning graveyards and slime pools.I've got 15 hrs of Retro-Pixel Castles on my clock now and I start feeling like having seen most of what's currently in the game. What's there is polished, except for graphic hiccups whenever it autosaves (whole screen semi-jumps to a different position on the map and back within 100ms). It's great fun actually, even though it took me one failed attempt to realise that you need about three times the farms you have people to assign to (1 farm gives 4 farmer slots - if you have 12 farmers, though, you'd better have 8-12 farms to keep them actually busy (and to make enough food for summer/winter during spring/fall)).PROs:+ retro graphics that I personally really like+ mostly decent working AI (sometimes people ""forget"" their current task when becoming hungry and eating - but that might be intentional)+ cool mix of RTS/TD/Dwarf Fortress+ constant energy dilemma (do I fend off enemies with it or help my people to flourish?)CONs:- short but very noticable graphics glitch on every autosave (see above)I think, content-wise, this game has tons of potential and if devs hold on to it, this could become a remarkably entertaining new sub-genre! I'll definitely come back in a few months and see how it developed.			"

								Early access games have received a lot of attention lately both good and bad.  Some people are disappointed if a game doesn't turn out as they'd hoped, others are excited to be an active part of game development.  I played through the indev 23b version of this game and it is one of the best early access games I've tried yet!  This is because it is already fun, and the developer (Rayvolution) is bar none the absolute most active developer when it comes to communicating.  Seriously, check out any single forum post and most of the reviews, there will be a thoughtful and thorough comment from Rayvolution.Even incomplete, the game is awesome.  After multiple failed villages I finally figured out how to (barely) be successful.  After claiming the majority of the map, my villagers had nothing to do and massive amounts of housing and resources, and they all decided to start babymakin.  My population exploded from around 100 to around 280 in a season or two, and  summer approached.  Knowing that during this barren season my entire village would starve, I began zapping villagers as fast as I could into limbo (where they could survive) leaving behind all earthly posessions.  To this day I am in a race against time, zapping villagers at not-quite the rate of their reproduction as they continually starve to death.  I know that this isn't exactly how the game was designed to play, but it is still fun to just imagine the stories of these little pixelguys as they struggle under the inpet leadership of their god.  Varied and unpredictable scenarios like this play out all the time and make it a real thrill!			"

								This is an awesome game!!! The game is still in development, so it needs a little balancing and a bunch of other stuff, but it is an awesome game already! Survival mode is quite difficult, as it should be, but gives a fair challenge, so you have to be really good to actually survive. Peaceful mode is a good way to practice, and learn the game mechanics.It kind of gives me a RuneScape-ish feeling, when it still used to be fun, because of the old graphics and the awesome midi soundtrack. :) I bought it a few days ago and I already put 21 hours in the game, it is very captivating! :DDefinitely worth every penny, even without a discount!

								I enjoyed the first 30 hours of this game in a binge, struggling to learn the mechanics to stave off hunger or dehydration for my villagers, and defending the town from mobs.  Now surviving several winters, I am impressed with the engine feed/stock dynamics, the balancing a complex system as strategy feels satisfactory and time-pressured.  Losing track of many hours of the day is a sign of good enjoyment for this game.  The particle animations and amiga-like pixel art are also super and pleasing.Gameplay reminds of other games like the original Warcraft, dwarf fortress, command & conquer, castles, and simcity classic. All great titles!At this time, I'm not so sure that the ""late game"" -- cross-pollinating to more difficult territories -- will keep me interested to play much longer, as there isn't any kind of reward in sight. I am hopeful as an early access game that the end-game will become more compelling and rewarding at time of release.  Maybe by introduction of unique map features for each village, or some kind of overall crusading plot. I look forward to development updates and highly recommend this title.			"

The core of the game is the replayfactor. you simple but things together like you do on settlers or anno, but this game has a free mode where you simple can have fun inbetween, if you built your settlement and want speed up because you have to go somewhere, then simple speed it up, if this is to easy then try the survival mode. the game is much more then most of the new settler parts and simple fun. the depth is some missing, but the developers seams to work on new features and they come from time to time. seams a good solid hobby project to me.

								Playing this game for quite a while. At first, I thought that it was going to be boring but it looks like I was wrong, I got hooked on playing this game. A simple tower defense like game where you make a city and survive, and surviving is the hard part. Honestly, the only problem that I have always encountered is Food. It is HARD to get some food, Farmers do tend the Farm and harvesting food from the environment is easy but it's not enough, after having enough food for 40+ people it would not last for maybe 2-3 days and the farmers are mostly just standing there after doing their job, and the lack of food just enough to feed your people would be even worst at winter where there is no harvest at all. For now the game is fantastic and I can't wait for it to update, I just that the game can get animals like pigs or sheep that can help with food production and make it a bit easier with my people not dying of starvation.

								I purchased this in sale for less than £4. Still in beta but fully playable and in my opinion fun (especially for the price). Essentially similar to a tower defence game but also with town building (settlers) and god powers (populous). The game has different modes but the base survival mode sees your settlement constanly attacked by monsters (more at night) so you have to balance keeping your people alive and happy (for god powers) vs building the town and defences. The pace of the game is quite fast and the monsters get stronger and more numerous seemingly with time. Your no.1 resourse is your people who if looked after and fed will breed and increase your population (lots will die to monsters though!) and also feed your god powers. It works well and the balance is good for such an early game. For the price give it a try if you like thse kinds of game.			"

								Been playing this game for over 60 hours now and I can't seem to get enough of this retro style survival game. I think that the AI of the Villagers could be improved, and I hope to see some improvements in the efficiency catagory of the construction of buildings. Farms are close to useless, I usually just keep a large patch of free growing vegtables nearby due to the fact that your regrowth ability produces crops much more efficiently than farms. I also hope to see some new buildings and maybe even a much cheaper ability to help slay single mobs for early game development. I think that some mobs like the skeleton should undergo some nerfs, I think that the speed and tankiness are to powerful a combination for something as fragile as a skeleton. I think if you switched the health stats of the headless entity and the skeleton you would be just fine. I think that I should be able to have some sort of Barrack type building to order a specific amount of villagers to guard the village at all costs. And I would also like to be able to order units to go on conquests to attack enemy bases because having to use the fireball seems to prove ineffective when the enemy bases start spawning in mass numbers. All in all I absolutly love this game and the only reason it is good is because it has so much potential.			"

								I have played this game since before it was on Steam, and I absolutely love this game. The graphics and the feel of it are wonderful. I prefer peaceful mode, as I am more of a sandbox/village-building guy, however I have dabbled into survival and the game flows really well. If I have a village fall, I can easily trace it back to what I screwed up. The menus are easy to work through, and it's pleasing to plan out a village and see it come to life. Also of note, Ray is on Twitter and extremely active when engaged as well as updating folks on the game. He truly is a great dev and I look forward to watching the game continue to grow.			"

								Can be tedious at first my first two hours were a bit rough as I was slowly learning. Once I figured out the mechanics of the game I have not been able to stop playing. Build shelters for your people or they wil freeze and over heat to death. Save Nomads from monsters to boost your needed population. build farms and use god powers to grow crops so your people don't starve. Use Golems and towers to fend off monster invasions while being offensive and useing fireballs to destroy monster spawners. Build roads in your city to your defences for faster foot travel don't forget your defensive towers don't grow their own monster slaying bolts. It's a great addicting game yes it looks simple in graphics but it adds to the fun of the game. The Biggest plus is the game is still going to get better the developer puts lots of love in to this game and seems like a good chap always responding to people on the forums and sharing their ideas of what is in store for the future.

								TL;DR - This game is a perfect catch, especially on sale! The mechanics and gameplay is wonderful and you can play for hours on end.This game is still being constantly worked on but my God it is one of the best games I have played. You play and put hours of work into building your own colony but all of a sudden it  falls to ruins because monsters have overrun your poor people. But that doesn't stop you, that inspires you to play even more!The only real issue I have with this game is I have an issue where every so often the game will freeze for a second, it's not dramatic but it is quite annoying and I hope that this is fixed soon! If I really wanted to complain aout something else well I guess Steam Trading Cards would be nice for this game so badges could be built, this makes the game feel a bit oudated in some aspects.			"

								The game itself is excellent.  I like the UI, the graphics are great etc. etc.  However, please, developer, can you add a difficulty slider to survival?  Zombies (which you can't really tell apart from your own guys) come strolling in with 700 hp which takes 12 villagers 3 minutes to kill.  SUPER ANNOYING.  There's no slow buildup.  All of a sudden bam take these monsters in the face on day 2.  Can we start with just a few slimes/headless here and there, maybe on day 4 introduce the zombies?  It's near impossible to have any towers out before day 2. I HATE, HATE having guys die but no matter I do I can't save them, those poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.  I want to play survival because I WANT the monster attacks, but it's just too much.  OR keep it the way it is but reduce the zombie HP.  I don't, something.  I really like the game but the monsters are laid on too thick.  I'm still going to recommend the game, because overall it's very well designed and the gameplay is great, but please keep in mind the monster difficulty/build up.  It seems out of proportion - too strong, too fast.Another thing, at the moment I'm on day 22 about 90 colonists.  I have nine stone combobulators to help with defence, they work fine, they're way off to the side.  I built an essence collector and a fire tower but neither of them do anything, neither of them have collected a single essence.  They are right in the middle of the main battlefield with essence swirling all around them.  I watched, they get nothing.  Still enjoying the game.			"

								This game is not easy, also you're meant to die- which imo takes out the fun, I'm the type that wants to beat something.  At first I thought there was a way to survive- but let it be clear- the 'survival' part in the title should really be the 'delayed death'.  That is unless you figure out some sneaky tricks and tie them all together! Then you're in for an intense long haul fight against the ever expanding horde of monsters.  In it's current state you can slowly fight the horde back during the day and defend up at night.Pros:- Good music- Nice visuals (They are really consistant and totally retro :)- Fun mechanics- Interesting weather cycle- Good options(Settings) for the game- Active development and a friendly dev--- (If development stopped for the game I would still be happy with what I paid, but this means more content down the road, so win win!)Cons:- Difficulty curve at first can be very hard (you die you learn, do better)- Some villagers love to dive into death to finish a building or collect wood (Would be nice to create a 'no go zones'  or something similar in one for or another)- Only one latest save file- (can't try out different things by reloading unless you copy your folders around manually) not a fan.- If things get REAL BUSY like 1000+ things going on you will take an FPS hit, but for most of the game fps is smooth, you'll only encounter this if you have lasted a very long time.Old review:This game looks like fun and I read and watched enough to figure that I will give it a try, however without going to an external resource to learn how to play you will not be getting very far unless you stick through it and figure it out on your own.  Until the game improves on teaching the player how to play  - and not via an external resource like wiki, my review will remain negative (which I can see is in the works so most likely this review will become positive in the future).In its current state I started a game, read the tool tips tried to build some things but ran out of wood, ok tried again- same scenario, clicked around, tried destroying terrain, they still don’t harvest.  Perhaps it’s something obvious, if it is I couldn’t find it and as I refuse to go to an external resource this means I won’t be playing.  I’ll come back to this game in a few months and review.In the short time I played some issues: Changing to full screen added an odd border- the main menu remained in the top left without expanding, bricks added on the sides unevenly.Game screen flickered, looked like the main menu appeared over the game for 1 or 2 frames, happened 6 times in the 20 minutes I played, this was enough for me to not play even if I knew how.Main title screen music was not playing correctly, some channels kept cutting out, reloading fixed it- then they cut out again. Lightning on the title screen makes a weird noise but the thunder sounds right, not sure if that was intended.This review will most likely change as the game does.Edit: GaH the icons are on the bottom left, but are tiny.  The UI might need tweaking, like navigating through buildings is fiddely.			"

I'll settle this review with the Pros and ConsPros:1.It is fun.2.It looks good.3.It can be quite challenging which adds the fun.4.A lot of replayability until you have a successful village or your village gets destroyed.5.You can create your own map.6.You can play other people's map.7.Good music (If you don't like them, you can just mute it!)8.I have not encounter any bug so far.It looks like the game is going to have more updates (May change if something were to happen)Cons:1.After you play numerous times, you will feel bored.However this is the type of game that you will come back and play when there is a new update or you are just plain bored! If you are the kind of person who is impatient. This Is'nt The Game For You!Whether you bought it for full price or discounted price. It doesn't matter to me as i bought the game due to the reason.I was on a ""Looking for god-game spree"" or ""Survival kingdom simulator"" and i gave this game a shot.And it is fun being God. "

								This game combines RTS, tower defence, and godlike very well.  While I'm a casual gamer when it comes to games like this, and the difficulty ramps up a bit much for the one setting that has enemy mobs in it for me, I can wholeheartedly recommened this game.  It's totes worth supporting the very active and responsive dev.  Current, early access state is 7/10 (because I'm looking at the potential this game has, its not even close to being what it could) and can't wait to see what it becomes.Oh, and soundtrack is 10/10.  Good stuff.			"

								Rise to Ruins (Previously Retro Pixel Castles) captured my attention for quite a few years, I finally got a job and purchased it and found it to be really fun! Cute soundtrack, great gameplay, highly replayable, very diverse, and most importantly a great developer who is constantly speaking with the community and is very active on his twitter, which I recommend following him on!

								If you like a relaxing game for an afternoon, something to procrastinate on or a game to really get into - Rise to Ruins is the perfect fit. It's soundtrack is great, its mixture of tower defense, god-game and strategy fills that hole where Black and White 2 should have been. Not only this but the developer is on the forums, answering questions and queries and responding to feedback with updates and fixes!			"

Early Access Review
								This game is basicly if Dwarf Fortress and Populous had a child.The concept is great, the ability to cross over to new maps with resources from preious maps is great too.Best part of the casual side of things is the simplicity of the management.you only need to assign and build buildings they will do the tasks on their own.  I do however wish I could set caps in either the storage locations or globaly.  where you can say, only make/store a total of 100 Logs ect.  yet to no advailCombat is pathedic,  worst part of the game in my option.  as yes it is satisfying to make that turret defense maze, yet when you need to expand you have to remake it, or expand in a way that just adds to the ""whole night to attack one tower"" size of maze.  Lastly I do wish they had some kind of water buildings, like fishing.  that would make maps with larger water locations usefull. and would make it so that you wouldn't just wall off all large water locations in fear of monsters not going to your kill maze.In the end this game is good, and can be great with a little more pollish.  keep up the good work.

								Edit- Changed from not recommend to recommend.The developer reached out to me to help me understand where I was going wrong with food.  Please read the comments if your having similar issues.Food production is counter intuitive, if you build more farms it takes away from your current food stores.  Avoid building farms outside of early spring or your village will face starvation and death.  I'm still not a fan of the food system, but once the food issue was resolved the game became fun again.  It's nice to see a developer reach out to its users!			"

								Thanks for the tip rayvolution!This game is still in Early Access as I write this.This game is fantastic! Build a settlement and hope you don't get wiped out! Game will become close to unplayable if you have 250+ villagers. This is a known engine problem and may never get fully optimised I reckon.. This is not a bad thing however as it makes you realise the game is meant to be played a little slower. It's still hella fun.Whie it might be a bit slow at first as you learn just exactly what is needed for your people to survive (Water and food lolz) it quickly becomes very fun as you guide your people through the troubles of the world. It has a black and white plus warcraft 2 kind of feel. It's very addictive to be sure.A great game for chewing away hours of your time.Note to Developer:Key definable spells example: shift+1 is fire blast, shift+2 is motivate, etcFireblast should be made slightly more powerful in the most extreme of heat in summer.

								The creator of this game likes to read his own reviews, so I just want to say, Hello Ray!That said, this early access game is shaping up to be fantastic.  It's a city builder with tower defence in the vein of Gnomoria, and while the learning curve can be a bit steep, it's actually pretty easy once you get the hang of it.  The lack of late game difficulty is probably due to its status of early access, but there are new features every few weeks so it's only a matter of time.Thumbs up, highly recommended.			"

								The game is painfully slow with no time manipulation option, the god powers are limited and the farming/harvesting is also slow but saying this the game holds promise consideirng it is in early acess.The dev seems active  and adresses problems as they come (before you realize they are there infact).Once polished I can imagine the game being a nice relaxing game but its not quite there yet (for me).The userface is reasonably simple and easy to get used to with nice little options of being able to switch between songs.It would be nice to see the build menu be implimented with navigation keys i.e. backup from  sub catagories and a couple more hotkeys  so users can build faster/navigate with more flow but I can imagine its these things the  dev is working on.Give the game a try if you have the chance and  offer some feedback as its nice to see a developer who is passionate about interacting with his user base in the way  Ray does.

								The game is still in early access and I can tell the devs are putting a decent amount of work in order to improve the game but 10$ is what we should be paying for the full game unless we have at least double the ingame content - I hope they will take that in consideration.The game is a mix of tower defense and city building. You do not directly control your villagers but 'guide' them to get the structures built. As you can see, I put in a decent amount of time considering the how long I bought the game. I'd say if you do not have the patience to keep restarting a few times, this game might not be for you. If you have managed to survive past 3 seasons you will realize there is not much to do except to improve your base and expand. This is normal considering it's an early access game and does not have all the content necessary.			"
