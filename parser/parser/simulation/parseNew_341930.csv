												So, I checked the game out yesterday. The game is one of those semi-roguelike basebuilders, not that different from Prison Architect or Banished. However, compared to those titles, the game is quite shallow. You generally deal with money, power and oxygen. Money comes from residents and visitors, power comes from solar panels and is used by components on your ship, and oxygen is generated by some of these components and flows through your ship depending on the status of your doors.And for just that, the game is quite easy. Getting a net profit is not that hard, and getting power consists mainly of building lots of solar panels. Oxygen is easily managed with air locks.The only real problem comes from random events (of which there are not that many it seems, I got some of them multiple times in my playthrough) and meteors. You eventually research equipment to deal with that. Until then you have a cycle of buildup -> damage -> people die -> buildup.To make things interesting there is research, but there are only 7 or so subjects which do not offer more in-depth mechanics. The game suffers from the same problem I had with Banished. After a while the real challenge is out of it and you can just expand until everything eventually crumbles apart. On my second try, at took me 1,5 hours to build every facility there is, net 2k each day and I did not have to care about asteroids or supernova's. Getting the last achievement would only consist of me walking between my pc and the couch to check for random events and otherwise let the game run at max speed.Add to that the fact that the user interface is functional but a bit weird, and that the game lacks explanation. Yes, I think pointing out after the tutorial that ""the hand-holding comes to an end here"" is very clever, but I could not find a way to use the stairs to actually build a second floor. The game just ""lacks"", it lacks content, it lacks challenge, it feels like an early access game with way too less stuff to do.Is it worth the money? Well I got 3,5 hours of minimal fun and I feel like I've done everything there is to do. Since the game cost me 5 euros, it was not a complete waste. But I don't think the game is good by any means, maybe a 5/10 for effort and only considering the low price.You want something like this? Get Prison Architect. Maybe Banished. Or Dugeon Keeper. Or Evil Genius. Just not this game.			"

												As much as I like passion projects from indie developers; this game is far from being done. The AI does not work well (robots will just stop doing their assigned jobs), building structures lacks sanity checks (you can have solar panels overlap each other on the same level), zoning causes problems when walls are removed* and asteroids destroying the floor makes rezoning necessary.There are nice ideas in this game, but at this point it lacks a ton of bugfixing, polish and ui redesign to make it more intuitive. Glad the developer is still working on it - but, at this point, I can only advise you against getting Space Station Alpha.* and why, WHY am I not allowed to have oxygen generators outside of living quarters? I had passengers dying on arrival just because the only oxygenated room was the living quarter which they couldn't reach in time... Wouldn't have been so bad if the robots at least bothered opening the door from time to time - but no... tasks piled up and they must have felt too overwhelmed to even get started. (I could go on...)			"

												If this was an early access game, then yes, I'd say go for it... but it isn't. This game seems unfinished. It's fun, cheap, but it leaves you expecting something more. The research ""tree"", for instance, is very small and quickly completed (no teirs, just a few boxes to click on the screen). The settings menu lacks any controls for sound volume. Instead, it lists a series of screen resolutions which happened to be missing my 1920x1050 screen size.  The game also lacks any real documentaiton on how to play after you get your first resident. There are also parts that have no purpose, mainly the stairwell.  It could be a fun game, but it needs a little work. It feels very much like an early access game, but it isn't being sold as such.

												Mkay... So after playing for a while, and unlocking some achievements...I'm gonna have to say, that at the current state of the game, I wish I hadn't spent the game. This is basically a VERY basic ""Apartment Management Sim"", and it really shows. It has potential, but the limited number of features, lack of ability to decorate the station in any manner, lack of ability to attract specific aliens, limited number of alien races, and just in general, how bland and dark and gritty everything looks... It's a very plain, very basic game. It feel unfinished and unrefined... Too unrefined for them to have pulled it out of ""Early Access"". I'm very disappointed at this time and REALLY wish I hadn't spent the $5.00 on it now.			"

												This game is really awesome from a one man dev who's way more active than most large companies with the updates.He's constantly adding heaps of new features, and most of the issues people have mentioned in other reviews are already resolved which is great to see. He's pretty active in the forums, I don't know that he knew they existed initially.As for the game, it's already pretty awesome so far and with a bit more polish and functionality will be excellent.As it stands, I'd say it's well worth the asking price of $5.99 USD.

												Although some people are finding this game hard and a little light on features (both are currently true) I think there's a lot of promise here and the studio is actively working on it. I love supporting indy devs, and I think this little management game is worth the few dollars being charged for. I've also made a short video showing off the game!

Posted: March 5, 2015
												This game really upsets me. I really like games like this one and Prison Architect but neither are finished games I can just play. Prison Architect (a really great game by the way you should buy it now or when released) crashes and Space Station Alpha is nearly unplayable due to workers getting perpetually stuck unloading.What happens is sometimes when a shuttle lands it will not be unloadable. Up to 4 of your workers will try to unload it, some freezing right where they are instead of going to the shuttle. At this point the launch pad cannot be deleted and 4 of your workers for the rest of the game must be stuck unloading"" nothing. Deleted workers causes new workers to ""unloading"" the unloadable shuttle. You can try various things like not accepting deliveries, closing your station, waiting a really long time, turning off your launch pad, etc. but none of those will fix your issue.The only way to get past this is save the game, close game, and load your saved game. You will have to do this often. I usually use this trick to remove things i mark for destruction but never actually seem to get destroyed. I simultaneously enjoy and hate this game. I keep comming back to some of the same issues.2015-06-05bugs not fixed. super annoying to have workers just stand in one spot for enternity while your shuttle on the launch pad waits for said worker for eternity.2015-03-20After 69.0 hours I am happy to say everything seems to work as it should ingame. It is always a good feeling seeing certain bugs being juicily squished by a devoted creator.2015-03-12After 52.3 hours these are the nasty: Saved game bug makes saves somewhat worthles. Shuttle stuck on launch deck and is no longer destroyable bug. workerbot stuck in invisible and remote area of the map-but-is-thankfully-destroyable bug. The somewhat difficult process of placing floor to align the way I want too not-actually-a-bug-I-have-OCD-sorry bug.My take is this game is fun (if you like these type of games) but still needs polish. As evidenced in the comment below, the developer is accepting feedback to make the game better. This game is his beloved creation. If you help him test it, he will fix it. Even after just a few days, many things have been patched. My outlook for this game is rosey, I just hope it can get some attention and more positive reviews as time goes by.2015-03-05After a mere few minutes playing I only encounterd one bug so far and it occurs when you try to load a saved game. I am thumbing this game up with the expectation this will be fixed.			"

Started Over and Played A Second Game Video: (Better video)


YouTube™ Video: Space Station Alpha - Still Learning On My 2nd Game 

			Views: 310		

			This is my second game and my experience and thoughts as I continue to try and learn how to succeed in this new space ship building simulator where you host alien guests to earn cash.		

If you are going to watch one of the two videos above, watch the 2nd video, as I believe it will give you a much better idea of how the game works and what you're buying.This is a pretty darn fun little game.  Kinda reminds me a little of a sim city game, but in space with the threats of asteroids smashing into your spaceship (space cty) as you have rooms for science, guest services for alien visitors who pay you for such services, and more.  Like Sim City, it's an itricate balance of keeping your space visitors happy, yet safe while on board all the while trying to turn a profit and not collapse from a number of disasters that can happen.While i have yet to play it enough to give it the time it deserves and that I want to give it, my 9 year old son loves it already.  He has over 3 hours into it at the time I write this review and has a space station that would make our home town in the real world look small.  The fact that this game looks and plays this good in its early state shows me a lot of promise for it's future.I will update this game and score when I've had more time in the game.. but it looks like its an easy 8/10 and considering it's value for your dollar, it might deserve a little more credit.It does take a little patience and there's a little to learn, but it looks like no two games will ever be the same game twice, and for the creative and strategy, as well as science fiction fans out there, I'd certainly give this game my two thumbs up.  If however, you are looking for Diablo, minecraft, or Call of Duty here, you might look elsewhere, lol.-  Zaxx			"

												I actually tried to break the game; multiple crossing halls, singular pathways for multiple activities, equipment build in the path of critical systems, etc.  Nope, worst I got was someone moved their bed into a common room next to the vending machine.  Fun little game, lots of room to grow and become amazing but well worth the current $5 price tag especially since basic inspection of the options and controls lets you customize and ease movement speeds and camera angles to fit your computer's abilities or personal gaming style.Are there some improvements needed imho, of course, its early access.  Doors have to be left open to move air between rooms instead of a vent system, no que system for construction (it is done as you add it to the ""blue print/design"" so lay it out in the order you want it built) and single plane of construction rather than multi-level (personal preference but easier to view and control as is).Basic first impression review.

If the devs continue to update the game and fix up bugs, I can see this being a great game.If it is worth the buy to you is up to you. It is buggy, which is expected in alpha, but nothing is game breaking so far (I haven't play too much, obviously).			"

												Fun game, especially if you have a bit of engineer in you. You build your space station by keeping balance between spending and earning. At the start its constant strugle to get enough power. When you open commercially, you also have to maintain oxigen. How you build will help or hinder later, plan ahead. And there is that dreaded asteroid strike with fire or vacuum to fix in a flash, or see your visitors asphyxiate. The worker robots can be switched between five duties. You can build staircases and open upper floors. You can mine nearby asteroid, research better equipment, and although I have not reached that far, there is diplomacy, commerce, prison, and probably more to come.So far no game crush, errorous behavior, annoying lag, But my station is also rather small, two floors, two permanet residents, eight visitors, nine robots. (My OS is Windows 7)In all I already had more fun with this game for less money than with a movie premier.			"

												This game is really enjoyable for a casual player. The only downers that I have to admit to are these: -Work Bots will stop in a single location and stop working on their given tasks and When that happens I am forced to quit the game and start a new one just for it to happen more and more. -The bug above also causes shuttle not to continuously take off bringing more passengers in.-Mining asteroids is buggy, bots will mine the asteroids but if I were to re-task that bot to do maintenance for example that bot will then come up with an error status and will become useless.Now I haven't gotten far enough in this game to have any real useful advise because I usually get 10 to 35 days in and bots will stop tasking. Whats worse is that when asteroid showers occur and I task bots to build and they just sit there with their thumbs up their butts, I am again forced to start fresh games.I really hope that these bugs with get addressed so that this game will stop me from wasting hours of my night starting new games. I only start fresh because I honestly see potential for a very fun game and because of that I will recommend this game for others to enjoy on their own.			"

It has now been well over a year since it has been updated, there are a few bugs that are usually game breaking, and the overall depth of the game is not much. You can normally get to the ""endgame"" within a couple of hours.
