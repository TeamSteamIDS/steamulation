												This game is extremely broken in its current state.  The developer Funky Logic Studios doesnt appear to monitor the steam forums or even have a website/forum to report issues to.  Everyone stay far away! The publisher Libredia	 hasn't answered an email I sent weeks ago.There isnt any kind of player animation for casting, half the text isnt translated to english, it has no controller support, and when you do cast out and move the mouse around the lure moves in ways you couldnt with an actual fishing line. If a fish does take the bait you instantly catch the fish without having the fight of reeling it in or dealing with line tension(pretty much what you want in a fishing game experience).Don't waste your money.

												14 years ago if you told me european fishing was even remotely similar to american fishing i would've punched you so hard in ur grill that at least two teeth would've fallen to the ground and shattered (so dentist cannot replace)but now in my moderns days (i'm twenty-nine years older) i'v erealized that fishing is by and large the same regardless of whatever continent you're init is all white men standing near bodies of water with rods with strings attached looking to bait the creatures of the sea into biting their hooks.karl marx once said, ""the products of fish belong to all people, especially poor people because they're pretty great.""i really like european fishing. it's like sailing in a boat in a body of water and casting a line into said body of water and waiting for a fish to take the bait.it's fishingmore or less.""you can't keep fishing like this""- apollo creed			"

												This game is absolute RUBBISH. I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone. If you want a good fishing game, Buy Euro Fishing, thru Steam.			"

			This game is basically a scam and the developer should be ashamed of themself. Or themselves. Or maybe there was no developer, and the game was produced by a freak of nature?

												You may be asking, why do we need a ""European"" Fishing?  What's so different about how people fish in Europe?  As someone who has never travelled to Europe, I asked myself the same question, and I've learned the answer from playing various fishing games over the years.In some continents, you catch fish by first choosing a lure, casting the lure via fishing line into a body of water, waiting for a fish to bite your lure, then reeling in your fish/prize.  However, in Europe, you catch fish by putting basically anything on your fishing line in place of a lure, casting the line into a body of water, and what happens next is the European fish will proceed to swim past your line and lure, then actually jump into your fishing boat.
