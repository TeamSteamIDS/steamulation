												Simply amazing.It's a puzzle game, you play as a puddle.Of coffee. Or water. Or weedkiller. And so on.Each liquid has its own unique property, and all you do is tilt the screen, and let physics do the rest!Great presentation style, the science-y background music is awesome, and the puzzles are good with a fairly reasonable learning curve, so even total newbies can master the concept of the game.

												An original and well-made puzzle platformer. The twist is that you're controlling a puddle of liquid by tilting the screen - and it may be difficult to keep it all in one place. Failure can be gradual - losing a tiny drop is no big deal, but they add up throughout the level. The game can be almost as frustrating as Super Meat Boy - and almost as fun. I've encountered a few bugs - most are error messages, but one is a persistent crash towards the end of the game.			"

												Puddle is a puzzle-platform game that makes clever use of advanced physics to let you move all kinds of liquids through different obstacle courses. While the idea itself sounds rather straightforward, the execution is certainly not. The first levels, using water as a liquid, are not too difficult and I thought ""tihs game is going to be a piece of cake"". But how wrong I was (am actually). Difficulty goes up steeply and the developers have really thought of all kinds of possible liquid and obstacles to make life ever more difficult. Water, oil, goo, fertilizer, nitroglycerine, all pass the review and all ask for a different approach. This keeps the game interesting, since the visual context changes accordingly to the liquid being processed. And since the visuals are really outstanding for an in essence static background, the developers have done a good job.But after a couple of hours, my interest in the game diminished since I got tired of the trial-and-error which seemed to be necessary in some of the later levels. So I let the game rest for a couple of weeks, and picked it up again recently. Now I pick up some levels ad random and try to get more of the Steam achievements, which are a clever addition to the game. All in all, this game is a nice sideway away from any larger-scale gaming projects, but don't expect anything more really. If Steam reviews would have a ""neutral"" option, this one would get one. But in the end I give it a ""thumbs up"", if only for an original idea being well executed, with a lot of love for the project being involved.Gameplay: 17/30 (interesting at first, but too difficult after a time)Graphcis: 16/20Sound: 5/10Longelivety: 5/10Technical/stability: 16/20Personal appreciation: 5/10Overall: 64/100			"

												There’s nothing better than a game that takes a simple idea and runs with it. Puddle does more than that. It runs, drips and oozes its idea through almost every conceivable formulation.Levels characteristically take the form of a laboratory or industrial setting – somewhere with a lot of pipes and tubes. By tilting that scene left and right and letting physics do the hard work, you guide a volume of liquid through various courses. Along the way a multitude of hazards from furnaces to buzz-saws threaten to simmer and splatter your solution.That’s the sum of Puddle’s mechanics, but it’s how it pours this concept into dozens of different scenarios that makes it so engaging.The liquids vary greatly, each with a series of challenges designed around it. What really elevates Puddle above many other physics puzzlers is not these individual puzzles, but how they are cleverly threaded together. The entire game progresses in this contraption-like manner, adding a sprinkling of adventure to the proceedings. The only other issue is the controls. Puddle uses the left and right mouse buttons to tilt the screen in the corresponding direction, but there is no way to adjust the extent of the tilt aside from repeatedly releasing and pressing the buttons. Consequently, great care is required in timing movements; otherwise the liquid might accelerate too quickly and separate into smaller globules, usually leading to a slippery end.All in all, Puddle looks like a simplistic game – after all, you have to press only two buttons. But it offers so many diverse challenges that you'll be quickly proven otherwise.			"

												Don't be fooled by its appealing graphics; under the polished visuals lies a frustrating, slow and clunky physics-based platformer which unfortunately doesn't become much more interesting as the game progresses.The general summarized gameplay, ""get these things to the end of the level"", is accomplished much better by other physics-based games like World of Goo or Mercury. Get those instead, and save yourself a headache.			"

												Fun game but frustrating, I did not finish the last episode. Each map should have at least one check point so you players don't have to start all over again. There should also be the ability to move the camera to look around what's coming next instead of doing trial and error every 10 seconds. The difficulty in the maps is very not linear. Some are super hard while others are fair. The ability to skip a few maps is vital for the game. The most fun liquid was the molten metal but there was too little usage of the hardening property. Nitroglycerin was fun too but should have more use of it's unique property. The scrap yard maps and the body maps were the hardest. If there was to be a sequel I would like to see acid that corrodes stuff, water that needs to be frozen to ice at certain sitations, magnetic liquid, mercury and non-newtonian liquid. There could be maps with other liquids on which the player's liquid floats upon like oil on water.			"

												It is a fun puzzle game that involves liquid physics.Each chapter portrays different scenarios with different liquids and each one makes an interconnection to the other in somehow. This makes an interesting story to follow.The game has several kind of liquids, each one with different characteristics like viscosity and velocity over different surfaces.A negative point is the lack of controllability. You can only tilt your screen to the left or right and this give you low control of the fluids.Some levels can be very frustrating because you have to memorize the entire level in order to complete it. But that's not so difficult to do it.There are very interesting achievements to unlock. The most difficult one is to earn all 48 gold medals. This requires you to finish all levels carrying as much fluid as you can on the lowest possible time.			"

												Great concept and all, but terrible execution.  Levels require an annoying amount of precision that just can't be achieved with liquids... at least not liquids as non-cohesive as these.  What's more, some levels seem almost designed to force you to lose large amounts of liquid, such as levers that you have to ""pull"" dropping down and bottlenecking the liquid behind it while the rest of it races forwards for no clear reason.  Some of the levels seem like they were tested for use with a solid ball, and the liquids were put in there as an afterthought.  What's worse is that most levels require you to know what's ahead and plan for it even though you've never seen it; and many of those require you to be at some particular speed between letting the liquid just do its thing and full tilt.And the kicker is that the game has the nerve to call you a ""whiner"" (read:  about as close to ""little b*tch"" as it can while keeping a kid-friendly rating)  when you want to play normal mode or can't get past the clunky controls and poor level design.  All in all, 5/10.  Absolutely great concept, but the poor controls and poorer level design just make it an infuriating game.			"

												Puddle seems like an interesting liquid physics game.  It has a wide variety of liquids in different levels with different properties which you move by tilting the level, attempting to reach the end in the least amount of time possible while losing the least amount of liquid possible.  It should be fun, and at the beginning it is, though it quickly loses its luster.To start with, the developers have the gall to give you ""whine"" tokens to skip levels and on the difficulty selection, go on about how playing on normal is for whiners.  Seriously?  I haven't seen such hostile behavior towards players since Phil Fish's ""PC's are for spreadsheets"" debacle.The game starts off well, giving you a good variety of liquids to use and obstacles to overcome.  Goal times vary wildly, with some levels being trivially easy to get a gold medal on, and others near impossible.  Towards the end of the game, levels can become quite frustrating with precision ""jumps"" required using liquid that spreads out often beyond your view on the screen.  Then I got to the zero gravity levels, where instead of controlling gravity, you control slow-moving paddles to bat the liquid around in levels filled with walls that destroy the liquid.  It has to be the worst idea anyone has ever had for a physics game and stopped me from progressing any further.Stay away.			"

												Interesting game. I've already finished nearly half of the levels in a little over two hours (and I am sure some of that was time away from my computer or watching something momentarially-as lately I have been watching YouTube in the background.I say 'finished' half of the levels because some, if not many of them I didn't even rank in. I have more copper than silver and more 'check marks' (i.e. finished, but did not rank) than gold (and likely silver).But the poor 'what exactly do I need to do to rank copper, silver or gold, isn't really the problem... anyone can figure that out after playing a level a few times... no, the problem I found is that in the labratory levels, specifically playing Nitroglycerin, if you start the second level of without directly beating the prior-and even then sometimes-your will immediately explode, restart the level and repeat. Even that can be a simple error in coding, not spawning the liquid correctly, or the game assuming the liquid is moving too quickly as it 'jumps' into existance... but when you get to the Body levels, and specifically the blood levels I constantly get a divide by zero warning. This doesn't crash the game, but it does freeze it until I 'windows key' out and click 'ok'.I haven't gotten past these levels yet, as I fet it inportant to add this to a review. If you are programming anything you really NEED to make sure you don't have code divide by zero. Usually it will completely crash software (ah, the blue screens of old), and I'm not entirely sure how this software is able to cope with it.The game looks finished and even polished, until you reach the bugs that clearly show it is not. It is still fun to play, and for those who feel the need to get gold on everything you'll have a challenge... but they really needed to go over their software and make sure things worked correctly, each time, for all hardware.(A FYI, I'm on an HP Pavillion 7000, with Intel I7 and nVidia GeForce 630M, running WIndows 7--so it isn't like I'm trying to run the game on obscure hardware or software).EDIT: So, I've had to 'skip' some levels... Space is hard, and the level just before also has the divide by zero error...			"

												Don't waste your time. It's not 'liquid' physics, it's 'half-set jelly physics'. Nothing handles like a liquid. SOMETIMES IT GOES UP HILLS.It's a physics game which requires tight controlling...which is PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. Oh, and the best bit: some levels will fail BEFORE THEY EVEN START as the nitroglycerine explodes for no reason.A great concept ruined by awful execution.			"

GameplayYou may have noticed that the publisher does not want to put a genre tag on this game, although the description does mention the word 'puzzles'. Well, I understand that but I will name the genre: Puddle is a platformer game. Granted, it's a platformer game that uses unique mechanics in the sense that the 'avatar' is not a classic little man, animal, robot or a ball. But in the end all you do is guide something through a linear, straightforward parcours towards the finish line, while jumping (to avoid falling to your 'death') and while dodging stuff (to avoid getting 'killed' if you touch it). If that's not the very definition of a platformer game, I don't know what is. Assuming the word 'puzzle' implies at least a bit of thinking on how to solve a problem, there is no puzzling whatsoever in Puddle. You always know exactly what needs to be done: there is only one way throug the parcours before you and you'll get through it by trial and error, not by puzzling your way out.In Puddle, you don't control an avatar directly. You can only press a button to tilt the screen to the right or a button to tilt the screen to the left. As you tilt the screen, gravity will cause the 'avatar' to move. Most of the time, the 'avatar' has something to do with liquids. That means you need to guide either a liquid or a container containing a liquid through a parcours.The level design is quite impressive. There is a lot of variety in the levels and they are all clearly designed with an eye for detail. But be warned, this is a very difficult game to master. Getting through the later levels will take a lot of practice until you know the parcours pretty much by heart, especially if you want to achieve the best score for each level to get the 'gold medal' the game awards, or for the Steam Achievement. Graphics and soundThe graphics are quite nice and vibrant, and they managed to bring a lot of variety to the settings and their backgrounds, which is an impressive feat for a game with a pretty basic concept like this.The music is all over the place. Sometimes I hardly noticed the music because it was soft and unintrusive, almost 'zen-like'. Other times, you get to hear techno music with a thumping bass beat. I have nothing against either of those music styles, but for a game I think they should pick one because alternating between two completely opposite genres is just weird.On Steam's extra featuresPuddle has 8 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 4 just for running the game.The Steam Achievements come in three varieties: finish a set of levels  make it hard on yourself e.g. complete all the levels with near perfection or finish a specific level with an extra condition to make it harder playful achievements just for funVerdictPuddle has a lot of strong sides, especially its graphics and its level design. But in the end, for platformer games I weigh the fun factor against the frustration factor. Great platformers are games that manage to provide more fun than frustration. To be a positive experience, it should at least be 50-50. And Puddle fails to balance that equation. It's more like 60% frustration and 40% fun, maybe even 70-30, so I can't recommend this game in general. Only if you're a die-hard platformer gamer or a gamer looking for a nerve-wrecking challenge that will have you cursing at your screen more than once (guaranteed!), Puddle is right up your alley. "

												If I wanted to suggest a game that would appeal to the widest range of players, from small child to the disabled to a brilliant adult engineer or gamer, it would be Puddle.If you love to watch fluids flow, from coffee to rocket fuel or decomposed rat (yes, rat rot) and just have fun making them flow in strange, interesting or even funny ways, this game can be JUST that simple. And if you reach a level where more demands are made, and the player is unwilling to commit intellectually, they can take one of four “whines” (two whines on “extreme” skill level) in order to skip that difficult level. Each category grows more challenging as it progresses, and each group is VERY different from the preceding one. Each fluid flows differently, and is affected by factors such as fire or consumption by carnivorous plants (though gratefully not on the same level.) A glass globe filled with water must be handled with great delicacy, as must nitroglycerin, both in the Laboratory section. (But it may also be necessary to CAUSE small amounts of the nitro to detonate to proceed. Or to sacrifice fluids to make a branch break to facilitate a pathway, or destroy a container to free a fluid to flow. Such skills are a bit beyond the “small child” level.) Some fluids are highly flammable, but can also be extinguished if action is taken quickly. Sometimes “winning” may consist of sending a flaming mass of liquid pouring quickly over the finish line (though not likely with a high score).For those seeking an intellectual challenge on an intensely scientific level, this game is just a little slice of heaven. While in its simplest form this game is simply gravity acting upon fluids, Puddle vastly exceeds the simple. Anyone not familiar and comfortable with the phrase “water seeks its own level” may find themselves at a severe disadvantage, but understanding Newton’s laws of motion is REALLY helpful. Ultimately, as there are only two buttons, there are also two goals: get as much of the original fluid mass to the finish line as quickly as possible. If the constantly monitored fluid level drops below a preset amount, you lose. If it doesn’t, you WIN! What you win is gold, silver, copper, or simply completion. The scoring is given in the form of a rather sophisticated graph where the meeting points of the two measured variables are displayed in comparison to the three award levels. Players are also informed if their score is a new record.It takes skill and intelligence to use the force of gravity alone to keep the fluid in a compact mass, especially when it’s gravity trying to spread it out and break it into separate droplets. On several game levels that may be helpful, on others, the deal breaker. Some fluids, such as water, slosh about and need to be “damped” (as is done with the swinging weight hanging from an overhead crane.) Often trailing bits of fluid must to sacrificed so that the leading mass isn’t slowed as it crosses flame, or other reductive forces. Knowing that science will help the trailing fluid to move faster, thus pushing the slowly moving leading fluid quickly over a destructive force is often critical. So is trusting that momentum will keep fluid moving uphill if direction is changed as early as possible, helping the full mass end up downhill faster than if you waited. The real challenge in this game is trimming milliseconds off the time, and adding the tinniest fraction of a drop to the mass by speeding it along instead of waiting that extra tenth of a second.For many disabled or impaired players, this game is “perfectly” simple. All that’s required for play are the left and right arrow keys to tilt the world displayed onscreen (though split-second timing can be VERY crucial in many levels.) I have played exclusively on the Mac version, and Puddle does not appear to have adaptability for colorblind players. The game is very nearly photo-real with a wide range of colors, and the fluids themselves often change color during play. I can’t speak for how this might be an issue for the “color-impaired”.There are some issues with Puddle. If your fluid gets broken into several masses, the camera may ignore the one needed for completion. I’ve had to manually close games when I was unable to even know where the remaining fluid was, much less maneuver it effectively. On my Mac the mouse is useless in the menus. The menus themselves need LOTS of work. It would also be nice if the score you were trying to beat was shown in some way on the score screen, or better still, in the graph. To see what scoring you’ve achieved on each level takes several steps more than could possibly be necessary. Some levels (Human Body: Tension & Stout Hearted) are FAR more difficult and cumbersome, bordering on impossible, on my Mac than what I’ve seen on YouTube.All in all, the BEST $2.49 I’ve ever spent on a game in my life. I expect to be playing this game for quite some time to come.			"

												I don't think many people will actually buy this because they're interested in it. It's just one of those games that doesn't draw much - if any - attention. 'Impulsive' is a word most of us will recognize here. Myself included. Before playing I had no idea what this game was all about. 'Why ?', I keep asking myself. Because this game is great fun.Essentially Puddle is a platformer game where instead of a character you control multiple fluids (sticky, explosive, you name it). You know the drill; getting from point A to B. But there are switches to be flipped, fluids to be split and more, and you have to tactically move your fluid because if the fluid get below a certain amount it's game over. Some of the later levels can be truly frustrating, but at the same time fun and, in a way, relaxing.It looks great in motion, I truly adore the artwork. It's simple, yet sophisticated and colorful. Just check out the screenshots and you know what I mean. The sound effects get the job done, in a realistic way. It's what you'd expect.To all my fellow impulse-buyers; please do check out this game. You won't regret it, I'm pretty sure (that's right; not 100% :P).[Rating: 78/100]			"

												Puddle is a physics platforming game.  But instead of controlling a character, in the standard sense, your character is a liquid.  You control water, molten metal, coffee, and many other different types of liquids that all come with their special attributes.  The levels themselves range from super simple to super difficult, however, finishing the latter levels is not as difficult if you are not aiming for gold medals on all runs.  Achievement hunters, beware!  This game is very difficult to beat and achieve 100%.  I'd definitely recommend this game for that shear fact that it's original, it's beautiful rendered and the varying levels and liquids offer ever changing gameplay environments.  Definitely worth it if you find it at 50% or more.			"

												Preface: I got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at this game and decided to stop playing it.Looking forwards to a relaxing or fun physics game involving liquid?Well ♥♥♥♥ you.Immediately you are dropped into a seemingly unforgiving game world with arbitrary grading schemes and fail states. Your sole means of interacting with the game worlds is limited to rocking the screen in either direction approximately 30 degrees.A terrible camera and poor controls means beating a level is often a process of memorization and brute force replaying, the game mechanics and liquids are never introduced sufficiently to feel competent with the game's systems before you are whisked off to other novelties. You may lose liquid by virtue of it just being off screen with the overly zoomed in camera - Which you do not seem to be able to control.All of the liquid behaves like goo, it is slow moving and has ridiculous velocity. You can never move the liquid fast enough to be satisfying or to convincingly act like reality. The latter complaint is arguably not important as realism in Puddle's arcadey context is never a requirement but the slow and unrealistic physics movement seems to be a cover up of the game's incredibly short levels. This game may not be new and therefore cannot be fairly judged with today's standards, but it hasn't aged well and just feels like a crappy mobile port with good graphical polish.A game that gives a number of 'whines' allowing the player to skip a level while insulting my intelligence with crappy controls and camera is a load of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Final ""word""Sucks/10			"

I think there were some design choices that seriously limit the enjoyment, primarily the fact that your liquid is constantly in danger of depletion, forcing many many retries.

												TL;DR Simple controls but unique gameplay because of the particularities of the liquids. Not only liquids so it diversifies the gameplay. Not for easily disgusted and non-patient people. For physics lovers. Worth 8$. I highly recommend.Here's Puddle, a game I found during the Paris's sales. At first, maybe it's hard to decide whether or not to buy it. I mean, you only tilt the screen to the left and right, moving liquids, but this game is incredibly... incredible! So yes, this is a ""I go from this point to another"" game, but you don't directly control what you lead to the end.Let me explain myself. Basically, you control a liquid by tilting the screen to the left and right (I think this game was first designed for mobile). Sounds boring, uh? Well destroy this thought right now. Not only are the graphics awesome to my eyes, but the every liquids are different and this creates unique and diversified gameplay. You have coffee, ink, lava, even a liquid that doesn't fall from the top to the bottom but... from the bottom to the top! Some are heavy and falls quickly, some are compact and stick to stuff, some explode... I couldn't even name all the particularities off the top of my head, there are so much! And I haven't even finished the game while I'm writing this!However, people that are easily disgusted shouldn't play this. The body chapter made me slightly wince and I myself am someone that is not easily disgusted by this kind of stuff. The following chapter is the sewers and ain't really better. Also, if you're not patient, unless you want to start to be patient, this is not really a game you should be looking for. However, if you're ready to spend a chunk of your time on difficult levels, go on. The game offers to use ""Whines"" to skip levels but you know, I want to keep my honor and not use them to be proud to say ""I completed all the Puddle levels""...About being patient, some levels are special sometimes, and also harder. They usually are at the beginning and end of every chapters. There, you don't always control liquids but most of the time, there always are liquids involved. One time you control a souvenir ball where the liquid is inside the ball, another time you control lasers and need not to burn the liquid in addition of doing something else at the same time to finish the level... Consider those levels as introductions and bosses. I really like the idea.If I revise everything, Puddle has reaaaally simple controls but the particularities of the liquids make the gameplay unique every time. Also, you don't always control liquids, so it diversifies the way to play. But of you're not patient and easily disgusted it's not the game for you. If you're a fanatic of physics, however, you should like it.I really recommend this game. Worth 8$. Could've been 5$, but 8$ is alright too.			"

												The game is obviously beautifully designed and the gameplay is refreshingly different, but my first time playing, I didnt give it enough time and thought it was boring. When I finally decided to dragged myself back to it, I found one of the best indie games I have played. The controls seem simple at first  but you will soon learn there is more to it than just leaning the screen to make water fall down a hole. The hazards start requiring a bit more thinking and you will not always have the luxury of stopping to figure it out. The variety of liquids differ in more ways than just colour and viscosity. You may have trouble keeping some pooled together, others may dissolve or even explode in certain situations. Then there is the occasional change of physics to deal with and keep you on your toes.This is definately not a game you should try to play through quickly as you will miss its full potential. Just finishing it is one thing but to get all achievements will require some patience and skill and a lot of planning. While difficult in spots, the game does not give the feeling of being impossible. You may pull some hair out but there is always the impression that you can do it if you just move slightly different over a section.This is definately one of the more memorable and enjoyable indie games I have played. The achievements are well designed and give a sense of being rewarding, not just collecting. The game is challenging, but not near-impossible, so even if you doubt you gaming skills, I would still recommend looking at this game.			"

												Pros:+Looks kinda cool.+Runs pretty well.Mids:~Not very orginal ideas.Cons:-Brutally hard in one moment and trivially easy in the next.-Nags at you for playing on normal.-Terrible execution for a terrible idea.-Liquid isn't liquid, it's gel that doesn't stay contained, no matter what you do.-3-5 Levels are almost unbeatable, I'd even say not beatable at all.Basically, you know that one idea you had when you thought of a physics platform game with liquids? That's this, and that was a terrible idea. The liquid doesn't stay together, so the platforming is just a pain.It was that ""kinda-fun-but-I'm-not-enjoying-myself"" fun for a little while, but then it was just grey name on my steam list.			"

												A physics puzzler which isn't totally annoying? A game featuring water, lava, and other elements (including some quality choices such as ""rat goop"") which isn't monotonous? An indie game with an interesting story? Good grief! It's Puddle. It has a rather dull name but the game itself is fun throughout, aided by design choices such as making the actual levels fairly brief and the restarts quick. Also, level skips (called ""whines"" here, lol), one of which I used (on the Apollo level). I liked this a lot.			"

												This game is good fun.  It looks and sound good and plays well.  It can seem very difficult but with a little and sometimes a lot of trial and error one can get to the last levels.  What makes this game stand out for me is its originality.  It provides the player with unique gaming situations which can be hard to fathom.  I've never controlled an object floating through an artery or swirled a liquid through a centrifuge for example.  For these reasons I would rate the game 7.5/10.			"

												The game itself is not too complicated, but it is really well-made and thought out. At times it gets really challenging if you want to get the highest score, which is a good thing. Although to be honest, certain levels are just frustrating – for example, there is one level where even watching the official walkthrough doesn't help because the timing of events in game is just different from the walkthrough, leading to a lower score.Still, the game provides heaps of entertainment and keeps the player interested by introducing new mechanics every now and then.

												Puddle is perfect in almost every sense. It's a not that typical indie game, it's challenging, have a fast pace, it's finally a real fun! This is a sole indie title I played till the credits since a long time.In this game, as you can see in the trailer, you control the liquid. The only method of control is to tilt a world a little. Basically the tilt creates a height difference between the liquid and the ground and the former accelerates due to gravity. You can use a keyboard arrow keys, but I personally recommend a gamepad triggers. So, you use just two keys to progress through the whole game.The game's world is divided to several chapters, which consists of number of levels. Each chapter represent a visually and aesthetically differing surround and the type of liquid you control in it. In some chapters you have different types of liquid in different levels. You starting at Watercourse with a coffee, proceeding as a water, then going to the Nursery transforming into weed killer (Sodium chlorate + copper oxide), become a fertilizer, travelling to the Laboratory, where the liquid turns into a hydrocarbon, oil, nytroglycerine, fruit juice + technecium solution... Human Body, Sewers, Rocket, Foundry, Nuclear Power Station at last! Each type of liquid has it's unique properties, water freezes and evaporates, nytroglycerine explodes when handled without a care and lava hardens when it's far from the heat source. The gravity in zero-gravity zone is actually zero, but in the centrifuge at the nuclear station with tremendous radiation levels the gravity alters after short distance travelled. You need to adapt you reflexes and to reinvent controls patterns with almost every new world's and liquid's conditions introduced in the game. And that's really fun.For me, the most funny part was a human body chapter. It starts like a real anatomically true human body but quickly you realize, that this 'body' has nothing to do with it's real world representation. The game's 'human body' is abstract as hell. As a chapter climax, your liquid get absorbed into the circulatory system, the view gets zoomed to 500x and you find youself in a blood cappilary system. You barely can control such a microscopic amounts of substances by tilting the world, so your gamepad's triggers, being rhythmically pushed one after another, pumps the blood and your precious solution of juice and technecium, which some fool drank, will jerkily flow through the capillaries. The fun is massive.Seems like game developers had a lot of ideas and that's great they realised a good part of it. THe game doesn't just exploiting the idea and brilliant representation of realistically looking liquid physics model through the whole game, which will be a tempting approach for some indie game studios. But no, they developing and evolving the original idea level after level, adapting and transforming it. And you just keep getting amazed when new properties and world conditions get introduced.At some levels the game is really challenging. Some levels can be passed only after 30 tries or so. Some levels' obvious difficulty can leave you infuriated and with no progress. And this is undoubtedly true for the very final level. There are no chances you can beat it in one sitting.This game is great. Small graphical inconsistencies here and there, like non-working antialiasing on 1440p cannot make it not great. The whole idea and implemention are great. If you're into indie gaming and your library is not like CoD 15 and BF 5 likes all the way up and down you should probably check it out. And I presume you'll not be dissatisfied.			"

												Puddle is this kind of game I wish I could recommend.It's a physics based puzzle game with a great concept, it's creative and honestly, I did have some fun while playing it. But there are flaws that can't make me recommend it (or at least to its full price).The point is basically to make some liquid go from point A to point B, while being confronted in different situations and environments. Depending of the level, the liquids are different, with their unique properties, which makes them interact differently with their environment... although I thought that most times, whether they were different or not, the same physics applies to them.While the game has a great concept and there's a certain variety of levels for the player's entertainment, the game gets hard very quickly, and it becomes quite irritating to fail again and again a level. You can never know what's ahead, as the camera is too close to your liquid. It also seems to follow the liquid part that's in the front, and never gives you a big picture, which is pretty annoying if you have most of liquid left behind.Also, the physics and at times, whole level design, are really clunky, which is of course a real problem for a game as such, where you need to be really precise with where you take your puddle.About the great difficulty, and I’ll be frank, what immediately irritated me when I started the game: the “casual” or easy mode, is called a mode for “whiners”, where you’re allowed to skip a limited amount of levels and you won’t appear in the leader boards. To me, calling the casual mode as a mode for ""whiners"", where you ""whine"" when skipping a level, is an insult to all gamers, casual or not. It's aiming at all the ones just wanting to enjoy their games without pressure, nor wanting to have their names in some leader board unlike the normal mode (which, curiously, they haven’t renamed…).In short: Great concept, very interesting ideas but quite clunky physics which is a great problem when you need to be precise. The game gets difficult too quick for casual gamers, or as they put it, “whiners”.			"

												A physics game where you control the tilt of the screen to make a small amount of liquid move through an obstacle course. You get a better score for both being quick and not losing too much liquid.I thought it was creative and the levels were mostly well designed. Some players dislike the physics of the liquids, but I feel that it is pretty consistent for a simulation game. The camera can be downright awful sometimes as it attempts to keep as much fluid on the screen as possible, which is not a good idea when fast-paced areas cause your liquid to spread out as some parts trail behind. This makes some obstacles frustrating when you are less able to see them coming.Overall, it's a difficult game and suffers from physics bugs from time to time. I enjoyed it however, and even managed to complete all the acheivments, so it's not impossible.			"

												This game is very difficult to control, has very poor physics (Fluid should have a lot stronger cohesion) and the camera zooms in so far (compared to how far the fluid is spread out at all times) and moves so quick that you cannot exucute the main goal (keeping your liquid together) effectively, or at all if your in one of the areas with slopes more extreme than the ~25 degree tilting you can do. The game is also very aggresive and demeaning towards the player, calling them a ""Whiner"" if they play on normal mods, giving the player ""whine"" tokens to skip levels (which you often have to do seeing as it's a buggy mess).

												Puddle is a nice physics-based game. Goal of the game is to get as much as possible of a liquid to the end of the levels by tilting the gameworld left and right. Sounds easy enough but can get tricky in some levels - most levels are rather short though, so the big amount of whining about the difficulty on the Steam forums really surprised me. Finishing the game on normal difficulty settings requires some trial & error but isn't that hard, however getting gold medals on all levels (by finishing them in a short time and without losing much liquid) is definately a big challenge for all completionists out there.What makes the game really shine is how much effort the developers put into making every level unique and interesting although the player's basically pressing only two buttons over the course of the whole game. There are several liquids with different attributes and handling, most of them reacting differently to their environment (pesticide, acid, nitroglycerin, lava and more).Then there are some levels where the liquid is inside a container like a beaker or a snow globe, thus slightly changing the gameplay (there's also one level without a liquid at all which, incidentally, was the only one I didn't like).Add to that the diverse and well designed levels themselves: from an obligatory sewers level over levels inside the human body to a zero-G level in space - the game does a very good job at keeping things interesting despite its simple concept.

												Puddle is a game I have enjoyed over several months. It's probably not a game I would recommend playing straight through, but to fire up from time to time and finish a few levels, I think it's good fun and worth it to have. I say this because depending on who you are it could be frustrating to finish certain levels or achievements. To me this is a good thing, as it adds playtime and I always feel accomplished when I finish a level that was difficult for me. Some people may not like it, but I laughed a good bit over the ""whine"" button and the message you get when you're choosing the difficulty. So much so that I shared this with friends who don't own the game. Hilarious, and I thank the devs for including those gems!Even on my toaster for a PC the game looks beautiful, and runs fairly well. If you're a patient person, who doesn't get butthurt over jokes and like arcade-type games, I think Puddle is definitely worth having in your library.			"

												Very fun. Each level adds something new to the game from the liquids consistancy to the different obstacles you must avoid. It's a simple yet horribly fustrating puzzle game with plenty of levels to keep you entertained. The music is great too. My only real complaint is there are sometimes not enough direction in some levels - like after spending all this time NOT evaporating the liquid to suddenly going into a level where the objective is to evaportate as much liquid as you can. I was baffled and had to redue the level multiple times before finally figuring out that I was supposed to be doing the opposite of everything the game told me to do in previous levels. Who knows though, I might just be bad at ths game haha. Either way its a fun game that I was suggest to anyone looking for an almost mellow puzzle game.			"

												A fun physics game that got difficult towards the end.  I used a controller, and there are really only 2 buttons for this game.  You can tilt the screen left or right to make your liquid move.  The liquids vary from level to level, which keeps things interesting.  For example, water evaporates if you get it close to heat, while nitroglycerine explodes.  And each new liquid's unique traits come into play in the levels.  You can skip levels if you get frustrated, but you have a finite number of skips (that you can earn back if you do eventually beat a level you skipped).  I had fun, but eventually quit without beating it, as it doesn't have a checkpoint system and I got frustrated by later levels.			"

												While the game may be great for some it just didn't work for me. The game just didn't feel good to actually play. It doesn't feel like you have much control over what is happening at all and you are just watching it play out. Your only controls are tilting the screen back and forth which has very little affect on the liquid and only makes minor changes like you either will or won't make it past the obstacle if you aren't pressing the correct way. What makes it frustrating is that even if you hold the opposite direction completely the liquid still keeps moving along the path with or without you making you feel like you are just along for the ride and not actually figuring anything out.

												This game is sometimes fun though I must say some mechanics like not knowing ahead of time that you will need your liquid to be at a particular X static position beforehand is kinda average.Same with the camera which can't be altered at all and will sometimes just force you to forget about some of the liquid left behind...(even though you could get it but since your camera doesn't show it, it's not always easy to control)It's a bit frustrating as there is very limited amount of controls available so it would not have been overwhelming to add a camera control scheme in my opinion.The UI is slightly ... unintuitive , like for example have a hard time interpreting the results of scoring Also the game taunting you with his ""whine"" button is a deal breaker for mealso a controller/gamepad might be more precise to play.Though despite all that, it can have it's fun moments.

												Such a disgustingly terribly game.The scoring system is bad.  You don't know what you're being scored on until you finish each run.  On some runs you need to conserve fluid, on others you need to be as fast as possible.  Unfortunately, there is literally no way of telling which level is which type until you've reached the end.Further, the game is heavily trial and error.  There are many curves and jumps that you need to be going a certain speed over to clear them successfully, but you have had to set that speed up two or three jumps previous, and often a few screen lengths away.  Also, you can't scroll the screen, so you can't look ahead.Further still, the game is physics based, so your run is a little bit random each time as any slight variation (including random chance) modifies the position of your fluid, making some levels impossible on some runs.To cap this trifecta of fail off, the whole time the game is making fun of you for your forced failure, calling you a 'whiner' for skipping levels that you get overly frustrated in because of aforementioned trial and error gameplay, laughing at your poor times and mocking your difficulty choice.What would have been a neat physics game was outright ruined by terrible design practices.  90% of the game's issues could be fixed if the score system was published before a run, and if there was a map or scrolling overview of each run shown before you began.Do not buy this game.  Do not let your friends buy this game.  Do not support this company.			"

												Another patience-testing physics game with a frustrating control scheme that's probably more suited to a tablet. The liquid in Puddle moves at such an awkward, sluggish pace that predicting the necessary movements becomes a chore of trial and error. Occasionally, the liquid will respond in a completely bizarre way, travelling uphill for no apparent reason. The camera is also confusing, sometimes following the liquid at the front and other times following the largest mass of liquid, which can make it either impossible to control the majority of liquid or impossible to see what's coming next. I guess Puddle could be entertaining for anyone who enjoys failure and repetition, but for everyone else it's probably worth giving a pass.			"

												I played this on a tablet and I didn't enjoy it. I think the most irritating is the camera. You never know what's ahead of you, so you need to learn the level by heart using trial and error. Sometimes the camera follows a single drop off the liquid that was too fast and leaves the most of the liquid behind. Of course developers insulting players (""whining"") is also never a good idea.

In fact, watch the video of the game and you can see it -- the fluid behaves wildly, there are pixel-perfect jumps happening in them...This is not to say the game is bad, but it does not work for me (meaning: I don't get much fun from it)			"

The levels artwork is awesome like the X-Ray photograph levels where you are inside a humans body or painted levels with almost the style of ""Doodle Jump"".Some levels are not easy even if you already know what to do. Has a Normal Mode and a Hardcore Mode, in Normal you can often skip levels, in Hardcore you don't have that much skips and you can earn gold medals.For arround 10€ it's worth to buy. 8/10			"

												Dive into Puddle, a game unlike any other where you have to guide a puddle of fluid by tilting the environment to the left or right! Play carefully taking friction, gravity and temperature into account, and by using the unique properties of each type of fluid (water, oil, nitroglycerin, molten lava...) in a range of original environments. Conserve as much fluid as possible when crossing a variety of obstacles such as burning passageways, carnivorous plants and electric currents!			"

												An interesting but very frustrating physics simulation, turned into a game. You are responsible for a volume of liquid, and you have to ""tilt"" the world around you in order to control where the liquid flows.A lot of the levels seem to be designed poorly, to the point that even when playing on Normal, the ""difficulty so easy that even (the creator's) grandma can get a gold medal on every level"", I have a hard time making it through some of the -beginning- levels.You're even given ""whiner"" tokens to help you get past the levels that are either broken/buggy or not even worth playing. I can't recommend this game, even if you pick it up in a bundle for a dollar.			"

												Looks nice and will destroy your nerves. Seriously, this game is frustrating as something. Mostly because of the controls, the ""physics"" aren't realistic but more or less free for all and don't follow a pattern you'd expect. So if you don't mind to replay a level dozens of times again and again and again to beat one little level that punishes you for one mistake with an instant fail, feel free to give Puddle a try. I didn't really enjoy it.			"

												""Puddle"" is pretty much a liquid-based platformer with the same physics as ""Vessel"". The levels range from either very simplistic or irritatively impossible, neither of which merit any fun. If you enjoyed ""Vessel"", tread lightly on playing this game; if you did not enjoy ""Vessel"" don't even bother buying it.			"

												Ah, physics games.  What's not to love about them? This one is fun and challenging as you have to make sure to keep whatever liquid you're guiding around each level stays in contact as much as possible.  Gotta have the closest to the original amount left! I will say this though... TRYING TO EARN GOLD MEDALS (aka - best ranking possible for a level) CAN BE A PAIN IN THE A$$!! But I love it anyhow! :PDefinitely check this game out if you can and if you like physics games then why aren't you already trying to make sure your puddle of water isn't drying out in the fires already?!?!!

												It's boringThere is no plot which leaves the gameplay. You can sort of rotate the screen so that the water moves in certain directions. You don't get 360 degrees of range so you have to mind momentum and it’s a bit tricky. However, there aren't many obstacles in the way other than ""just don't touch me"" so the ""puzzles"" are boring (if you would even call them that). I gave up after an antigravity stage because you aren’t controlling water! Don't change the mechanics. Also, the end of every ""world"" has you doing something completely different. What?Overall, I got bored of the game and gave up after it crashed my system. "

												Puddle is an interesting little game that's generally relaxing but occasionaly frustrating, and a decent timekiller which I tentatively recommend. Puddle -as you may have seen- is sort of a physics based puzzle/platformer. You indirectly control puddles by tilting the screen around. Most levels are obstacle courses which you must skillfully navigate to the end of as fast and efficiently as you can. When you complete a level, you are ranked by two criteria: time spent, and liquid lost. Though it's not necessary to get a medal to advance to the next level, ranking well can unlock certain achievements and objects for the ingame sandbox. Levels have numerous hazards which often correspond to the theme of the current chapter you are in. You journey from a kitchen table, to a laboratory, to a botancial garden, to the sewers, and to even more interesting locales.As you progress, events of the game cause a series of reactions much akin to a Rube Goldberg machine (those 20+ step contraptions you see in old cartoons which ultimately do one simple thing) which wind up changing the liquid you control. In fact, your liquid can even become sticky rat goo, heavy contrast materials in the human body, and various gels! The great thing about each new substance is their new properties which reflect at least semi-realistically how they'd act in real life, and how each will have a special quality not seen in any other substance. For example, in the botancial gardens chapter you use both weedkiller and fertilizer, and you have to figure out when to kill plants, or when to grow something, or even how to tip a plant over by running your liquid across it. In my opinion the single greatest strength of this game is how well they keep things fresh by changing up scenarios, even if occasionally a substance may react a bit differently then how I'd expect it to in real life. The only examples I can definitely think of are the water and ink. They both should probably move faster, though the water should have a greater degree of cohesiveness due to the surface tension which ink lacks. The ink should be much harder to control and bleed everywhere. Now I'd like to quickly address some other aspects. I liked the visuals a lot. The visuals are a pretty big draw because each chapter has different color palettes, cutscenes are animated pretty well, and almost every level has it's own background. I only noticed a few repeated backgrounds or stage assets (ignoring levers and buttons of course). As for the music, I think it's okay. Not great. Suitable for the game I suppose but not really memeorable, moving, or something I'd listen to outside of the game. Next up is the sparse story. It's cool how everything flows together, but ultimately it could have used more personality. The story told is just a means to an end effectively, so I guess it really IS like a Rube Goldberg machine. Second to last gripe here would be the lack of content for the sandbox thing. It doesn't have a lot of accessible assets and it has a low cap on how much can be onscreen, despite it being a very small box, which limits creativity a bunch. Finally, the difficulty. Whoo boy can this game get tough. Only 2.3% of people have actually finished the game because the later levels can get mean. Some levels do require a lot of memorization or fine tuning, so you'll wind up having to run them multitudinous times, which can get pretty agravating.All said and done, if you like the core concept, striving to improve your scores, and don't mind some particularly tough challenges now and again, then this might be worth your time. For $8 I'd say maybe to most people, but if it's $4 or under, everyone should give it a thought-though don't expect it to blow you away by any measure. 6.5/10			"

												Interesting game. While puzzles can seem repetitive, they're fun. The liquid physics make it a fun game to pass some time. One thing I don't like is the clunky controls. I wish the controls were more advanced.7.8/10			"

												Well I finally finished this. The game starts out well, but then things get weird with radioactive♥♥♥♥♥♥dissolving rats, rockets from space dropping capsules into smelters, fire trucks being destroyed by debris from fires.... and other stuff. The ending is also mundane. Can I recommend this? No really, the level design is bad in quite a few places and there are two levels where skipping is mandatory because of this. I think I bought this game at a time when portal 2 had wowed me with liquid physics and I wanted to see more.			"

												Puddle is a liquid physics platformer, for the better part of the game you control liquid which you much guide to the end of each level. Obstacles and hazards stand in your way, if you venture too close to these the liquid ""protagonist"" will diminish, lose too much mass and it's game over. It's a unique idea, at any rate I haven't heard of another liquid physics platformer out there. As you progress through the game you will encounter a lot of different mechanics as well as different liquids (which each have their own properties). I will say that I appreciate and applaud the many great ideas that the developers had for these different levels, and the overall variety from biome to biome (and sometimes even from level to level) was one of the most enjoyable aspects of this game.Unfortunately, it is also one of the worst aspects of the game. While a lot of these levels were enjoyable to play, others however were downright frustrating and even counter-intuitive at times. I don't discredit the interesting ideas behind some of these problematic levels, but somewhere along the lines something didn't translate. If I didn't know any better, I feel like this might have been noticed during testing and Q&A, because one of the ""features"" of the game is the ability to skip levels by using the ""Skip and Whine"" feature. Sounds to me like somewhere along the lines the developers were aware of these frustrating and poorly design levels and rather than remove or improve, they decided to add a skip feature mocking who should so dare to dislike a level.This is conjecture of course, what I can say that levels like the ones where your controls are reversed for the entire level ended up making me hate playing the game. It might be worth picking up in a bundle, especially if you are unlike me and don't mind using the ""skip and whine"" feature, just be warned that you can only ""skip and whine"" so many levels until you have to go back and beat some of them to skip more. At the end of the day, I was glad when I beat the game. Not because I was glad to beat it, but I was glad it was over. I will reiterate that there is a lot of great ideas in the game, plenty which work, but it's the bad ones that really put a stopper to the enjoyment and have ultimately led me to rate this down.			"

												In its concept, Puddle proposes us, quite simply, to lead liquids of varying types from point A to point B, with, of course, a certain number of difficulties along the way and a limit for the minimum of liquid you have to bring to the finish line. Nothing particular here, but, as often, it is the way in which this concept is given form that makes the game really enjoyable. In the case of Puddle, the art design does a big part of the job. It is smooth, detailed, out of time, and even, on some rare occasions, a bit poetic. The game is divided into several environments corresponding to a theme, with in each 6 levels. It ranges from the sewers to flora to laboratories, even taking you inside the human body.While on the environment, there is an electroacoustic music accompanying us in the perillous journey of the liquids, sometimes calm, sometimes dynamic, and I've found the soundtrack quite enjoyable overall (and I'm glad the devs made it available in a dlc, best to be bought during Steam sales).In terms of gameplay, it couldn't be simpler: just tilt the screen left and right with the arrow keys for the liquid to move forward or backward. Of course, some parts will require that you measure your speed, or that you adjust yourself so as to make good use of the specifities of some of the environments (such as fans, slopes, sticky parts...). However, the nature of the liquid also comes into play, and it will force you to adapt to each one (water and organic wastes do not move in the same way, obviously). There are, more or less, as much types of liquids as there are environments, but you will find some variations on certain levels. The last level of each environment will give you a bit of a change in the gameplay, though. It acts as the equivalent of a ""boss battle"", without a boss, granted, but with added specificities in the task at hand (getting the right amount of two liquids in a glass bottle while it moves on a device, for example). A welcome change after struggling in the previous challenges. Regarding the difficulty, two settings are proposed: a relatively easy one (I insist on the ""relatively""), in the form of chocolate medals (for the ""whiny players""), or a hardcore one with metal medals. The rewards are based both on time and on how much liquid you were able to save.If I didn't really suggest it so far, the devs don't take themselves too seriously, which is a good point in my book. To finish with, the negative things. There's only one that comes to my mind: the camera. At some points you will find yourself with your liquid being a bit scattered, either because that's inevitable (hopefully rarely) or because of a miscalculation. In these situations, the camera seems confused so as to how much of a zoom back it must make so that you keep an eye on what has been temporaly lost along the way. More often than not, it will keep its focus on the most forward part of the liquid, making it very difficult  for the player to gather it back. It is a bit annoying considering that, deadly obstacles apart, the game will consider a patch of liquid lagging too much behind as lost, and will remove it from your reserve. It doesn't spoil the pleasure of playing, far from it, but it is to be noted.As a side note, and camera appart, the game is not buggy at all, and I don't find it redundant, at least with the way I play to it. For the length of the game... I've got a bit more than five hours on it at the moment of writing, and I have completed 5 out of 8 of the available environments on ""whiny"" difficulty.To sum up, a lovely, humorous little game which is quite enjoyable. Best to be played little by little in my view.			"

												This game could have been interesting and all, but it has a major flaw : when your liquid get separated (and it will be a lot of times), camera will follow only the one ahead, meaning that you will end up loosing everything not on screen because you can't  make it avoid the traps you can't see either.Still, to be fair about his game, I must add that the physics are good, the environments are varied and beautiful and the controls are accurate (otherwise it would not be playable at all).

												I will tell you three facts about this game:NUMBER ONE: It's a simple but enjoyable game. If it's $4 or less, possibly worth it.NUMBER TWO: Easily playable even if you have hooves instead of hands since the only controls consist of right and left clicking the mouse.NUMBER THREE: All these fluids through pipes is like a mechanical engeneers wet dream...if you are into that. The game will make you thirsty, or want to pee. Or both.			"

												I really loved this game, it was fun and challenging (And insanely rage enducing if you play on Extreme, and go for all the gold medals!), I was really surprised with how many REALLY different levels there are, and how many different liquids you get to be. It stays fresh and new throughout the entire game. Love these kind of indie games, and I'm currently looking for more like this, but this game is unique as hell, so its very hard.			"
