												Don't be turned off so quickly by all of the other bad reviews – I would say that some of these people are stuck on ""beauty is skin deep.""  I can agree with the other reviewers in some aspects; if you have big standards for shiny polish on games, you might want to avoid this one.  The graphics are dated, the controls take some getting used to (I keep having to look at the configuration to figure out what I pressed by accident, even after 15 hours).  There are bugs and CTD's.  You can’t dock with T-gates sometimes or steer.  The camera gets stuck at odd angles on occasion and you have to change sectors to fix it.  The music selection leaves a bit to be desired.  The radio chatter is repeatable.  One guy complained the tutorial was too long!  I found it was just right for the complexity of the game and it got the basics down quite quickly.  You just have to wait patiently for them to read all the text on the screen out (there is no “click to skip”).  As for graphics, the sector backdrops are a bit washed out for my liking, I love the colorful and crisp sector graphics in X3.  The music, though quite good, has a very limited number of tracks and is quite repeatable. HOWEVER, this game has engaged me happily for over 20 hours now, and I’m only halfway through the campaign with very little extra exploration.  The campaign can be challenging at some times, but I found it was a bit too easy to make money and afford a dreadnaught.  It seems you need to do this in order to make good progress in the campaign.  At one stage in the campaign you lose your ship, however you keep all of your equipment and cash.  No problem, at that time I had enough to buy three new dreadnaughts.  So yes, the campaign is a bit out of balance sometimes.  In the campaign, there is a lot of ""fly to this sector, blow up this ship, then fly to that sector.""  But it's all wrapped up in a package that keeps it enjoyable, as you search for derelict ships to loot, Rogue containers to crack open and steal goodies from, and fight off pirates that randomly attack you.  You can speed up monotonous travel by getting a T-Drive, but then you miss out a lot of the sightseeing opportunities along the way, and also chances to dock at stations to find better equipment than what you already have.  If you are excited by the prospect of boarding and capturing ships, this game does it nicely!  If you love to customize ship equipment (weapon slots, shield slots, engine slots), you'll enjoy this game.  If you want to play with over 50 different ships, each having different special abilities, you'll enjoy this game.  If you like RPG-style characters, where you can focus on specific weapon types (beam vs. plasma) and improve your skills as you level up, you'll enjoy this game.  You can even hire different officers, each which will add to your perks or boost one or more of your ship stats.  The game gives you the possibility to line up your stats and perks to make an ultra-powerful beam-equipped ship destroys everything easily, until you hit an enemy who has shields and equipment specifically set up to resist beam weapons.  Then you’re screwed.  What fun!!!The game has many aspects familiar to Freelancer - faction names and how they're handled, station names, station designs, radio chatter, jump gates.  It also shares common control mechanisms with Eve Online, including 2D controls, ship configurations and character skill leveling.  I wouldn't call it a ""rip off"" of any other game; rather it combines many of the great elements from other games, while setting up a solid new story and universe to enjoy them in.  It's all tied together quite well in an engaging way, and I am continuously reminded of fond times I had playing Freelancer and Eve in years past.  I have been looking awhile now for a good new space game to enjoy.  After playing SG1, I am even more excited now for the release of SG2.  Well done, Little Green Men!			"

												I really can't recommend Starpoint Gemini. This was LGM Games' first project, and I'm afraid it shows. I can see what they were going for, but it just doesn't come together in a satisfying way. Presentation-wise, the game manages to look dated (ship models) and beautiful (nebulas and planet vistas) at the same time. I can live with that. I could't live with the voice acting though, which I'm sure must be done by the dev team, or someone they kidnapped off the street. Fortunately for the sake of your sanity you can turn this off. More worrying though is the UI, which is confused, overly complicated, and a royal pain in the ♥♥♥. Even basics such as turning your ship aren't handled well: you can either left click to turn the ship towards the point you clicked, which is useless for anything to the side or behind you, or you can hit the A and D keys which turn the ship in what seem like 30 degree increments per press, with multiple presses resulting in prolonged spinning until the key presses wear off. It's manageable once you get used to it, but it's painful and makes combat a drag. That's a pity because the combat engine is fun at first, it's nicely tactical and lasers sizzle and whump appropriately, but I found it soon became frustrating due mainly to the very high early difficulty; your ship only has a narrow firing arc, everything else it seems can out-turn you, so lining up to take a shot means your front shields are quickly toasted with you being barbequed shortly afterwards.The other problem is that the living universe is merciless, and high level rogue (pirate) ships crash your nice low-level party with frustrating regularity. I had to replay the first mission about four times because I kept getting jumped by high level pirates that laid waste to everyone including my puny level 1 ship. It's a pity the quicksave button doesn't work, because you have to save a lot... except it doesn't actually let you save during the prolonged and tedious dialogs and during mission events. Eventually you start to get a handle on things, and there were moments such as the first time I flew inside a nebula that the game almost starts to sing, but then it's gone. Side-missions from stations largely involve flying to a point and clicking a couple of icons, or flying to a rogue ship and getting blasted within seconds. After a few hours I realised that I just wasn't having any fun because I'd played this game before in much better forms. However, the silver lining is Starpoint Gemini 2, which is apparently so massively better as to be a completely different game. I'd start there if I were you.			"

												Got this game with the early access of the second one and i have to say I cant believe i missed this one! ok the voice acting is pretty basic and its a bit old now but if you want a game where you can have epic battles like sins well this is it! I love it because its different! ive played many space sims but this one is a gem! best way to put this game is a cross between star trek and sins.			"

												Starpoint Gemini is a very good game in many ways. The missions are great and test your skills almost to a point of frustration (Save often). After each mission you are given free play untill you reach a certain level at which time the next mission begins, this free play time is to make money and upgrade your ship, weapons and shields, use it to your advantage and the missions are a little easier, squander them or rush to advance makes life tough.Downsides are the game is based on an unrealistic 2 planes (no up or down) and the frequent crashes when jumping to new systems (game autosaves at each jumpgate so when it crashes you restart at the gate you crashed at). There are other little downsides in the game, like slow docking, random attacks that you can't win (again, save often) and systems that don't load right in the missions (not often) that makes you reload to continue.Although this game is a little weak on realistic space flight it is a very engaging game that I find myself playing for hours on end and seldom tire of. It has it's quirks as any game does and if you ever played a game called Freelancer this game would be a distant second, but I love to play it and would recommend it to anyone who loves open universe space epics. Great missions and storyline mixed with great free play make this one a must have.			"

												I wanted to like this game. I put over 70 hours into it. What I liked about it was the simplified controls - WSAD. The game was easy to get into. Despite the Russian voice acting, there was a storyline of sorts. What hooked me initially was the desire to upgrade my ship, weaponry, shields, equipment and captain skills.  The combat system is essentially about shield management and trying to manoeuvre your ship to the enemies weakest point (typically rear) whilst delivering maximum damage. Many times I found myself spinning my ship so I could round-robin fire my weapons to suit their firing arc. Play the game and you will understand what I mean. There are missions to do and what is akin to boss fights. But it all gets a bit monotonous. Mining is boring. The missions are repetitive. Travelling to different sectors is tedious, having to navigate to the jump points. The T-drive makes it a little easier, but some missions require jumps of 10 sectors or more, which is a chore.Having maxed out my ship, crew and talents, I kept playing the game, hoping for a grand finale. It was a let down. I persisted with this game and I should not have. Oh it also crashes regularly, so save often.			"

												SPG is far from a polished release. It has lots of little problems, copious disabling of the save function, clunky dialogue with a horrible translation, annoyingly repetitive and random voice overs, some horrible accents and voice acting, a simplistic ui with no customization that routinely conflicts with itself, dated graphics, few ease of life features like map waypoints/autopilot/market comparisons, labourious buying and selling procedure, you can only have one ship at any one point, tiny module inventory in each station, split functionality between the overview and radar map, balance which ensures the majority of the ships (ie the smaller ones) are redunant for the later game, HORRIBLE collision detection between your ship and asteroids (You will exclaim at some point during your playthrough ""I was ♥♥♥♥ing miles from that asteroid!""), and there are probably other things I am forgetting.However despite all this they still manage to craft an engaging experience. The plot is interesting, the world is large, combat and movement is simplified but not too simple and the missions have a bit of variety.As the above paragraphs should attest, it's faults are many and varied and on the surface may seem to outweigh the positives but it somehow adds up to (mostly) fun. I am 32 hours in and still going strong.			"

												Remember to save up a ton of money - or sell your ship - before you're called in to do a certain space station defense story mission. Otherwise, you'll end up destroying all the enemies just because you can -> Proceed to complete the mission -> then watch as your ship gets blown up because there were ""too many enemies"" and someone had to stay behind as bait for the evacuation.  Huh?  Didn't you blow them all up?On the very next mission, you end up in a weaponless shuttle with no afterburners and paper-thin shields.  Your mission?  Infiltrate a heavily guarded military compound deep in the heart of enemy territory.  Wow, lo and behold, the alarm trips while you're right in the middle and you have to escape.Not...happening.  In a fit a frustration, on the 5th restart or so, I broke story and used the money I had left to purchase a ship with weapons, loaded it with the best gizmos for its class (jump drive and afterburners not optional), and proceeded to barely survive that mission.This game has that and more plot holes.  Mainly, whoever had designed the game continually assumes you're still piloting that dinky starting freighter instead of working your ♥♥♥ off to buy a class 10 dreadnought with the latest upgrades.That wasn't all that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off, this game took a page from Freelancer and added radio chatter.  However, if you listen closely to the radio chatter, it ends up being one of three things.  Something about law enforcement are all pigs.  Some guy being interdicted and scanned.  And something else.  Wow, I'm happy that I'm finally forgetting what they were saying.  After listening to the inane chatter for the several hours that I played the game, you'd think it'd have sunk in more.  Ah, but wait till you get into battle.  Then you're treated to a hostile cacophony and some small schmuck in the background threatening to kill you.  No, seriously.  It's like you're in a noisy nightclub and there's some guy with the band singing an accompaniment of death threats at odd times.And don't even get me started on getting killed at the very beginning because my level 1 ship can't stand up to a level 20 pirate.  Actually, I thought that was interesting.  Never mind.Still, I think the game has far too many stupid issues to be recommendable.			"

												I'm torn.I'm NOT recommending thisa game, despite my love for its mechanic, its tactics and its interactivity; not because it's dated, not because there's a few bugs here and there and not because of the awful dialogue in the story mode - because ultimately, they actually kind of endear me to the title.  It's because of the lack of certain features.Cross Freelancer with Star Trek Legacy and you've pretty much got the general premise, barring the storyline - which, in and of itself, isn't ridiculous... it's just the dialogue that's awful.So what's missing that's so damned important if I'm going to be so forgiving in other realms of the game?The trading system.  The core of being a merhant.  THis game invites you to scan and mine, scan and board, scavenge from derelicts, even pick up cargo and flog it elsewhere... BUT where?In games like Freelancer (being the best and closest example to this game), but also in the likes of the X series or Elite, Starpoint Gemini boasts the opportunity to be a merchant and make so money via filling your cargo hold and getting that stuff to someone who might actually pay for it... but you have absolutely no way of knowing WHERE that might be - there's no tickerline to tell you that System A has  deal on XYZ, while System B is desperate for XYZ and will pay +50% of the going rate.If you examine an item in the commodities, and equipment but there's no problem with the systems mechanic at all, you can learn the Average Price of that commodity (assumably in relation to all the ports in the game) and then when you go to purchase it then, and only then, can you determine it's actual price in the outpost you're in at the time.This makes for some really slow commodity training and then flying about without a clue who will pay more for your goods is infuriating: eg.:Picked up Holoparts and Medical Supplies from a gaff in Kingsway (I think) at 20 to 30 over the average market price (which isn't actually that bad by all accounts) because it'd been the lowest price I'd seen for a wee bit.  Then went hunting through the next 7 systems trying to find someone who would buy them for more - scouring every station, every hole, every system in the hopes of selling at a profit.Now, maybe I could see if there's a wiki, but why should I?  Yeah, I would consider the sandbox mode over the story mode for further play (due to the significant difficulty of having a new ship in time to run head long, within the story, in to a sortie of ships that far outclass my own and all the other Bots just fold and die a bit too quickly to be useful) and that might give me enoigh time to figure out trade lanes for myself, but I could get that same action from Freelancer or the X series, heck even EVE Online if I was so inclined.I want to like this game, I do likle this game, I just can't recommend it because of some potentially game-breaking features that NEEDED to be in the game.Oh, and beware the Tutorial.  It is magnificently literal - you WILL LEARN one step at a time and NO faster!Plus, if you still fancy a bash at this game, which, for it's age is still a bit on the awesome grrovy side in my humble opinion, I'd STRONGLY consider the following:Specialise in no more than 5 skills and be careful which officers you hire...Remap your controls!  No seriously, rethink how to make this game work through re-mapping; personally, I managed to really ramp up my effectiveness by employing an almost WoW like fasy-key logic - transferring power, burst fire, distress call, docking, scans, boarding etc. all within one row of keys and suddenly I'm a devastating force of nature...  in Sandbox mode... :DThis could be the game for you, but if it is, you're going to have a few moments where you want to ask the developper why they missed a couple of bits out, but then you might just love it because of what was essentially a lovely build based on a hither-to under-exploited game genre, but then Freelancer is a pretty tough game to top, am I right?  ;)			"

												For the patient player willing to spend the time to work through the lengthy hour-long tutorial, Starpoint Gemini delivers a rich, polished space exploration freelancer experience.  The game supports widescreen resolutions, the Steam Overlay, and is complimented by a relaxing musical score.  Unfortunately, the graphics are inferior to other space titles such as X3, and the Russian accented narration is nearly unintelligible at points, this game is a solid edition to the genre.  If you enjoy games like X3 or EVE online, you will probably find much to like in Starpoint Gemini.			"

												A space sandbox with a strong Elite/Freelancer feel. A big open world, load of different ships, weapons, factions, tactics - everything that makes a good space sandbox is included. Very simple to learn and play. Decent consistent plot. Some bugs, none are game-breaking, most are easily circumvented. Voice acting is a bit lame.Overall - very nice game for the money. Expect 20-50 hours of gameplay before you finish the plot line/get bored of playing.  Good if you want to try out the genre without much effort. And buy the second game. It is better in every way.Things to consider before you buy- it's a ""2,5d"" game, with very basic physics.- You do not pilot a small single-seat ship, you command a large vessel with gun turrets and crew.- Some RPG elements are present.

												Starpoint Gemini is a very good ""Space Trader"" style game for first timers. There are a lot of the ""Space Trader"" games out there, and some can get a bit confusing as to how to handle the game. This game is a bit more simplified ina sense that, although the game is in 3D, space flight isn't. Not to imply that space flight games SHOULDN'T be 3D, but if you want simple, you can't get much simplier than this.Starpoint Gemini allows you to play either in a campaign or play as if you were a freelance for hire. Campaign is pretty straight forward, complete missions to get to the end of a story. Endless mode (If you will) lets you do what you want without having to complete missions. As long as you are making money, you can do anything you want. Upgrade your ship, help space stations handle a few pesky space pirates, or even participate in a free for all battle to be able to win the best ship and equipment. Or, if you feeling lucky, maybe you want to take on the entire galazy and be the ruthless pirate and space crook there is, just kill everyone you meet.Because flight is in 2D, it's simple to find where you are going and getting to where you need to go without having to be able to understand the concept of space flight in general. Also, getting from one location to another is also simple. Just follow the flight plan and follow which jump gates take you to any sector you want to go. A simple game for people who love space flight, but don't want an overly complicated game. Who knows, maybe once you learn to play this game, you might move up to Starpoint Gemini 2 or some more to your liking.			"

												I recommend it but realize this is with hesitation.  The bugs, oh the bugs.  There are many, some are potentially game breaking (read: save often and on multiple files), and some required frequent restarting the game for me (an audio glitch that would grow until it is unbareable).  The game completely lacks polish and it uses frowned upon mechanics to extend gameplay (e.g. requirement to level up 1-3 levels to progress the plot even though levels aren't even really useful beyond level 15 and having to occassionally travel through a dozen sectors to get to where you need to be).  So, why do I recommend it?  Because despite those bugs, I thought it was fun.  The combat was challenging.  Hunting for parts to upgrade the ship was entertaining and rewarding.  The plot, despite poor voice overs and bad grammar, was interesting enough to keep me playing.  The game is an exercise in patience so be mindful of that if you're considering buying it.The game logged over 30 hours to beat it on ""Captain"" (normal) difficult.  Steam logged over 41 hours.

												Wow. They have fixed most of the bugs. Now as to the first mission with the DLC (Timebreach) there is a way around the bug. You will lose your ship, but you can still dock with a station and purchase another one if you have credits saved. Ok you gotta fish around for parts, and it's inconvenient, but it's doable. As to the game, I've really enjoyed it so far, mission depth and some which make you think fast to just survive. They are all survivable though. Only thing I can't seem to find is a Cloak Officer for my Level 5 cloak for my Dreadnought. lol. I'll just have to dock at every single station I come across till I get one I guess. Anyway, it's been really enjoyable, and I recommend the game to others who like a space sim. The controls are a little tricky to get used to, but you do, eventually.			"

												I was a bit hasty in my original review for this game. Once I reduced the punishing difficulty, I found the game to be quite rewarding. Flying around, collecting new weapons and buying bigger ships is a lot of fun. This game reminds me a lot of Starfleet Command, and I reccomend this to fans of that game, especially if you wished there was more to do in those games then just combat. Like actually docking at stations, mining minerals for profit. Capturing ships and having said capture actually benifit you.if you are sceptical about this game, I have read lots of good things about its sequal. you could look there instead.***Original Review***I read many of the reviews for this game but still thought that it would be a good game for myself anyway. At first, it did show promice. A ""Starfleet Command"" like game for the modern era. Sadly I found the game to be a bit punishing at its normal dificulty.I still think the premice is good, and I with it's sequal in Early Acsess as of this review (and hopefully the game is being molded by the community because of that), I do hope that the 2nd game is better then the 1st. Sadly though, I must give my disrecomendation for the series' cornerstone.			"

												It's boring, unbalanced, and way longer than it should be.  I got this on the cheap beacuse it looked liked , and from what some other people said, felt like the old Star Trek Starfleet command games.  But it isn't.  It's like they got the engine and took out a bunch of fetures that made the game playable.  It's huge guess to know if a subsystem is completely fixed or not.  The hit-boxes are WAY bigger than they should be on objects in space like debris and asteroids.  You can be well out of the objects way and still take damage.  God help you if you go into the small debris feilds, you just become a space pinball and bounching all over the place and explode, because no matter what speed you do, you take the same amount of damage.  Combat is unbalenced.  Some ships abilities are completely OP and/or unless.  You can be swarmed so esaily, even in the biggest ship you'll still get killed.  And that mostly happens during main missions where they're annoying cutscenes you can skip fast enough.  I did enjpy the Fleelancer aspect of the game but that got old really fast.  Just don't get this game.  The second one looks better but I don't know, I haven't bought or played it yet.  This game is so bad it's forced me to buy Sins of a Solar Empire Rebellion at full price with DLC just to play a good space related game.

												I'd like to think people would come to my defense if someone said something untrue or false about me and after reading so many negative reviews and scores on this game, I wanted to, as a fan of the space sim genre and a gamer, come to the defense of this game but after 8 or so hours.......let me explain....I really wanted to give this game a chance and I did try despite it's....flaws, however minor or major, which I will explain because I can't stand criticism without a reason. I was having fun, once I learnt the ropes, which buttons do what, how missions work, how I make money, a very basic frame that works. There are missions from various space stations, you can mine rocks to sell the ore to stations, buy commodities low and sell high. Upgrade your ship or buy a completely new and more powerfull ship with better upgrade slots, hire officers for your ship wich give you certain abilities and basically do whatever the heck you like in an open world sandbox space sim. The ideas themselves work, it's what you'd expect to find in this type of game. Right, so where did I find it went wrong?Generally the first thing a gamer notices is the graphics but that's only the most obvious thing and it doesn't make a game. With SPG it's in your face, very noticable that for a 2011/12 game, you'd expect a little more bells and whistles. I have to say the thing I found most grating was the voice acting, I'm not sure if they were genuine accents or acting but in all honesty I HAD to read the subtitles because I couldn't understand a thing the actors were saying, let alone differentiate one from another. The controll of the ship was jumpy, if you use the keyboard for turning there is a massive jump in direction, too sensitive. And if you use the mouse for control, particularly durning combat, it feels janky. Using the mouse you need to mouselook as well as turn to the direction of the enemy ship...very difficult. I found it a lot easier to use the mouse for looking and selecting during combat and the keyboard for turning. BUT, for some reason the worst thing I encountered amongst a list of others, was the fact that you have so many skills that you could easily use and are quite helpfull...but only one action bar with 5 slots........I tried to reason with myself: "" I don't need to use 10 or more skills do I?"" But simply put, if anyone at all found more than 5 skills usefull, they have every right to damn well use them and be able to equip them on the quickbar. In actual fact, I found myself using active pause so I could swap out the 10 other skills I wanted to use....to much frustration!!!! Games are supposed to be fun! And I did find this enjoyable but the negatives outweighed the posatives for me, the quickbar thing was for me the gamebreaker, the point where the enjoyment turned into the frustration. I did overlook the graphics, voice acting and overcame the quirkiness of the controll methods initially but if I can't use 6+ abilities on the fly or at will by clicking an icon on that hotbar then it's a game I'm unable to play at it's full potential. One last word. Unfortunately also, there is very little on the web about SPG, no lets play vids no walkthroughs and not much or nothing on tactics or hints on how to play. I was hoping to go through the story of the game before I played SPG 2, which incedentally has so much more info and hype around it that it's predecessor and for good reason. So at this stage, I can't recommend SPG.			"

												This is just bad.  The controls are clunky, the voice acting is terrible, and man-o-man the graphics.  For a game that came out in 2011 it looks like it would have been right at home on a CompUSA shelf in 1998.  If you're looking for a space sim go for X3 if you want single player (that came out 3 years before this but looks like it came out 20 years after it) or for the masochist's out there try EvE Online.

												If you like a game that feels like a cross between Freelancer and Starfleet Command, you could give Starpoint Gemini a try. I am certainly enjoying it!Pros:+Freedom to explore at your leisure. Do whatever you want inbetween story missions+Lots of ships and equipment to choose from+Tactical micromanagement a la Starfleet Command (targetting enemy subsystems)+Excellent tutorial and low learning curve (but follow it to the letter, or it forces you to restart)+Character customisation and RPG elements (levels, perks, abilities (called maneuvers) )Cons:-Poor voice acting. The writing is okay though, and you can mute the voices, so it really is a non-issue-Occassional crash to desktop when jumping between systems seem common for many players (thankfully the game autosaves before a jump)Comments:Controls may feel clunky, but that's because there is a lot to manage. You can pause the game at any time by pressing F. During this pause you can do things like plot a course, check out the enemy ship's equipment and assign targets. Pausing mid-combat makes the game a lot more manageable.Tip:If you can't dock at T-gates or stations, it is probably because you are still in combat-mode. Turn it off by pressing the big red button at the bottom of the screen ;)			"

												Worst purchase of my life and that´s coming from a guy who bought Aliens: Colonial Marines and Duke Nukem Forever.First of all the game promises easy handling and stuff like that, it should be easy to get used to everything. Well that´s the first lie. The controls are unnecessary stupid and complicated because of the point & click feature, and you wouldn´t think that of this feature. Also you have to do EVERYTHING on your own. I mean come on, it´s a f***ing spaceship you are controling here, there HAS TO BE something that runs automatically! You have to fire your weapons on your own, you have to make combat repairs on your own, you have to maneuver on your own, omfg I guess you have to remember your crew how to breathe because they´re not f****ing doing anything!Then there are ""abilities""... I´m just saing at this point that those things do NOTHING. Unnecessary bs that does not what it promises, not even on higher levels. They could have at least given you some usefull passive abilities.I could go much further on about how much the gameplay sucks, but I have better things to do.And there is an even bigger problem what makes the bad gameplay even worse:Constant crashing to desktop whenever you jump to another system... I mean really?It is a turd of a game and I´m not even able to play it properly? I PAID 14 BUCKS FOR THAT CRAP!Playing in windowed mode reduces the crashes to every second or third system jump, but it´s still not okay!So what I´m telling you is: If you want to spend 5 to 15 bucks on something, spend it on something better! Go watch a movie, buy something nice for your parents, or buy a BETTER game!Sorry but this game really got me furios.			"

												Hmm. I was expecting this to play a lot more like Freelancer. In reality it's a lot like Starfleet Command. Take the control scheme from Starfleet, put it into the game world of Freelancer, take away the third dimension, and you've got Starpoint Gemini. Not terribly impressed. Not bad, but not at all what I thought it would be.The controls are fairly intuitive, but not very useable. There's too much clicking and not enough hotkeys. This game would be great on a touchscreen, but I don't have one. So I'm stuck with a mouse and I need to click to do just about anything. And forget about the tutorial. BORING!!! Yes, it's nice that there IS a tutorial, but it's so slow and so LONG that I didn't bother getting very far into it.I don't know what's so hard to understand about ""in-game tutorial."" It's the only way to go. Don't put me in the kiddie pool and show me how to use the mouse. I understand ""click anywhere to set a course."" Don't spend five minutes telling me that, and don't make me wait through pointless dialogue before you let me actually do it. Throw me in the deep end and explain things along the way. Just start the game already and spend FIVE MINUTES going over the broad strokes (click to set a course, right-click to target, click here to dock, etc). When something new comes up, tell me how to do it with a concise pop-up message and a blinky that says ""CLICK HERE TO FIRE YOUR WEAPONS.""So... meh. I don't recommend it. It's a new mash-up of two classic genres that just kinda falls flat because of (a) the tutorial and (b) the mouse-dependent control scheme. Maybe I'll feel different after I play it on my laptop (with the touchscreen), but it seems to me this game is too old to properly support a touchscreen.			"

												Most space sim fans will be turned off by the fact that combat and flight is only 2d movement. Aside from that it is not a bad space game. Starpoint Gemini 2 is vastly better. My advice is buy Starpoint Gemini 2 and play the original campaign in the starpoint 2 game engine, ""Play through the 30 storyline missions of the original Starpoint Gemini, re-envisioned as free DLC for Starpoint Gemini 2!""

												Don't buy this. It is described as a space RPG/Simulation. I have never played an RPG where you go to choose your character, and there is just one choice. The arrows are there to pick something else, but every choice is Derp McStachio! It's like trying to change the channel away from Cake Wars, and every channel is showing the exact same episode of Cake Wars! Also, the only way this game is a simulation is if it is trying to simulate a drunken man pretending he is a space ship. Dear god I have never had so much trouble trying to fly in a straight line.

												Are you kidding me?  This game was released 7 years AFTER Freelancer?  From playing it, I thought it was a distant ancestor of the genre, not a decendant.It's quite possible that I'm just REALLY BAD at this game, but the controls are awkward, the camera viewpoint can change with no clear way to revert it, and combat is atrocious.  My ship's shields apparently run on AAA  batteries 'cuz 1 or 2 shots knock them out, and I'm not playing on an advanced difficulty.  Meanwhile, my own guns slow rate of recharge ensure that this will be a slow-paced slugfest, like watching the two worst football teams in your high school's area go at it.I love Freelancer.  I thought Darkstar One was enjoyable enough.  Rebel Galaxy is amazing.  Starpoint Gemini seems to combine the worst of all these games.I hear the sequel is leaps and bounds better, so I'll give it a shot next.			"

												I've played this many hours on another platform before it was available on steam, and am surprised at all of the negative reviews for this game, as I recall having nothing but fun with this game and was VERY happy to see the devs go ahead with Starpoint Gemini 2.It is a fun third person(more or less it's not really isometric and it's definitely not first person, similar to star wolves) space sim in a more or less open world.There were a fair number of missions available, although the details are a bit hazy now as it has been quite some time since I've played this game, all I know beyond these admittedly vague details is that I had a great deal of fun with this game, putting in probably c.30h and was very happy to see that they were pushing ahead with Starpoint Gemini 2 along with all of the discussed improvement.  Admittedly I  have NOT yet gottren around to really sitting down with SPG2 yet although I did play a bit VERY EARLY in early access and decided to wait for release/closer to release but since have been OBE.Fair warning though, I am a space sim fanboi and pretty much will buy ANYTHING that is not a completely arcade space sim.  Also I've played a great deal of Star Wolves 1 & 2(non-steam) and enjoyed those games greatly as well, i.e. I also like strategy and RPG games and as a further digression I purchased Star Wolves 3 as soon as it was avilable but like SPG2 it languishes awaiting play.

Starpoint Gemini is an open-world tactical space combat simulator. Emerging from a space-time stasis, you're a soldier trying to make your place in the Gemini System that has changed beyond recognition since its isolation at the end of the war you were originally part of.Pros: The Gemini System is vast, with dozens of sectors, each with their own space stations, factions and secrets. You're allowed to roam freely, at your own risk, which is great for for anyone who like exploring. You get access to dozens of ships and hundreds of ship components as you rank up your status through experience and standing with the numerous factions. You can freelance your skills, board or capture other ships to upgrade your own.Cons: You have little direct control over your actions, as you command a ship, not a craft. You ask it to fire on enemy ship, you don't actually get to aim and shoot. The universe is flat, you cannot maneuver over and under and beyond other ships, so you must circle around them in this 2D fashion, giving you little combat strategy. The game is far from polished and the graphics are showing their age. Voice acting is extremely amateurish with bad recording quality, speaking traditional technobabble in a failed attempt to give this sci-fi world credibility.Verdict: ★★☆☆☆ - Forget itI really can't recommend this game. It is sub-par on too many aspects and an overall disappointment. If this is really type of game you like, perhaps you'd be better off investing a few more bucks on the sequel, but I sure won`t.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												Starpoint Gemini is an RPG tactical simulator focused on the control and strengths of individual vessels. In SPG ship captains and their skills make the greatest difference in large-scale battles. The games is set in a science-fiction universe where various thriving technological directions exist side by side. After spending almost twenty years trapped in the so-called Stasis rift anomaly, unaware of the passage of time, player reemerges into normal space to find Gemini and indeed everything he knew, had changed beyond recognition. The Gateway stood as the entry point to the Gemini system, but events that took place two decades ago closed the wormhole and practically sealed the system off of the rest of the universe. The isolation and the appearance of countless anomalies enabled unforeseen technological advancements. Political intrigues, greed and lust for power have shaped the fate of Gemini and it is almost time for reckoning . Players will freely traverse the rich and filled vastness of the Gemini star system, fight skirmishes with rogue ships, trade commodities, research anomalies, buy new vessels, upgrade their ships with state-of-the-art technology, increase their experience and rank to learn more powerful maneuvers and ultimately use all that in large scale engagements against other fleets of hostile ships. Gemini is a dangerous place with riches waiting to be claimed by the more daring and capable captain.			"
