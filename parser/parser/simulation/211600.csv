												The first time I played this game was back in 1998 when I had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Pentium III with an 8MB graphics accelerator S3 Trio, which was completely incapable of running the game in its glory. Had to play it in software rendering to play it. Even with that compromise in quality, the game offered absolutely amazing immersion factor and gameplay mechanics, meaning no two game modes can be the same. Especially at Expert difficulty, when you're forbidden to kill anyone and are required to accomplish additional objectives, this is where the lore of the game truly shines.Fast forward 15 years, and I'm amazed at the level of support this game has garnered from its fans. There was a patch recently released by the loyal fan community, which pretty much fixed the game and made it compatible with modern hardware. Running windows 7 with quad core processors, latest GPU technologies & gobbles of RAM, alongwith a 1080p widescreen monitor, no problem. The patch fixes them all. There's even support of OpenAL for Creative's old Audigy 2 ZS cards which makes full use of EAX sound effects which we haven't heard of since XP days. It so good to finally play and listen to the game the way it should be after so many years.If you're a fan of first person sneakers, and haven't yet played this game. Do yourself a favor and buy it. Games like these only come out in decades, as the sad demise of its deveoper studio meant nobody took the reins and pushed the franchise forward until now. Hopefully, the new development team can do full justice to the game franchise, though the absence of Stephen Russell is extremely unnerving. He was and always will be the voice of Garrett. Highly recommended.P.S: In order to help out the community make this game run perfectly on modern hardware.

												Since new Thief game was recently released, I decided to start from the roots. Thief Gold must be one of the best stealth games I've played so far. Unlike most old games that are Steam released, Thief Gold runs very smoothly, isn't crashing and has no problems on Windows 7. The game is very atmospheric, has got an awesome gameplay and storyline. If you are into stealth games, Thief is for you.			"

												Certainly, the first and most cleverly devised first person stealth game, I'm not gonna argue that, but also the absolute master of subtle storytelling: you play a dozen missions as a Thief doing his work in a strange City and in the process - without even noticing it - you experience one of the most richly detailed medieval worlds ever created.Future iterations have tried to improve on the formula, the second adding a more personal involvement of the protagonist in the story, the third - (arguably) better lore and an open city to roam and immerse yourself in when you're taking a break from the missions, and there are also other games that try to build a world from subtle hints and little detailes, but the way in which the world takes form and developes as it is ""told"" in this game, or, more likely, ""overheard"" while you're playing it, from The Bear Pits where the lower class citizens go for entertainment to the complex theology of the Hammerites, is still unsurpassed in gaming to this day.

												the greatest game ever madeunmatched atmosphere and immersion, fantastic and fun gameplay, superb storytelling, voice acting, writing and charm.  these are a few things that Thief Gold boasts. the graphics aren't anything to sneeze at now, obviously, but this game came out 17 years ago and it still holds up decently now, imo. the maps are also large and spacious and it's easy to get lost in them, it's beautiful.everything about this game is just so stellar, it's something that i think everyone should experience. obviously a (tiny) bit flawed, a couple of weird hitboxes for some objects in a few areas, the occasional weird physics-related problem (it's somewhat easy to make garrett repeatedly jump and gain a decent amount of speed to lunge across some maps. it's actually somewhat humourous and fun to execute) also there's the occasional weird AI glitch where a guard may stop moving at all for a second... but none of this is major at all compared to a lot of games nowadays, let alone other games made in the late 90's.regardless of these flaws though, this game is a real treasure. a fantastic experience; gripping, compelling, incredibly engaging and fun as hell. there aren't many games out there that i love like this one.definitely, definitely buy it. Thief Gold is a wonderful game.			"

												1998. That date should hopefully mean something to you. 1998 was the harbringer of classic video games. 1998 counted among its releases Unreal, Fallout 2, Ocarina of Time, Half Life, Grim Fandango, and more. But among those releases is Thief: The Dark Project, otherwise known as Thief Gold on steam.What was the point of bringing up the date? Because it doesn't matter how old it is. If you haven't layed Thief yet, it's still new to you. It's the grandfather of stealth and is ready to welcome you into its arms.			"

												First, I must assure you that this review is completely free of nostalgia. I never played Thief: Gold (or Thief 2, for that matter) before 2014, and was far too young to play and understand video games when The Dark Project was released. I must also note that I patched the game with TFix, as without it I would be playing a 640x480 600% speed mess designed for a computer from the late 90s. I also installed a texture/lighting mod called HDmod, which was not neccessary but did vastly improve the graphics from their dated, fugly appearance.With that out of the way, I have been wholly impressed with my first few hours of play. The movement feels surprisingly good (after assigning WASD controls, of course), and the bow and arrow feels realistic (though the arrow flies slowly). The melee weapons aren't perfect, but fit their roles nicley. The sword combat is deep but slow (fine, since combat is discouraged) and the blackjack has a limited range and requires you to stand up. It's slightly awkward to use, but it's satisfying to knock out an unaware guard. The level design so far (on level 2 currently) is perfectly balanced in terms of being difficult to navigate but not so much that you get stumped for hours on end. I like how it presents you with stealth situations that have no apparent solution, challenging you to think of your own clever work-around. The animated cutscenes look surprisingly good, and the story has me curious, especially about the Keepers.I definitely reccomend it so far. I will update this review as I progress through the game.EDIT (3/30/2014, 14 hours in): Level design is a bit inconsistent. The ""Assassins"" mission was an absolute joy to play through, giving you a surprisingly large chunk of the city to sneak through in addition to Ramirez's well-designed mansion. I am unfortunately hitting a bit of a rough patch in the ""Guild"" mission, which started off great but quickly degraded into possibly the most convoluted labyrinth I've ever seen in a video game. Perhaps the new missions introduced with the Gold edtion should have been optional, or just side missions. The story feels both vague and simplistic, with a little bit of backstory on the Hammerites and Keepers between chronicles of Garret's unrelated (as of now) thieving exploits. I sense it's going to pick up soon, though. Still loving the gameplay, of course. Can't wait to finish Guild and (hopefully) get something a bit easier to navigate!EDIT (4/11/2015, 30 hours): It should be said that this game has a ridiculous amount of content.There is a good amount of variety as well. Levels with human guards showcase the superb stealth gameplay. Levels with monsters/undead focus are weird, but encourage the player to take an action-stealth approach that is very satisfying. Story has picked up nicely, some very interesting characters have showed up and each mission has a purpose and cool backstory. Despite my 30 hours of game time, I am only a bit more than halfway through the game. Even if I never finish, It's been a fun ride and I'm glad this game hooked me into the phenomenal Thief series.

												This is by far the greatest stealth game ever released, nothing has come remotely close since its year of release in 1998, this is a masterpiece which everyone should play in their lifetime. Thief consists of levels that are beyond expertly designed, each more impressive than the last masterpiece. As the game progresses so does the level of abstractness in the levels. I doubt games will ever reach this point again as every company these days are run by suits who know nothing about this industry other than its profitability.The AI is not by any means terrific, but still far more impressive than any stealth game of this era as once they spot you, it will most likely warrant a load as they don't stop hunting you down throughout the lengthy levels. You will need to use objects in the environments such as plates and goblets to create noise distractions in order to sneak past them and flash bombs to blind them momentarily if no nearby resources are available, I find non-lethal playthroughs to be the most entertaining and immersive as you're a Thief, not an assassin or murderer.As mentioned earlier, a massive part in making Thief the masterpiece it is, is the sprawling layouts of the levels which are atmospheric and absolutely perfectly designed that allow for freedom by giving you multiple paths to your objectives, the graphics may seem dated to some but I still find them more appealing than the overly gloomy, bland and soulless games of today.Thief is a timeless classic which I would recommend to anyone who enjoys games that aren't dumbed down and have no handholding, also to those who can appreciate good design, solid mechanics and a fair challenge.

												Before I get to the review have you ever thought to yourself:Geewillickers I really wish this stealth game had better gameplay!Golly these levels are really small I wish this stealth game had larger levels so I could actually do things!If yes then just buy Thief Gold already you'll enjoy it. Also your inner monologues sound like a 50's sitcom you should go to the doctor or something.Gameplay:Thief Gold is the most complete and satisfying stealth experience you will ever find. The A.I. is incredible for its time with some of the most impressive sound design I've seen in a game even by the standards set today. There are also some mods out there that fix and improve the AI and graphics by making the game run on the engine of the sequal Thief 2. With that being said much of the limits of the stealth must be self imposed. You can crank up the difficulty and make not killing enemies an option, but if you put the difficulty up you will also have to do more side objectives that can either be frustrating or just pad the length without prior level knowledge or a guide. The reason for this is many levels are huge and complicated with a few being near maze-like. If you miss one or two treasures along the way you'll be lost on where they are on higher difficulties and be stuck backtracking for a long time. The enemies in this game take two forms: humans and other things that are annoying. Without spoiling too much just know there are sprawling levels that are massive in size filled with awful enemies and very old-school puzzles. The game itself is also very long clocking in at close to or over 20 hours. That may not be bad if the gameplay advanced in some form, but what you're doing in the first hour is what you will be doing in the last hour. This was definitely a boon when it first came out but with the present state of games there's usually a large advancement in some form that occurs over the course of the game to keep you fully invested.Story:The game is absolutely drenched in atmosphere and lore but light on the exposition. You get a brief introduction between missions but that's almost it for being ""told"" what's going on that is all up to you and your attention span. If you decide to read everything and pay attention to the world expect a decent story experience, but if you plan on playing only for the gameplay expect a lackluster story with a nice little dash of interesting at a certain point. Final verdict:Three doughnut holes/A coffee			"

												The father of the stealth genre on PC. No, gadgets, no high-tech. Just the darkness, your lockpick and the ambiance....A masterpiece. An overshadowed gem by those loud shooters at the market, a detailed setting unlike ever seen before with probably more than a dozen inspirations of various literary works.A  very gothic, victorian, medieval-like city drowned in crime and sin - It's a glorious landmark of how to make a non-shooter game engaging. Pretty revolutionary for 1998. Everybody owes it to himself to play this if you are even remotely into good story and stealth which the new Thief 2014 probably didn't handle with the same production quality.I'll let these videos speak for themselves:

												Thief Gold is one of the first stealth games ever made, and somehow, Looking Glass Studios perfected the formula of stealth genre on their first try.This game is on my five game list, and I've played lots of different kinds of games. This is truly a gold that you should not pass, even if you're not a fan of stealth, it has an amazing atmosphere that will lock you into the game; gritty cutscenes and the later levels add up an interesting experience.For its price tag, it's a steal...(heh)			"

												Thief is hands down the best stealth game I've ever played. Taking into account the time when this game was made, it is a technological achievement. The most innovative of these is that depending of the kind of floor you are walking on, determines what sound is produced. And the variety of arrows was really refreshing compared to the generic arrows most games use. The guards always have something interesting to listen to, and listening to them can help you tell if they are looking for you. The one complaint I have is the combat. With a game this age, of course it won't be pretty, but still. If you get caught, it's pretty much instant quickload. This makes it worth all the more to stay hidden!Pros:+Practically invented modern stealth+Atmosphere+Guard dialog+Varied levels+Graphics (I know they are dated, but I would not change them)Neutral: *Bow combat*LockpickingNegative:-Sword combat (If you are sneaky, you will never have to resort to this)Overall: 9/10 I am always surprised that no one knows what this game is. This was a groundbreaking game and should be remembered! It is also dirt cheap, so buy it now!			"

												Don't let Steam fool you. It says I've only played 7 minutes of this game but the truth is I've played this game from start to finish probably more than a hundred times. More if you include my playtime on my original CD installation. This is hands-down one of my favorite games of all time. I love everything about it, the background lore, the voice acting, the art style in the mission briefings, the gameplay, and especially the whole dedicated fan community (I love all you taffers). This game is old and as with all older games you can run into difficulties getting it to run on new computers. Fortunately, that fan community is there for you. You can find guides for modding this game to work easily enough so I won't go into all that but that's the reason I only have a few minutes of playtime on this thing. It *works* ok right out of the Steam library but it can work *better*. I launched it and then immediately moved the game files out of Program Files to another folder so I could get to work on it.If you need convincing that this game is great just look at the fan community. We can't all be crazy. There's something here for you to like, I guarantee it.EDIT 11/24/2016: One of the categories for the Steam Awards is Test of Time. This one is a no-brainer for my nomination, even though I doubt this will win because it's still kind of a cult-following type of game despite having received a reboot.			"

												It is amazing how as computing technology improves and new tools such as VR are introduced that consumers continue to pine for 'better' and 'more immersive' games, as though immersion is some ideal we may hope to one day achieve once the graphics are good enough and the gadgets we attach to our forehead become more effective. However, one need only look back to the late 90's, when a developer known as Looking Glass studios was already forging the path for immersive simulators decades ahead of time.It achieves immersion not with high resolution character models but lumpy primitive 3D figures. It achieves immersion not with 3D glasses or goggles but with game mechanics and level design. Is Thief Gold perfect? Certainly not. The movement physics can be rough and get stuck on the uneven surfaces of the levels. The AI can be frequently prone to mistakes and it is not uncommon for guards to end up stuck in walls. There are also some monster lair levels which have aged very poorly compared to the rest of the game. But the core mechanics, and the world and places in which you are given to apply them to, give rise to a game which gives the player the sense of interacting with a living real world. The sound design should be given its own praise for bringing the square, low resolution worlds to life, as the mere footstep sounds do its job of grounding you in its setting. But even with the blocky low resolution visuals, Looking Glass does an excellent job of bringing to life the various manors and facilities which you visit to life with the proper decorum and architecture necessary to a place which people live in.It is also impressive how such an old game takes themes such as dark fantasy and steampunk and synthesizes them into a setting which is uniquely its own, and feels distinct from the multitude of midieval fantasy games on the market. It's gameplay is also a unique fusion of first person exploration, stealth and even collectathons, that genre which wholly belongs to the 90's. It is a wonder why item and treasure collecting are not applied to more realistic genres more often, there is something quiantly enjoyable about wandering through carpeted rooms alone but near danger, admiring the oil paint portraits, opulent furniture and elaborate wall patterns, all while enjoying the thrill of robbing the owners right under their noses, taking everything valuable in sight and adding to your bonus in valuables and goods. In some ways, you could look at Thief as the ultimate walking simulator, one with complex and engaging interactions and a fail state, which would already make it superior to all the walking simulators released within the last few years. Eat your heart out, Dear Esther and Gone Home, this is how you do a walking simulator.In the early days of 3D technology, when it was an exciting and unexplored frontier, game design was more alchemy than a science. Mechanics and genre formats had not yet been solidified, and the routine of 3D game templates was not yet a thing. Games were not yet pigeon-holed into preset genres(fps, third-person action, rpg etc) and the kinds of games that could exist where limited only by what kind of interactions and mechanics that could be made with the technology available. Sometimes to advance the future, it is necessary to look to the past. Looking Glass showed with their games that to make engaging and immersive video games, you need fun and engaging mechanics and interactions, and an interesting enough world to apply those mechanics too. No amount of technology will ever advance the quality of video games if we do not remember what it is that makes video games fun and unique compared to other mediums. If you want to remember what is possible for the future of video games, look to the past and play Thief Gold.			"

												I have never played a Thief game before, so my playthrough was not affected by nostalgia. Still, I agree with everyone here - you need to play this game.I got Thief Gold on sale and it was an absolute steal. I am a huge fan of stealth games and the Thief series earns its spot alongside both the Metal Gear Solid and Hitman series as must-plays.Positives:- Excellent, well told story;- Quality stealth gameplay. You hide in darker areas and shadows, you sprint across rooms when you feel unwatched, you knock people out and hide their bodies, you climb up ropes to higher areas to hide, you manipulate the environment to your advantage. Impressive gameplay mechanics especially when you consider the age of the original game;- Very large levels, leading to a number of options or paths to take to complete each one;- A range of difficulties that you can play the game on, with increased difficulty requiring more objectives to be completed before a level is completed;- Various types of bows to use and experiment with, either for stealth or attacking purposes.Negatives:- The game is fairly old, so don't expect the most amazing graphics. It's shouldn't be enough to stop you playing, but if good graphics are a must for you, you may not like this game;- You may get stuck at times, unsure of what to do. (In fact, I would say this - don't give up if you feel lost in the first couple of levels. The game will start to click with you shortly after if it doesn't early on);- The controls can take a while to get used to. I recommend customising controls to a typical WASD and setting 'Run Forward' to shift and 'Speed Toggle' to Mouse 3. Spend some time in the tutorial playing around with the controls until it clicks and you know how to customise it right for you. It's also worth spending some time to Google and find help with the controls at the beginning.In short, this game is a classic, and now I see why. You owe it to yourself to at least try this game if it's on special, and buy it regardless if you're a fan of stealth games.			"

The mechanics are still solid, though you may want to rebind the keys to a more modern feel. The environments are still begging to be looted surreptitiously, thanks to great design, aesthetic, and world building even if the raw looks don't hold up as well. 5/5			"

Garrett is a memorable character,his lines are really well written and just like most characters in the 90's and 80's,he's got some one-liners.the gameplay holds up to this date,in fact its unique because there aren't many first-person games,where you need to stay hidden in the shadows,you actually feel like a Thief i highly recommend this game to any stealth fan,if you loved Dishonored you will love this game			"

												10/10Pros--Nonlinear level design with plenty of routes and plenty of secrets.--Fun toolset, especially the water moss arrows and especially rope arrows.--Light and sound fully accounted for in stealth, Non dousable lights in a marble hallway leads to a swift detection.--Higher difficulty means more enemies and less supplies, aswell as stricter and more mission objectives enemy health scaling isn't relevant when you can oneshot most enemies, you should be avoiding them anyways.--Cool as hell cutscenes.--Maps are part of the game's world, not just a screen in the pause menu. You can write notes on them and they reflect Garret's knowledge on the mission.--Difficult in places. ( Difficulty is always a good thing. )--Can boreder on horror at times ( Constantine's manor best level. )--No scripted events outside dialogue triggers ( which often yield useful information. )Cons--No Autosave/Checkpoint ( Promotes save scumming ) ( a quicksave button exists, but there isn't a quickload keybind if i recall correctly )--Keys need rebound ( takes less than 2 minutes )--Needs unofficial patch software to run at it's best on modern software ( Tfix is your friend )--You need to be able to read and listen to understand how to beat a level ( Takes quite a bit of efford to read that note that says ""I can't believe that nobody has heard the secret room behind the bookcase"")--Doesn't hold your hand ( ""Where are the quest markers?"" ""Why isn't my health regenerating?"" )Overall Thief is an almost perfect stealth game that has yet to be surpassed.If you enjoyed it. Don't forget to check out the sequel.			"

It still does it better than most games as well. You play as a thief, Garret. He is wise, cunning, and uses intelligence and stealth over brute force. You don't want to be found because the guards are tougher than you. But you're smarter to them. Stick to the shadows, walk quietly, and learn what it really takes to be a truth Thief.

												The most innovative stealth game ever. Recommended to everyone with a thirst for the creme de la creme of stealth games, although the aging mechanics require a good dose of patience and tafferpatcher.exe to make the best of it.			"

												I played the third Thief (Deadly Shadows) game when it originally came out and despite some flaws in the game, I enjoyed it a lot. I always planned to also play the old Thief games and now in the last few weeks, I've finally come around to playing the first Thief.Thanks to Mods and Patches from the community the game looks acceptable and it did run flawless on my contemporary Win8 machine.The great thing about this game is that in most missions, you are relatively free in how to tackle each situation and the overall mission. There are often multiple paths through a level and you have a variety of tools to dispatch enemies or to simply try to get around them undetected. Thief basically invented the stealth genre and it still works well. The enemy AI is quite predictable but this not a flaw in my opinion. It allows you to precisely plan every move and to become an expert at the game - which is the main source of enjoyment. The story is more or less video game standard fare but the presentation is intriguing. It's very dark and foreboding and generates an impressive atmosphere. There is also a lot of humor in the game, especially with the guards and their reactions.The voice acting deserves a special mention, Garret sounds great but I liked the character Constantine even more. It perfectly fit the game and character. Some frustrations I had were that sometimes the levels were almost too big, so it could get quite confusing. Especially if your mission involves finding some tiny little side object which sometimes were easy to miss. Before searching for hours, I would reccommend just looking at a guide.There are three difficulty levels and every level adds more mission objectives which increases replayability. I played on the second level,""hard"" and I think this should be the default difficulty because there it gets interesting. On the easier setting you have to just find the main object most of the time while on the higher levels you also have to make it safely back out again which should be mandatory for a thief I think :)			"

												This game is an absolute masterpiece. There are reasons why this game is an absolute classic, and it's definitely worth your time. Don't be discouraged by the dated graphics, this game is amazing. It's fun, it's immersive, and sometimes it even manages to be scary. It's probably one of my favorite games of all time. However, I would STRONGLY recommend you use TFix to play, installation is easy and it adds a lot of necessary tweaks and support/compatiblity for modern machines.*Some of my particular highlights*+The level design is absolutely fantastic. Maps are massive, multilevelled, layered, and complicated. While this is occasionally somewhat frustrating in some cases as the maps become difficult to navigate (such as The Lost City and The Haunted Cathedral) the sheer magnitude of the maps is impressive and fun to explore on its own. The levels also vary greatly. One level has you stealing a sword from a mansion, and things get psychedelic the higher you ascend until you finally reach the sword in question. The next map is one of my all time favorites: a journey through a closed down section of The City that was subject to years of neglect after an invasion by a horde of undead, leaving the Old Quarter literally falling apart and haunted by zombies and the spirits of the undead, particularly the Hammerites that died fighting them. The sound design in this level is SPECTACULAR, and hugely contributes to the amazing atmosphere of the whole level. The main sounds you hear throughout the map are the moans of the undead as they wander through the streets, the ceaseless whispers of the Apparitions patrolling nearby, and Garrett's loud footsteps. Not to mention this odd, loud, ethereal hum in the background that you hear throughout most of the Old Quarter. In general all the little effects like that add up to an atmosphere of pure uneasiness and loneliness that is often genuinely spooky. It's one of my favorite levels from any game.+The game has some other features that are incredibly impressive for the time, and it encourages creativity (and sometimes needs a level of creativity to progress). Botch the job and get caught by a guard that you have to kill? Wash away the blood with a water arrow. See something wooden above you? Shoot a rope arrow into it to try climbing upward. Find a hallway with some torches that's too bright? Put the torches out with some water arrows. Going down a loud stone hallway? Use a moss arrow to make a soft carpet that masks your footsteps.+The game is, surprisingly, very immersive. The sound design is very good, and the occasional music cues and tracks that play are fitting for the areas. With how vast and well designed the maps are, the game has a tendency to draw you in and keep you playing for hours at a time.+As dark (no pun intended) as the game is, it's still got a sense of humor. The guards are drunk fools, peering into the shadows, completely oblivious you're merely _inches_ away while they shout things like ""I'll find you, you taffer!"" Garrett is a wisecracking cynic as well, making numerous sarcastic remarks as he essentially robs people blind right under their nose.			"

												Thief Gold is 1999 year's special edition of Thief: The Dark Project that came out in 1998. Developed by infamous makers of John Madden 93 for Sega Genesis, The Looking Glass, it was one of the first games to try and combine stealth and FPS perspective. It's also one of the more immersive games around.Steam release is a Thief Gold edition, which added 3 more missions to the main game. And some smaller fixes and very few changes. Pretty much superior version, ignoring the way that some of those new missions wreck campaign's pacing. Aside from Song Of The Caverns, which is awesome and feels like pre-Thief 2 level.It also means that it includes very few extras in folder, which is just some Thief theme for old Windows OS and Making Of Thief 2 video that probably will not play properly.Technically, this release is pretty much as-is. Square Enix is not Night Dive, they didn't do much here, if anything at all.In order to make cutscenes actually work I had to go to game's folder and to change Thief.exe's properties so it's always launched with admin rights given.And yea, it doesn't support widescreen by default.Then again, you can go ahead and get some community patches, so to say, which will provide fixes to some bugs. Yes, there are some. But I am more of Vanilla experience person, so eh. And most of them do it by porting Thief 1 code into Thief 2 engine, which also adds some new features by itself. Like ability to creep or leaving map notes.Plot follows Garrett, thief who once was taken and trained by the Keepers only to leave them for sake of his own greed. Now you shall live the hard life of Thief, stealing and living off it, only to end up in dark epic and interesting dark troubles due to your bad luck. Yes, it turned out to be much more interesting both in plot and setting than I belived it would be. It's like a combination of Dark Fantasy and Steampunk in right amounts, mostly leaning on the former. And you are going to find out about it during gameplay too, from little pieces here and there. Also includes exotic locations and 180 degrees misaligned alarm lights. Can't forget those.And here are few things that must be mentioned about this game. First, it's awesome game. And second, it's not exactly a hardcore stealth game that people might make you belive. In reality, it's a huge mix of a bit of everything. It has stealth. Then it also has horror with zombies and such. Then sometimes you want to shoot monsters instead with arrows. A bit of sword slashing at monsters too. A bit of adventure-puzzlish, with huge mazey mazes and having to find key to whatever lock. As well as puzzles that make you think what you are supposed to do.No, seriously, it's more like a Dark Fantasy FPS epic fit into missions where you can play only as thief class, but with gameplay designed around it.Stealth is quite interesting, albeit somewhat not as good as more modern offers. There are two things to watch out: sight and sounds. The part where you must not be seen is quite simple. Just stay in dark, which is pretty much everywhere and where you feel safe, even if it might look not very dark on the screen. But this is what visibility gem is for, to show if enemies will see you or not. Sound on other hand makes it not as simple. Mostly, you have to watch out surface that you walk on. For example, on carpet you may as well run around with no care, while ceramic tiles are as bad as lava, something you never walk on with anybody nearby. Not even crouch-walk.You also got bow and arrows with many ammo types, to feel like a thief-agent, with many tools to get around. Awesome. Lockpicks too, though it's simple, no minigames there. Just keep holding or change between two types, while worrying that somebody may come over anytime.However stealth part still can't compare to more modern games. It's not as punishing to be not stealthly as you might think and it's extremely easy to knock everybody out with blackjack, just by waiting in the dark for person to come by. Higher difficulties try to force you to be more stealthly by often giving restriction ""kill no human"". Which means don't use sword on those. The thing is, you still got blackjack, which knocks out anybody permanently as long as AI isn't directly aware of you. And knocking everybody in the world is easy. You also aren't as pressured to hide evidence, AI isn't all that good. You can just leave dead bodies right in the center of hallway right where you knocked them out as long as it's somewhat dark, AI will just walk over them.Heck, manual even gives you a tip not to leave doors open so not to make AI suspicious while in reallity this subroutine was implented only in Thief 2. Actually I would be surprised that noisemaking arrows weren't implented properly either, couldn't make use of them.By the way, seriously, read manual.By the way, yes, higher difficulties give more missions. And you don't keep money between missions, so live for today instead of final level. Awesome.By the way, watch out, levels sometimes require certain arrows type to progress that you may have already wasted. Yay old-school adventure game design.AND by the way, Thieves Guild level is like labyrinthish mazey maze that gets really tedious.And it has cliche where you have to get four talismans based on four nature elements. You know what those four elements are. In original version it was two elements per one levels, but Gold added two more levels for those, so it's so cliche that it almost turns my brain off. And then one of those levels you have four arcadeish towers to beat based on the same four elements.Clicheception!Clicheption.You get it.It also has immersive sound design, with short looping track that are forgettable yet help the atmosphere greatly. With some additional design that makes sure that sound is disturbed realistically through level. You can even close door and notice how you can barely hear everything from opposite door. And it's part of gameplay too, as you will often have to guess what's behind the corner as somebody walks by loudly, making some noise, whistling. And yes, enemy footsteps also follow same surface rules, so you may even judge their position if you know the map.But you know, you not only stealth. You also explore the levels, finding secret entrances. And this is what I think is more focused on in the first Thief. And it also gets immersive with some additional naviagion challenges. You see, maps are taken realistically. Sometimes you have precise map and it even points the part where you are. Other times it doesn't point and you have to actually use compass to figure out where you are and where to go. Which is actually the first time compass was useful in videogames in my experience, so this game wins. And sometimes you find out that map actually has mistakes or that Garrett didn't manage to gather any info.And yes, in some levels you will be busy Tomb Raiding and solving actual puzzles. Or, you know, almost all of them. It's like old-school FPS of hardcoreness, you can see that it was made by same people who made System Shock 1. Or at least same company. Though sometimes maps are so mazey that you will get lost. Just to realize that you forgot to take a key in the beggining of the level and have to waste 10 minutes.Though combat could be a bit better as sometimes you just have to fight undead. But it's all fine otherwise.But you know, I like how this game is pretty much old-school FPS-Stealth-Horror-Adventure-Puzzle, combining lots of elements. And yet, unlike many other games where it means lose of focus, it still manages to success. Mostly because it all still requires some cunning and skills, so to say. Of exploration and thinking how to get through.			"

												Can't recommend this game enough.

												First and foremost I should note that before playing this game that it's mandatory to install T-Fix, as it upgrades the game to run on NewDark (an updated version of the game's engine that's used in the digital release of System Shock 2), gives options for improving the graphics (something I'm not too fond of doing myself), and restores the cutscenes so they actually work.  T-Fix Download [www.ttlg.com]I can also reccomend installing the Gold To Dark mod for first time players, which converts Thief Gold into Thief : The Dark Project, for reasons that will be stated later in this review. Gold To Dark Download [www.ttlg.com]Now on to the review.I never really played that many stealth games before Thief Gold, I mean I did dabble around with Bioshock Infinite's DLC (which is a stealth game) and I did play the Thief Reboot, but I never really thought I'd be one who would be really into the stealth genre, that is untill I played Thief : The Dark Project (or the GOTY edition known as Thief Gold). In Thief : The Dark Project, you play as Master Thief Garret, who goes around stealing ♥♥♥♥ from places, or at least that's what the game centers around at first. I won't spoil what happens, but the gameplay does take a shift near the end of the game. While the game mostly involves breaking into places, and stealing a ton of loot, some missions feel more akin to Tomb Raider, which to me isn't entirely a bad thing, as these missions are (in my opinion) much more relaxing than the standard theiving missions, and are a nice break from the stealing aspect of the game. The crontrol in this game isn't the best, mostly due to the fact that this is a Dark Engine game, but you will get used to them after playing for a while, and once you do, they can be quite enjoyable at times while climbing up stuff, and feeling like a stealth god. The combat on the other hand isn't all that great. It's clunky and unresponsive, and extremely akward to use at first, but you aren't really supposed to get into combat, and you can learn the neuances of it. The atmosphere in this game is exelent. Before each mission, you're breifed with an intro video, explaining what to do in the mission from Garret's perspective, which is exelently voice acted if I might add. In game, Garret will occasionally mutter something entertaining or somewhat helpfull, while being well done and believable. The voice acting carries across to all of the characters. Standing around and hearing the guards chatter is not only entertaining, but sometimes extremely usefull, as they often point out key infromation needed to progress. But the guards are just one part of the atmosphere, the soundscape is just freaking awesome, and even somewhat tense at times. However there are some things that I don't like about the game. Level design is exelent and complex, but sometimes way too complex for their own good, at times takeing over an hour for first time players. I mentioned earlier that there is actually a mod that converts Thief Gold to Thief : The Dark Project, and that's because Thief Gold adds 3 new missions. Now while that sounds good on paper, these missions are some of the most assinine missions in the entire game (and debatably the series), taking upwards of an hour and a half to complete for first time players. The Gold missions consist mostly of long empty hallways, and require a metric butt ton of backtracking, to the point where I'm not even sure that I'd reccomend Thief Gold over Thief : The Dark Project. Overall though, Thief : The Dark Project is a great start to an exelent trilogy of games, and while it may not be my favorite in the series (Thief 2 holding that title), it's still an exelent game in its own right. What are you waiting for you taffers?			"

												Thief Gold is an excellent stealth game. That being said, it's not as consistent with its design as it wants to be.Level design is pure 90's. Big, open-ended levels with lots of alternate paths and rewards for the attentive player. A big part of it is the verticality in a lot of them, with many of them going all the way down or all the way up, occasionally doing both on the same levels. The rope arrows, one of the coolest '' weapons'' in the game, being the best way to explore them. Since I've brought them up, the weapons are mostly tailored to the stealth and are as creative as the uses a player can give for them: moss arrows lowers noise on surfaces, regular arrows can be used to create distractions and hurt enemies and water arrows are used to lower create dark areas for the player to sneak on. Weapons such as your Blackjack are used to knock out enemies and the sword can be used for fighting the non-human enemies.Story's perhaps this game's biggest achievement (other than the stealth gameplay). With an immersive, complex, multilayered plot that develops in a very unique way. Staying mostly in the background, gradually increasing in reach, before finally grabbing and enveloping the player character. The world of the game is also very unique, mixing medieval architecture and Tesla-like machinery, creating sections which feel very in-line with the story's themes of Science vs Nature.Unfortunately, not all levels are all about showing the best qualities of the game. For a game called ''Thief'', a lot of levels feel like the developers were in some sort of insecure identity crisis over the direction the game should take, which leads to combat being a major part of them.Don't get me wrong, I love variety in games. But in the case of Thief 1, many of the cumbersome levels seem to pile up on top of the levels everyone enjoys (the''steal stuff'' levels) and almost force you to engage in really slow, stiff sword fighting. Some might say this adds a layer of survival horror to the game, which somewhat works in that sense, I guess. Unfortunately, it's in most of these levels where the design takes a dive and many of them feel like it's impossible to avoid enemies, which leads to the complaints I've raised above.Another issue I have with this game is some of the levels added by the ''Gold'' edition (such as Thieves' Guild) feel a lot more rushed and not as polished as they should be and can bog down the flow of the game. Making it feel a little too lengthy and sometimes overblown.No matter my criticisms, make no mistake. This still is pretty much one of the most advanced stealth games of all time and if you enjoy stealth games, this and The Metal Age are pretty much essential if you really want to experience how deep a game like this can go. I'd still recommend it to people looking for a game with a great story and immersive world, looking for something more ''unique'' than the standard fare of modern gaming.			"

												IMPORTANT: You won't be able to see the cutscenes unless you patch the game. You must install TTFix.Thief Gold - the first installment (an updated version of Thief: the Dark Project) in the cult saga of Thief games. The game was released in the year 1999 and very well received by critics. Surprisingly, even though I am a fan of Splinter Cell and Hitman series, I haven't played Thief upon its original release. Luckily, recently I finally got my hands on the game. Even though the game is not about graphics, I highly recommend installing HD Mod - it looks simply beautiful.The game is set in a steampunk city called.. The City. Gameplay suits people like me very well. I am the kind of person who likes to crawl around the levels very slowly and sniff every corner. Now, you CAN go through the front door all guns blazing swinging your sword, but that would be just silly. And, unlike Camelot, The City is not a silly place. Although AI is not the sharpest - you cannot expect a super advanced AI from a 1998 game - you will still face a formidable challenge and your attacks are but a scratch to the enemies.For a game that is almost 20 years old, the levels are bigger than one could expect. If you like to screw around, it may take around an hour to finish a level. Despite all that, level design is very good.There isn't much of a tutorial to the game, since the training part covers just really basic things – it teaches you how to swing your sword and use items (like keys to unlock doors). You will have to learn things on the go. At your disposal you have a sword, a blackjack (a tool for pacifists – when you don’t want to kill your opponent, just knock him out), a bow and some explosives (like flash bombs). You probably won’t use your sword too much however. With a variety of different types of arrows available to pass through levels undetected, you will find the bow to be one of the most useful items.I recommend the game for everyone who enjoys stealth games, likes a challenge or simply wants to remember old times and replay Thief with HD Mod. For those who haven’t played any games like this before – this is great value for your money and you definitely should try it. However, if you don’t like slow paced gameplay – this game is not for you.This review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

												TL DR: Thief Gold is simply the finest stealth game ever made. The sheer quality and variety of level design, amazingly creepy atmosphere, and the tools you have to sneak around just make this my favourite game of all time. If you like sneaking through masterfully crafted locations then just click the ""Add to Cart"" button above. Also, I recommend TFix, Sound Enhancement, OpenAL for proper audio and the Enhancement Pack 2.Thief Gold is a first-person stealth game where you play as Garrett, a mysterious master thief.    You have 15 levels (not counting training) and set objectives for each. These are usually simple (most of the involve stealing an artifact), and increasing the difficuly will usually give you extra objectives.    To traverse the level you have several tools at your disposal. You're a thief, not a swordsman, and even if you do have a sword this doesn't mean you should fight your enemies. Guards are slow and sometimes you might get away with fighting one or two unscathed, but more supernatural creatures (more on that later) might be harder to take down. You do have a blackjack, which can knockout most humanoid enemies, useful if you plan on traversing a patrolled area several times and could do without having to avoid a certain pesky guard/s all the time, and also a great alternative to killing them if the mission states that you can't. You have a bow with a wide variety of arrows (rope arrows to climb, water arrows to put out torches, moss arrows to make noisy floors quiet, for example), lockpicks and more.    Even though you're a thief, this doesn't mean that the whole game is spent robbing city buildings. More than half of the levels do have supernatural creatures, and they involve exploring ancient cities and haunted crypts, caves and cathedrals. If you don't find the idea of sneaking through zombies, spiders, ghosts and beasts, I'd recommend Thief II. Even though the graphics are severely dated, the atmosphere is still really good, a lot thanks to Eric Brosius's work on ambient and creature sounds. The creepy voices of Haunts (""Join us! JOIN US NOW!"") are still as haunting as they were almost 20 years ago. Overall, the game has terrific level and sound design.    One of the greatest things about Thief, however, is that you are in full control. Garrett isn't really a master thief. He knows how to use tools that help with sneaking around, and can seem to hide pretty well in shadows, but he's not that quiet for a master thief. Stepping on marble tiles will get you caught very quickly, forcing you to take very small steps in order not to make incredibly loud sounds, or to spend all your moss arrows trying to be quiet. But really, how good Garrett is at thievery is decided by you. The game itself never takes away control from you during a mission. You watch an intro cutscene and you're dropped in the level to do as you please with the tools at your disposal. You're never taken away control from to watch a cutscene of the badass Garrett taking down a guard, you swing your blackjack and the guard falls, and the player keeps having control of his character.    Another great part is the storytelling. It's extremely subtle. The aforementioned cutscenes are 1 minute long usually, with 20 seconds of a quote from some text (which is great lore for the factions), and a description by Garrett of the level and the objective. That's it for ""in your face"" storytelling. The rest of the storytelling comes from notes, overhearing conversations, and the level design itself. The architecture in a level will subconsciously tell you things about the world, especially about a mansion and it's owner. You can tell that someone is more powerful than someone else you've robbed before just through details about his mansion, for example. A wealthier person can afford electric lights which you can't put out with a water arrow, and marble flooring on which you make loud noises when stepping on compared to a poorer cobblestone on the streets or wood. The levels are designed with care to what it would realistically have, not so much what it shoudl have to benefit the player. Obviously, you will find a lot more gold and valuables on the upper floors of a mansion where the owner's room is for example, instead of the servant floors.    Not to say that all the levels are what you expect them to be (hell just go see the sixth mission, The Sword. Trust me.) Sometimes you just go check your map to understand where the hell you are, and the map may well just say ""Location Unknown"". Even though you have a map, this map is another storytelling device: if a servant gave you the map to a mansion, he obviously could never have gotten to the upper floors and see the exact layout of the rooms, therefore that part of the map is very vague. And in these deeper parts you'll have to find information and use your compass and general sense of orientation to guide yourself towards your objective.    It's a pity that most games these days just spoon-feed you story through hours of cutscenes instead of using the medium's strengths for storytelling. This is one of my favourite games of all time, and if you feel that the graphics are too dated (shame on you) try the HD texture mod or somthing, see the screenshots to see if that's good enough for you. Seriously, don't miss out on this amazing game.			"

												Modern gamers would know Metal Gear Solid, Splinter Cell and to a certain extent Hitman when it comes to stealth games. But only one game did stealth right and that was Thief. Thief was the first ever first-person stealth game and is still probably the most hardcore stealth game of all time. Fighting is not encouraged, requiring you to really, really focus on not getting caught.The first-person view also makes the experience more immersive. Graphicswise, the game is very old but still looks nice, actually. The sound department is where Thief shines. Thief was the first stealth game to fully incorporate more realistic sound in terms of stealth. You can hear enemies and they can hear you if you make too much noise. Sound plays a very important role in the game as you'll need to figure out where your enemies are and for when you need to eavesdrop on them for more information.Thief is still highly regarded along with the second game, Metal Age. Modern stealth games are becoming very gimmicky, one of the reasons why Thief is still considered superior to most stealth games despite its age. You want the ultimate challenge in stealth? Then get Thief Gold. Even better, get the whole original trilogy.			"

												Thief has aged very well, and it is still one of the better stealth games around.  In fact, it's far more advanced than and superior to the entire Metal Gear Solid franchise.  It boasts a distinct, wonderful style and really encourages exploration.  Levels are very large and non-linear, so you'll have plenty of ways to sneak around.  Gameplay mechanics are what you'd expect to find in a good stealth game, including but not limited to dynamic light sources that can be disabled, smart AI whose vision is actually affected by lighting, almost endless object interaction, you can carry and hide bodies, lockpicking is included, doors accurately block out sounds, good climbing system, the list goes on.  Play this game and the entire franchise, and remember to think outside the box and get creative.Must be played with New Dark and HD texture mod, both of which can be found here.http://www.moddb.com/mods/thief-gold-hd-texture-mod "

												One of the best games of all time IMO.Pros:*Long Campaign*Can download Levels other people have made to keep the game going.*Suspensful, many of the horror levels are scarier than most modern horror games without having to do scares on rails.*Semi Open World so one playthrough is never always the same as the next.*CheapCons:*A bit old so the controls can feel a bit dated.*Obviously the graphics aren't visually stunning.*Can have problems running on newer computers but nothing that can't be fixed.*Not a problem for me but it doesn't have controller support.Overall for the price you pay this is one of the best games I can ever advise anyone to buy. If lack of visually stunning graphics doesn't bother you and you just want something to sit and play, get this game. Maybe its just me but I never see this game get much attention and doesn't seem to be regarded as one of the greats, I feel a lot of the community have missed out on this treasure.			"

												The Chronicles Of Riddick: Gold is a game by Eidos Interactive for the Xbox 360. Made in 1995 the game follows an assassin by the name of Garret. He is the reluctant hero that the dystopic future city needs, but not the one it wants right now. The game has you going through various places stealing and killing people as you please. The controls are very bad and you will need to rebind them if you buy it, but if you can get past that it's a pretty good game. Guards have very small detection boxes, enemies die really easily and they all run slower then you do. All these come together to make Assassin™ Gold one of the most enjoyable ""stealth"" games I've ever played. The voice acting is also impeccable and anyone who disagrees is a taffer. I have to admit I was so excited when Looking Glass Studios™ announced Thi4f coming out soon for the Xbox One™ from Microsoft™, the PS4™ from Playstation™, the WiiU™ from Nintendo™ and the Macintosh™ from Apple™. I can't wait to get my hands on it and by the looks of all these great new trailers coming out showing Garret as a more edgy more DmC Dante esque hero I shed tears of joy. It's such a great feeling knowing your beloved video game series has grown up and turned into the next big thing!			"

												Where to even start with this game? This game is the crown jewel of stealth games. Never has any stealth game in my opinion ever put a torch to Thief: TDP. Imagine this game as a fine aged wine if you will. Sip it slowly and really ""taste"" the game as you play it. The main character is one you will quickly fall in love with and the voice acting and dialog is incredibley well written and acted. The art is unique and creates a immersive and original world that is shrouded in mystery. Often you will wish that you only knew more about the setting and characters as the game often teases you with just enough to make you play the next level. The plot develops at a reasonable and sensible pace making you feel that the developers really thought this game out. The gameplay is suspensful and it does not pander to the inexpierenced player like most AAA games do today. The AI is still rather sophisticated given the games age and the levels are well designed, pushing the player in the right direction without holding the players hand. Unfortunately the modern interpretation of the game by Square Enix simply is utter garbage compared to this original. If you are a true a computer gaming fan, do yourself a favor and add this game to your collection.

												I can't recommend this game enough, even with its age and quirks.But I always disliked the additional missions of the Gold edition, they are very unpolished and sometimes outright ugly.Which is why I was happy to find out that there's a mod called ""GoldToDark"" which converts Thief Gold back to the original. Of course this isn't 100% (e.g., there are still the additional fire-guys in some of the missions), but it works well enough. After patching the Steam version of Thief Gold with this, and then using TFix, I could play the game ""as it was meant to be"". (Windows 7)Awesome!			"

												Thief along with Metal Gear shaped the stealth genre and to this day still nothing can rival this first person stealth game... You are placed in huge mission areas and its up to you to use your wits and problem solving skills to over come each and every obstacle Garrett(MasterThief) faces. Thief Gold has an incredible amount of depth partly because the man who is behind Bioshock had a big influence on this game. On a side note the visuals in this game can be somewhat bland but in my opinion that is no reason to bring the score down since there are so many amazing modders that keep this game running with the big boys even today.R.I.P Looking Glass StudiosPersonal rating: 9.6/10			"

												tl;dr Anyone who says to play other Thief games first is an ignoramus. No nostalgia either, I'd never played this before June 2015. This is an amazing game with great dialogue, AI that is still impressive, and one of the most unique and interesting stories in gaming, as well as the best in all of Thief.I'm currently playing the Thief series, and this particular entry gets a lot of hate for bad reasons. Put simply, it's more open-ended than later games in the series in that only about half the game is thieving and stealth. Many of the missions, particularly in the second half of the game, involve survival horror style running from (or fighting if you're good enough, more on that later) monsters, zombies, and demons. Most of the complaints against this game stem from this (""You're only a thief half the time""), and this design itself stems from the game not being a full-stealth game until very late in its development.So to answer most people's main concern, this is a great game, one of the all time great PC games, but it isn't without negative qualities to the extent its sequel is. Most people relate this to the supernatural elements, but most of the heavily supernatural missions are absolutely fantastic if taken for what they're supposed to be, creepy horror missions where you're forced to run a lot. The Lost City, Escape!, Strange Bedfellows, and The Maw of Chaos are all fantastic, and represent a ratcheting up of the scale of missions as well as intensity of story telling. The Mage Towers more than any other mission perfectly blends stealth (hedge mazes full of guards) with the supernatural (towers full of mages), and is an excellent showcase of the game's strengths.Dismissing tone complaints regarding the supernatural elements, we can begin to discuss the game's true flaws, which actually relate to a series of gimmicky stealth missions that simply aren't up to par with the rest of the stealth missions in the game nor the ones in Thief 2.There's just no way around it, Thieves Guild is a terrible terrible mission. One of the worst in any First-Person PC game. Every stereotype of bad FPS design is showcased, it's a confusing blend of underground tunnels and sewers. It reminds you of every level you got stuck in in games like this growing up, and there's no way to defend it. It's worse than just confusing too, in addition to being the second largest level in the game, the objectives even on lower difficulties require you to backtrack at least twice over 75% of the level's length. The gimmick here is that the ""thieves"" who own the guild keep keys to two locked doors in two different bases, so unlocking the final door requires going to the first, then the second, then back to the first, then back to the second. On higher difficulties, you still have to walk back a third time to escape. Awful.And while I'm discussing missions I dread when replaying it, Undercover also deserves special mention. Up until this late game mission, I had no idea this game even had NPC AI, as every NPC met up until this point was either found already dead or rattled off a single line of dialogue before dying where they stood. The mission involves dressing up in hammer garb and raiding a hammerite temple for a key stored within. This is better in description than execution, and it becomes immediately obvious the engine wasn't designed for this sort of thing. I've never done this mission without having certain hammers automatically distrust me, turning the game into a match of ""avoid the 1 hammer"" walking around looking suspicious while the other hammers completely ignore you. The mission ends with a timed race to flip 5 switches that are impossible to find without a guide. The game actively tells you where to look via scrolls, but 3 of the switches in particular are all but impossible to find even with these clues. One clue tells you to check by an Oven, with the stage having two Ovens, and the wrong one being much easier to find. Another one tells you to check behind a tree, but gives no indication of which tree, causing you to strafe circles around trees looking for a switch that's actually under the fence surrounding the trees. Awful.Everything else about this game is good though. If you can skip or speed through those two missions, a great game awaits you. Unlike Thief 2 with its forced stealth, Thief Gold puts no restrictions on your movement. If you want to, you can play it as the sword fighting game it was originally intended to be and fight every single guard and monster. A talented swordsman can defeat any enemy in this game except the bee-shooting-praying-mantis-men without taking a hit, and you have a bow for enemies like the mantis men with ranged attacks. Your maximum movement speed is likewise, never capped, so all your favorite classic FPS advanced movement works here, including one of my favorite versions of bunnyhopping ever. Instead of putting a speed cap on bunnyhopping, going too fast results in a build up of centrifugal force that tilts your perspective back. When you go at these speeds you can actually hear Garrett's individual footsteps speeding up, until you go so fast Garrett's feet can't keep up and you fall on your head and die. So going fast is an exhilarating gamble, and mastery of bunny hopping involves capping your own speed by letting Garrett take a few ground steps every jump once you reach full speed. I'd love to see something like this in a modern shooter.I've seen some suggest that this bunny hopping somehow ruins the game, a notion that I completely reject. No one is forcing you to bunny hop through the whole game, it just provides a second emergent gameplay style for people who want to chop up crab people with swords while flying through the air at 90 miles per hour.Taking it as an entire package, this is a great game. It's not in the running for best game of all time like Thief 2, System Shock 2, and Deus Ex, but it's still a solid 9 or 10 out of 10 game, and is up there with games like Quake 1 in level design and gameplay. In addition, the story is absolutely fantastic, and is significantly better than Thief 2's, as well as being roughly as good as System Shock 2's and almost as good as Deus Ex's. Without spoiling anything, the Trickster is objectively up there with SHODAN, and in my own opinion much scarier, though I think that partially relates to my own fears.P.S. Setting is Medieval, not Steampunk. This was probably played out at the time, but now that steampunk has been done to death this simply makes the game feel more unique than its steampunk sequels.

												I can attempt to go loud, but the guards just give up after 2 minuites. So, Skyrim ripped this game's stealth mechanic.10/10 -MetacriticFor a more serious review, continue reading.Thief Gold is a game all about stealth, no going loud in this game. It has a linear objective, but you can execute those objectives any way you want. This can be compared to the Hitman games. Thief is all about learning from your surroundings, one example of this is in the ""Assassins"" level  If you enter via the library by heading to the right part of the courtyard and jumping onto the roof to the balcony. You can hear two servances complaning about the master, but will hint that there is loot in the basement.  Sometimes, the game is a little too cryptic, and only internet fourms can help you out with that. Even after playing this game for 10 hours (As of 9/29/16) I have still not beaten this game, meaning that you will have to dedicate time to this game. If you are turned off by this game because of the graphics. First off, ♥♥♥♥ you this game was made in 1998 not everything has lens flairs. Second off, this game has an amazing real-time lighting. While it is not shown from moving light, it is shown from when you shoot a water arrow at a torch. I think that was revolutionary for its time, but I was born in the 2000's so don't think than I'm credible. All in all, this game was amazing, even for todays standards. But I heard that they made a remake, that I heard sucks. ♥♥♥♥ remakes.			"

												Easily one of the best stealth games I've played. Though appearing simple by today's standards, the system where you are in various levels of concealment while lurking in several levels of darkness is very well though out and implemented with many ways one can get through a level. It's not uncommon for a player to reach an objective with much more of the area to explore and loot. Very rarely will you find everything in a level on your first go, in fact I never did. AI is intelligent enough to require careful planning at any corner, the abililty to lean and peek pivotal. Listening in on enemy conversations can either be enlightening or just plain amusing, and while their voice acting can be questionable at times, our main characters are voiced superbly.Being able to save anywhere and any time is helpful, and I'd recommend abusing this system mercilessly. If a guard sees you, escape is definitely possible (unless you're on a difficulty which causes this to fail the mission), but I for one tend to just reload to right before it did, that's just me.Speaking of difficulty, you can change it at the start of any mission. All difficulty increases add objectives to your missions, sometimes just a higher loot requirement or not killing/being seen, but in some cases you have more side-tasks you must accomplish. Not many games do this anymore, so that was a pleasant surprise.I cannot praise this game enough, but there is one thing you should know. In this version, cutscenes are pretty broken. There are fixes if you look it up, but I was lazy and just searched them on Youtube between missions. As you get later in the game, they become VERY important to the plot. Don't go through the first five wondering if there should be any like I did!Now if you like stealth (if you don't, then this is NOT a game for you, it is raw thievery from the shadows), buy this game already. Even full price makes me feel like I paid too little for such an incredible experience!			"

												(This game holds up well and works on W7 64-bit no problems.)A stealth game from ""the golden age"" of gaming where stealth isn't the Splinter Cell ""kill everything that moves and maybe sneak past a camera"" and actually means sneak.  If for some reason you're 100% new to this series you play Garrett, a thief whose motivation to steal is to pay his rent.  Throughout the game you go from a pickpocket on the streets to planning your retirement.  This game has a pretty good stealth system even by today's standards in that you need to pay attention to how visible you are and how loud you're being as you move around.  The tools Garrett has at his disposal allows you to actually be a ghost through most (if not all) missions and get through them all without being actively seen by the servants, guards, ghosts, spiders, ghosts, crabs, zombies, grasshopper things, monkeys, frog-beasts, fire elementals, or even hammerite ghosts.  All while turning a nice profit to pay your rent.  For $7 you can't get much of a better deal.			"

												This series of games except the 2014 one is so amazingly great that im getting a hard-on just by writing a review for it. But in all seriousness, this game plus the two that came after it are in my opinion are the grandfather of spooky stealth games. And because of the fantastic community it has, they continue to be updated by fan made patches that ordinary people took their own time to make just so everyone else can enjoy these games one last time just for some nostalgia.

												10/10 !games like this are simply not made anymore !here are few things that i liked about this game:1)level design - each level is huge , while this game doesn't have today level of graphics the textures in this game are simply beautiful, rooms have nice pictures , everything is well placed , each level contain many paths to the target, each level is whole new world for example some of the levels are played in an urban enviroment , some are played inrural areas , some levels are logical and some are totaly crazzy or even psychedelic2)secrets , puzzles , traps - each level in this game contain so much secret locations , even that you think that you seen everything there is always more hidden content , there are hidden rooms in so many places in this game , the cool thing is that this game allow you to continue with normal gameplay even if you didn't find hidden stuff , but when you find it such a nice feeling, also some places contain very cool traps in some levels you get the feeling like you are an the firstexplorer of some ancient pyramid :)3)many different kind of enemies - you have to deal with simple human guards, mages, zombies , ghosts,spiders , mantis like creatures and there are even mini dinosaurs :) and flying fireballs4)you can use alot of equipment5)very good lock picking system (comparing to thief deadly shadow)6)excellent soundtrack - the game makers did a very good job assigning each area of the game its own special soundtrack7)alot of content - you can find many texts and books to read which add alot to the story, also the conversions between guards help you to get clues about the level that you doing.since i played this game after playing thief deadly shadows , i must say that this game is superior to thief deadly shadowfrom the following reasons:1)no more walking in the city - thief dealy shadow had very annoying concept which force you to travel in the city between missions , this one simply give you mission after mission without useless traveling2)no more loading screens - there are no loading sections between different areas of the map3)huge levels - unlike thief deadly shadows the levels in this game are very big and better designed4)rope arrow - a much better system than the climbing gloves5)its simply more fun :)this game is a wonderful expirence and its well worth buying !

												It's truly amazing how ahead of its time this game was. As one of the first first person games that wasn't a shooter, it introduced many people to a whole different genre: stealth. And in terms of pure gameplay mechanics, I'm going to make a controversial claim: this game (and presumably Thief II, which I will start playing soon) has the best stealth in any series of games.While other games put their own spin on the genre (MGS, Hitman) and are good in their own ways, this game requires you be stealthy. Go up against more than one (two if you're REALLY good) enemies and there's a very good chance that you'll meet your end. It's easier and way more efficient to just knock guards out anyway, as they are funcitonally silent and there's no blood to clean up afterwards.In addition to the mechanics, there's great, open ended level design at work here. Each level plops you in the middle of it with only a vague idea of where to go. It's up to you to explore and figure out what's what. And these levels are MASSIVE, especially the special levels included in the Gold Edition. Plus, the world and lore allows for variety as well. In one level, you may be investigating a manor, while in another you may be running and sneaking past the undead (and the horror themed levels in this game are effectively freaky thanks to utterly superb sound design). There's a neat level where you need to tail assassins and, in possibly my favorite level in the game, one where you go undercover as an enemy.To top it off, there's a pretty solid story. Garret is a Thief in an unnamed city who was recruited by a mysterious faction known as the Keepers when he was very young. He rejected their secretive ways, but used the training they gave him to master the art of burglary. After a few vaguely related but nontheless interesting levels, he is recruited by a man to recover an ancient artifact known as The Eye. It twists and turns from there and makes excellent use of its lore.One of the best parts of this game is Garret himself. He's not a typical video game rogue, who might steal from the rich and give to the poor. He steals form literally everybody so he can live. He's selfish as all hell, yet the player can still sympathize with him because everyone he steals from are awful in their own way. His commentary through the game is scarce but wonderful thanks to the developers getting the absolute best voice actor they could for the role.In short, this game is an absolute must play for anyone who loves stealth or for people looking for an extremely well designed and polished game with lots of variety and meat on its bones.

												This game is so awesome. It stands the test of time and that is not an easy thing to do. Everything is just so good in this game. A very loveable protanganist, awesome level design, cool stem punk themes, and a great stealth system to boot. Unfortunely, I had some problems getting the cutscenes to work. However it was an easy fix by going into the program files and running the .exe as an administator. Also, the levels can be a bit confusing and it can be very easy to get lost. But overall the whole expierience is definetly worth it.			"

												An absolute classic.Thief: The Dark Project was one of the first games which spawned the stealth genre as we know it today, along with Metal Gear Solid and Tenchu, and still holds its place as among the best games the genre has ever produced. Thief: Gold is effectively the ""Game of the Year"" edition which includes two extra maps (which admittedly are among the weaker ones in the games). In the game, you play as Garret, a master thief who contains a jewel which notes his visibility at all times, and you use it and your other skills (specialty arrows and especially listening skills) to sneak your way through levels pilfering everything along the way. It is played from a first-person perspective, so there's no means to be able to see around corners, which leads to a claustrophobic experience and requires patience to move forwards, listening carefully for what might be ahead.I poured an enormous number of hours into this game and its sequel when I was younger (prior to Steam), and had replayed them relatively recently - while the graphics have certainly aged, the atmosphere and gameplay have not, and they're well worth checking out. The mod community has put out a wise variety of patches to help those on modern systems play teh games, and the sequel has an entire new ""sequel"" campaign that was made for it.I cannot recommend this game enough.

												Thief Gold is one of the best stealth games I've ever played, maybe even one of the best games I've ever played. It offers a deep and involving plot that unravels itself as the game progresses, 15 humungous levels with a lot of depth to each of them (Like having a multitude of ways to carry out your objectives with different playstyles and many hidden goodies and secrets to unveil), an unrivalled atmosphere that hasn't been beaten by any other video game since, brilliant stealth gameplay mechanics, immersive sound design that's done extremely well and makes you feel like an actual 'master thief' (for the majority of the game, anyway).There's also lots of thinking involved in Thief: Gold, as well. It kind of tests your sense of direction and memory to find your own way through the confusing mazes and sprawling environments. Plus, it doesn't hold your hand at all, or guide you through the entire area with objective markers all over the place.So... there's not much I have to criticize T:G for, but if I had to, the only 2 ""criticisms"" I'd give this game would be that first of all, the graphics are dated. But you can't really fault the game for this. It's a product of it's time. Plus, there are so many graphical mods and patches out there that give it a heavy facelift, regardless! It goes to show how much the fans still care about the Thief series.The other criticism I'd give it is that it sometimes focuses on action more than actual stealth (due to huge changes late in development), but luckily, they're VERY few and far between. And thank god for that, as well.My summary for Thief: Gold is: just play it, already. That's all you really need to know. I'm sure you'll love this game (And you'll love Garrett, too. He's hilarious!

												Thief Gold puts you in the role of Garrett, a master thief and former member of the Keepers. As a thief, your main concern is stealing, and this game does a magnificent job at making you feel like you're the master rogue himself, slipping from shadow to shadow as you make your way through the 15 exhilarating and sometimes terrifying locations that the game has to offer.   You are dropped into a huge, open ended area, ranging from colossal mansions to a large labyrinth of underground sewers, full to the brim with every kind of imaginable loot. What stands between you and your prize are a wide array of guards and creatures, patrolling the perilous corridors and walkways. How you get to your destination, is up to you, and Garret's wide arsenal of different arrows and gadgets make every playthrough potentially different.   The City is dark, gritty, and immerses the player into an abnormal world, bridled by cults and sects which give the game life, giving it a particularly paranormal feeling not seen in any other game. The gameplay itself is close to being absolutely flawless, making use of the revolutionary ""Dark Engine"", with great AI and magnificent stealth mechanics.   Thief: the Dark Project started what is, in my opinion, the best video game franchise to ever exist. It is the first, and arguably the best entry in this series and is nothing short of an absolute masterpiece. An exceptionally terrific game, that is not to be missed by veterans and newcomers to the stealth genre.			"

												takes one step while crouched on a tile floor:4 guards instantly know I'm there and come to attack meruns around like a maniac directly behind a guard on a carpet floor:he blames it on rats10/10But seriously, this is a great game. I think any fan of the stealth genre should play it.I had never played any games in the Thief Series, despite being a huge fan of the stealth genre. I decided I would give this a go after seeing it on sale in the Humble Store, but I didn't expect a lot from it because of the release date. I was so wrong.The gameplay overall is very solid. The combat is a little frusterating at times, but this isn't a game where you should be engaged in a lot of combat anyway. The controlls are total garbage unless you customize them, but that's an easy fix.Where this game really shines is the stealth, which feels so satisfying. Looking at maps and trying to plan out infiltration routes, studying gaurd patrols, hiding in shadows, pickpocketing keys and gold, it all feels so good. It holds up better than some more recent stealth games I've played (which now days play more like action third person shooters than stealth games). The different types of tools at your disposal are another huge plus. I'm particularly found of the gas and water arrows, because I prefer to move through a level with no kills and minimal knockouts.The level design is great. It surprises me to see that some people complain about it, because I think it's one of the highlights of this game. The maps are huge, with tons to explore and see. I love that. There were times when I was wishing I could download a mod that removes all enemies because I thought that the maps were so genuinely well designed and fun to explore that I wanted to be able to see every inch of them.The story is good so far, but I haven't beat the game yet. But very intruiging premise. I like that steampunk medieval cross, it's very cool and gives the game a unique feel. Garretts character is pretty likeable, which is good for any protagonist.Overall I would say this is a phenomanal game. It hasn't aged nearly as much as you may think. You should buy it.			"

												In a world full of shooters and rpgs there is really only one First Person Sneaker franchise to choose from. And its a shame because they blew the roof off that genre (and while roof blowing is quite good, it left no other contenders to offer a shot at this playstyle)Thief Gold sets you in a Medieval timepiece where laws of logic apply to everyone in the game. Sound travels. Light illuminates. And, a thief living on the streets can't win a fight against 3 trained guards. So to get far in this game you must understand the logic behind its design. Walking slowly on carpet can help you remain quiet, while running fast on tile floor will awaken the entire house. Crouching in a dark corner can help you remain completely unnoticed by those around you, while standing next to a torch will certainly get you some attention.In this game you abandon the rocket launcher and mini gun and pick up a bow and sword instead. However, the most effective weapon in your arsenal is a blackjack. When using stealth, you can silently take down enemies. But they aren't dumb. They will notice bodies, blood, or loud noises and often work together when things aren't right.As a thief you can maneuver your way in the front door, or you can mantle your way up to the roof and come in through the chimney. You can bypass all the guards and leave without anyone knowing you were there.. or you can draw your sword and make a mess of things. The choice is yours. Planning your next move from the shadows is a really nice twist from games that throw non-stop action at you. In Thief you get to truly experience every footstep, every comment, every conversation in the level.While carrying out your mission objectives you also get to search high an low for loot. Little is more satisfying that the sound of new coin going into your pocket. Before you find that priceless vase in the safe on the top floor, take a look at the servant quarters and find some extra coin. Then head up to the kitchen and snag a golden goblet. Pass through the bedrooms and find a note that may help you understand a secret hiding an emerald dagger.A single level can last several hours if you enjoy the ambiance, and this game comes with 16 levels of ambiance, thrills, and chills. But once you are finished, visit the mods page, as there are a few hundred fan mods that you can play as well. Some of them containing quality and polish that surpass the original game levels.The path is set out. How you choose to reach the destination is really up to you. Run through the lit corridor when the coast is clear, put out some torches to provider the cover of shadow, or take down the guards and walk through like you own the place. You can even throw some objects or use some special tools to create a diversion away from yourself.. choice is supreme.Over an 19 years after release and still, every single stormy night you can find me playing Thief by candlelight. At least until you try Thief for yourself.. then you will be too busy playing for yourself to bother searching *winky face*			"

												Woah, mama this game is great. You've got tons of freedom in how you approach the environment, the levels are very large and varried, and you are never told exactly where your target is, and sometimes you're gonna have to be a little creative in how you get back out, as the route you took could be very hard to go back through. The AI can be a little dumb sometimes, but it's still very playable. Make sure you think creatively with your rope, water, fire, broadhead, and noisemaker arrows, mines, holy water, etc. If the game falls short in certain areas or leaves you wanting MORE, there's always custom maps and you could find some guides to which ones kick ♥♥♥.Remember that this game is not linear, and there are many ways to enter a complex or get to an objective. Be creative. Think creatively. But don't think wastefully. Water arrows are usually abundant so feel free to shoot off all of those, but buy a ton before entering the level.DO BUY the OLD 1998 Thief. It's fantastic and gives you loads of freedom in stealing and exploring.DO NOT BUY the NEW 2014 Thief. That one is linear garbage with poor writing, terrible audio, retard AI, and GOD-AWFUL level design. Also many more probalos.			"

												Thief Gold edition has been one of the greatest pleasures in gaming I have experienced. While other current 'AAA' titles have the graphics and storyline of a current Hollywood movie, games similar to Thief encourage the player to continuously explore and expand as a video game enthusiast. Any novel would similarly encourage a reader's imagination to flourish. While save restarts can drive me insane, this game forces you to be stealth, and tactful at the same time.I highly encourage any player at a minimum to install the audio enhancements. These enhancements are available in conjunction with the HD texture update packs. The depth and quality of sound is amazing, even for a game this old. You can listen in on countless conversations to learn where certain targets are located in a level, or wait in a dark corner as a guard approaches, and then slealthily knock them out and drag them into the shadows.

												Don't let my playtime fool you, I've sunk a lot of time into Thief!I had to move it out of it's default directory and install a mod in order to fix the surround sound and actually get cutscenes to play. Other than that, this is a great game. It shows some age, particularly in some sound quality, though it was still immersive. Graphics-wise, this game was made over 16 years ago, it definitely looks a bit old with low-polygon models and simpler textures, but you still know all the important information from being in a room, wooden barrels, guardsmen, etc. Plus, there's bound to be a texture mod out there if the graphics are bugging you.The gameplay still holds up! The AI isn't the brightest, with some odd pathfinding that I've noticed, but it is not terrible. They're smart enough to make trickery and deception satisfying and meaningful.A small complaint would be the controls. By default, there are a lot of redundant and confusing keybinds set up. For example, I had to manually set A and D to strafe, so I could have Q and E used for leaning. The walking and running transition is also not retroactive, meaning that if you are walking and you suddenly need to run, you have to let go of the walk key and then run. In my setup, walk is W, run W+alt, so to run whilst walking I release W then hold down alt and press W. As opposed to Skyrim where it would be automatic. Once you spend some time getting used to the game, this isn't much of an issue, but it still slows you down some.Voice acting, dialogue, story... Classic. "

												You will not find a more immersive game...Thief Gold is an expanded version of Thief: The Dark Project.  It contains 3 more missions than the original 12 in the first game, new enemy types, some revisions to some of the maps/loot and expanded on the story and the universe the game takes place in.Thief: The Dark Project came out more than 15 years ago, Thief Gold coming out a year later.  It was the first ever first-person 3D game where stealth, not fighting was the emphasis.  In fact, trying to play it like it was any other first-person game up to that point would result in a very quick and unceremonious death.  You aren't a strong warrior skilled with a sword, you are a Thief, adept at lockpicking, pickpocketing and burglary.  When it comes to combat you will often find you are weaker, slower, and deal less damage than your opponent.  You do, of course, carry a sword and you can parry blows from enemies.  However, a blackjack to the back of the skull when they don't know you are even there is much more effective, and satisfying.  An arrow shot from afar, though cowardly, is always better than more direct confrontation.  Heck, you can play through most missions without even engaging the enemy, so long as you are careful, clever and patient.  Regarding enemy takedowns:  you need to hide unconscious bodies (and corpses) because if other enemies stumble upon it they will go into full alert mode.  This could also mean having to use a water arrow to wash away the blood you've spilled, you murderer.Thief: The Dark Project was, and still is, one of the most immersive games you will ever play (the others being Thief 2: The Metal Age, and Thief: Deadly Shadows).  Even the 2014 THIEF (reboot) game cannot compare to the original(s).  Not in immersion, mechanics, scope or story.  The game required you, as a master Thief, to creep along in the shadows, avoid detection by enemies, steal some nice loot, and meet the mission objectives, because dammit - you have bills to pay.  The levels are huge, complex and sprawling.  They take you through the streets of a dark city, mansions, caverns, crypts...  it wouldn't be unfair to say that the game is part 'Tomb Raider', in that you sometimes find yourself trying to figure out how to avoid clever traps in tombs far underground where undead and burrowing beasts make their home.  You have to climb ropes, leap from ledge to ledge, and swim, among other things, to meet your objectives.One of the greatest things this game and it's 2 immediate successors had was the mythology of the game's universe.  There are interesting factions with opposing ideologies and myriad layers of philosophical inferences made by all of them.  The Hammerites are devout followers of an orderly religion that worships a ""diety"" they call ""The Builder"".  The Builder is revered for casting down the ""Trickster"" and leading the way for progress, particularly in building and forging.  The Trickster was a chaotic pagan god of the wild forests of the old world.  He's a Puckish character; part Pan and part Green Man.  There are ""The Keepers"" who watch from the shadows all the happenings of the world, intervening only to maintain a balance between opposing forces, and keeping scholarly records of all that occurs.  There also exist the ""Mages"", who are akin to Nietzsche's Super Man, in that they have excelled beyond their human abilities, but in turn have lost some of their human moral sensibilities, isolating themselves away from society to study deeper mysteries.Regarding gameplay mechanics:  You have a light gem on the HUD that brightens and darkens signifying how exosed you are.  When it is black you are in pitch blackness and therefore completely invisible to the enemy.  You also have health shields to signify what your physical status is.  Your arsenal can include a sword, blackjack, arrow, water arrow, noise arrow, fire arrow, rope arrow, moss arrow, and gas arrow.  The sword will be the least used of your weapons.  The blackjack will knock an enemy out.  An arrow can kill most enemies on the first shot so long as they have no idea you are there and you have the arrow fully cocked.  Water arrows extinguish torches and fires, and can even kill fire elementals and fire shadows.  The noise arrow will distract enemies.  The fire arrow can kill, light torches, and explode explosive barrels and other such.  The rope arrow allows you to climb to otherwise unreachable places.  The moss arrow makes loud and noisy surface soft and quiet.  The gas arrow knocks an enemy unconscious.Items include various food items that can increase health, health potions, breath potions, flash bombs to blind the enemies, mines, gas mines, keys, lockpicks, and other useable items.Unlike games of today, there are no in-game cutscenes.  The game is broken up into missions and there are cutscenes inbetween that expand upon the story, though much of the story unfolds in readables and overheard conversations during gameplay.  Overhearing an important conversation, finding a key item, or stumbling into a room full of guards and dealing with it's consequences ALL takes place within the game.  You are ALWAYS in control.  How any situation is dealt with is entirely up to you.  Do you shoot a noise arrow down that hall to distract the enemies so you can run by?  Or maybe you could douse all the torches and make it dark enough to creep past.  You could fire a gas arrow at their feet and put them all asleep.  Maybe you could toss a flashbomb at them temporarily blinding them.  Or you could just try looking for another way in.  There's always another way in to be found. One of the most immersive aspects of the game is it's sound propogation.  Sound carries and it gives you an indication of how near or far an enemy is, from which direction, and it informs how you proceed in the game.  You can lean your ear against closed doors to listen for footsteps or conversations happening on the other side - opening doors willy-nilly is not the best approach in this game.  In this respect, it's very much a strategy game:  when to move, when to take, when to engage,...  Another factor that determines how the game is played is in the difficulty settings.  On Normal difficulty you have generally less restrictive objectives.  You can kill ""enemy"" ai, if you want.  On Hard difficulty your loot quota goes up, more objectives are added, and you have fewer health shields.  On Expert difficulty your loot quota goes up higher, even more objectives are added, you have even less health shields, and on most missions you cannot kill anyone.  I could be wrong, but I believe the difficulty settings also affect starting equipment and where some items are to be found.  I know of one mission in particular where a secret door is inaccessible on higher difficulty levels.  No matter what the difficulty level, finding as much loot as possible is strongly advised, because you spend the loot you find before the start of the next mission buying the equipment you will need for it.This game is old, and it's ugly.  However, it has a following and a community that has  been keeping it as up to date as possible.  There is a patch that includes a new enhanced executable, improved models, improved textures, bug fixes, and other tweaks.

												Thief is a true masterpiece and should be a requisite experience for anybody taking a stab at the stealth genre. Nothing beats sneaking around in those dimly-lit hallways using water arrows to quell the flames of nearby torches and melding into the ensuing darkness to mask your dark figure as you knock out guards one by one.

												Thief Gold edition has been one of the greatest pleasures in gaming I have experienced. While other current 'AAA' titles have the graphics and storyline of a current Hollywood movie, games similar to Thief encourage the player to continuously explore and expand as a video game enthusiast. Any novel would similarly encourage a reader's imagination to flourish. While save restarts can drive me insane, this game forces you to be stealth, and tactful at the same time.I highly encourage any player at a minimum to install the audio enhancements. These enhancements are available in conjunction with the HD texture update packs. The depth and quality of sound is amazing, even for a game this old. You can listen in on countless conversations to learn where certain targets are located in a level, or wait in a dark corner as a guard approaches, and then slealthily knock them out and drag them into the shadows.

												You will not find a more immersive game...Thief Gold is an expanded version of Thief: The Dark Project.  It contains 3 more missions than the original 12 in the first game, new enemy types, some revisions to some of the maps/loot and expanded on the story and the universe the game takes place in.Thief: The Dark Project came out more than 15 years ago, Thief Gold coming out a year later.  It was the first ever first-person 3D game where stealth, not fighting was the emphasis.  In fact, trying to play it like it was any other first-person game up to that point would result in a very quick and unceremonious death.  You aren't a strong warrior skilled with a sword, you are a Thief, adept at lockpicking, pickpocketing and burglary.  When it comes to combat you will often find you are weaker, slower, and deal less damage than your opponent.  You do, of course, carry a sword and you can parry blows from enemies.  However, a blackjack to the back of the skull when they don't know you are even there is much more effective, and satisfying.  An arrow shot from afar, though cowardly, is always better than more direct confrontation.  Heck, you can play through most missions without even engaging the enemy, so long as you are careful, clever and patient.

												Considering I did a Thief 4 review I figured I would go back and do the one that started it all, and MAYBE the other 2, I don't know about the 2nd cause I haven't really played it much.PROS:Water arrows: The place that started it all, since this is back in the olden days with no guns or anything except bows, arrows, and sword, there were torches hanging around, which meant you had water arrows, and it took out the lights, so you could sneak by without much hassel of being caught.Light Gem: The light gem is what shows how lit up you are, if you are exposed to the light, or if you are hidden in the dark, very nice tool for being sure you are safe or not.Mapping: The maps are kind of huge so you can explore all you want, get as much loot as you can find, and end up nicking everyones keys and getting rid of all of the lights.No help: I kind of liked this and didn't, it was nice because you had to fend for yourself and think about what to do if a guard was in the room or looking for you, but on the other hand if you were lost in a house and didn't know where to go, even after objective checking and map checking you got lost it could be very tedious to run around and look for whatever it is you were looking for.Knockout aware enemies: I liked this, if a enemy was aware of your prescense and you ended up getting behind him with the black jack, and hit him in the back of his head he would get knocked out from it regardless, you can do this in the 2nd and 4th game too (Atleast I think you can with the 2nd)Monsters: Monsters are all over the bloody place, theres dinos, the fire balls, the zombies, the undead hammerites.CONS:Huge maps: I kind of despised this really, some of the maps were so huge I got annoyed I had to constantly backtrack everywhere just to find something, especially the Gambling Den, that map is so huge, I ended up getting so frustrated about running around trying to sneak around everyone I Just gave up and blackjacked the sods and just ran around looking for the stupid key to the safe, not to mention theres about 4 houses you have to go to with a crapton of underground tunnels.  I don't mind exploring but when I start running around and end up getting lost even with the map and objective I just start getting frustrated about either A) what I am currently looking for, or B) I end up getting lost in the place and annoyed I don't know where to go.Health: You don't get much health in this game, I know you are supposed to be stealthy but if you get backed into a corner with no way out with no flashbangs or speed potion you basically have to fight the guy(s) and your health drops like a anvil just fell on your head, not to mention health potions aren't all that effective.Noises: This annoyed me, either Garrett is wearing tap dancing shoes or he weighs a whole lot, if you walk on surfaces such as metal, grass, etc, they all make different noise as well as how loud it is, but bloody h3ll tile is the worst of it all. One time in Constantines house there is tiles almost everywhere, and guards walking around, so I crouched and walked as slow as possible and apparently a guard 3 meters away from my position heard me, and I was going as slow as a snail for gods sake, if I were to actually get close to him it would have taken me forever and he would have had to fully stop.Out of all this game gets a 7/10 some things heavily bug me and I wish they would fix them or atleast put something up as a workaround.

												To be honest, the sequel (Thief 2) was better in just about every aspect, but this here started it. This here was the first fully fleshed out stealth FP(S) game.If you look past the dated graphics (which can be greatly improved by some fanmade patches), the game mechanics, the atmosphere, the controls... the overall package has never been surpassed by any other stealth game since. The original Splinter Cell and Dishonored were probably on par, but that's about it.Maybe nostalgia is getting the better of me when it comes to this, but for the advertized price, you can't go wrong.

												As of writing this I haven't beaten it yet so keep that in mind. I am currently almost 14 hrs into the campaign so I feel like I have a pretty good understanding of the game as of right now to give a recommendation. I will list pro's and cons as follows. Pro's: The sound design is wonderful literally some of the best stuff I have heard even by todays standards. The gameplay is always fueled by player agency, not a single point during this campaign does the game spoon feed you with needless cutscenes or take away your control. YOU ARE Garrett and Garrett is YOU. The level design is spectacular as well, this is the first time I've played an older game where I don't feel like I really need a map. You have one, it serves its purpose but as long as you have a good sense of direction you'll hardly ever need it. Plus it is just fun sneaking around stealing random stuff you see. Cons: There aren't many cons I can think of but maybe one I could list is some of the Gold specific missions aren't as good as the non Gold ones. However, that doesn't mean they are terrible because the game is still amazing Gold or not. Another con may be the fact that Steam has done a poor job at getting this ready to play as soon as you purchase it. Would be nice if the Tfix patch was just bundled with the purchase because at this point I can't see anyone playing this without it. Score & further comments: I personally feel this game lives up to every single praise it has gotten and I can't wait to play Thief 2 and Deadly Shadows, I give the game ""Must Buy"" rating. I have always heard so many things about this series and I have played some of this game and the others but I always stopped very quickly. It wasn't until just recently that I decided to play through them all and I have to say I'm glad I made this decision.			"

												I was lucky enough to play this game when it was released. Still one of the best game out there. This game had everything: charismatic main protagonist and villains (Garrett, Viktoria, the Trickster etc.), a great new engine (Dark Engine which featured new alpha blending, texture filtering and lighting techniques... all quiet revolutionary back than). Great game and level design (It was designed to be largely unscripted; events, instead of being pre-defined by designers, occur naturally.) Great gameplay (Thief focused on stealth and evasion from a first-person perspective, and not full frontal action.) Atmosphere (The game takes place in a metropolis called ""the City"" which has been noted to contain elements of fantasy, the Middle Ages and the Industrial Revolution.) Cutscenes (They were partly animated, partly made with live actors and motion capture technology). Even today the Thief series is the ultimate stealth game in gaming history. The stealth system was very new when the game was released. The player had to rely on the environment to avoid being detected. Shadows could be used to avoid notice; a monitor on the heads-up display (HUD) indicated the player character's visibility level. The player could lean, crouch, climb, swim and run, among other actions. Surfaces caused varying amounts of noise; for example, carpet is quiet and ceramic tiles are very loud. Enemies were reacting to these factors, and players could manipulate these element of gameplay to distract NPCs etc. Go play Thief:TDS than go and play the rest of the series			"

												An excellent stealth game, very fun with tons of replay value.  However it does require third party patches/updates.  The Steam version runs rough, but once Newdark updates done runs better than ever.The graphics are certainly dated, the dark engine was never known for its graphics.  So that aspect of the game has aged poorly.  The gameplay is solid though with tons of hours worth of content.  Plus there are hundreds of fan missions to enjoy.I personally prefer Thief 2 over Thief 1, but still cant recommend this one enough.  Get it, its well worth the price.			"

												Recenly got this on Steam and its just as great as i remmber from when i was a kid. Thief is a game about a dude that steals ♥♥♥♥ and hits people. and its a great experience. But the selling point of the game unique in its time. Today, stealth is about stalking in the shadows and taking out your enemies with ease. You can slit their throats, take them down with a expertly placed arrow to the spine, whatever you want. But stealth back then was about environment more than anything. One of the reasons that the Thief franchise was so beloved is the immersive effect on the world. Everyone who has played the game will recall moments of standing in the shadows and having a curious guard creep over to them like a teacher who suspects you having a pocket knife. and then they move their torso around like an action figure and say ""IS THAT THEE????"" get it			"

												There are very few games I consider objectively perfect, and Thief ranks extremely high on that list.Thief is a pure hardcore first person stealth game, and it largely tests your impatience. Your enemies all fight better then you do, and they call for reinforcements faster then you can press the quickload key. As a result the game encourages you to slow down, and as you do so take in the extremely impressive sound and environment design. As well as it's amazing storytelling.It's a game that features a very diverse amount of environments. From drab castles, old abandoned mines, crypts, to hellish alternate dimensions. It provides an amazing atmosphere and is one of the few games that consistantly keeps very good pacing (aside from the Thieves Guild mission). Believe me when I say, the only contender Thief has for greatest stealth game is probably it's sequel.			"

In Summary:Thief was a pioneer of its time, turning people away from mindless killing and over to tactful thinking and stealth. In many ways it cannot stand up to modern titles, but it surpasses others still. For anyone who is a fan of the stealth genre that spawned around this very important foundation, Thief is a must play. If not for the historic relevence it is simply good sneaky fun.Expect: Sneaking, shadows, straight lines, polygons, religious dudes, magic, getting your backside kicked, a unique steam-punk world, servants.Do NOT Expect:A thriller, amazing AI (by today's standard), fantastic graphics, to survive a fight.The LONG VersionI find it most challenging coming back to older games to review them. Firstly, there's not many who'd be reading these reviews - most people buying it on Steam owned it at one point and don't really need convincing. Secondly, it's hard to separate nostalgia from honesty. On other words, it's hard picking fault with a game you've grown up with. It's like a sibling - even though they may be flawed as a person you love them anyway. You grew up with them, they mean something to you.It has been some time since I came back to the original Thief. Last time I played it I was very young and the prospect of being caught scared me so much I barely made progress through the story. Fortunately my older, possibly more apathetic self, now desensitised from most video-game fear by the many horror games now doing the rounds, found progress much easier. The first thing you must consider is the game's age. Thief came out in 1998. To put that into perspective, Half-Life came out that same year. Games in that era were very much similar - FPS was king. Stealth hadn't really been thought of as a core game mechanic and the concept led to what became a very unique game. Rather than goading the player into massacring hundreds of would-be assailants, Thief flipped the whole playing field on its head. Combat was to be something that should be avoided and feared - it meant you'd done something wrong.The world created in Thief is rich and deep, even if it isn't overly explored and developed as lore. You get a feel for the various factions and how they fit into the society of the world. From the fervorantly religious Hammerites to the technophobic Pagans and everyone in between, the world is populated with a huge variety of people with different roles in life. This doesn't so much come to mean much over the course of general gameplay - avoiding being detected is key to your success, regardless of if there's a powerful magic user around or just a servant who might royally fudge up your day by running off and telling the guards. All the while you'll be stealing stuff. After all, the game is called Thief. There are also many documents lying around which give valuable information or simply give an insight into the game world.This brings me to the storyline. Minus spoilers, naturally. Playing as master thief Garrett you'll get pulled into a very nasty and sinister plot, which echoes many a dark tale of evil. Even considering the game's age the story isn't at all bad. It takes you to many different locales from treasure-laden lordly estates to cathedrals and entire city districts abandoned to an encroaching malevolence. Even knowing such evil exists makes the least magical places seem spooky. Thief boasts one of the scariest levels in videogames. ""The Haunted Cathedral"" still sends shivers down my spine, even in the altered Thief Gold version of the level.AI-wise the game does quite well, even by today's standard. There are fixed enemy types, as you'd expect, but they each possess certain attributes which determine how they behave. For instance ghosts and apparitions are completely deaf, but are easily alerted to visual disturbance, while beastmen have heightened hearing. As a general rule, any messing about you do (making noises, picking up valuable trinkets from highly visible well-travelled locations) will trigger people to search for you. The more you do it, the longer they look and the more on-edge they get until they find you. The combat itself isn't great, and for me I'd say it was the biggest let-down in the game. The animations don't quite synch making parrying difficult.In terms of graphics Thief is very basic. It uses the first iteration of the DarkEngine, so all the humanoid models are very edgy and polygonal. The animations are what you'd expect, but they get the job done. The game mechanics are fairly solid and the mission briefs/cutscenes give you enough information to go through the levels with the minimal of guesswork. The stealth system itself is very basic. It measures stealth via light and sound. If you're stood still in a dark shadow (or sometimes a very thin shadow in a doorframe) you'll be completely invisible, regardless of surrounding lights and the sillouhette you'd think would be a dead giveaway. Enemies would have to bump into you physically to detect you.One thing I should note - Thief Gold is different to Thief: The Dark Project, the original release. Many levels were redesigned, added or removed. In some ways the changes are good, certain things are made easier whilst other things are made much more challenging. It's a mixed bag. Purists will tell you the changes are bad, but you can make up your own mind.			"

												I was lucky enough to play this game when it was released. Still one of the best game out there. This game had everything: charismatic main protagonist and villains (Garrett, Viktoria, the Trickster etc.), a great new engine (Dark Engine which featured new alpha blending, texture filtering and lighting techniques... all quiet revolutionary back than). Great game and level design (It was designed to be largely unscripted; events, instead of being pre-defined by designers, occur naturally.) Great gameplay (Thief focused on stealth and evasion from a first-person perspective, and not full frontal action.) Atmosphere (The game takes place in a metropolis called ""the City"" which has been noted to contain elements of fantasy, the Middle Ages and the Industrial Revolution.) Cutscenes (They were partly animated, partly made with live actors and motion capture technology). Even today the Thief series is the ultimate stealth game in gaming history. The stealth system was very new when the game was released. The player had to rely on the environment to avoid being detected. Shadows could be used to avoid notice; a monitor on the heads-up display (HUD) indicated the player character's visibility level. The player could lean, crouch, climb, swim and run, among other actions. Surfaces caused varying amounts of noise; for example, carpet is quiet and ceramic tiles are very loud. Enemies were reacting to these factors, and players could manipulate these element of gameplay to distract NPCs etc. Go play Thief:TDS than go and play the rest of the series			"

												Yes Its awesome.I bought this for something to do and I thought It was so good I would buy all of them. The stealthiness and ambience created in these games are just great, and the mechanics and physics are just great. This was the 1990's and I would be very suprised, If I saw a game like this in these times.This game is 100% worth the money and is a giveaway on the 75% off steam sale, however 4.99 is a Good price.  This ios also a challenge if you look old games as you can choose difficulties which change aspects of each objective. I would HIGHLY reccomend it. The game is definetley the Title GOLD pure gold. I couldn't have asked for better.			"

												Listen, forget assassin's creed, forget splinter cell, forget metal gear, forget every stealth game you ever played.  This is where it all started.  There wouldn't be a stealth genre if there were no Thief.  And unlike the former titles mentioned, Thief is TRUE stealth.  At no point can you decide ""Oh to hell with it"" and run out of your hiding place guns/daggers/et al blazing, killing everything with a consciousness in your path.  You are a thief - you stay hidden by shadow and silence and steal stuff.  As soon as you leave the shadows you are fair game to be hacked to pieces like the taffer you are.  That being said, stay hidden and walk with shadows and you are a force of nature.  Thief is to this day a one of a kind game with mechanics that are still mostly unique.  The only games I can think of that come close to hardcore stealth like Thief are the Styx games (Master of Shadows/ Shards of Darkness).  I love the story, the world building, the environments, the characters - everything narrative about this game and cannot recommend it enough.  Only drawback is because it is an older game, it has a hard time running on newer operating systems (Windows 7,8, and 10).  There is a workaround for this though and it's super easy: go here http://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=134733 and install the necesarry patch.  TL;DR+The OG stealth game+Dope story, characters, and world+Gameplay that challenges you to be one with the shadows-It is dated, so graphics aren't up to snuff+/-Have to download patch to get it to run on present day operating systems (Takes no time, is super easy to do)			"

												Despite having clunky controls & older graphics, I was impressed with the size of the levels & complexity of the heists. I liked the tone of the game world; the struggle between chaos & order & how the protagonist doesn't care about that at all & just needs to steal things to pay his rent. This game is pretty great when you're not fighting anything, which I believe is intentional.			"

												The Dark Project is a classic, a very dated classic however. I remember beating this game when I was much younger and remembering how difficult it was. Thief 1 and 2 have probably the least amount of hand holding that I have ever seen in a game almost to the point where it’s a detriment because the levels are so massive that you would very regularly get lost and it does get quite frustrating and takes the fun out of the game because you spent quite a bit of your time in these games just trying to figure out where you need to go and what you need to do. I never found the hand drawn maps to be ever useful when I played this game, it always just looked like a clusterf*ck and I could never pinpoint where I was so I never used it and always ended up relying on my memory of everywhere I have been in the level to forge a map of my own in my head. Thief has a decent story with a cool protagonist but I was never a fan of the supernatural aspects that the story goes to and that story also reflects on the later stages of the game as well because you will be visiting catacombs, crypts etc. I feel like that takes away of what the core of the franchise is supposed to be which is thieving. There is also just some awful levels thrown in there like the Thieves Guild in particular. The controls and movement are very clunky and the stealth mechanics are pretty basic now looking back but the highlight of this game was always and still remains the levels themselves and how massive and detailed they are and how you navigate them to complete your objectives, that is what still makes this game worth trying out today however as a pure stealth game today I don’t think it’s better than the average stealth game out there right now.5/10 (Average)			"

												My favourite Thief game out of the bunch, I've yet to grow my love for Thief2 because I haven't gotten around to the FMs yet. Thief Gold, is a good 50-100 hours of gameplay if you wish to find all the loot and secrets on your own, complete in on all difficulties to see how all difficulties affect the pacing of the game, challenged yourself to 'Ghost' the entire game and/or even Supreme Ghost some. With how old the game is you definitely need to set some limits as to what you're allowed to do, or the game gets boring and easy very quick.Getting TFix and Fan missions is a MUST, playing through the, around 100, fan made missions out of which there are some that are just plain horrible and some that are amazing, with custom conversations, missions that stick to the lore of Pagans, Hammaries and Keepers, or maybe something that has nothing to do with the original story of the game, but is just so well written.With FanMissions you are looking easily at another 100-300 hours of gameplay if you choose to play through ALL of the fan misions. And this game definitely has a lot of replay value, the story and cutscenes are amazing.10/10 - Would lock all hammrites outside the temple again			"

												Going back to Thief: The Dark Project after playing its (superior IMO) sequel, The Metal Age, is quite a jarring experience.The Dark Project is one of those games that, in retrospect, comes off as more of a tech demo showcasing the potential of the licence than a fully-fleshed out gaming experience. While you still get a lot of fun out of it, looking back, you can see the cracks and rudimentary design that would be further polished and refined down the line.You see it everywhere - guard patrols that stack up four or five deep in a single line, rooms with lots of guards facing away from the player, smaller levels on average, rougher animation, etc.Yet, for all that, the original Thief is still an engrossing and eminently-playable experience. The bones of the engine are all there, and blackjacking and using rope arrows still feels as good as it did when I first played it back in the late 90's. It's definitely worth picking up both of the games, if only to see how much the engine and gameplay developed between the two original installments.			"

												I played a bit of Thief (2014) before but I wasn't satisfied with it (the thieving aspect felt lackluster and dumbed-down). I took some notice however to the praise its predecessors have received. I then bought Thief Gold for 1.74€ on sale, a steal of a deal and it can't hurt. I have played the first 3 missions so far (excluding the tutorial) and saved currently on the 4th which I am nearly done with.I am absolutely astounded how much fun I have and feel kind of sad that the reboot was distancing itself from its roots.The sound design is great. It's important to consider the sound you make by walking (different surfaces produce different volumes of sound). You also have to listen to enemies which you cannot directly see and it goes along nicely with the stealth mechanics (hiding in the shadows and judging different lighting conditions). The levels are usually very large and allow for many different approaches. However, they might be too time-consuming. I spent one and a half hour just for the Prison one. I like the slow gameplay of it (it's a nice change of pace with all the fast-paced games we currently have) but it certainly is unappealing for some. The AI is hard for me to judge. If I move to recklessly, they will either hear me and scout me out that way or see and aleart other guards. They do feel kind of dumb at sometimes but I can't expect a perfect replication of human behaviour. Obviously not from a game from 1998 and it could make some levels a tad too hard.The fighting is kind of strange and unnatural, but I'm fine with it as you usually don't want to fight at all or head on.I absolutely recommend Thief Gold, playing a game barely older than oneself is interesting and I'll definitely pick up Thief 2 and Thief: Deadly Shadows at some point once I'm done with this one.SOME TIPS BEFORE PLAYING:The game will probably not support the resolution you're using, to fix that and many other issues, I recommend downloading TFix 1.23 (as of this writing). You can find it here: http://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=134733The Intro video and mission briefings will not be played properly, I fixed it by running ""THIEF.exe"" in the installed directory as administrator (Windows 7 64 bit). Thanks for the fix to some person on the Internet who mentioned it.I already mentioned that I'm barely older than this game so using the default controls was very weird. There is a steam guide which includes ""Modern Thief Controls"", you can find it here.

												Do you think you can master the art of thievery  like the Master Thief Garret? Well, I found out that I was worthy of this challenging experience and this was one of the best play throughs I have ever managed to accomplish, even after all of quick loads/saves, deaths, mistakes, and retries. Thief Gold is an amazing Stealth game that allows the player to take control of the most beautifully created protagonist, Garret the Master Thief, as he slips in and out of the shadows to knockout his enemies, steal a bunch of pricy loot in gain for personal adavantages, pickpocket enemies for quick access to locked doors: truly a master of it all really. Thief Gold introduces a new sort of gameplay style, one where you have to think about every action that you perform, it can be fluid if done properly, but if one were to mess up  (i.e. failed attempt to knock out a guard) all hell can break lose. Every action is yours to think about, where you want to go, how you want to get there, who do you need to knockout in order to get there, etc. etc. In order to be a Master Thief one must think like a Master Thief, use your wits to your advantage, stay in the shadows as much as possible and dont forget to quick save whenever you feel the need necessary. Can't seem to figure out how to obtain all of the objectives or find the right way to go, then just restart the mission, there is NO PENALTY in doing so, there is only progression and sometimes restarting will only freshen your mind and will help you accomplish the mission with ease. So please do yourself a favor and pleaseeeeee please please try this amazing stealth game out, you WILL NOT be disappointed with it. 10/10 would bang again. Thank you, I'll be here all night.			"

												This is definitely one of my all time favorite video games ever that every taffer out there should at least try out. Here are the pros and cons:PROS- The amazing sound design, this is absolutely Thief franchise's best features. Not only does it help player get deeply immersed in the dark and mysterious world, but it also works as an effective way to determine enemy locations.- Impressive shadow based stealth system for its time, in a matter of fact this might be the very first sneaking game that uses darkness as the main tool for hiding.- The graphics, they aren't bad that's for sure, especially for a slow paced 1998 game that puts a high focus on environment and exploration (Just remember to NOT play on the software mode).- The main protagonist, there's just something charismatic about everybody's favorite cynical and snarky thief, Garrett.CONS- Spiders...Mother♥♥♥♥ing spiders everywhere, damn i'm glad they fixed this in Thief 2 and removed most of dem motha♥♥♥♥as!- The high emphasis on horror and tomb raiding, thankfully fixed in the successors.- The last 2 levels just suck... They are just plain horrible.Conclusion: Like i said, one of my favorite games of all time and i definitely recommend this to any hardcore stealth fans that isn't afraid of spiders and creepy ♥♥♥ zombies like myself. My final rating is [9,1].Review written by a hardcore taffer and a long time Thief fan, Hoxton47 "

												So I recently finished this game and I have to say; for most of it's faults, it's a damn good and extremely addicting result from an experiment of making an tomb raider rip off only to make it a stealth game in the last few months of development. The story is one you really need to pay attention to because this game doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing spoon feed anything to you, and when it does it's only for dramatic affect. And hot digidy ♥♥♥♥ing damn is it effective. Not to mention the cutscenes are absolutely gorgeous. The game itself has some of the absolute best stealth mechanics in any game ever (and this coming from a Metal Gear Solid fanboy) thanks to it's good use of lighting and simply perfect sound design. Now this game isn't without it's faults, and unfortunately they are pretty ♥♥♥♥ing big faults. The big one is Monster levels. First you're ♥♥♥♥♥♥ing over the ♥♥♥♥ing briliant Prison break level only to have the game ♥♥♥♥ in your mouth with levels like The Lost City, Return to the Cathedral, that one abandoned city level, and the absolutely atrocious last three levels of the game. Then there's also the problem archaic map design which would have been fine if the map was actually ♥♥♥♥ing useful. Then there is the added flaws with some mechanics like mounting and jumping. Mounting doesn't seem to want to work a third of the time and Jumping while running makes you exceed ♥♥♥♥ing mach 5. Thankfully the good bits are ♥♥♥♥ing sublime and easily overshadow the rest of the games problems. In the words of The Rageaholic, ""it's impossible to shake the feeling of taking one step forward and three steps back while playing Thief: the Dark Project. Lucky for Thief then that the one step was so mother ♥♥♥♥ing monumental."" It's the result of a dangerous experiment that got lucky and I can't wait to play Thief 2: the Metal Age9/10			"

												This and Thief 2 are the gold standard by which stealth games are measured. There is an interesting and mysterious world that you will learn about as you play your way through, sneaking through the shadows. The graphics are a little dated, but there are mods that can bump them up a bit, and the dark environments and wonderful sound design preserve the atmosphere.			"

												It's a bit rough around the edges, even when it came out, but his remains one of my favorite games of all time. Anyone who loves the stealth genre should check it out. Thief II still has some of the best levels in any game since.You can read my guide if you need help getting it patched and running. :)			"

												With strong level design and some of the best early stealth gameplay, the game revolutionized what first person ""shooters"" could accomplish.  Its plot, however, is far from revolutionary, and quickly veers from clever pilfering and plundering capers to unnecessary supernatural elements.  Nonetheless, the strong gameplay can withstand the weight of the weaker plot; the game is well worth the bargain bin price-tag it sells for these days.			"

												PLAY IT IN HD using TFix & the HD Texture Mod, it's a delight!Instructions here: http://www.moddb.com/mods/thief-gold-hd-texture-mod/forum/thread/thief-gold-hd-mod-faqDark Project... a stealth classic which includes good surprises, various levels with different kind of missions and their own atmosphere, sometimes creepy, sometimes quiet. Using shadows to hide and avoiding making noise is important because combat is a little rude.By the way, the sound effects are really neat for a 1998 game.I remember watching several times a demo in 1999 using a 4.1 home cinema and it was awesome at this time!If you like stealth, give it a try, and use TFix & the HD mod to enhance everything.

												Pros: Not only the prototype for stealth, it remains the best. Use sound(speed of movement, surface you move on determine how much noise you make) and shadow(light meter tells you how hidden you are in that regard) to sneak. Everything around you is there to reveal and/or find and kill you. Awesome Steampunk(some modern machines in otherwise medieval setting) atmosphere and world-building. Few but incredible gadgets, like a rope arrow and flashbangs. Tense and challenging. Solid story, yet non-linear game-play, well-balanced. Exploration of themes of the disciplined, science-driven and controlled versus the chaotic, natural and unpredictable. Addictive.Cons: Survival horror elements are out of place, though fun. Graphics weren't even good when it came out.My recommendation: Into stealth? Play this. Not mincing words.			"

												Thief GOLD is absolutely incredible! I'm glad I finally played it. When I was younger, I skipped out on the Thief games because they had stealth and seemed hard. Thief GOLD is no walk in the park and is quite challenging. I clocked in about 26 hours and some missions took me 1-2 hours to complete. I had to use a walkthrough and watch youtube videos for some parts because it is easy to get lost! The map system is more like a visual representation of hints and doesn't actually tell you where you are, thus making the levels seem almost maze like. However, the gameplay and atmosphere of Thief totally make up for this. The game is totally immersive and sucks you into it's universe. The gameplay is really simple! You play as a thief, Garrett, and must follow certain objectives to complete a mission like stealing loot for item purchases after the end of each mission. Also, you must sneak around; castles, caves, dungeons, cathedrals, mansions, and med-evil cities without getting caught by guards and monsters. The visuals and controls obviously have shown it's age compared to modern games, but they definitely have charm. I would totally recommend this game! Great atmosphere, great gameplay, great protagonist, and a good challenge.			"

												    As I first entered the game the first thing I asked myself was, ""what the hell is this"". After playing the in game tutorial and realizing that the controls are absolute shi* from a younger gamer's point of view I edited them which felt well suited to my play style. I start to play and I see instructions on what I need to do on the upcoming mission. Immediately closing the dreadfull screen full of words with no pictures I start to adventure. Hiding in the shadow like a... thief *pun intended, you may chuckle to yourself now softly* I got caught by the guards within 30 minutes and had to restart all over again. As I curse to myself realising that theres no autosave feature in a game made 15 years ago *to my astonishment*, and also realising that I actually need to manually save, I start to play again with a determined look on my face and a bag of doritos sitting close to me *for confort reasons*.10/10			"

												Do you think you can master the art of thievery  like the Master Thief Garret? Well, I found out that I was worthy of this challenging experience and this was one of the best play throughs I have ever managed to accomplish, even after all of quick loads/saves, deaths, mistakes, and retries. Thief Gold is an amazing Stealth game that allows the player to take control of the most beautifully created protagonist, Garret the Master Thief, as he slips in and out of the shadows to knockout his enemies, steal a bunch of pricy loot in gain for personal adavantages, pickpocket enemies for quick access to locked doors: truly a master of it all really. Thief Gold introduces a new sort of gameplay style, one where you have to think about every action that you perform, it can be fluid if done properly, but if one were to mess up  (i.e. failed attempt to knock out a guard) all hell can break lose. Every action is yours to think about, where you want to go, how you want to get there, who do you need to knockout in order to get there, etc. etc. In order to be a Master Thief one must think like a Master Thief, use your wits to your advantage, stay in the shadows as much as possible and dont forget to quick save whenever you feel the need necessary. Can't seem to figure out how to obtain all of the objectives or find the right way to go, then just restart the mission, there is NO PENALTY in doing so, there is only progression and sometimes restarting will only freshen your mind and will help you accomplish the mission with ease. So please do yourself a favor and pleaseeeeee please please try this amazing stealth game out, you WILL NOT be disappointed with it. 10/10 would bang again. Thank you, I'll be here all night.			"

But the levels in general makes you want to find secrets and alternative routes to your objectivs.)  walking/running on metal floor,marble floor, etc, will generated its own unique amount of noise and alert guards nearby  Usage of sound to hear guard patrols and shadow to hide from them.

Thanks to the wonderful effort of the modding community, which has taken the time to completely re-texture this game for today's standard, there is no reason not to play this game if you have not already. Be warned, however, that it is a difficult game. Old-school difficult. Here is my advice: Hotkey quick-save and dive right in.

												This game is much much harder than i remember or anticipated, even on normal difficulty you would most likely struggle to complete a level in a single run. All this being said it is still an awesome game, you may just need patience if you wish to play it or you may rage quit. There is none no point running around hacking and slashing at anything that moves, thats just a quick way to die, not to mention certians enemies wont die by your sword, you may have to use special weapons that you can only have active for 30 seconds.The graphics in this game are what you may expect from a first person game made in the late 90's, some of the animations are a little awkward (but also kind of funny); particularly when a zombie is on the floor and then stands up in one single movement like a drawer bridge being closed realy fast.In terms of gameplay there are about 15 different missions that will take you somwhere in the area of 25 to 30 hours to finish in their entirety with a rather extensive choice of inventory items that will help you in different ways on different missions, one example being you can put out tourches with the water arrows to improve your shadow cover and move around guards without being seen. The replay value of this game is quite low, unless you start on the lowest difficulty, then you could move your way up to higher difficulties and with the higher difficulties you will receive additional mission objectives.My Tips: 1.If you are having trouble with cutscenes not playing then change the permissions of the thief exe to run as administrator. This has worked for me on Windows 7 and Windows 10.2.Save Regularly, this game does not autosave and if you have been sneaking arounf for say 30mins and then you die you will have to go all the way back to your most recent save.3. Pay attention to the light bar when trying to avoid detection, some areas will look nice and dark for hiding away but when you step into said area; your visibility may as not be well hidden as you hoped.All in all i do recommend this game, but if sneaking around and potentially dying alot is not somthing you enjoy in a game; then this game may not be for you.

												I have nothing but the highest praise for this excellent game.  It's probably not for everyone so I would say, you will either love this game a lot, or you will hate it.  Personally I play the first 2 in the series at least once a year, since they came out -  they stand the test of time in a way few other games can.  Please do not confuse it with the EIDOS game ""Thief"" of 2013, i could not make it 10 minutes into that one-already two developer firms have tried to recapture these first two, and flat out failed.  There's a reason, because the look, feel, and gameplay of these two games are probably impossible to copy.  Anyway, this game is one of the best ever and classic games of the early 2000's.  I still replay this game once a year.  It plays just fine on Win 7, no issues whatsoever, with the Steam version, and so does thief 2 the metal age.  Thief gold and thief 2 immerse you into a sort of Medieval theme world, the emphasis is not shoot em up it is stealth, sneaking around in the shadows, dowsing torches and knocking out guards so you can achieve your objectives.  Thesse objectives include all sorts of missions not just thievery, although you of course do plenty of that on the way too. You are in a weird world, that gets introduced to you in small steps fortunately, populated by mechanists (they worship the machine), keepers (of knowledge), weird creatures of all kinds, but you get gently dropped into it bit by bit so it doesn't seem bizarre to you.  Your weapons are limited and you  use them in clever ways=sword, blackjack, arrows, water arrows (for dousing torches and cleanign up blood) fire arrows (these do impressive damage and blow up the ""head cameras"" in thief 2).  There are no guns of any kind in this game but it just makes for a more fun challenge.  There are no cheats except, if you want to skip to the next level, hit these keys:  ctrl  +alt +shift + end.  I forget if you have to hold them all down at once?  Also if you want to start a level with all the money, like you  might want to do with ""First national Bank"" in THIEF 2, you can download save games and you can start with all the money so you can buy all the tools and weapons you can possibly have.

												Thief: The Dark Project is the first game of the Thief series and basically the mother of first person stealth games. The gold version on Steam is the base game plus the expansion levels. This review contains minor spoilers but they are kept at the absolute minimum.Garrett is a street child who survived by stealing. One day he gets caught by one member of a secret organization called the Keepers. The man, noticing Garrett's natural talent offers him the opportunity to join the Keepers instead of calling the city watch. Garrett agrees to join the Keepers and undergoes several years of training in covert operations. But eventually he grows tired of the Keepers who are only about keeping secrets and reciting prophecies, so he decides to leave to live by himself again. The Keepers are not keen of his decision but let him go. Garrett wants nothing more than not getting involved with other people's problems and eventually getting enough money for him to quit stealing altogether. However, things don't go as planned. Eventually Garrett gets involved with the wrong people and finds himself within a major conflict that he cannot ignore any more.Thief's setting is a weird but interesting mix of middle ages, fantasy and industrialization. Due to not knowing a better word for it I'd call it fantasypunk. While swords and bows are common weapons electric lights and sophisticated machinery are often seen. Also does magic exist as well as undead and other monsters. The city is controlled by an extremely wealthy elite on one hand and a religious group called the Hammerites on the other. The Hammerites believe in absolute technological progress and also have a zero-tolerance policy against all criminals and non-believers. They are responsible for most of the technological wonders of the city. They have so much influence that they even run their own prisons. The Pagans, the other major religion in the city, have nearly no influence any more. If they are caught by the Hammerites they are likely to be executed since their beliefs are the polar opposite of the Hammerite doctrine.  They believe that humanity is already too advanced and needs to embrace nature again.Garrett is neither a fighter nor is he able to cast magic spells. He is however extremely good at hiding in the dark and sneaking past people without getting noticed. He also is able to use some gadgets to aid him the most important ones being his arrows. In addition to his sword and his blackjack Garrett is carrying a bow for which he possesses various arrow types. The ability to use those arrows might actually be minor magic but that isn't clarified anywhere. Garrett can for example use water arrows to extinguish light sources from a safe distance. He also has rope arrows which can be shot into any wooden surface and provide a rope to climb up. Garrett also has access to noisemaker arrows come in very handy if he wants to distract enemies from his current hiding spot. Even though Garrett is able to kill with his sword or his broadhead arrows stealth is highly emphasized in Thief. On the highest difficulty setting it is not even allowed to kill any person. Killing someone always makes some noise unlike knocking them unconscious or avoiding them altogether. Even a one on one fight is dangerous for Garrett since his fighting skills are not comparable to those of the guards. If you knock somebody unconscious it is highly advised to hide the body somewhere in the dark so people don't find it. In addition to stealth the gameplay naturally revolves around stealing things. In most missions you have one main object to  steal and many other valuables that you can sell for cash after the mission to get more equipment or hot tips that may help with that next mission.The level design focuses on big, sprawling and open levels. Most of the time there are several paths to approach your target. It is always beneficial to search every corner because you might find valuables, documents or even secret doors. The levels look and feel like actualy places, not just like a path for the player to walk. The game's sound design is top notch and still cannot be matched by many modern games. The graphics are obviously a little dated but there is a community patch that not only makes everything look a little crispier but also fixes all compatibility issues with widescreen monitors and multicore processors.Thief features a quite unusual approach on difficulty settings. A higher difficulty does not make the enemies stronger and also does not place more enemies in the level. Instead it just adds more mission objectives. On the lowest difficulty it is often enough to just get your main target. On the highest setting it is not enough to just put the treasure in your pockets. You also need to get out afterwards. In addition to that there are more objectives like finding more special items or stealing a certain amount in gold value. There are many parts of the game that you can only experience on the highest difficulty setting, therefore I recommend playing it on that.Thief: The Dark Project is still one of the best and most atmospheric stealth games out there and I think everybody who is in the least interested in stealth games, games that are heavy on atmosphere or games with good level design should give it a try.More reviews here

For making Thief run on modern systems, use the TFix Patch. "

												A good story, large open levels, multiple tools, amazing atmosphere and possibly the coolest protagonist in any game ever make Thief Gold one of the best stealth games (and games in general) of all time. It is pretty freakin' bipolar when it comes to mission types though... It has a lot of stealth missions but it also has a lot of ""tomb raiding"" missions that don't favor sneaking. It's not a deal breaker and the game is still really good, but these missions are by far my least favourite and can get really boring really fast. It's a good thing the sequel ""Thief II: The Metal Age"" ditched these completely, making it the best in the series, but one should always experience the game that made the sequel possible. A diamond in the rough,  "

												This is a great game, i played it when i was a kid, only like 9 years old, it set the margin for stealth games at the time, and it holds up pretty well today. However, if you are going to play it on a modern windows os, you need the unoffical patch, the theif fix, or you will have crashing issues, no cutscenes, among other bugs, its easy to install just run its installer after installing the game.

												THIEF GOLD✓ Fitting soundtrack & immersive audio✓ Gameplay builds a lot on the audio and making as little noise as possible which is perfect in a stealth game.✓ The graphics hasn't aged very well but it has a certain charm to it.✓ This game doesn't hold your hand and expects you to figure out everything yourself, which makes it very rewarding.✓ Huge maps that allows different approaches and playstyles to the game.✓ Provides you with a varied set of tools to navigate trough missions.✓ Still runs great on modern system but I would recommend downloading TFix for HD support and cutscenes to work.✖ There are a few missions that doesn't hold up to the quality compared to the rest of the game, especially the GOLD ones.

												So, my previous issues with the game have been rectified thanks to just one easy to use mod. Thanks Tafferwocky! Your reccomendation fixed every problem I had with the game prior. Anyone who is having problems like I was just follow this link http://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=134733 and follow the steps provided.Now that I've had an honest chance to play Thief I can say that, while it has faults it is still an enjoyable experience. The gameplay is what one could expect from a first person stealth romp, or from games like Splinter Cell for example. You get missions that change in terms of objectives based on your difficulty, kind of like Goldeneye on the N64. In these missions you'll do things that one would expect a thief to do, steal things, lots and lots of things. Though sometimes you'll be busting friends out of jail or other things of the like, but they all come back to the stealth elements of the game. You as Garrett are not much of a fighter, and on the higher difficulties are even tasked with not killing at all, so as such you rely on the shadows above all else. The use of shadows and sound is like I said earlier similar to Splinter Cell. The darker your surroundings the harder to see you, and the different surfaces all make louder noise. The first of my newer problems arise here though, and it has to do with your enemies. For the most part you deal with local town guards who don't seem like they'll be too much issue, don't be fooled. Every enemy you encounter is deadly, and when they find you they will chase you everywhere. Do yourself a favor, SAVE OFTEN. Keep a close finger on F11 or you'll be stuck in a lot of tricky situations that have the high probability of ruining your missions entirely.Another issue comes in the form of the game's combat, or the lack there of. Your swordsmanship is controlled based on where you are looking at your enemy, right side for a slash to the right vicea versa. You can power attack with a held click and block with mouse 3. Overall the swordplay isn't terrible, but stacked against other combat engines, even some from the era, it's very lackluster. Your bow is indeed a weapon but it's far more useful as a tool, using water arrows and the like to affect your surroundings. Your bow has a sight, but only with trial and error can you reliably hit a target without prior knowledge about where the arrows will go based on the sight. Make sure to do training and take as much time as you need to figure out your bow's ranges. The opening cinematic shows Garrett nailing a guard in the neck with a well placed arrow, don't do this unless you have to. I say this because every time I've tried to kill someone with the bow I've only ever ♥♥♥♥♥♥ them off. Even with an assured head shot all they do is stagger and then shove their sword through my chest.The environments are all really great in game, ranging from castles and prisons to zombie infested mines and abandoned sewers. Wrapped around all these environments is some of the best sound design I've ever heard in almost any game, some of the voice acting witholding mind you. The music is non-existent for the most part, leaving you instead to the ambiance of the area you are in. Guards talk about their days, machinery whirrs & grinds, and ghostly sounds wail in the darkness. Thief's environments steal the show for me, above all else.One could easily look at the game and pan it for its graphics, and admittadely they're not much to look at. Add to it the animations are a bit stilted and robotic, but admittadely they are pretty smooth all the same. Characters are blocky and have some messy textures at times, but that could be looked past because nearly everything else is awesome. The graphics as a whole are what you can expect for the era this game comes from.It may seem like I've got nothing but problems with Thief, but like I said I can't help but laud over the environments and atmosphere that is established. It is amazing, really some of the best I've ever seen. The combat may suck, but a swift blackjack to someone's head when they don't see it coming puts them out of commission pretty much indefinitely. If you're playing the game right you'll never have to really fight anything or anyone, so really the combat takes the back seat to a game that is all about the stealth and environmental design of the world. At least that's what I've got to say personally about it. So grab it on sale or the like, slap the mod on, don't get stabbed, shot, bitten, or eaten, and have a good 'ol time with one of the progenitors of the stealth genre.			"

												Ever wanted to play a 90's version of Dishonored? You have?Then what are you waiting for?!Get Thief!Thief is a brilliant stealth game with simple, yet effective mechanics such as;- Stepping on different surfaces makes louder/different noises- The ability to pick up unconcious/dead bodies to hide them- The ability to walk at two different speeds- The ability to pick up most objects to then be thrown as a distraction- A series of different arrows to fire to have differnt effects on the enviroment (E.g water arrows can put out torches)- Light levels affect whether you can be seen or not- The ability to lean side to side as well as forward to get a better view of your surroundings- Different difficulty settings giving you different objectives- Good sound quality so you know where people are in relation to you and what surface they are onThere are probably many more features I can inclued but I am not going to as the list will be too long! So, if you like stealth games with good mechanics and a challenge, pick Thief up today! P.S. This is a minor issue but I will warn you about it. The A.I. does not seem to respond well to you throwing objects! I threw a box behind a guard and he did nothing so I threw it a bit closer, still nothing. I then threw the box directly as his head and he still didn't react! Although this is annoying, it has only happened to me once so far so don't let it put you off.			"

The game has a great story and big engaging maps, with multiple routes and lore.Compared to the new Thief that only focus on shadows this game goes one step further and makes the footsteps an important feature.You'll also notice that the designers had more creative freedom, giving the game really interesting levels and enemies.If you don't mind the outdated graphics this game is definitely a must play.

Product received for free
												Ever since I could remember, I love stealth games, since I played Splinter cell I love stealth games, just hiding in the shadow and kill your enemies is fun…but being a thief and steal anything you can, is even more fun.IMPRESSION AND STYLEI was pretty impress how this 1998 game still holds up today, the mechanics of this game really stands up to a unique design of gameplay back in the day, you thought  Splinter Cell was the first to use that gameplay style? Sorry, thief snatches up first and became the first to implement the shadow mechanic which again back in the day it was a unique feature in the game. You need to use the darkness as much as possible to hide from guards, while also use your thief’s tools to get through the mission.  Being a thief has its own sweet reward when you go to some snobby rich man’s mansion and just steal anything you can and just feel like robin hood, but this robin hood is all for himself only.STORY AND CHARACTERThe story I got is pretty interesting especially the extra contents I got from the Gold editions, the silhouette cut scenes were interesting except a bit of the cryptic verses it shows which to me feels sorta pointless. The main character Garret the greedy selfish thief going through missions to do the one thing he wants, money. Indeed, throughout the story all he wants is just to be rich and that’s all, even the shadiest job from just anybody he will take it with no 2nd thoughts as long as he gets his reward which I don’t know if I should find him a risk taker or a fool. Although one part of the story finds me interesting when I was reading the wiki was the trickster was like this nature god who wanted the old ways and mankind once live in forests, until the Builder which he is like an allegory of mankind’s progress, on behalf of humanity advances them to use stone and metal to lived outside of nature, so what does this mean? Are we seeing the trickster as the true threat or are we fooling ourselves into believing there isn’t a true enemy? Because if you really think about it, this whole game acts like a big allegory of nature vs. machines, tradition vs. progress and maybe even some religion philosophy, which means  the two would need each other to be balance in order for the world to function, like God and the Devil? Evil and Good, who knows? This made me love the lore even more and I wish to explore it even more on the sequel for the consequence of having “too” much influence of the Builder, “the rise of the metal age.”GAMEPLAYThe gameplay is fun, smooth, but the button choice is a bit odd, I guess I got used to using WSAD but you’ll get used to the WZC if you put your middle finger at the W, ring Z, and index C. Since you are a thief you aren’t as strong as any soldier so you’ll get a variety of weapons, most weapons does the trick though few I find it very un-helpful. For example the broad arrows is practically use as paper airplanes when killing the enemies, especially if you try to headshot them or surprise them, you won’t get a one hit kill, the fire arrow does more damage but it makes noise which obvious you don’t want that. The noise maker is useless because the broad arrow can just make noises by hitting at the wall. Another item I didn’t find it helpful is the speed potion which increases your speed but jumping up and down is almost the same effect speed. The AI sometimes can be dumb and easily fooled by just luring them and hitting them behind the head, or just rush them quickly when they are behind and just whack them, I did it one mission when all four guards were behind and I manage to whack them all on the head easily. This is why to get the most challenging and fun experience play either hard or expert, but I recommend expert for people who have good stealth experience. Expert will give you the most missions and tell you not to kill anyone which you will think more when dealing enemies if you don’t to use your sword to thwack them. Hard is a good balance for beginner thief series, but never go normal, that is for people who suck at stealth, I grew bored at normal and forgot to turn on expert on different levels, I thought I wasn’t ready for hard but I sure did when I played my 2nd play through on expert, the experience was much different and for the better. Though watch out, because the map at times is troublesome to follow and I know is to reflect Garret’s view of the level, but it can be frustrating when getting lost in a level, maybe provide a cryptic hint might help on the menu screen? CONCLUSSION This game keeps you on your toes, it does hold up to be an old classic, the voice actors were great, level designs were interesting especially some missions, and the sound designs at times are great when listening to your surrounding of the way you step. I give this an 8/10 “a gem taker” one of a good first start of the franchise to check it out and see if you can be the next great thief.			"

												A game made by the venerable Looking Glass Studios, them who made another of my favorites of all time, System Shock 2.  I consider Thief to be the genesis of the First-Person Stealth genre, introducing numerous concepts that we see often in stealth games today, such as hiding in darkness, different surfaces making more or less noise as you walk across them, leaning to peer around corners, making distractions, eliminating light sources, climbing and swimming to reach different paths, and hiding bodies to avoid suspicion.In the first game of his storied career in voice acting, Stephen Russell shines as Garrett, a cool, calm, cynical rogue, with just a touch of silly wit.  (""So this is the Lost City . . . . It's not lost no more!"")  The environments of the vaguely-named City drip with atmosphere, and would only be improved as time wore on to Thief 2 and Thief 3 (and we don't talk about Thief's ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"", thank you).  A vague steampunk aesthetic weaves through the whole affair, with an undercurrent of the supernatural to give it spice.  Each map is well-crafted, with numerous ways to go and plenty of secrets to find, and some excellent environmental transitions in places.Levels are usually set up to simply steal everything valuable without being killed, then escape, though there are some different types of levels for flavor.  The ""horror levels"", though grumbled-about by a lot of folks, are wonderful in my opinion.  They seethe with quiet dread and loneliness, surrounded by strange creatures and undead nightmares in long forgotten and rotted places.  This is not a game about running and dashing and furious combat (see: that other game we won't talk about), it's about skill and collected coolness under pressure, being watchful and aware of your surroundings, and a pulse-pounding tension of just barely avoiding being caught, or scurrying from fights to lose attackers.All-in-all, Thief and its two sequels are some of my favorite games of all time, and though the graphics most certainly have not aged altogether well, it stands as a pinnacle of design, and a treasure of videogaming history.  If you can put up with the chunky models and the slower style of play, you won't find much better than this series, and though the 2nd did a lot better, this one has elements that will always have a place in my heart.

The environments of the vaguely-named City drip with atmosphere, and would only be improved as time wore on to Thief 2 and Thief 3 (and we don't talk about Thief's ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"", thank you).  A vague steampunk aesthetic weaves through the whole affair, with an undercurrent of the supernatural to give it spice.  Each map is well-crafted, with numerous ways to go and plenty of secrets to find, and some excellent environmental transitions in places.Levels are usually set up to simply steal everything valuable without being killed, then escape, though there are some different types of levels for flavor.  The ""horror levels"", though grumbled-about by a lot of folks, are wonderful in my opinion.  They seethe with quiet dread and loneliness, surrounded by strange creatures and undead nightmares in long forgotten and rotted places.  This is not a game about running and dashing and furious combat (see: that other game we won't talk about), it's about skill and collected coolness under pressure, being watchful and aware of your surroundings, and a pulse-pounding tension of just barely avoiding being caught, or scurrying from fights to lose attackers.All-in-all, Thief and its two sequels are some of my favorite games of all time, and though the graphics most certainly have not aged altogether well, it stands as a pinnacle of design, and a treasure of videogaming history.  If you can put up with the chunky models and the slower style of play, you won't find much better than this series, and though the 2nd did a lot better, this one has elements that will always have a place in my heart.

												Over the years i have played many stealth games, all of them were third person and i always considered that having a third person perspective on stealth games was cheating but that is how almost every single stealth game is so i had to deal with it, i then found Thief, a first person stealth game so i naturally got really excited since it was first person instead of third person and after playing it all i can say is that i cant go back to play third person stealth games, i really cant, Thief is what i always wanted in a stealth game and it is the best stealth game i have ever played and probably will, it is also one of the best games i have played and it definitely goes into my Top 5 of all times.All third person stealth games do it wrong, Thief is truthfully the only way to stealth.

												If you are a fan of the series, you should pick up this game when it goes on sale. For me the game was fun to play but mostly for the lore and the story. I started out playing Thief: Deadly Shadows, so playing this is a good way to pick up on what happened before the more graphically intense games. While I would consider this game to be clunky, and dated, the gameplay is still surprisingly challenging, and rewarding. I mostly found myself running through the levels however, just to finish the game, and not taking the full time to sneak around and enjoy the atmosphere. Either way, if you enjoyed any of the other games, I would recommend picking this one up as well.			"

												I bought this game purely for the nostalgia of playing it when I was a young whippersnapper. As well as that, I thought I would actually buy it so that I would be able to understand it and maybe complete some of the levels instead of watching it over my brother's shoulder suggesting things when I was like 5 or something. Anyway, it's a fantastic game to burn a couple hours on, the maps are huge with loads of little hidey-holes and rooms to explore and loot, the textures of the guards are hilarious when looking at it now, but back when it was the ♥♥♥♥ and the epitome of PC gaming it was awesome. There's some pretty eerie sound effects and music to accompany you in the shadows which gives the game a little more depth than just sneaking around grabbing all the stashes of coins. It's a great world to escape into and become the stealthy theif mastermind, Garrett sneaking around people's mansions and stealing valuable stuff. Basically everything you want to do but without the ASBOs or restraining orders.Buy this game because it's actually really amazing. I love it.11/10			"

												Thief 2 is what many consider to be the height of the series, and I tend to agree, however it's very interesting to go back to where it all started.  Aside from a few annoyances (there are far too many zombie/spider filled levels, which negates the use of stealth entirely), this is still an incredibly rewarding and polished experience.  Expect to be challenged, of course.  Death can come very quickly if you don't have any patience, and this is late 90s level design at it's most prevalent so expect to get lost a few times in the surprisingly large maps when you start.  There is no hand-holding here.  On a final note, I find the atmosphere in these early Thief games nothing short of stunning, and certain sections are pretty damn chilling to play through, thanks in part to the sound design.  So for taff's sake, get on the case and play a part of videogame history already.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine  I FINALLY HAD THE BALLS TO FINISH THIS GAME! One of the greatest and classical masterpieces of all time! Thief: The Dark Project or Thief: Gold, developed from the now defunct company Looking Glass Studios puts you in the Steampunk Victorian times, with creepy music, great atmosphere (believe me this game scares me to bits!), great story line and great voice acting! The only problems I encountered with the game is that its too confusing to get to somewhere, and also the first time I got it, it was poorly optimized, so I highly recommend if you are using an up-to-date PC, to download an unofficial patch which fixes some of the problems like cut scenes not working, bad resolutions and poor quality. But set aside all these problems, and you have a perfect stealth masterpiece.Stick to the shadows at all costs! RECOMMENDED :)  THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY! (What's this? :- Like some games get ""Best Game of 2014"" or ""Best Indie Game"", etc... So I have decided to make my own!)  "

												Thief Gold is definitely one of my favorite games associated with the stealth drama, a theme that's a favorite of mine. Though the controls are a bit strange, and the graphics outdated, the game holds up extraordinarily well compared even to a lot of modern games. This is also overly sophisticated and I don't know half of what I said. So buy dat ♥♥♥♥, and be all stealthy or whatever. I dunno. You can if you want, but I won't force you... Except I will.

And it is definitely worth it.The ambience is very good, along with a near perfect voice acting. Although the graphics are obviously outdated, if you are willing to ignore that than you will most certainly enjoy this game, especially if you are a fan of stealth games.			"

												Thief - The Dark Project was the first game I ever purchased for PC. I am happy to see that it is now able to be incorporated into the Steam Library of games. To this day my daughter, who spent many hours on ""dad's"" lap watching TDP with her sippy cup, is still a fan of the Thief series. Obviously this game has a lot of memories, and also a lot of meaning; so I won't even try to be objective...Thief Gold is not an enormously fast moving game, so if you are the type of player that wants to ""knock 'em all dead"" and hurry up and finish, I'd think you would dislike Thief Gold. It takes time. Waiting out guards, finding loot, and at times failing and dying. If you're not familiar with Thief Gold, you may want to save often.The graphics are not bad for '98, and keep in mind that you don't fix up a '67 Thunderbird to look like the modern Mazda version of Thunderbird today. Thief Gold is a piece of gaming history. A landmark for patience and problem solving in the gaming world. So... put the super graphic modern games on the shelf of your mind, and step back in time to an era when you were able to overcome the developers design in your own way!			"

												When the first Thief game came out, my brother convinced me to get it.  Glad I did and extremely happy that years later I was able to get it on Steam, and it being Thief Gold at that. I had followed all the games that came out after I had got the first one, but moving from overseas back to the states, they got lost :( so being able to have them available whenever through steam is nice. Only one I did not get was the newest Thief that came out not to long ago. Being an original fan of this series, the new one did not appeal to me personally.It's a stealth/some what horror game, where you do your best to remain in the shadows and not be seen. At times you may get caught and have to fight, but the main goal is to get what you are looking for, get in wihtout being seeen, and then get out the without being noticed. Also collecting treasures and goodies along the way. The music fits the mood nicely, and depending on which one in the series you are playing or the level, you may come across some pretty weird, eerie stuff along with interesting steampunk style looking contraptions.One of My favorite things in this game was the passages that are apart of the animated clips before and after the missions. Especially from the Woodsie Lord or the hammerites. Shows the weird but interesting creativity behind the makers of the game.I feel if you ever played this way back in the day, its worth having for nostalgia, or just because you liked it so much.For those who have never played it, or played the new one to find out about the old ones, you might not like it so much. The graphics are rough and at times there might be glitching. Sometimes its funny glitches. On some missions I even ran through the end or goofed off with guards chasing me because the way the run or things they say looks hilarious.I'd suggest if you feel you might be interesting in this game, check on some play throughs of it that are available online first, to make sure it might be something you'll like.

Stealth aspect is challenging but noob friendly, level design is realistic which makes it sometimes confusing (i'am looking at you Thieves Guild).

												One of my favorite games of all time, Thief is an enduring classic.  Stealth is your path to glory as trying to do the ""run and gun"" approach will only get you dead, quickly.  Sneaking around, stealing treasure, right from under the guards noses, is fantastic fun.  Throw in zombies, spirits, strange creatures, immersive sound fields, and dark, forboding maps, and you have hours of entertainment.  I love this game and keep coming back to it over and over again.  To think that the original copy I bought came for free with a video card I bought years ago and I almost didn't bother to install it.  Am I ever glad I did.			"

												Thief is a First Person Game unlike most of the games of this genre. It challenges you to carefully navigate the environment in which you inhabit. Each level had three stages of difficulty, the lowest allows for most of the tricks a FPS player should have, while the highest demands precision in awareness and timing to achieve your goals instead of brute force and direct action. The levels themselves provide interesting opportunities to test your ability to bypass the opposition.The graphics for this game have aged and compared to the current shine of the triple A titles it is lacklustre, but this does not detract from the playability of the game. The audio still atmospheric enhances the game making some of the levels with the undead almost spooky.The story of Garret the character you play as provides some interesting twists and turns, while giving context to the levels you play. If you are looking for a game that will offer a different gaming experience then Thief will deliver something unlike most of the offerings out there.			"

												What a game! Never have I experienced a game that looks so ugly but remains totally immersive. Such good sound design! If you're a fan of horror games, you're in for a treat here. Though not horror in its entirety, the game is definitely spooky and atmospheric. I both look forward to and dread the mission in the catacombs. But it's not all spooks. There are moments of glee as you work around unwitting guards, knocking them out and stealing their keys, while snagging anything that isn't nailed down. The use of lighting and sound is still the best in any game I've ever played (sorry, Splinter Cell) and the gameplay is absolutely fantastic! Controls are a bit wobbly and need rebinding and the visuals are very poor, but at its core this game is still very fun to play, and is guaranteed to get your adrenaline pumping, either from elation or downright terror. I give it an 8.5/10.			"

Atleast after first mission I have been taken to the seccond without explanaition why I need to go to prison in the first place.But still excellent old game!For full experience try torrents or something.

												This is the best steath game ever made, and it's pretty much the first 3D steath based game and they got it right the first try.  The story is very good with several plot twists.  It's told through the use of very well made cut scenes and finding more information during mussions.  The NPC interaction is very interesting to liten to.  The graphics did not age very well, but there are HD texture packs that really help make it look good.  The shadows in the dark engine still looks good since you rely on them for gameplay.  Another classic that used the same Dark Engine is System Shock 2 and Thrief 2.  The Gameplay is still solid after all these years, just remap the controlls to the the Unreal preloaded setup for ASWD.			"

And trick arrows combined with the sword and handy blackjack, Will entertain for hours and, of course, make for a memorable hameplay experience.(Sorry if my spelling or grammer is a little off)Extra props to the devs that thought up the world around.For any one that does not like stealth i must say in the imfamouse line at the start.

												First stealth FPS I played, very emersive, I played graveyard back in 1998/1999 got stuck on the level for a literal day and a half, left the game running listened to the atomospherics and sound, which I think is still yet to be rivaled by any other series, love the varied gameplay with zombie/demon/guard/ghost/dinosaurs/giant incects/ancient mystical drones,  NPC's , they dumbed this down in the sequal making it tamer, I think the 1st game was bold and the story is also one of the best in a game I've ever played.PROBest sound in a game to this dayOriginal in design and years ahead of its time on releaseSolid story telling elementsGood game mechanics (play hard if you think its too easy)CONSome levels can be confusing, this might be a charm to some players but on my first playthrough I got stuck on some levels for a really long timeNeeds better inegration with modern tech, its ok, but some aesthetics could be better			"

												When the first Thief game came out, my brother convinced me to get it.  Glad I did and extremely happy that years later I was able to get it on Steam, and it being Thief Gold at that. I had followed all the games that came out after I had got the first one, but moving from overseas back to the states, they got lost :( so being able to have them available whenever through steam is nice. Only one I did not get was the newest Thief that came out not to long ago. Being an original fan of this series, the new one did not appeal to me personally.It's a stealth/some what horror game, where you do your best to remain in the shadows and not be seen. At times you may get caught and have to fight, but the main goal is to get what you are looking for, get in wihtout being seeen, and then get out the without being noticed. Also collecting treasures and goodies along the way. The music fits the mood nicely, and depending on which one in the series you are playing or the level, you may come across some pretty weird, eerie stuff along with interesting steampunk style looking contraptions.One of My favorite things in this game was the passages that are apart of the animated clips before and after the missions. Especially from the Woodsie Lord or the hammerites. Shows the weird but interesting creativity behind the makers of the game.I feel if you ever played this way back in the day, its worth having for nostalgia, or just because you liked it so much.For those who have never played it, or played the new one to find out about the old ones, you might not like it so much. The graphics are rough and at times there might be glitching. Sometimes its funny glitches. On some missions I even ran through the end or goofed off with guards chasing me because the way the run or things they say looks hilarious.I'd suggest if you feel you might be interesting in this game, check on some play throughs of it that are available online first, to make sure it might be something you'll like.

												If you like me prefers action run-and-gun games like Quake or Serious Sam you still going to enjoy this game! I was skeptical about this title since it's a stealth game and i never was into that. Picked it up on a sale and was completely blown away by how advanced and enjoyable this game is. Stealth aspect is challenging but noob friendly, level design is realistic which makes it sometimes confusing (i'am looking at you Thieves Guild). Do you like stealth games? - Buy it!You don't like stealth game? - Buy it!I'am definitly going to get the second game.			"

												Thief - The Dark Project was the first game I ever purchased for PC. I am happy to see that it is now able to be incorporated into the Steam Library of games. To this day my daughter, who spent many hours on ""dad's"" lap watching TDP with her sippy cup, is still a fan of the Thief series. Obviously this game has a lot of memories, and also a lot of meaning; so I won't even try to be objective...Thief Gold is not an enormously fast moving game, so if you are the type of player that wants to ""knock 'em all dead"" and hurry up and finish, I'd think you would dislike Thief Gold. It takes time. Waiting out guards, finding loot, and at times failing and dying. If you're not familiar with Thief Gold, you may want to save often.The graphics are not bad for '98, and keep in mind that you don't fix up a '67 Thunderbird to look like the modern Mazda version of Thunderbird today. Thief Gold is a piece of gaming history. A landmark for patience and problem solving in the gaming world. So... put the super graphic modern games on the shelf of your mind, and step back in time to an era when you were able to overcome the developers design in your own way!			"

												Thief is one of the many master pieces that makes the video game industry still worth defending over the stupid assasin's creed and Call of duty Bullsh*t lately. It is the only game that has really balanced stealth with good combat if you get yourself in a jam. The game is really old though, so the graphics might take some getting use to, it reminds me of when video games were introduced depth and perception and not a 2D side scroller. The controls are messed up like no other in here though, and-from what I can see- there is no way to change it. It's not that they are stiff or stuff like that, it's just they placed the commands in the most awkward postions on the keyboard. I've never really understood the story because, as old as this game is, it just throws you into a level and expects you to know what's going on so when something happens I kind of misunderstand and it takes me a minute to realize what just happened. To understand the story you mostly have to read what you are going to do on the current mission, and why. But what makes up for it is the gameplay and the stealth in this game. Few games today can actually have good stealth and still manage the game with decent combat if you gor yourself in a pickle, Thief puts that right on the mark if you have to run and hide, you can do it. If you need to fight your way out, you can do it. Overall score: 80/100			"

												Thief Gold was my first Stealth game. I didn't know the simple joy of extinguishing a torch and clubbing some guard unconscious before scrapering with an entire mansions worth of loot in my pocket.Thief Gold despite it's age and need for a patch (which is easy to download from the looking glass studios Forums) is a stella experience. It is a well paced game with hints and clues to the story scattered through out this richly created world. The first missions get you to grips with the mechanics of the game with all the gadgets and weapons at your disposal. Garrett is a great playable character, always there to crack wise at certain people or situations to lighten the mood in those slightly stressful missions. In fact there are so many great characters, from the Blackjack fodder to the prisioners. What I will say is that there are some missions that feel more of a chore than others, especially those concerning the walking dead. These unkillable things were the bane of my play through. It did during those missions become more of a hack and slash type game, despite Garretts terrible combat ability.Overall though I would highly recomend Thief Gold as a gateway stealth game. It is quite simply a masterpiece.			"

												One of my most memorable gaming experiences from back in the day....and I only ever played the demo!! That's a fact, but even after all these years that brief experience with this game stuck with me. Just from what little I experienced back then I quickly realized that Thief was far more engrossing and complex then most games at the time of its release and now that I've purchased it and finally played through most of the game up to the time of writing this review, my mind has truly and completely been blown by its level of depth. The stealth tactics you can make use of, such as water arrows for putting out torches and fires, moss arrows to muffle the noise you make as you slowly walk/crouch towards unsuspecting enemies, rope arrows to more quickly complete objectives or work your way around a tight situation, hiding bodies, etc. all make this an unforgettable experience.  The level designs are pretty complex and extremely atmospheric and there are also some fairly challenging environmental puzzles to solve at times too. Even the voice acting and ambience totally sets the mood for your quest for loot and other more notable goodies as you complete objectives.  Oh yeah, and then there's the strong horror element (some of the ambience plays a role here too, as it perfectly sets the mood for those creepier moments) relating to some of the objects you acquire in the game and enemies such as zombies, spiders (including giant ones), skeletons (well, at least 'a' skeleton that tried to kill me at one point) and also demonic and ghostly-enemies.Thief is one of the better gaming experiences from an earlier generation. Even after all these years, it still stands out in the crowd and remains one of the best stealth experiences you'll ever have in a game, bar none!UPDATE (8/8/15): Just beat the game, and if I've learned anything from the many trials and tribulations I faced furing my quest (besides how to properly steal things while being all stealthy and whatnot) it's that Constantine is a major ♥♥♥♥♥♥!

												There is no better stealth game out there.In Thief, you play as Garret, a legendary thief and a character so famous that even those who never played the series probably heard of him. Garret is the perfect and original thief archetype: Ganancious, egocentric, quick-witted and very, very skilled. Trained by the Keepers, Garret was meant to be an agent for the organization and help to keep order in the city through subterfuge, but he eventually decides that his skills are best employed to steal from others and make a good living out of it. Even though all that Garret ever wanted was to alleviate the rich from their burdens of gold and gems, he finds himself forced to be much more than that when a chain of events place himself at the eye of the storm. The struggle between Order, represented by the Builder, and Chaos, represented by the Trickster, is about to reach its pinnacle and Garret will be right in the middle of it all.The gameplay is pretty much flawless. Changing the keymapping to your liking is probably a must, since some controls are not as intuitive for not following modern patterns. Once you're accustomed to it, you'll soon find yourself immersed in the single most stealth-driven game that ever was and, hell, probably ever will be. Don't you ♥♥♥♥ing dare using your sword on this game unless there's a immediate threath to your life. Thiefs like Garret never kill and are never seen. If you play the game on expert (which is exactly how the game should always be played), you'll be required to see and do everything without ever killing a human being. That is stealth right there. Walk in the hard wood instead of the carpet and your steps will alert guards. Remain in the shadows with your sword out and the blade will shine and give you away. Shoot an arrow off its target and everyone will hear it hitting the wall. This is how stealth should be done, no quick running around no-scoping teleports and instant magic kills (I'm looking at you, Dishonored). All you have in your inventory are some lockpicks, a blackjack and a few different arrow types, like rope arrows for reaching hard-to-get places or water arrows for squishing out torches. That being said, you should probably know that there will be combat, since there are supernatural creatures walking the world and some of them are very, very violent. This is the reason you carry a sword around.Graphics are a little outdated, especially on the resolution support department, but mods can easily fix that. All in all, with a little setup time and a little getting used to, you'll be playing the game like a pro and enjoying every second of it one or two hours after buying it, trust me.Gameplay - 10/10Soundtrack - 7/10Graphics - 4/10Content - 8/10Challenge Level - 9/10Replayability - 6/10			"

Install Thief Gold (Steam) and maybe set the compatibility mode from THIEF.exe to Win XP SP2 and maybe it can help to deactivate the steam overlay2. Install TFix (v1.22)You will find a download link in the description from the HD Mod below3. Install Thief Gold HD Mod (v1.0)You will find it on moddb.com4. Important: If you experience huge framerate drops, rename dark.gam in the HDMOD folder (for example to: dark-BAK.gam). This will deactivate the new fireplace effect and the framerate drops are solved. I searched very long for this solution. :)With these settings, Thief Gold runs very good on my rig.Intel quad-core and GeForce GTX on Win 7			"

Rather challenging with a smart stealth tactic, and really requires the player to be calm, patient (and also load anytime they screw up... which in my case is frequent) and to really listen to where your enemies are (good headphones are a must).The only thing that personally irritates me a bit is the tedioussness of getting lost, especially in very sprawling areas. However, IMO that makes you feel more like a Thief and in a strange way, makes them game feel more like you're in the shoes of Garret. You're not going in there with knowledge of every nook and cranny, you have to explore, get lost, get lost some more, cry, get lost, reload, start over, get lost again, curse at the screen, and then finally find what you're looking for. It's irritating, but realistic.I reccomend this to any fan of late 90's games and especially to anyone who likes the stealth genre.			"

												Thief Gold, an expanded version of Thief The Dark Project, is one of the stealth genre's most successful titles.  Although the game is dated, the gameplay is immersive and the level design is immaculate.  Each mission is designed in a way to allow you the use of all of the tools available to you.  Loot is hidden around each mission, interesting sights and text that provides flavor may also be found simply through the exploration of a level.*****One problem with this version*****The game advertised is not the game you are buying.  You end buying the original Thief The Dark project and -not- Thief Gold.  Thief Gold had added missions and they are missing from this download.  Something else that is missing are the cut scenes between missions.  Not only are the scenes entertaining, but they help to make you care about the game world and characters while furthering the narrative of the story.  Without these cut scenes, someone knew to the game won't understand everything right away and we are all missing an important part of the experience.			"

												Thief Gold gives you just bare minimum necessities needed to play. No accurate map trackers, no mini-map, no fancy doohickeys; just you and your own abilities. Oh, well they give you a light meter which is nifty, but even that's just common sense. Yay for hardcore traditional stealth for hardcore traditional stealth gamers!			"

In recent years, stealth games are fairly simple as far as mechanics go, and quite linear. Here, there's quite a bit of skill needed in order to successfully sneak around, knock enemies out, traverse, and steal which should be expected, given its first person nature. This isn't even mentioning its huge levels with various secrets.It should be noted that of the 3 stealth games released in 1998, this was the first to use shadows (through a gradient) and sound as game mechanics, something that Splinter Cell would use 4 years later.Besides the occasional pathfinding bug and the lack of cutscenes (for which there is a fix), you'll find that the game is finely programmed and definitely worth the price.

												I bought this game purely for the nostalgia of playing it when I was a young whippersnapper. As well as that, I thought I would actually buy it so that I would be able to understand it and maybe complete some of the levels instead of watching it over my brother's shoulder suggesting things when I was like 5 or something. Anyway, it's a fantastic game to burn a couple hours on, the maps are huge with loads of little hidey-holes and rooms to explore and loot, the textures of the guards are hilarious when looking at it now, but back when it was the ♥♥♥♥ and the epitome of PC gaming it was awesome. There's some pretty eerie sound effects and music to accompany you in the shadows which gives the game a little more depth than just sneaking around grabbing all the stashes of coins. It's a great world to escape into and become the stealthy theif mastermind, Garrett sneaking around people's mansions and stealing valuable stuff. Basically everything you want to do but without the ASBOs or restraining orders.Buy this game because it's actually really amazing. I love it.11/10			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine  I FINALLY HAD THE BALLS TO FINISH THIS GAME! One of the greatest and classical masterpieces of all time! Thief: The Dark Project or Thief: Gold, developed from the now defunct company Looking Glass Studios puts you in the Steampunk Victorian times, with creepy music, great atmosphere (believe me this game scares me to bits!), great story line and great voice acting! The only problems I encountered with the game is that its too confusing to get to somewhere, and also the first time I got it, it was poorly optimized, so I highly recommend if you are using an up-to-date PC, to download an unofficial patch which fixes some of the problems like cut scenes not working, bad resolutions and poor quality. But set aside all these problems, and you have a perfect stealth masterpiece.Stick to the shadows at all costs! RECOMMENDED :)  THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY! (What's this? :- Like some games get ""Best Game of 2014"" or ""Best Indie Game"", etc... So I have decided to make my own!)  "

It demonstrates all the incredible elements on how stealthy you need to be when you're playing the role of Garrett. Sure you have a sword and bow and arrow in the game to fight and defend yourself. This game though is about Stealth, so the combat in this game won't be the best. If you want to play a combat game, then this game isn't for you.

												One of the progenitors of the stealth genre and the first game that really immersed you in the role of the character as you tried to stay as queit as possible and as hidden as possible. Darkness and carpeted floors are your friend, light and tiles are the enemy. Has some dungeon crawley elements in about half of the missions but I think that makes it all the more special when compared to Thief 2, which is usually regarded as the better game and an improvement on the formula, but I think both games are equals in different ways.This game is 1000x better than Thi4f and you should spend money on this.

												I know what you're thinking. The game looks old as ♥♥♥♥♥ and is apparently the progenitor of the first person stealth genre. How can this be worth $10? It's worth $5, tops. Right?I disagree. There is a very good reason why Thief is still lauded as one of the best stealth games ever made. That's because it IS one of the best stealth games ever made. Though the systems present are basically systems we take granted for today, they are rock solid and play very admirably. This is coming from someone who has cut his teeth on stealth games, but hasn't played Thief until recently (2012). And the level design is just so good, and can be extremely creative...keep an eye out for some of the later missions...they will blow your mind.			"

Thief 1 + 2 have one of the finest atmospheres ever made in a stealth game.To be completely frank if you are even remotely into the stealth genre you do not want to skip this game. It has some of the most wonderful level design ever introduced into the genre. Gameplay is tight and tense, and there are always plenty of ways to go about solving your mission, this is not a linear game and multiple points-of-entry and solutions are always available.Give it a try! Length is ~12 hours for a first playthrough and everything is top notch. There's a reason this game is still lauded over a decade later. "

												CHALLENGE.This game is really hard. I like it, because there was no dumbing down for consoles when games like this were around, which means it's nice and hard. (well,  depending hehe). You can get lost, but if you use your brain and study the map, you can 'figure it out'. Make sure to check for secret levers and false panels, hidden passageways, for they more often than not lead to loot or an easy gain.GAMEPLAY.The more loot that you manage to find in each mission, the more equipment you can buy for the next job; Therein lies the reward for your efforts. Being conceited as I am, I personally like completing the game having killed not a single soul, which is possible to do. However, Garret has a Bow and an array of Arrows at his disposal, if you just can't resist the urge to snipe that unwitting guard!Timing is everything. You can rush in like a steam train, but that is just not the behaviour of a Master Thief now, is it...Also, if you play on Expert, then you cannot kill anyone, adding a lesson in Master Stealth. Enjoy :)INTERFACE.The maps are basic handwritten suggestions, aimed at giving you a hint rather than a dumb arrow pointing you the way. The key bindings take a little getting used to. But I am a veteran and I can tell you they ARE easy to get used to. There is free reign on personal key binding. You can save many configurations, depending on how you play. Okay, so the physics are a little rough and ready, but this was the cutting edge of technology and it is all about the stealth. Get used to how the player behaves in the environment and you won't have a problem.GET IT?If you like games with a real challenge, requiring patience, a game that delivers punishment for idiotic decisions, immersive and scary environments with appropriate abience and music, Levels that are varied and difficult, then the Thief series is certain to please you. Thief 1: The Dark project (aka; Thief Gold), 10 / 10.Thief 2: The Metal Age  11 / 10.(These two are the two to focus on).Thief 3: Deadly shadows. (started to stray away from the original themes and level of difficulty, but still close to the originals). 7 / 10Thief 4: I don't even want to recommend this one. Leave it on the shelf with Call of duty and Assassins Creed if I were you...Sorry, it ain't Thief no more.. 0 / 10			"

												I came to Thief late.  As much as it's praised, and that praise is well deserved... it does suffer from a bad control scheme and some of the problems of retro games.  You should rebind your keys immediately, because you KNOW your hand is going to be reaching for WASD.  This is an easy fix, but it does need to be done right from the onset.  But the bigger problem is that the physics have some serious issues.  They were standard, normal issues for all games of the time.  Younger people who can't remember gaming in the 90's, are likely to get severely frustrated with these issues.  I get frustrated with them MYSELF.  It shouldn't take six tries to jump over a one-foot ledge, but it often does.  You shouldn't fall to your death because of the lack of the game's responsiveness, or because your character's toe was in the wrong place and prevented you from getting up on the ledge, but you do.  We used to take these things in stride because it was the best thing we had.  So if you're less than 25, new to gaming, or frustrate easily, you should probably stick to modern games.  But if you're 25+, or if you can take your lumps with old game mechanics issues (die horribly a hundred times, get ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and come back to it later when you've cooled off, and do it on the first try... you know that's how it goes every single time) you'll love this.  The story and narration are great.  I can't wait to go through the whole series!  You do have to keep in mind that this is from 1998, but I would still recommend this to anyone.  Even if you don't enjoy the gameplay, this is one of those games you hear about constantly, and having first hand experience of a classic game is the best thing.  It's like seeing Casablanca, or playing the Ocarina of Time, for a more game-centric comparison.  When you're looking at its flaws, view it critically, like an old horror movie with cheesy effects.  Let it sit heavily on your mind that it was the best they could do at the time, and don't judge it against modern game standards.  Judge it instead, on the merits it had, compared to other games at the time.  By that standard, this game's amazing.			"

												I discovered the Thief series in some roundabout way, but the similarities to the sneaking system in the Elder Scrolls series is fantastic, and I would even say it surpasses it. Thief Gold is essentially the director's cut of the original Thief game, so it's got some dated Quake II-esqe graphics that end up making the game that more charming.TL;DR: If you like Skyrim sneaking, you'll love this game!

Stealthiest game everThis is the father of all first person stealth games and its goal is not to engage in combat as in many other FPS, but to avoid it and act as a true thief! The sounds your character makes, makes you think about your every step if you don't wanna get caught and the light system which is one of the main point of the game is perfectly done. Levels are massive, and for a game like this, it is perfect.Hide in the shadows to avoid enemies or take them down when necessary. Sneaking at the patrolling guards is really thrilling and sometimes funny when you listen to them talking to themselves :)I recommend downloading a HD patch! The game looks pretty bad by today's standards. With the HD mod, however, it looks positively gorgeous! "

												Great fun First Person Stealth game with excellent level design that promotes exploration and creativity. Only minor issue is there are a few levels that stray away from ""stealing from the rich"" into Tomb Raider-ish environments filled with Zombies/Monsters, which detracts from the stealth gameplay.Make sure to get TFix before playing.

												I alerted some guards by throwing crates. They came for me and saw me but only one decided to fight, and subsequently got bashed in the face by my blackjack, after taking away most of my health of course. The other was caught on a pillar and, thinking I was gone, started to look for me again. I shot him in the face and he ran to get help. Later, I ran into a guard patrolling the halls and ran away (he didn't follow, though). Using my superior intellect, I jumped down a flight of stairs and died.

												Almost twenty years have passed since the release of Thief, and this game still doesn't cease to surprise me.Who needs fancy next-gen controls, focus modes, casual player difficulty or quick time events if you already have this particular gem?Thief is all about pitch-dark steampunkish medieval mythology paired with probably video game history's best stealth gameplay.• Sword, Blackjack and Bow? Check.• High replay factor? Check.• Awesome cutscenes? Check.• Castles, dungeons, temple ruins, all with excellent level design? Check.• Cultists, zombies, ghosts and other hazards? Check.• Loot, loot and loot? Check.• One of the most badass main characters ever? Check.• One of the best PC games ever produced? Hell yeah, check.Make sure you play it on Expert Mode to explore all the secret areas and mission goals.

												Thief Gold is a first person stealth game. Singleplayer only. Released in 1998.It's quite old but you can believe me: It's nice and worth a try.Graphics:     8/10It's an old game. So I can't compare it with Crysis 3. The textures and effects are really ok.The most important thing here: They created a really nice atmosphere with textures you would describe nowadays with the word awkward.Leveldesign:     7/10Let's split this topic. There are good levels and bad levels.The bad levels are so confusing that I wish I could erase them for good.For our luck these levels are fairly rare.Most levels are really well designed. You have to think and search for the best pathin the shadows hoping to not get detected. Sometimes there are more ways to get to the target location. There are plenty of secrets and loot. I admit that sometimes it's extremely hard to find the correct answer to the riddle and the game becomes frustrating.To sum it up: 7/10.Sound:     5/10On one hand you have really annoying enemy sounds, on the other hand you can locate the enemies' footsteps and the rest gives you a fitting sound ambience. Music is virtually not existent and not necessarily needed in this genre but I miss it. Gameplay/Handling/Equipment:     9/10You are the thief crawling in the shadows. The game wants you to hide and sneak. And I swear you will do it. Otherwise you will have a really bad time playing the game. The enemies are too strong for you to kill them in combat (most of them). You must use the really innovative equipment to take your enemies down and find the best way to infiltrate. But it takes a long time to get used to the controls and ""rules"" of the game. For example: Killing people with arrows is nearly impossible except you do it from the shadows (1-shot kill). The same thing with the club. Knock people out with one hit from the back or die after trying to kill your enemy face to face. The most important tool is your bow. Use your rope arrows to climb up, use water arrows to extinguish the torches, use the noise arrow to distract enemies, use moss arrows to silence your steps (etc.).Enemies/AI:     9/10Ok - now I have to explain. Nine out of ten is really high.I have to remind you that this game is really old. And it's really amazing that guards don't just ignore dead or sleeping bodies and keep on searching you until they find you. The AI reacts if you miss the shot and I never experienced a real bug. Sometimes the AI has problems with altitude but it's not gamebreaking or noticeable.So for this time: Awesome!BTW.: Most undead are dumb like they are meant to be.Story:     7/10It's a nice story with unexpected twists. Some people may have a problem with the fact that the story becomes science fictional and doesn't remain realistic. The voice actors for the characters are really fitting and it will never be boring throughout the game. The best thing is that you can hear Garrett's thoughts which makes the chacacter lively.Critic summary:     7.5/10     Personal fun rating:     8/10     [very good game]The game is oldschool and one of the first stealth games. And it deserved the name Thief..I can recommend the game for genre-fans. One warning: If you don't have patience then this is not your game. One of my favorites. 31h played (one playthrough). Sadly the replay value is low.			"

												It simply is a great game. Don't let the outdated graphics fool you. Give this game some time and you will be sucked to it's dark world. Each level gives you unique feels and gameplay time is pretty long. Maps are designed in a way that you can come up with multiple solutions for obstacles at hand. Some maps are really large and complex that you can get lost pretty easily. I like this design approach which I can't see in any modern games (they tend to hold your hand from beggining to end of game).			"

												In 1998, Looking Glass Studios, a company that wasn't afraid to tread new ground in innovation and game design would release one of the most fascinating games of all time that would pave the way for many future titles, stealth and otherwise.Thief is one of those games where you can lose yourself in it's atmosphere quite quickly. Doing steampunk before steampunk was cool, it throws you into this marvellous Victorian styled world of magic and technology as a character you can't help but love; Garrett.As Garrett, you will visit mansions, underground tombs, ruins and abandoned sections of The City, risking life and limb for that final prize; unimaginable wealth.The gameplay is solid and rewarding. Your 'Light Gem' will tell you how visible you are at any given time. Hide in the shadows and sneak past at the right time to avoid your enemies... if you want. You could kill them or knock them unconscious but that's your choice to make. Its perfectly possible to complete this game without killing or knocking anybody or anything unconscious.The story is also very well written however the main story doesn't start until a few levels into the game so you get time to take in the world around you and see a tiny bit of it, time to master the controls and learn how to play.Small story segments are given to you here and there that may tell you things you need to learn about your objective or the environment; two guards having a conversation, a dropped scroll or book on a bedside table. Exploration of the open-ended levels is rewarded either with loot to steal or with tiny story segments.Speaking of loot and gear, you'll need to get exploring and collect it. The more loot you collect in one level, the more money you will have to spend on gear for the next. Gear such as Water Arrows to put out torches, Rope Arrows to climb or to find alternate entries into buildings, Flash Bombs to temporarily blind pursuers, Moss Arrows to silence your footsteps over loud surfaces or Noisemaker Arrows for a quick distraction.The game does have it's flaws; the sometimes confusing level design can make it hard to navigate some levels, a small amount of voice-acting isn't that great, the slight overuse of the undead in places and the character models haven't aged very well but the art design, atmosphere and storytelling still hold up today as some of the best ever encountered in a game.Mods are out there to update the graphics and textures if you want to use them. The game is very mod friendly and there are plenty of user-made fan missions out there to keep your inner taffer happy for a long time.

Thief Gold Setup and Modding Guide

												If you missed this one back in the 90s, it still hasn't lost its appeal. There's a reason every review for a modern stealth game includes a comparison to Thief. This is the game that defined the genre.It contains realistic open level design that's never been matched since. Each building feels like it was designed to serve a real purpose, not just to be a linear game level. The backstory is deep and immersive and the motivations behind the steampunk-versus-magic factions are morally complex.One of the all-time great classics. Well worth a purchase.Unfortunately, the engine hasn't aged well. Even with the recent patches, this game requires a bit of tweaking before it runs without mouse lag at the correct speed in widescreen mode. No matter how highly I recommend this game, you need to be willing to spend some time reading the forums and tweaking configuration files to get the most out of it. "

												Thief is not a stealth game for the light of heart.  For starters, you may be used to backstabbing enemies in other games, such as Dishonored, which was inspired by this game.You would be better off unlearning that instinct, as this is a game that emphasizes the fact that you are a thief.  Not a ""Rogue"" from D&D, and not an Assassin from Assassin's Creed.  Garrett is no swordsman, carrying his sword more for self-defense than necessity.The swordplay is intentionally awkward, as they originally developed the engine for another game they had planned, but discovered it was too difficult to use.  Then they realized they could apply it to a game where the player character isn't expected to be a good swordsman.As far as stealth mechanics go, you will learn to love the shadows.  Garrett is practically invisible while in the darkest shadows, and thus you will find yourself flitting from shadow to shadow, like a true thief, while fearing the light that exposes you to your enemies.  You will also learn to pay careful attention to the sound you make, as guards have ears and will pay attention to sounds you make.Being a thief, however, Garrett is squishy.  And on the highest difficulties, he considers himself a professional - that means no murdering.  This is what sets Thief apart from other games - it discourages simple murder, and encourages you to get around obstacles instead of cutting your way through them.  This is a simple thing that Deadly Shadows and Thief 4 have neglected.The graphics are dated, but this can be mended by the HD mod, which improves the quality of the textures.  However, if you can overcome the graphics, you will find a rich and rewarding experience.As far as the plot goes, well,, it is slow to start off with - Garrett takes the first chance he gets to escape from the Keepers, and tries to make his own fate outside of their influence.  The plot of the game doesn't kick in until part of the way in.  More impressive than the plot, however, is the atmosphere.  You are in the !@#$iest steampunk city in the entire fictional universe.  The rich are corrupt, the poor are sick and hungry, one religion's word is law, and another religion is trying to kill everyone.  Even the bears suffer (if you eavesdrop on a conversation in the first proper mission of the game).Even if you are a new player, I would recommend playing the game on Expert.  Expert is where Thief truly shines, as it requires the most gameplay out of you.  It isn't just a flat upgrade in stats, you have more objectives you are required to complete, objectives you might not have ever known about on any other difficulty.What are the bad parts of this game, you might ask?  For starters, the controls are outdated.  You can remap them, but you have different keys for ""walk forward"" and ""run forward"", and you WILL be using both.  Thankfully, the game doesn't use TOO many keys, so just remap them to your comfort level.All in all, if you're a fan of stealth games, I would DEFINITELY recommend Thief.  If you are interested in starting a stealth game, I would recommend giving this a try, too.  If you hate Stealth games, why are you reading this?If you want a Thief game where you play as a Thief and not a kleptomaniac Assassin, this is the game for you.			"

At first, since the game was so old, I did not enjoy any of it, until I did the first three missions and I started to get the hang of it. The story is great, the gameplay is fantastic, your inventory of tools is wonderful. On top of it, this game is huge. I never been overwhelmed by a game of such size. There is no map to hold you hand, it is all up to you to figure it out, and the vast size of each map is overwhelming at first. This game is extremely long. It took me 37 hours to beat it, but I played the at the highest difficulty setting. So it will last you a while. Get yourself the ""Gold"" version, not the original version, the expansion adds to the value of the game. The only weakness of this game is the AI is really stupid, but it does not end up ruining the game for you. I rate this game at 9.5 / 10.			"

												One of my good friends had recommended this game to me; it was his favorite PC game of all time.I have not really got too far into the game quite yet, but I have played it for a few hours, and I can say I really do appreciate it a lot. It has a very dark and eerie atmosphere to it. I like it's old-school feel, too. I would like if the game would let you play using an Xbox controller, but it seems it doesn't support it fully.Recommended if you like stealth, going around stealing things and knocking out gards, as the game's title obviously implies.

												Thief is not a stealth game for the light of heart.  For starters, you may be used to backstabbing enemies in other games, such as Dishonored, which was inspired by this game.You would be better off unlearning that instinct, as this is a game that emphasizes the fact that you are a thief.  Not a ""Rogue"" from D&D, and not an Assassin from Assassin's Creed.  Garrett is no swordsman, carrying his sword more for self-defense than necessity.The swordplay is intentionally awkward, as they originally developed the engine for another game they had planned, but discovered it was too difficult to use.  Then they realized they could apply it to a game where the player character isn't expected to be a good swordsman.As far as stealth mechanics go, you will learn to love the shadows.  Garrett is practically invisible while in the darkest shadows, and thus you will find yourself flitting from shadow to shadow, like a true thief, while fearing the light that exposes you to your enemies.  You will also learn to pay careful attention to the sound you make, as guards have ears and will pay attention to sounds you make.Being a thief, however, Garrett is squishy.  And on the highest difficulties, he considers himself a professional - that means no murdering.  This is what sets Thief apart from other games - it discourages simple murder, and encourages you to get around obstacles instead of cutting your way through them.  This is a simple thing that Deadly Shadows and Thief 4 have neglected.The graphics are dated, but this can be mended by the HD mod, which improves the quality of the textures.  However, if you can overcome the graphics, you will find a rich and rewarding experience.As far as the plot goes, well,, it is slow to start off with - Garrett takes the first chance he gets to escape from the Keepers, and tries to make his own fate outside of their influence.  The plot of the game doesn't kick in until part of the way in.  More impressive than the plot, however, is the atmosphere.  You are in the !@#$iest steampunk city in the entire fictional universe.  The rich are corrupt, the poor are sick and hungry, one religion's word is law, and another religion is trying to kill everyone.  Even the bears suffer (if you eavesdrop on a conversation in the first proper mission of the game).Even if you are a new player, I would recommend playing the game on Expert.  Expert is where Thief truly shines, as it requires the most gameplay out of you.  It isn't just a flat upgrade in stats, you have more objectives you are required to complete, objectives you might not have ever known about on any other difficulty.What are the bad parts of this game, you might ask?  For starters, the controls are outdated.  You can remap them, but you have different keys for ""walk forward"" and ""run forward"", and you WILL be using both.  Thankfully, the game doesn't use TOO many keys, so just remap them to your comfort level.All in all, if you're a fan of stealth games, I would DEFINITELY recommend Thief.  If you are interested in starting a stealth game, I would recommend giving this a try, too.  If you hate Stealth games, why are you reading this?If you want a Thief game where you play as a Thief and not a kleptomaniac Assassin, this is the game for you.			"

												Like no other game Thief holds a very dear place in my heart.  Nothing in my experience comes close to the sense of otherworldly atmosphere as presented in this game.  I remember when I played this as a 13 year old kid, the visceral sense of breaking & entering Bafords manor, blackjack in hand, the guard on duty who seemed so real in that long dark forboding corridor.  Dark Souls comes close to this but is too grimdark and frankly difficult, and Dishonoured tries too much and loses a sense of immersion.Thief Gold is even better as the extra missions act as good breaks between the supernatural missions towards the end.  Protip about those supernatural missions: think of yourself as more of a Ranger than a Thief: its action time >:)1000/10, best game ever			"

												This game arguably had more influence on the industry of gaming than The Beatles had on the industry of music. From Splinter Cell to Half Life 2, and from Hitman to Dishonored, numerous other titles have borrowed from or referenced this masterpiece. The story, the charismatic protagonist and the bizarre setting all contribute to a completely unique experience that feels more like the digitalised image of a picture in your head as you read through a dark medieval-steampunk novel. it's mircaulous, and it's aged graphics give it a much needed charm of being ""just enough"" for your head to complete the picture.

												Charming game, but the cutscenes don't work, and I'm not going to keep playing it until I get them working so I don't miss important parts of the story. It's a shame that I didn't figure out there were cutscenes until I saw someone's playthrough of it. I doubt that many people even figure out they're missing anything. My point is: Steam, I want the story. I'm not getting the story. And it's a damn shame that players need to go on the internet to even figure out they're missing the story. Patch it.There are also some really weird controls that you have to rebind unless you're an octopus. Good luck with that.			"

You take ANY level in this game, nevermind The Sword and Banford's Mansion, and you have an entire game that is better than most modern releases full games today.  It's that simple.  Stealth, detection of your presence, your awareness of your visibility to your opponents, your realization of levels of detection by voice cues and whether you have a chance of just staying in the shadows all make this games one of the MOST INTENSE battles you will EVER face without ever firing a single shot.  You don't fire fight in this game.  Two blows from a Hammer's hammer and you are done.  No 200% armor, no superhealth, no quad damage, no invulnerability.   It's just you; a mace, a few arrows filled with water and moss and hopefully a flash bomb or two.  It doesn't get more real than this game and you can feel the love and care in every level			"

												First two important facts: You need to mod this game and YOU NEED TO MOD THIS GAME MORE! It'll make the textures and lighting look less like mud and cutscenes work. Other than that, this game is a step short of a masterpiece for a stealth game. Why a step short? The last few levels are basically hacky-slashy which destroy the mood, plus they are dreadfully difficult to sneak in.I can't say much more about the game. Story is really nice, the main character is written well, and most, not all, of the levels are full of exploration.			"

Introduction:Thief Gold is a first-person stealth game set in a medieval/fantasy world in which you play as Garrett, a master thief who makes his living by stealing from the rich.  And in order to avoid any spoilers... well, let's just say things get complicated.This is the first game in the Thief series and the extended edition of Thief: The Dark Project.  It includes all of the original game content and features three new missions adapted to the original storyline along with full voice acting and new graphics.TLDR Highlights:+++ Stealth Gameplay and Utilities++ Voice Acting+ Improved (but still old) Graphics-- Slow Start/Story- Wonky Hit-boxes= No wonder it's such a beloved classic!  The old graphics might turn some people off, but if you can get past it, then I highly recommend playing this one.Review:PROS -- The main feature of this game is also the very best thing about it:  stealth gameplay.  I also believe this game is the first to use first-person 3D stealth, which is honestly pretty amazing considering how good it is!  Near the beginning of the game, I was trying to hide in the shadows but it wasn't dark enough thanks to some torches.  Now, this is my very first time ever playing this game, so at first I just made do, thinking this game was far too old to have useful mechanics like removing the torches or, better yet, putting them out somehow.  Sure enough, I found water arrows in my inventory and was able to shoot them at torches to put them out and create more shadows!  There's also rope arrows, noisemaker arrows, moss arrows (to create a quieter surface to walk on), not to mention a blackjack and the need for multiple kinds of lockpicks that somehow made me feel like I was actually picking locks even though the mechanic is extremely simple.  All of this and more are what make the game fun.  Master them, and you'll look be running around like a Master Thief in no time!!Since I never played the original version of this game, I can't compare how the voice acting now compares to how things were then, but I can say that I'm very impressed with it in Thief Gold.  It honestly surprised me right from the start how good it was.  Even the idle chit chat of the variou NPCs were rather good (and often funny lol).As for the graphics, I did end up seeing some images of the old graphics and they have been noticeably improved.  I also recommend using TGTool, which is what I used for some additional improvements, such as 1080 resolution and darker shadows/ambient lighting, making the game even more immersive.CONS -- My biggest and main gripe about the game, however, is the slow start.  This is most likely caused by the pacing of the story.  Some of the first missions were cool and all, but I didn't really feel a sense of purpose.  Sure, there would be little cutscenes that gave me an explanation as to why I was going to this place and stealing that item, but it was lacking in the ""big picture"" department.  In fact, I started to get bored enough that I almost quit playing.  Fortunately, I stuck it out because the story really gets ramped up by the end.  It sucks that it took so long, but in the end I felt that it was totally worth it, and I can't wait to play the sequel to see what happens next.A much, much smaller issue for me was the hit-boxes when attacking or knocking out the NPCs.  Sometimes I could hit them from a few feet away, and other times I could be right on top of them and miss consistently (maybe hitting somewhere through and behind them).  This wasn't a huge problem, though, because you get a feel for it and the distance required.  Just a by-product of being an old game perhaps.OVERALL -- I've been hearing about this game for a long time, but especially around the time that the new Thief came out not too long ago, and it's been on my list of games to play just as long.  Honestly, I'm very glad I finally got around to it.  It got a little slow there for a bit, but it was worth it.  No wonder it's such a beloved classic!  As long as you can get past the dated graphics, then I definitely recommend playing Thief Gold.			"

												I can say nothing bad about this game.  Dated graphics?  Pshaw, play the game and it doesn't matter.  This is what medieval Hitman would be like, if going in guns blazing was suicide - open ended from every angle.  As someone who played this when it first came out, there are play styles which are not rewarded in-game, but are infinitely satisfying: steal all the loot, use nothing which could be found later (water arrows, noise arrows, etc) and knock no one out.  The aftermath is that everything valuable is gone from the house, there are no clues, and no guard saw anything...do this and you aren't a thief - you're a shadow!			"

												This game has it's fair share of problems. You can't play it unless you have Tpatch ,which lets it run better on modern computers. Don't expect anything in terms of graphics ,this is from 1998. This game revolutionized stealth gaming and it's mechanics show in modern gaming. The in-game map was a piece of paper ,which would come up when you press ""M"" ,similarly to most other games today. The map wouldn't actually show your position ,because it's supposed to be a map that is hand drawn by your player character and it fits the theme ,so I liked that mechanic. I would get lost because of it ,but it's different from most maps and it made you feel like you were there. It also made you look around to figure out where you were ,which actually was really annoying for me. The AI is also extremely stupid and I hated a lot of levels. As much as I hate a lot of mechanics ,this is still an entertaining game. I guess I just don't like it as much as some people because I'm not use to some mechanics. However ,you will get use to it and this is fun.			"

												I immediately loved this game from the first time I played it 18 years ago on a free trial disk. It has the best replay value of almost any game I've ever played, and I've played through it at least 10 times before it was available on Steam. With the new HD mod that Bentraxx developed (and continues to polish), I have begun to play through it yet again and it is incredible. This game is in my top 3, and I doubt I will ever cease to enjoy its incredibly immersive atmosphere. A couple tips for those who haven't tried it: 1. Play in a dark room, and 2. Make sure you have plenty of free time, as you will be engaged for a while.			"

												This is a great stealth game of hiding killing knocking out, to you just dying. The only difficult is the brightness factor so if you play on a laptop I reccomend plugging it in to your tv so you can see better. 10/10 The first thief here on steam has three more missions added then it had on the game disc.

												I immediately loved this game from the first time I played it 18 years ago on a free trial disk. It has the best replay value of almost any game I've ever played, and I've played through it at least 10 times before it was available on Steam. With the new HD mod that Bentraxx developed (and continues to polish), I have begun to play through it yet again and it is incredible. This game is in my top 3, and I doubt I will ever cease to enjoy its incredibly immersive atmosphere. A couple tips for those who haven't tried it: 1. Play in a dark room, and 2. Make sure you have plenty of free time, as you will be engaged for a while.			"

												First of all the stealth mechanics are excellent. The game is easy to understand but hard to complete. Yes, you have a map, but in the map you don't know where are you any you need to use your instinct. The IA is good and you never will make it easy if you've never played the thief.There are several weapons and many kinds of arrow for each occasion. For example the sword (only be used if you chase), the Blackjack (that you will use to knock out the enemies) and different types of arrows for any occasion such as an arrow with a rope to climb, the arrow water to extinguish torches, the arrow with sleeping gas to stop the enemy  etc.This game is a 9.5/10 in my opinion. Is just perfect but the game but the game does not have any checkpoint so if you die you'll have to start over from the beginning of the level and you'll have to save the game manually or by pressing F11.

												Somehow I've missed the thief series back in the day and started to play it only now. I am an old gamer so outdated graphics/gameplay mechanics (they are not outdated in this case and are much better than many new AAA titles have these days)/complicated controls/etc don't bother me at all and I am perfectly fine with older games. HOWEVER. If you are like me and want to jump into thief games for the first time and EXPIRIENCE MASTER THIEF'S story then this game might not be for you.You see, I've finished this game in 27.2 hourse and 90% of the time it's not about thievery... The biggest problem is that first game heavily relies on supernatural elements like zombies, ghosts, and other evil forces. And it's simply not interesting to sneak past those foes nor to steal anything from them. I just couldn't be bothered about those enemies... I didn't feel like it's necessary to be sneaky around them. I slayed them/ran past them, and that completely broke the immersion. It might've been terrifying back in the day but today it's just an annoying experience. So before you play this game ask yourself if the idea of stealing from/sneaking around zombies excites you, because it's a HUGE part of the game.Another big issue for me which some might find very appealing is level design. Thief Gold levels are mostly long and pretty boring maze-like corridors. I'd say it's not interesting to explore 80% of them and I didn't feel like searching for secrets or other mission irrelevant stuff.On the other hand the story is awesome, gameplay mechanics can surpass many AAA titles we have today, the game has many confusing twists and mindblowing elements like Constantine's mansion and it's worth it to at least watch the walkthrough on youtube because it'll be a great entry point into thief series and Garrett's story AND into Thief 2... And that's a whole different story, because I am only 5hrs into Thief 2 and I am telling you that this game is just plain AWESOME. I know that it was like that since the release of the thief 2 and people were separated into two confronting sides: the thief 1 lovers and thief 2 haters AND the thief 2 lovers and thief 1 haters... Well it seems like I am with latter ones.			"

												Even though this game is old its gold like it name says. Most missions are good and areas are different and sometimes even maze like. You will play as Garrett (master thief) who will get in areas where thiefs arent very appreciated, so stealth and shadows are his best friends along with some special equipments that he owns. Combat is quite clunky and Garrett isnt exactly your swordsman but he got bow which helps alot in challenges that will come. Took 20 hours for me to complete this so it has good hours for single player game from my view. Because of difficulty settings you will get more hours in this game to spent.8/10Great- Garrett- Bow and its different arrows- GadgetsGood- Most missions- Difficulty settings (harder difficulties give more objectives to do or obey)- Stealth system- EnemiesBad- Bit clunky combat- objective text didnt update with information that npc's gave- Mage towers mission			"

												Continuing along with some older games and series that I've wanted to play for years, I now play the original Thief game (without having played any of the others, so I am going in order) after just playing System Shock 2, which I loved. Unfortunately, I did not love Thief, nor did I really like it, though I came in with high hopes as I knew that the same developers made System Shock 2.Firstly, I don't mean that the game is inherently bad in many ways. In fact, the majority of the game's design aspects are actually very well done, except for one, which killed the game for me: the level design. Before I get there though, I will first go through everything else I thought about the game, on the positive side:+ The story of the game was very interesting, even just starting with the first cinematic, which got me excited about the game actually going somewhere.+ Garrett is a very likable character and had his own unique attitude, unlike a good amount of protagonists (e.g., the one in System Shock 2 had no character to himself).+ The graphics of the game were decent and didn't bother me, though some things were badly distorted and the mansion in The Sword was ugly.+ The mechanical design of the game is great. I love all of the different items you can use, including intriguing things like the Moss Arrows. The fact that game properly organizes the stealth depending on the material you are walking upon is good, as some current games don't do such a thing. Simple things like directional combat when swinging the sword is good, which again most games don't do nowadays. And changing the difficulty and indirectly changing the objectives of levels is a great idea to add replayability, extending the levels.But sadly, none of the above things helped me get over the level design, which was abysmal. The first level was a generic mansion with nothing special about it, but I was like ""Okay, just a way to get you into the stealth."" The second level was just as generic, as I didn't find the zombies or caves interesting, and the prison was boring. The third level started making me really dislike the design.At that point, I realized that the levels were mostly generic, giant mazes. Labyrinths, basically! Really, the third level was ""unrealistic"" in terms of size and really killed my mood. You're walking through the same-looking caves and crypts over and over, in circles. Even though I got through eventually, it was just random waddling and being bored. Most of the levels turned out to be this way. The levels are generally split up into different areas, but all of the rooms or places in a given area usually look the exact same in design. The only levels I ended up enjoying even remotely were the Haunted Cathedral and Strange Bedfellows because of atmosphere.I enjoy stealth games greatly, and I didn't get impatient with the levels because you should take things slow. I'm fine creeping around as needed in such a game. I just got terribly bored and annoyed because most places took forever to find out how to actually get around simply because they were artificial expanses that had no character to them. Occasionally finding notes added some of that, but for the most part, it was all just so boring finding your way through. I know some people will ask if I was bored because I wandered around repeatedly knocking people out, but that was not the case. I was fine with the gameplay and I tried ghosting some levels anyway. It is just the design and layouts that I disliked and ruined everything for me.I mean really, they are just expanses of nothingness... the crypts, the thieves guild, the mansion in The Sword, so on. I loved System Shock 2, and I love other stealth games like the Deus Ex, Metal Gear Solid, and Hitman series, and Dishonored as the most recent example, in which I went through the entire first playthrough not hurting anybody or being seen. But this game's world design made it so boring to play, even though I really was interested (and still am) with the story.And you have the exact opposite with the last level in terms of approach. You go from incredibly open places to the most linear level ever... and just as boring. Fighting the enemies didn't interest me anymore at this point, and in fact, I ended up beating the level in less than 8 minutes (not counting waiting for the ritual at the end) because I simply just jumped along the way, evading all enemies. The only reason it even took that long was because of the water stream.But after the final level, the final cutscene was still very interesting... So I'm hopeful that the next games get better in their levels. I guess I will find out.			"

The worst news is that this is a game, so it suffers greatly from glitchy hitboxes, bugged moving geometry, bizarre lighting, nonsensical audio simulation, muddy controls, and more.I had fewer issues in System Shock 2, so hopefully Thief 2 will incorporate all those fixes and be the game this franchise deserves.

												I've tried this game vanilla (well, TFix, GoldtoDark mod to get rid of awful levels, and texture mods so it doesn't look too outdated). This game just strikes me as completely bland with some good ideas. I've seen the whole of the story and it's definitely underwhelming. After running a few action packed missions early on, the levels become these huge, empty labrinths that I got bored traversing. I bumped the difficulty up to Expert and it didn't help with more objectives.My suspicion is that people love these games because they played them like 2 decades ago and they were novel and fresh then. I feel they have not aged well; other games have used these mechanics and to much better, and more fun, effect. I would still rather play Splinter Cell over these games.			"

												First of all, congrats to the HD Mod and TFix, they are an AMAZING piece of work that enable the game to play in a gorgeous Full Screen with a great resolution and also bring back the cinematics (although I don't understand why they weren't already in the game in the first place...). In addition, keep in mind you will probably have to remap all the controls of the game before playing. At least I had to (playing on AZERTY keyboard). They were utterly broken when I first tried them . Note the game does not support controllers.  Be aware that Thief Gold is not a ""turnkey game"" in this regard. Back to the game itself, now. I must say I was impressed by all the stealth features Thief had right back in 1998. It's hard to deny the game had a MAJOR impact on gaming. Also, it's not that ugly, and the story and voice acting are pretty decent. HOWEVER, I couldn't bring myself to love it. Not even like it. I found it really tedious to play, and the biggest flaw in my opinion is the fact that you have no real map of the levels, thus resulting in you getting lost for hours inside maze-like corridors and caves. If only I could orientate myself, I'm sure I would have finished the game, but I found it too much of a chore to stay interested. So yeah. Great legacy, appealing game, but eventually too boring. If a mod is released to correct this, I swear I'll try it again.			"

												I had to tinker around forever just to get it to start, only to be extremely disappointed by how awkward and clunky the controls are. The options for keybind customization do not allow for camera control to be bound exclusively to the mouse, and this as well as the very limited options for other keybinds makes this game almost unplayable. I would definitely not recommend this to anyone intending to play with traditional first person controls.			"

												Nostalgia is one hell of a drug.Do you enjoy downloading patches and tweaking settings before you can even get the game to work?Do you enjoy tutorials that don't explain anything at all about the game?Do you enjoy incredibly clunky controls that you need to rebind almost entirely?Do you enjoy spending hours running around empty-looking maps with 0 detail to them?Do you enjoy enemies that will detect you with ESP-like accuracy even behind walls if they've already spotted you?Do you enjoy enemies that phase through doors?Do you enjoy out-of-depth undead that shatter the very genre by existing, since they can detect your presence just by being nearby even if in absolute darkness?Do you enjoy relying on 30 second buffs to kill said undead?Do you enjoy old interfaces that don't even tell you what you looted out of chests?Do you enjoy struggling to use something as basic as ladders and doors because of how clunky they are?Do you enjoy having to give up and look maps online to see where in the ugly maze-like building you can find a way to finish the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ level?Do you enjoy running more slowly just because you have a sword out, that you'd be carrying anyways?Do you enjoy having to quicksave constantly because of all the times you'll run around a corner and get spotted by enemies, because the game lacks an autosave function or safe way to peek?Then Thief Gold is for you!I didn't even say anything about graphics because they're honestly something that hardly matters as long as a game is aesthetically pleasing, which I can't complain too much about thief given how old it is, but the maps do feel incredibly empty like a lot of old games would.Didn't say anything about the lack of a reliable map either because the lack of one is supposed to help immersion, and I honestly never found myself even using the vague maps the games provides since they may as well not be there.I gave up playing the game after running around the guild's map for hours and having knocked out every single NPC but still lacking the key I needed to finish the level. All these issues just add up and ultimately make something unenjoyable.I honestly see 0 reason to play this game over any others in the genre other than nostalgia, fanboys will be fanboys and will downvote, sing endless praise, and refuse to see the numerous bad things about their favorite games, but honestly the game is undeserving. It may have been special 18 years ago but it's no longer true. The same seems to be true for a lot of older games having overwhelmingly positive opinions with 0 regards to the many, many negative aspects they may have.			"

												Heads up: CG movies don't work for modern OSes and a lot of the game's story is told through the CG cutscenes. I made it through 3 levels before I realized how little context I was getting for what I was doing. Easy to mod though.Gameplay-wise, it's nothing mind-blowing so far. The one thing I can say is that although some games have done stealth better, it seems you're more rewarded and acknowledged in this game for being stealthy			"

If you can somehow suffer through autistic level design that reminds me of minecraft caves then you might enjoy this game, the sound is great and the horror atmosphere can be enjoyable at times.

												Well here we are. Thief is ♥♥♥♥. Thats the truth it might have been good in the 90's but know it doesn't hold up for many reasons to numerous to name so here a few cons and pros of the game:ConsGraphics: The graphics are old thats the best way to say it but to be honest graphics quality doesn't really bother me but i know a lot of people are quite into their graphics so thats why its here.Map: I have nothing wrong with map screens if they have some sort of sanity put in them but Garrett god bless him decided to draw them by hand badly so the fun of a non-linear world is ruined by having no way of navigating it.Combat mechanics: Unlike most stealth games nowadays where there is a focus on action over stealth which is good because it gives variety and change to the genre but what makes a stealth game great for me personally is choosing how you would like to carry out your task. Basically whether you want to go in guns blazing or be more sneaky in your execution, Thief doesn't give you this option as the combat mechanics are really bad and trying to fight the guards is like trying to beat a dark souls boss while armed with a wooden stick.Pros:Non-linear map: With reference with my map problems this is feature is sort of ruined but i am still going to add it because maybe you can decrypt Garretts map and get enjoyment out of the exploration of these massive maps. Stealth mechanics: Brilliant, top of the range, amazing.. All words you could use to describe the stealth mechanics: Different materials make varied sounds either loud or soft forcing you to be more careful and thoughtful when you are sneaking through an area, The detail thats gone into the lighting and shadow casting is amazing for such an old game and it really adds to the dark grimy feel of the game but also makes for great stealth moments.In conclusion. I do not recomend Thief as compared to the stealth games we have now a days (Dishonored and Hitman for example) and i know a lot of people are going to disagree with me but know they are doing it because they are filled with nostalgia and nostalgia can only be felt in people that played the orginal thief so if you are looking for a expansion on the orginial game with the same mechanics and atmosphere then go nuts but, if you are like me and have not played it then i would avoid this game as it doesn't hold up to games like Dishonored (my personal favourite stealth game) and Hitman.P.S: Feel free to type as many hate comments as you want i am bored and i could use an inane arugument to liven things up.

												Undeniably very important in establishing the stealth genre, which is good, but god-awful (sometimes necessary) combat and labyrinthine level design make this really not fun to play.

												I love the idea of stealth games, but unfortunately this game and many others rely on trial and error. It's especially bad here since the combat system is so clunky and broken. Blocking with your sword only works when the game feels like it, and the hit detection is terrible. So combat should be avoided as much as possible. Sneaking up on a guard and knocking them out works most of the time, but other times they'll hear you even though you're moving slowly on carpet. Sometimes you'll get stuck in the middle of a well lit hallway and hear a guard coming that you can't possibly avoid. The only way to get through the game is to fumble around these terrible maps and memorize where these unavoidable hazards are.			"

												Game Score: 2/10I'm sure this game has some nostalgic value for a lot of people but 17 years later this game just doesn't cut it. You play a theif that has to steal ♥♥♥♥ and fight ♥♥♥♥ and jump over ♥♥♥♥ and other ♥♥♥♥. Clearly the control standard back in the day was a bit different and that difference makes playing is game very difficult after being so used to standard FPS/3rd person controls.Pros:- Nostalgia?- Being able to defeat enemies via force or stealthCons:- Garbage controls- old, Old, OLDI'm gonna try the other Thief games but this isn't worth my time to play any more.

												Kinda boring and somewhat janky but Im sure it introduced stuff that wasn't in games or in them much previously. Besides that its kinda boring. The AI isn't really fun to sneak around especially because they are just easier to kill. The combat isn't fun in any way though but then again its supposed to be a stealth game. Its not really hard, its just not very fun or interesting. Sitting in a corner waiting for a guard to leave the area has never been fun to me. The base gameplay is just boring is the issue.Its just so much easier to sneak sometimes and then just kill people who get in the way especially since alot of times you won't realize a guy is right on the other side of a wall until hes already alert. Actually sneaking around kinda sucks and isn't fun particularly because its not easy and super intuitive to control your character aswell as the fact that it can be a bit difficult to know if your going to be spotted or not. Theres certaintly alot of cool mechanics but in reality as a game its just not fun or interesting. Its functional but not fun.I doubt I would have played this game when it was new either, and with no nostalgia to the game I don't care to force myself to play something that just isn't fun. I think the main issue is the mission/map design is terrible aswell as the ingame map being often very unhelpfull.  From what I have seen the level design is nonsensical and confusing with more of the mappers saying ""this looks like a fun areal"" then it actually being a fun area to play in.Its just boring. Not worth playing without rose tinted glasses and nostalgia. I have seen people online saying you should play it on the hardest difficulty but at that point its not going to be scary for a man like me, just boring AND frustrating.Its only fun to play in very short bursts in between other stuff. Otherwise its just boring and repetative.			"

Even if you can customize the controls to be similar to that ones, you will still having difficult handling the battle system			"

												This game might've been something special back in the late 90's, but oh boy does it's age show more than an old man's wrinkly ballsack. Cons:-Extremely slow paced-Horrid voice acting-Horrid animations-EverythingPros:-The only true ""pro"" I can think of for this game, is making fun of this game. Final Verdict:This game aged very extremely poorly. I had to change literally every single key just so I would feel somewhat comfortable playing it, since the default controls are awkward. Buying this game now, would be like buying a computer from the 90's; there's nothing new and/or unique about this game that hasn't already been improved upon in current games.So, in short, I wouldn't recommend this game unless you want to experience an old game or relive some nostalgia.

The first game of the series, and you're a Thief (of course) doing missions in certain levels.
It's very time consuming, and some levels cryptic, I lost my patience for this game.

												1998-2004 were the ""MMO addiction"" years for me as a gamer.  I remeber when Thief: The Dark Project (1998), Thief II: The Metal Age (2000), and Thief: Deadly Shadows (2004) were released, but add them to the list of other great titles that I neglected for, instead,  endless hours of Ultima Online and Everquest.  Had I given these titles a shot back then, I'm sure that I would have been amazed.However, I think my three days of playing through (not completely) these titles earlier this month came, unfortunately, about 8-10 years too late.  As someone who has aged with the medium over the last 30 years, I can see how amazing these games would have been in their day.  But, much like if I were attempting a first play through of the original two Fallout games (~1998), or my beloved X-Com: UFO Defense (1994), I can't get past the graphical deficiencies and absence of other elements one takes for granted in modern games.The positives:  Great story.  Great voice acting by Stephen Russell portraying anti-hero Garrett.  Ground-breaking stealth play.  Amazing AI.The negatives:  No third person view.  Dated graphics. Problems running on modern systems.   Some games age well.  Civilization III, for example, is as fun to play today as it was at its release in 2001.  Unfortunately, some don't...If you were a fan of the titles back in the day, pick them up for your library when they're on sale.  Otherwise, if you're considering a first-time playthrough, consider waiting until the reboot drops next month (2/28/14).			"

												This is a remastered version of the original game ""Thief"", which apparently had thousands of bugs and was actually impossible to complete. The idea of the game is fantastic and the first level amazing, but then it randomly throws in a corpse who tries to kill you. It wasn't the sort of game I thought I was playing. That wasn't what put me off this game though. On the second level, I got stuck on a stone ledge. I tried for nearly 2 hours to get past it, but could not. I don't know if this is a bug, or I just missed something, but I suggest you go straight to ""Theif 2"", a game which I adore and would recommend.			"

												The first two Thief games are classics and have stood the test of time.If you are a fan of stealth games, then this and the sequal are a must.No console controlls, no handholding, good story, maps, voiceacting etc.What you need to do before playing:Since the game is old, if you try to play this with a newer PC the game engine will run too fast, so you need to patch it.Google ""TFix 1.23"", install it and mods if you feel like it. I highly recomend the Dark mod. Some of the missions are done amazingly well and are better than most newer stealth games.			"

With a heavy doze of nostalgia I'm gonna say that it still has its charm and is still very fun even though its nearing 15 years of age.Of course gaming have come a long way and gamedesign have changed a lot since this was released and the leveldesign range from brilliant to painful.Well, its a good game, but honestly if you didnt play this when you were young you probably will have a hard time getting into it.

												First game in the thief series, the story revolves around the master thief Garrett as he, unwillingly, gets sucked into a conflict between two of the more powerful factions in The City, a sprawling steampunk metropolis. As the title suggests, the primary goal in the game is to rob a variety of places of their conveniently large stacks of money with your name on it. The game was the first to take FPS game mechanics and apply them to a less combat-oriented game. Though there are plenty of opportunities to fight in the game, the highest difficulty levels require the player to manage to jump through an assortment of hoops without killing anyone. The game doesn't look beautiful by today's standards but does run without a problem usually and this edition contains several new levels not found in the original game. The mission videos, incredibly well done considering the technology limitations at the time, may not play without some custom troubleshooting in some cases but can be viewed on YouTube if it is too much trouble to fix. The game is one of my all-time favorites and the following games are equally well done. The bundle containing the three games released so far is relatively cheap and a fourth game (a reboot) is due to come out this year and is currently available for pre-order.			"

												This game...aside from a few issues, such as graphics (It was made in '98, give it some credit), controls, and small AI problems, I loved this game. The stealth mechanics are nearly seamless, with attention to sight and sound. Not only that, but this game does not pit you as a hero, per se; you are more of a man after one thing: gold. How you get it is up to you. You are given lots of options; you could murder or knock out every guard you come accross and charge through the level, worrying about your health (as your character isnt the best fighter), or you can go the stealth route and sneak past, pickpocketing guards for keys and looting treasure.TLDR: Game's good bro 9.7/10			"

												A great stealth based, first person perspective game.  The game is quite dated (made in 1998) and it shows, but the mechanics still work and runs well on my 64 bit machine, which is saying a lot for a game made that long ago.  The team that made this went on to making Deus Ex, and the Hitman games so this is a must play for the steath gaming historian.If you are a child, as I was when I first played this years ago, be warry of the nightmares this game induces.

												I hadn't a chance to play the game back in 90's and hasn't played the Steam version for long enough yet, but so far I like it.Main purpose of this review is to cover some FAQ though:1. I didn't find much use for separate run and walk keys -- I remapped keys to the ""wsad"" pattern, with ""w"" for run. When I need to walk slowly, I use ""shift"", works just fine.2. The game itself works OK on Vista (64bit), but without cutscenes. Pressing ""Intro"" button yields nothing too. I found lack of story/narrative to be quite disquieting so I started looking for a solution.3. As always, there were a lot of bull$hit solutions proposed on the Internet, like TTLG/TFix/etc, but IMNSHO you shouldn't tamper with Steam version using 3rd party patches that may contain every sort of malware while no guarantees whatsoever. The Real Solution for Thief Gold on Vista and Windows 7 is to set ""Run this program as administrator"" flag on THIEF.EXE (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\thief_gold\THIEF.EXE --> Properties --> Compatibility tab), this brings cutscenes back (don't bother with ""Run in WinXP SP2 compatibility"" mode, it doesn't cut the mustard).4.

												A instant classic from the days of windows 98 and one of the first well implemented stealth games. Every level has its own character with traps, secret passages, guard, ghouls and treasure scattered through out them. One level you maybe breaking into a fat cats mansion to steal a priceless scepter while the next level find yourself deep in a crypt looking for a magical horn. Each level has a good back story that makes the game feel more like a RPG/Stealth at times though you can't customize your character you customize his equipment for every level. Graphics will be scary to the younger generation (though they do make HD texture packs) for the generation that grew up playing balders gate and deus ex you shouldn't mind them.  "

												A true gem of the past, but still enjoyable even to this day. This game is a masterpiece that inspires exceptional games such as Dishonored.Even with a multitude of handy tools at your disposal, Your mission to break in and steal valuables is by no means easy. It forces you to be creative to survive with minimal hand-holding outside of the tutorial level. This game has clever level design and capable AI to top it off.I can safely recommend this to newcomers and Thief veterans who already owned the original version (like me) alike, because it is a decent release with a much needed compatibility patch to make it run on modern rigs and current Operating System.

												Thief is the pinnacle stealth game. Presumed to be the first stealth title to use shadows as a form of hiding from the enemy. The controls still hold up to this day, but the graphics haven't aged well, some of the characters look like coneheads. Either way, the dialog from the npc's is fantastically written and the plot development of Garret's venture as a professional Thief starts from basic robberies to religion conspiracy. A worthwhile title of being one of the greatest stealth games of all time.9.3/10			"

												Thief is a glorious game no matter what age you are, or date it is.The first of many games that taught us - not through words, but actions - to hide. Not to fight and be an unrealistic dual weapon wielding juggernaut, but to negotiate your way stealthily through levels, as a true Thief would. Thief is undoubtedly the father to many excellent stealth games such as Splinter Cell, and does not merit the fame or praise it rightly deserves from many. Also noteworthy is our narrator and protagonist, Garrett - easily one of my favourite protagonists for his little monologues now and again.			"

												Being a PC game that's the better half of two decades old, my immediate first impression of Thief was that it was very old and very dated. Graphically speaking, it's nothing an N64 couldn't handle, sound-wise, it feels like someone opened a can of stock ""swoosh"" sound effects, and after playing it only for a few minutes, I found myself very disappointed indeed. It seemed very bare-bones from the tutorial. There's not even a run button, and the controls are laid out pretty awkwardly. Overall it's hard to jump right in, but then I started to break the surface tension and I realized that underneat the surface of the water was... was a metaphor I'm putting way too much effort into.As it happens, a lot of what makes Thief old is what makes it good. I think this is best exemplified in the map system, chiefly because it's actually a freaking map. Most games don't give you maps nowadays, they give you radars and blip points and arrows and ""go-here-if-you-want-to-win""-type things. It makes everything feel very soulless; Thief manages to get around this by giving you the bare minimum. It's pretty neat how this is actually how you would imagine Garrett would put a map together. The game gives you the tools to progression, and you have to interpret them. You never quite know what's going to be around the corner. It's a much better approach than ""oh, please, chauffer me to the nearest mundane objective so I can move into your next playground and do the same thing all over again."" Cough, Hitman Absolution, cough.The amount of effort that has gone into the levels is very nice; it's easy to immerse yourself into the world. You're given a few details and have to fill in the pieces. Sure, it's dated, but at the end of the day it's a hell of a lot better than almost every stealth game released since... since 1971. Yes, I dare say this game is better than Tennis for Two. Couple that with a fantastically snarky protagonist and a nifty steampunk setting and you're left with a stealth game done the way it should be. This game makes Hitman Absolution cry. Get it.			"

												Thief: The Dark Project is one of three game released in 1998 that gave birth to the stealth based genre and basically laid the foundation for future games to come. Unlike modern stealth games which give you the option of fighting your way through mobs, you almost always want to stay hidden and strike from the shadows. Mobs usually take quite a few hits to go down and your character Garrett, although an adequate fighter in his own right, is quite squishy and will usually go down really quick. That's not to say that the direct combat method should be avoided, it's actually quite doable, however, the clunky combat system, questionable collision detection and lack of an aiming reticle makes direct combat more trouble than it's worth. The stealth mechanics I thought was innovative although can be quite laughable at times. Thief incorporates a cover system that allows you to conceal yourself in dark, shadowy areas. A ""light gem"" indicator tells you how visible you are to the mobs around you, however, a flaw with the system is that enemy vision AI is dependent on the light gem, so you can literally stand right in front of a mob and as long as your light gem is indicating that you're hidden, they won't notice you and will walk past you as if you were invisable. Sound also plays a part in stealth with AI responding to noises you make such as footsteps or the impact of a thrown item against a wall. Different floor types can affect the way your footsteps sound. Your gadgets are mostly based around stealth are actually quite creative. Water arrows lets you douse torches to darken a room, moss arrows lets you create soft patches on the ground to walk on to dampen your footsteps, etc. Level design is organic and open ended similar to Deus Ex, giving you more than one way to reach your destintion. If you can get over the outdated graphics (and if you're a real gamer, you should) you'll find that Thief still manages to hold it's own even by today's standards. Solid gameplay, well written story and the atmospheric soundtrack all blend well to create an immersive experience. The game is lengthy enough to keep you playing for quite a while. It's challenging but not unfairly difficult and the lack of a mini map, way points or instant checkpoints shouldn't detract you. It's actually a nice throwback to a time when video games didn't hold your hand as much as it does now. Completing it is very rewarding, especially if you're patient enough to play through and immerse yourself in the whole game and sadly, patience is a trait that most gamers nowaday lack.			"

												A true gem of the past, but still enjoyable even to this day. This game is a masterpiece that inspires exceptional games such as Dishonored.Even with a multitude of handy tools at your disposal, Your mission to break in and steal valuables is by no means easy. It forces you to be creative to survive with minimal hand-holding outside of the tutorial level. This game has clever level design and capable AI to top it off.I can safely recommend this to newcomers and Thief veterans who already owned the original version (like me) alike, because it is a decent release with a much needed compatibility patch to make it run on modern rigs and current Operating System.  Also, it contains some new levels and bug fix not present in the original release of Thief.			"

												Growing up, this was one of my favorite games. I compare it to games like Splinter Cell in the Medieval times. While the game itself was released in 1998, the graphics would be considered outdated in today's standard but they give the game a alternative look when playing it in 2013. What really impressed me about this game was the amount of variables you can control with your weaponry and gadgets and the fact it was made fifteen years ago. Your main character comes equipped with a Sword, Blackjack, and a Bow with a variety of different arrows which really are the focal point of my play style along with a bunch of other gadgets like flash bombs and stuff like that. For example, if you are going for a violent approach within the levels, you can shoot the enemies in the chest with your standard arrow. If you are going for a silent assassin type of approach, you can douse torches with the water arrows, dim the lighted area, and sneak up behind and knockout the enemy with your blackjack. If you are a real pro though, and why this game is called Thief you can go through the whole level/game without killing anything or very few enemies while you steal all the loot that is placed within the levels to buy more gear with.Another great element of this game is the fact they added undead and alienesque creatures in the later levels and it really shows in the difficulty as you progress through the game. There are some minor flaws such as enemy movement getting 'stuck on walls' and things like that but it really doesn't bother me because of how this game has held itself up against the test of time. It is a great addition to anyone's Steam library.			"

												Thief is probably one of those games that gets overlooked. It's a shame because this is probably one of the most memorable, unique, gaming experiences. In 1998, the Dark Engine was ahead of its time. Modern games today would rival Thief with its unique and sprawling levels, its interesting story, and wholly unique gameplay. Being able to truly be free in choice to handle mission objects is fresh, even by today's standards. Sound is an important factor. Dropping in on conversations can lead useful clues. The game boasts some really terrific audio. As good as the audio is the gameplay is where it really shines. I will never forget the first nerve-racking moment where an alerted guard begins sweeping the room, looking for me as I, the player hunch in the shadows praying he doesn't find me. You do have access variety of weapons and gadgets and  your arsenal gives a multiple means to accomplish goals but combat is largely a risky venture. You are a thief, not a warrior. These sort of experiences seem incredibly rare in modern games.In summy, for the cheap price, you are getting an amazing gameplay experience. If you find yourself wanting more, you'll find a fantastic community of dedicated Thief fans over on Thief theCircle. Fans are still creating Fan Missions, and hell, there is even a full blown expansion for Thief 2. Get this game, you won't be disappointed.			"

												This was a gamechanger, in my opinion. Elements from the original Thief would be incorporated in countless games over the coming years. To this day, this title, to me, is one of the most influential games of all time.The plot is unique but takes a few missions to set up. Most of the graphics are on par for the year - nothing special with the exception of the lighting. The game heavily focuses on environments - the light around you, the floors you walk on, the noise of the actions you make. Sound is beautiful in this game - surround sound is a MUST so look into OpenAL or fixes for Creative Alchemy if you need to. Combat is straight forward. The gameplay itself, played as its meant to be played, is strictly about avoiding conflict and remaining undetected. When combat is mandatory, it's usually against nonsentient creatures (undead, magical creatures, etc). Overall, I can recommend this game to -anyone-. It is difficult at times, but it is one of the greatest games of all time.			"

												Great mechanics, good world building, interesting setting. It rewards patience and planning effectively. You can't handle combat very well especially on Expert difficulty, and the game was purely designed around stealth which works well with it's multitude of ways to explore the city. Well crafted atmosphere that easily immerses you, especially as you continue forward. The music really fits the themes of the levels well, and changes depending on where you are. A recommended game not only to appreciate the stealth mechanics and ingenuity of itself, but to appreciate the non-tact story telling and overall craft that went into making this. This is the best game I've ever played.			"

												YES, my favourite game of all times!!!I remember the day I first played the demo of this amazing game. A dark and rainy day, as if it was made for gaming. I finished the demo after 2 hours. I explored as much as possible.And played it through again after finishing.The day the game finally came out I stood up early and was at the shop an hour before they opened to buy that game. I was not disappointed.Since that day I have played ""Thief: the dark project"" more than 30 times. No other game ever made me so addicted. I made 1-2 speedruns for my own, explored the hell out of the game, played every difficulty. I love beeing a stealthy thief... Even my brother still plays it, though most old games he defines as ""ugly junk"".Ok, enough of being a fanboy. Let's go to the core of the game.Technical:You are right if you think that this game is looking old. The game was made in the late 1990s and you can see that games developed quite much since then.(Thanks to a quite active modder-scene several mods have been released that make the game better looking.)In my case I don't care about that, because the game lives by a fascinating atmosphere, not by it's graphics.The sounds are amazing for the time being released. It is quite interesting how ""surround"" the sound is. And well, this game is the example for ""footsteps"". Listening to them you can define how far an enemy is, how loud you are and how much attaction you will get. So leave your stepdance-shoes alone and take the ""sneakers""...Gameplay:The controls work quite good, the stealth system is the best I've seen in a game so far.You should use the shadows (It has some reason the subtittle is ""the DARK project""), avoid noise, steal as much as you can and never be seen by the guards. Else the game will be quite short... So stay in the dark.You will see it takes a lot of patience for this game. Looking for gaps in the patrols, seeking the dark corners of a house, most time hidden. If you love modern shooters do me a favour and buy them, but not THIS game...The ""hud"" of the game has a small bar, that shows you how visible you are. A revolutionary concept in it's release. Did I mention: ""stay in the dark""?Loot is essential to buy stuff for the next level. Every worthy thing you steal will be sold and the money will be added to your funds. Buy a moss-arrow? Go for it. Buy some flash-bombs? Here you go. You need an water arrow to put out torches? You're welcome.Story:Well, I won't spoiler anything here now. You are a thief in the ""middle ages"". Stay in the dark and steal as much as you can. The rest you will see...To come to an end:A great game (in my case THE greatest game of all times) worth buying it (even after so many years)..........Did I mention: Stay in the dark?			"

What I'm getting at is this: with all your money and tech, as well as staff and resourceful customers, why haven't you fixed this yet? How long exactly has Thief Gold been out? Regardless, I find it ridiculous that this is still going on and I, although I should expect this considering all the jokes I've read and heard on HALOLZ.COM, feel cheated out of my money due to the fact that two of the three games seem to be crashing over such a novice issue.

I already owned an CD copy of this game and figured I'd buy it on steam incase the cd ever rotted. So glad this only cost me the price of a cup of coffee.

												YES, my favourite game of all times!!!I remember the day I first played the demo of this amazing game. A dark and rainy day, as if it was made for gaming. I finished the demo after 2 hours. I explored as much as possible.And played it through again after finishing.The day the game finally came out I stood up early and was at the shop an hour before they opened to buy that game. I was not disappointed.Since that day I have played ""Thief: the dark project"" more than 30 times. No other game ever made me so addicted. I made 1-2 speedruns for my own, explored the hell out of the game, played every difficulty. I love beeing a stealthy thief... Even my brother still plays it, though most old games he defines as ""ugly junk"".Ok, enough of being a fanboy. Let's go to the core of the game.Technical:You are right if you think that this game is looking old. The game was made in the late 1990s and you can see that games developed quite much since then.(Thanks to a quite active modder-scene several mods have been released that make the game better looking.)In my case I don't care about that, because the game lives by a fascinating atmosphere, not by it's graphics.The sounds are amazing for the time being released. It is quite interesting how ""surround"" the sound is. And well, this game is the example for ""footsteps"". Listening to them you can define how far an enemy is, how loud you are and how much attaction you will get. So leave your stepdance-shoes alone and take the ""sneakers""...Gameplay:The controls work quite good, the stealth system is the best I've seen in a game so far.You should use the shadows (It has some reason the subtittle is ""the DARK project""), avoid noise, steal as much as you can and never be seen by the guards. Else the game will be quite short... So stay in the dark.You will see it takes a lot of patience for this game. Looking for gaps in the patrols, seeking the dark corners of a house, most time hidden. If you love modern shooters do me a favour and buy them, but not THIS game...The ""hud"" of the game has a small bar, that shows you how visible you are. A revolutionary concept in it's release. Did I mention: ""stay in the dark""?Loot is essential to buy stuff for the next level. Every worthy thing you steal will be sold and the money will be added to your funds. Buy a moss-arrow? Go for it. Buy some flash-bombs? Here you go. You need an water arrow to put out torches? You're welcome.Story:Well, I won't spoiler anything here now. You are a thief in the ""middle ages"". Stay in the dark and steal as much as you can. The rest you will see...To come to an end:A great game (in my case THE greatest game of all times) worth buying it (even after so many years)..........Did I mention: Stay in the dark?			"

												An extremely difficult game when played on hard or higher... A difficult game is a good one, and this game has never failed to dissapoint. My first memories of my gaming era began with this game, right here. The way the sounds you make and the sorounding lighting instantly make you forget everything you know about gaming, and make you learn a completely new style of what we call video games. Can't wait for Thief on PS4, and can only hope it's half as good as this one... But maybe with some better graphics.  ;)			"

												Game is fun, takes little to no space, but I will have to take a point away for the AI.  While there are some challenging AI not all of them are that bright.  For example...you can go up to one guard in the first mission, and stab his friend to death while he asks you who you are and what you're doing there.  Not the ones in the front area as if you take on one of those all 3 will attack you at once, but if you're in a hall and 2 guards are coming from different directions one will stand in a doorway just letting you off his friend/the other guard lol.

												Thief is probably one of those games that gets overlooked. It's a shame because this is probably one of the most memorable, unique, gaming experiences. In 1998, the Dark Engine was ahead of its time. Modern games today would rival Thief with its unique and sprawling levels, its interesting story, and wholly unique gameplay. Being able to truly be free in choice to handle mission objects is fresh, even by today's standards. Sound is an important factor. Dropping in on conversations can lead useful clues. The game boasts some really terrific audio. As good as the audio is the gameplay is where it really shines. I will never forget the first nerve-racking moment where an alerted guard begins sweeping the room, looking for me as I, the player hunch in the shadows praying he doesn't find me. You do have access variety of weapons and gadgets and  your arsenal gives a multiple means to accomplish goals but combat is largely a risky venture. You are a thief, not a warrior. These sort of experiences seem incredibly rare in modern games.In summy, for the cheap price, you are getting an amazing gameplay experience. If you find yourself wanting more, you'll find a fantastic community of dedicated Thief fans over on Thief theCircle. Fans are still creating Fan Missions, and hell, there is even a full blown expansion for Thief 2. Get this game, you won't be disappointed.			"

												Great game! It must be played at night, with the lights turned out and thru speakers to truly appreciate. This particular version does not include the cut scenes, which is a pity, since those scenes really are fun to watch... due to the fact that it can be played in different leves (easy, medium and hard) its replayability is high.

												1st of all: LOL @ people buying a 15+ year old game and complaining about graphics and/or OS-issuesA quick search and you'll find the TG-Tool, which helps a lot. There's also a decent Thief Gold HD Mod out there. But Haters Gonna Hate, so i'll keep focus on the review.So here comes my 'old fart story': I remember, when a friend told me about this ""new game"" and after school he showed me the demo he got from a magazine. I never played a single demo level so many times and i couldn't wait to get the full game. Long story short, it was a great game back then!Fast forward to the new millennium and games with brilliant graphics but (mostly) mediocre gameplay. Nowadays i rarely play games, but when i stumble over a teaser for the new Thief, i checked Steam for the old trilogy and downloaded it without hesitation. What can i say ... i still love it.The game is just awesome and the missions are still brilliant (even my 'steam record' says 0.1 hrs, i played 5 missions on expert level so far) and a lot of fun to play. I'm know, that not every one can play 'slow games' like Thief, so if you're a shooter-loving action-junkie, you probably won't get happy. This game is about waiting in dark corners, sneaking around and being patient.The atmosphere is the best part of the game, so when you play the game while watching TV or browse internet-porn, you won't have much fun either (well, depends what porns you find). But if you have the right setup (dark room & headphones) and the right attitude, you can enjoy one of the best games of all time (and probably the best 'stealth game ever'). "

												Fun old sneaky game younger players would probably prefer Dishonered which got alot of its ideas from the Theif games. This is the gold edition so it comes with extra levels and the thieves guild is one of the worst. Its extreamly long and hard to figure out where you are and where you're supposed to go. also this game will run in steam but the video will not work, the only way I got the game to work properly was to run it in adminster mode. It wont track your time but you'll be able to see the story videos as you play.			"

												I absolutely LOVED this game. There is no other series out on the market that really puts you into the shoes of a masterful thief like this one does. I love the stealth and planning required in this game. You are often dropped into the maps with little hint on what to do, but there are usually multiple ways to go about completing a level which is great. It certainly does not hold your hand like modern games do, and because it is old it also runs perfectly on computers and laptops not made for gaming. If you love the stealth aspect of the game, then higher difficulty settings will work better for you and aso give you more gameplay content to complete. If you can't help but kill some guards/civilians, then the normal difficulty setting is best for you. But the game is still hard even on that mode haha! I definitely recommend learning how to use arrow ropes properly because they will be your best friend in a lot of the later maps/levels. The only problem I really had with this game is that for some reason to cutscenes wouldn't run on my pc, which was a minor inconvenience because I had to go watch them on youtube. This may not be the case for everyone, but after looking it up I know I'm not the only person who had that issue. However, cutscenes aren't too important if all you care about is the gameplay itself. Overall, I'd give this game a 9.5/10.			"

												I absolutely LOVE Thief` however this issue I have with a Buff Len 80, or whatever it is, completely refrains me from even completing the mission after obtaining the objective. Now I understand you guys have ALOT on your hands right now, but I'm seeing a large number of people using this patch 1.19 or TafferPatch that. What I'm getting at is this: with all your money and tech, as well as staff and resourceful customers, why haven't you fixed this yet? How long exactly has Thief Gold been out? Regardless, I find it ridiculous that this is still going on and I, although I should expect this considering all the jokes I've read and heard on HALOLZ.COM, feel cheated out of my money due to the fact that two of the three games seem to be crashing over such a novice issue. Please, for the love of God, patch Thief Gold and Thief 2 and get rid of this godforsaken issue...			"

												Released in 1999 Thief Gold is the re-release of 1998's Thief: The Dark Project the wonderful game from the sadly now defunct Looking Glass Studios.  Originally Thief was known as Dark Camelot and intended to be an action RPG type of game and you can see throughout this game where they recycled content from that original game - ie medieval influenced missions.  it later morphed into Dark Project when they found that the stealth aspect (championed by Paul Neurath) was a lot more entertaining and that a game involving stealth and thievery would be a better option.Rather than being a straight re-issue of the game it was an early form of what we now know as GOTY editions. It includes 3 extra levels: The Mage Towers, The Thieves Guild and Song of the Caverns.  In addition to extra missions it also tweaked the standard missions some minor tweaks in most and then a couple of levels receiving reworking notably The Sword (added more area - ie Little Big World), Undercover (story changes), The Lost City (enemy and story changes) and Down in the Bonehoard is retextured.  Furthermore Thief Gold moves the version up to 1.37 from T:DP's final version of v1.33.  On the old discs you also got a preview of Thief II and of course the additional mission the Blooper Reel (Lord Baffords Manor featuring entertaining bugs and humorous content)At present the cut scenes do not function on some systems, notably Windows 7, there are various work arounds available - they can be found over at ttlg.com (file is called Tfix_1.18c) or if you so wish you can always Youtube the Thief cut scenes.  I highly recommend you watch the cut scenes, not only do they advance the story and reveal a lot of twists and turns related to it but they are also beautifully crafted and remain a joy to watch.The concept of Thief is simple, achieve the mission objectives by the use of stealth.  Stealth in this game pertains to use of shadows, sound and movement.  To aid you in this you have a light gem in the lower section of the screen that indicates the amount of light you are currently exposed in.  Sound is highly important and was one of the first games, if not the first where sound was just as important as what you could see.  Footsteps on varied surfaces, the sound of patrolling guards and ambient noise all add a rich and extra layer of gameplay.  You need to take these elements and work within them or bend them to your favour to achieve your objectives.The game is set within The City, a steampunkish type era, like the Victorian era on the cusp of industrialisation.  The City itself is moody, bleak and dangerous, the perfect playground for the adventurous. There are several factions within The City all vying for control, the mysterious Baron of the City remains aloof, a figure of power and control but not involved directly.  The ambience of The City is beautiful and it's success is largely due to the presentation of The City, both aurally and visually. The story that unwinds also fleshes out The City.Comparisons can be made to Dunwall from Dishonoured and Dishonoured does indeed play like a Thief game and has that ambience, albeit the focus is on assassination and not on stealth and theft.  Dunwall though is the victim of politics that goes up to the highest level, The City feels more alive though.   There is no apocalyptic plague sweeping the streets and the highest power is not overtly tyrannical but the various factions do give ""layers"" to The City, it feels like it has more depth and soul than Dunwall ever had, it is an entity in itself.The visuals are nothing exciting but they are effective enough.  The sound though is truly a thing of sublime beauty.  This is the first game where it was essential to have sound enabled and if possible to have a dedicated sound card (that again has kind of died out thanks to integrated sound on motherboards).  From the fabulous sound ambience to the classical Loot sound it is all very stylised and very integral to the Thief experience.  It must be said that the talents of the voice actor for Garrett, Mr Stephen Russell truly stand out as one of the greatest in gaming. He gives Garrett the very jaded, near misanthropic character that makes the game feel so immersive.  Garrett feels like what you would expect to be a product of hard life within The City it is conveyed wonderfully.  It is wonderful to hear Garrett go into his internal monologues during missions, throwing story, character and enjoyment at you.  Be warned though after sneaking through a level only hearing footsteps and ambience you may jump off of your chair in fright the first time his voice unexpectedly booms out at you. The difficulty levels change objectives and throw in variables such as not killing anyone and collecting a certain minimum amount of loot. At the easier difficulty levels it can be easy to roll in and kill all the enemies in a level, but by far the biggest challenge is to play on the Expert setting and try to adhere to the rules of Ghosting - ie don't let anyone see you, leave things as you found them (except for things you need to loot to achieve the objectives), don't knock anyone out even relock doors you pass through etc.. By and large the rules of Ghosting are self-imposed, a fun challenge to yourself, but a rewarding one.  Consider the missions (levels) to be a big playground at your disposal.The controls are standard controls for the era and you may find you will want to tweak them to match what you are used to playing today - ie alternating strafe and lean keys for instance and changing the walk and backwards buttons etc.  Combat is straightforward - use your bow to snipe targets or to shoot a variety of specialty arrows - water arrows to douse torches, moss arrows to soften the noise on surfaces, rope arrows to climb to other areas, fire arrows to destroy things, broad head to kill enemies/make a noise, noisemaker arrows to create a distraction etc..  The Sword play is simple, space to block and primary attack to swing the sword.  Hold it down for a stronger strike. By far the most useful tool though is the Blackjack.  This item is used to render guards unconscious.  Slip up behind a guard raise your blackjack and then bring it down upon their head.  Then get rid of the unconscious body - be aware that placing a body near a fireplace or in even a small amount of water will probably result in death to the unconscious party - bad if you are trying to achieve a no-kill objective.  So while dumping that body into an unlit fireplace may seem great, it won't be if a servant comes and lights it up :PAt the time of release the original Thief was described as a sneak 'em up (as opposed to shoot 'em up) and it is the precursor of all stealth games that you see today.  The graphics have not aged well, mods can fix that if you so choose and the controls can be quite archaic. But the story remains as beautiful as ever and there is a great deal of satisfaction to be garnered from this game. The reboot of the series, Thief, is to be released soon and while the reboot doesn't follow on from these stories - it certainly seems to take ideas from the series.If you enjoy stealth games, games with an interesting story and enjoy a challenge, then Thief: Gold is a game for you.  It does look dated now but it remains as enjoyable as ever to play.  Make sure you apply the fixes to get the cutscenes working (and improved resolution options) to really improve the gameplay experience for you. Tweak the controls as you need and you should find yourself become immersed in the depths of The City very quickly.  From the first time you pickpocket a guard of a key, hear that chiming loot sound or even your first close shave with your heart pounding in your throat you will be hooked on the game.  It really is a gem of gaming. "

												Thief is the pinnacle stealth game. Presumed to be the first stealth title to use shadows as a form of hiding from the enemy. The controls still hold up to this day, but the graphics haven't aged well, some of the characters look like coneheads. Either way, the dialog from the npc's is fantastically written and the plot development of Garret's venture as a professional Thief starts from basic robberies to religion conspiracy. A worthwhile title of being one of the greatest stealth games of all time.9.3/10			"

												Sure this game is old, but its gameplay isn't dated— far from it, in fact.  This is pure stealth gameplay, and in contrast to the action-packed stealth games, such as Metal Gear Solid, Thief is much slower-paced, and there is much more emphasis on staying hidden.  Staying out of sight and keeping quiet, or a quick arrow from the shadows— you can play in your own style and steal as much as you can.With Thief 4 right around the corner, I hope some people will come back to the series's roots and give this game a try.

												Fantastic, even so many years later. The game WILL try your patience because rushing in will get you killed fast and stealth will see you through more. It has a very engaging story and awesome environment (one of the few times steampunk actually WORKS as a theme) and Stephen Russell's occasional retorts as Garrett are very amusing. BUY THIS, and be sure to install the fan made widescreen patch.			"

I enjoy this game and I haven't even played that much of it, its open to any style of play but charging gets ya killed.

												Thief Gold is a really interesting game. It was one of the first stealth games and has an engaging storyline. Thief Gold is an enhanced version of Thief: The Dark Project released in  1998. Thief Gold was released a year later and added 3 new levels into the game and bug fixes. This game is really worth your money and loads of fun.			"

My first memories of my gaming era began with this game, right here. The way the sounds you make and the sorounding lighting instantly make you forget everything you know about gaming, and make you learn a completely new style of what we call video games. Can't wait for Thief on PS4, and can only hope it's half as good as this one... But maybe with some better graphics.  ;)			"

												It is amazing to see how such a well crafted game still holds up to our modern gaming society through the amazingly constructed environment with smart and big level maps.  I personally found the game quite long.  Each level is just as the other (These levels can be massive!!!), walk into a building/area, each unique to one another, just to find that there a multiple ways to complete most of the quests.  For example, steal a key from a guard, open the front doors, overhear a guard talk about a back entrance, or find a hidden passage which you heard from a diary within this environment.  The possibilities are endless!!! I highly recemend this game also because it is such a revolutionary title.  This game is the first game to apply lighting and sound to the stealth franchise.  Great consept even though the story may be lacking and the dialog sound terrible. The combat is perposefully bad since this game highly supports the idea of stealth and making sure npcs do not even realize your are there.  I personally highly recemend this game to anyone who loves playing classic games, who loves taking their time and thinking things through, who just wants to play a revolutionary game, and wouldn't mind to get their butt kicked in the process through this games purposeful difficulty.

EDIT: The text below was written before Steam Recommendations became Steam Reviews.Thief is a masterpiece in its genre, that's a fact. It was released in 1998 and can compete with many modern games that have a similar concept. Great story, truly amazing music and cutscenes, steampunk vibe, scary locations and enemies. I remember when I was a kid (like Garrett, the protagonist when he tried to rob the Keeper) I couldn't play the game because I was so afraid of zombies that couldn't be killed without using holy water. Even now I had problems, maybe not with zombies but with spiders. There are so many of them throughout the game and even though the graphics are outdated they are as horrid as in the real world. The Gold version adds a couple of new missions that are of very high quality like the rest of the game. Thief is a FPS game, it's possible to kill/knock unconcious every enemy the player meets, but it requires a lot of patience and cunning. Thief is scary and weird, but the efforts are always rewarded. Steal from the rich and give to yourself!			"

												Patch it first: http://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=134733I had to add this because the cutscenes don't work for some reason when you launch the game. It's a simple patch, though, just download it, locate the game listed under your directory, and TFix does the rest for you. Do I think this game should be released without problems like the cutscenes simply not working? Yes, I do. Do I think it deserves a bad review? No, just because the cutscenes don't work doesn't mean this game should be flagged as one to be avoided. That's really the only problem I had, and even if there wasn't a patch for it I'd still recommend this game because it's really just a minute issue in my opinion. The gameplay itself is pretty solid, and for its time the stealth mechanics were incredible before stealth in video games was even popularized. Overall, the game is pretty definitive of a first person stealth game centered on a steampunk setting done right. Looking Glass Studios basically demonstrate how they were an underrated development team with an overwhelming amount of talent.			"

												In the small genre of stealth there is only a handfull of truly great games. Not only is this game one of the original classics but also one of the best(including the 2nd&3rd) if not THE best. The game takes place in a world that is a mixture of gothic fantasy, steampunk and, sort of 1600s- 1800s Europe. No guns though! But that's a good thing. this world includes all kinds of monsters, creatures and different types of humans. Most humans are designed to be a hilarious sort rather than serious. Events and lore are explained in 4 main ways: from cutscenes that have a awesome and beautiful 2D art style. Letters and books. The main character also comments on things himself, his name is Garret and has a witty sarcastic sort of tone and is a joy to listen to. And finally you can listen to other people talking both to themselves and others to learn things provided you are  sneaky and dont disturb them. The writing is suberb and really adds to the game, you actually want to listen and read. The voice acting is brilliant both the serious and humorous. Even the monsters sound awesome and some cases horrifying. The game and two sequels are full of atmosphere, the music, the sounds, the lighting is all done so well. Still to this day have some of the best sound design. At many points this game feels like a horror game which many ""actual"" horror games cant even  say. The guards will sometimes go off on a tirade about random stuff which adds a lot of charm and shows how much fun the developers had making this game. There's also a few different factions you meet, the Pagans who are nature worshipers, very occult stuff, the Hammerites basically medieval Christians and the keepers who i wont say anything about. Very interesting and different all of them. Now onto the meat of the game. The level design and the gameplay. So in Thief before every mission you will get a overview of what will be in store and then have the ability to use the shop where you can buy all sorts of things using the money you collected in the last mission so it helps to be a perfectionist and get most of the loot. You can even purchase tips if you think you will need some help. The game has several difficulties, i highly recommend the highest for all 3 games. It wont be insanely hard for you, just gotta be patient and plan out your stealth. The levels are fairly big and have many paths, they're also quite varied so you won't get tired of them. When it comes to your gear, you have a blackjack for knocking people out, a sword for combat which you'd prefer to avoid, it's not like dishonored, Garret is no amazing superhero. You also have a bow with standard arrows, along with some magic ones, water arrows for putting out fire, fire arrows for destroying stuff and killing, and moss arrows so you dont make too much noise on harder surfaces. You go through the mission always looking for the main objective but depending the place Garret will also mention other things you might want to check out, grab, or do. Sometimes will find bonus side events or objectives while looking around. It all works really well! When it comes down to it, just explore a cool level full of thick atmosphere and steal things! Even today the game itself looks fine, levels have a pretty and interesting art design. Although the Ai at times can be stupid and very easy to exploit which i only recommend trying after playing at least one time legit. Overall the game is a fun, memorable stealth game that feels like an adventure, sometimes fantasy, sometimes horror. And has huge replay value. I can't recommend this enough, they truly don't make them like this anymore. And if you like this one i recommend the 2nd and 3rd game. Thief 2: The Metal Age and Theif 3: Deadly Shadows. They change some things in those games but the core writing and gameplay is there.			"

But I had no money. :-(  So I grew up, and years later I bought a Thief bundle on Steam. It's been great catching up. This game plays well and it's easy to pick up and play even now.

												This is essentially the original stealth game for most people. Even though the game may have a small amount of missions which is 15 or so there is still an absolutely HUGE amount of secrets to find and things to steal. Along with it being an amazing stealth game, it was one of the first to use lighting for stealth and using sound to find enemies and guards. If your willing to ignore how it looks compared to todays games, you'll see why the newest game is being criticized so much. And since its cheap, there's no reason why you couldn't afford it.			"

												First-person stealth set in consistent, sprawling maps that allow the player to truly decide their own approach. A rich and believable world through brilliant design untouched by the technical limitations of its time. The lack of guidance adds to the suspense, but can be daunting for players used to the follow-the-arrows type of gameplay mainly seen nowadays. This remains, however, a timeless classic and a great game for fans of sneaky-sneaky, stabby-stabby.			"

												Theif Gold is definately one of my favorite games of all time. Although the technology is somewhat dated the developers ingeniously used the concept of stealth to assist the player in maneuvering past the guards without being spotted. If your new to games like these, it will take plently of practice to master. However, if you master the basics and complete your first level, complete satisfaction is guaranteed. Whatever you steal turns into gold so you can purchase items such as broadhead arrows, fire arrows, and health potions. Cool stuff huh?			"

												Got an ♥♥♥ beating for sucking at stealth.Why is that a good thing? Because I now know that I never really understood stealth games or how to properly play one until I played this.If you can get past the old graphics and sometimes clunky movements (it's actually really nice for a game from 1998), the game has some really nice mechanics that make it pretty unique. For example sound and its relation to your surroundings and movements in the game really play a big part in how stealthy you are. The setting and the story is also quite interesting.And unlike a lot of games that are being released in current and recent times, this game does not hold your hand. It'll teach you the basics of sneaking and moving around, and then leave you to fend and figure things out for yourself. Your character is not O.P'ed. And by that I mean even though you're given a sword in this game, Garrett can't fight for ♥♥♥♥. Which, as bad as that sounds, is great because I think that actually really enhances the gameplay and atmosphere.This game is definitely replayable.Using the thief patch that is available online is definitely recommended when playing as it fixes certain glitches and allows for slightly clearer graphics and options.

												Thief is a glorious game no matter what age you are, or date it is.The first of many games that taught us - not through words, but actions - to hide. Not to fight and be an unrealistic dual weapon wielding juggernaut, but to negotiate your way stealthily through levels, as a true Thief would. Thief is undoubtedly the father to many excellent stealth games such as Splinter Cell, and does not merit the fame or praise it rightly deserves from many. Also noteworthy is our narrator and protagonist, Garrett - easily one of my favourite protagonists for his little monologues now and again.			"

												As one of the first 3D stealth games, Thief Gold does a surprising number of things really well, even after only 5 missions. Dynamic lighting combines with an amazing stereo sound (get a headset) to create an intuitive atmosphere, where you're sneaking from shadow to cover, nicking things and conking guards on the head. Levels are huge, exploration is huge (no invisible walls), and the tools/arrows you have are large and varied. Top it up with a spooky, tense soundtrack and you have a real gem.It's not all great: graphics are ofc 1998, enemy AI isn't perfect (enemies don't notice patrolling guards go missing or torches going out), the Steam version doesn't show cutscenes (which is what Youtube's for), you backtrack a bunch, item menu is a bit clunky, but all these minor setbacks don't stop it from being a great game. It takes a while to get into, but if you love nicking someone's bag of coins before whacking him on the head, it's well worth $10.Thief Gold: cus u steal gold :-)			"

												The beggining of the true stealth genre. It is definitely dated, I won't deny it, but that doesn't mean that it's bad. The story line starts here, but if you had to play one of the thief series and only one, it wouldn't be this game, it would be the second game Thief2			"

												Growing up, this was one of my favorite games. I compare it to games like Splinter Cell in the Medieval times. While the game itself was released in 1998, the graphics would be considered outdated in today's standard but they give the game a alternative look when playing it in 2013. What really impressed me about this game was the amount of variables you can control with your weaponry and gadgets and the fact it was made fifteen years ago. Your main character comes equipped with a Sword, Blackjack, and a Bow with a variety of different arrows which really are the focal point of my play style along with a bunch of other gadgets like flash bombs and stuff like that. For example, if you are going for a violent approach within the levels, you can shoot the enemies in the chest with your standard arrow. If you are going for a silent assassin type of approach, you can douse torches with the water arrows, dim the lighted area, and sneak up behind and knockout the enemy with your blackjack. If you are a real pro though, and why this game is called Thief you can go through the whole level/game without killing anything or very few enemies while you steal all the loot that is placed within the levels to buy more gear with.Another great element of this game is the fact they added undead and alienesque creatures in the later levels and it really shows in the difficulty as you progress through the game. There are some minor flaws such as enemy movement getting 'stuck on walls' and things like that but it really doesn't bother me because of how this game has held itself up against the test of time. It is a great addition to anyone's Steam library.			"

												It is archaic and looks weird as ♥♥♥♥, but even to this day there's nothing out there that is as engrossing, tense, and involving. There is no other feeling like sneaking around the mansion and lifting everything that can be sold and then giggling like a schoolgirl on weed as you run away with your ill-gotten gains. And guess what: The sequel is even better.More info: http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/544-Thief-The-Dark-Project "

												Theif Gold is definately one of my favorite games of all time. Although the technology is somewhat dated the developers ingeniously used the concept of stealth to assist the player in maneuvering past the guards without being spotted. If your new to games like these, it will take plently of practice to master. However, if you master the basics and complete your first level, complete satisfaction is guaranteed. Whatever you steal turns into gold so you can purchase items such as broadhead arrows, fire arrows, and health potions. Cool stuff huh?			"

												Thief Gold is one of the few games of its kind. Even though I can't say I enjoyed every second I played, I consider it a masterpiece. By modern standards, the game is broken. During some stealth missions, you have to stay well hidden, but not because you will fail the mission if you get discovered; the combat system is built on such primitive mechanics that your dignity will be severely damaged.Yet, what is it so good about the game? Well, everything, even the bad parts. It is incredible how they managed to put everything into a formula that works like a charm. The atmosphere is wonderful and the story is amazingly well narrated.Do I recommend it? YES. Everyone should try to complete the game at least once, on Normal difficulty level, preferably without a walkthrough.			"

												This is a true stealth game where missions are restricted by not killing or not being seen for violating those means mission failed. The A.I is the best thing in this game they can hear the noise you make they investigate sounds or try to find bodies. The best thing about the game is the A.I doesn't magically find you like in 'DISHONORED' where when you make a sound they all know your hiding location! Anyways the problem with the game is that its buggy in windows 7 latest update. It worked fine before but after I updated windows 7 it stoped working. So I am using my old copy of windows xp in virtualbox an open source virtual desktop. So I simply ran the game within the virtualbox & it ran smoothly. Note I cpmpleted the game several times I just owned the CD since its release date but the CD well is broken so got it from here.			"

												This game i really REALLY love, its ALWAYS about stealth and its in first person view. I never EVER come across a game that involves stealth and sneakiness. Probably my first game that would involve using stealth the whole game. I never got bored of it and it never disappointed me. Buy this game, the story really knows how to keep it rolling. Whats even better? Some horror levels. I even thought it'll be just a ""sneak through guards and steal stuff"" game. But NO, it involves stealing something from undead, magicians, or even god. This game REALLY knows how to pack a punch. Really worth the payment. If you think you are crafty and impressive, try your shot on this on highest difficulty. It may even be the worth of your time.

												Hey you, yes you, that guy who won't even consider the thief games cause thier graphics are outdated. This gaming series practically invented mondern stealth systems and if stealth mechanics of games like dishonored apeal to you then it is in your interest to reconsider these games. Every mission is interesting and the settings captivating, whether you listen to a madman underneath an opera house or explore a large mansion that slowly warps into a realm of chaos. Be warned though, stealth is king here, marble floors and metal walkways are as much an enemy as the monsters who tread them.			"

												YES, my favourite game of all times!!!I remember the day I first played the demo of this amazing game. A dark and rainy day, as if it was made for gaming. I finished the demo after 2 hours. I explored as much as possible.And played it through again after finishing.The day the game finally came out I stood up early and was at the shop an hour before they opened to buy that game. I was not disappointed.Since that day I have played ""Thief: the dark project"" more than 30 times. No other game ever made me so addicted. I made 1-2 speedruns for my own, explored the hell out of the game, played every difficulty. I love beeing a stealthy thief... Even my brother still plays it, though most old games he defines as ""ugly junk"".Ok, enough of being a fanboy. Let's go to the core of the game.Technical:You are right if you think that this game is looking old. The game was made in the late 1990s and you can see that games developed quite much since then.(Thanks to a quite active modder-scene several mods have been released that make the game better looking.)In my case I don't care about that, because the game lives by a fascinating atmosphere, not by it's graphics.The sounds are amazing for the time being released. It is quite interesting how ""surround"" the sound is. And well, this game is the example for ""footsteps"". Listening to them you can define how far an enemy is, how loud you are and how much attaction you will get. So leave your stepdance-shoes alone and take the ""sneakers""...Gameplay:The controls work quite good, the stealth system is the best I've seen in a game so far.You should use the shadows (It has some reason the subtittle is ""the DARK project""), avoid noise, steal as much as you can and never be seen by the guards. Else the game will be quite short... So stay in the dark.You will see it takes a lot of patience for this game. Looking for gaps in the patrols, seeking the dark corners of a house, most time hidden. If you love modern shooters do me a favour and buy them, but not THIS game...The ""hud"" of the game has a small bar, that shows you how visible you are. A revolutionary concept in it's release. Did I mention: ""stay in the dark""?Loot is essential to buy stuff for the next level. Every worthy thing you steal will be sold and the money will be added to your funds. Buy a moss-arrow? Go for it. Buy some flash-bombs? Here you go. You need an water arrow to put out torches? You're welcome.Story:Well, I won't spoiler anything here now. You are a thief in the ""middle ages"". Stay in the dark and steal as much as you can. The rest you will see...To come to an end:A great game (in my case THE greatest game of all times) worth buying it (even after so many years)..........Did I mention: Stay in the dark?			"

												As one of the first 3D stealth games, Thief Gold does a surprising number of things really well, even after only 5 missions. Dynamic lighting combines with an amazing stereo sound (get a headset) to create an intuitive atmosphere, where you're sneaking from shadow to cover, nicking things and conking guards on the head. Levels are huge, exploration is huge (no invisible walls), and the tools/arrows you have are large and varied. Top it up with a spooky, tense soundtrack and you have a real gem.It's not all great: graphics are ofc 1998, enemy AI isn't perfect (enemies don't notice patrolling guards go missing or torches going out), the Steam version doesn't show cutscenes (which is what Youtube's for), you backtrack a bunch, item menu is a bit clunky, but all these minor setbacks don't stop it from being a great game. It takes a while to get into, but if you love nicking someone's bag of coins before whacking him on the head, it's well worth $10.Thief Gold: cus u steal gold :-)			"

												This is essentially the original stealth game for most people. Even though the game may have a small amount of missions which is 15 or so there is still an absolutely HUGE amount of secrets to find and things to steal. Along with it being an amazing stealth game, it was one of the first to use lighting for stealth and using sound to find enemies and guards. If your willing to ignore how it looks compared to todays games, you'll see why the newest game is being criticized so much. And since its cheap, there's no reason why you couldn't afford it.			"

With so many ways to tackle a level and the amount of frustration you'll feel when playing it is staggering. Sometimes you're just going to have to stop and plan how you do the mission itself.

												1st of all: LOL @ people buying a 15+ year old game and complaining about graphics and/or OS-issuesA quick search and you'll find the TG-Tool, which helps a lot. There's also a decent Thief Gold HD Mod out there. But Haters Gonna Hate, so i'll keep focus on the review.So here comes my 'old fart story': I remember, when a friend told me about this ""new game"" and after school he showed me the demo he got from a magazine. I never played a single demo level so many times and i couldn't wait to get the full game. Long story short, it was a great game back then!Fast forward to the new millennium and games with brilliant graphics but (mostly) mediocre gameplay. Nowadays i rarely play games, but when i stumble over a teaser for the new Thief, i checked Steam for the old trilogy and downloaded it without hesitation. What can i say ... i still love it.The game is just awesome and the missions are still brilliant (even my 'steam record' says 0.1 hrs, i played 5 missions on expert level so far) and a lot of fun to play. I'm know, that not every one can play 'slow games' like Thief, so if you're a shooter-loving action-junkie, you probably won't get happy. This game is about waiting in dark corners, sneaking around and being patient.The atmosphere is the best part of the game, so when you play the game while watching TV or browse internet-porn, you won't have much fun either (well, depends what porns you find). But if you have the right setup (dark room & headphones) and the right attitude, you can enjoy one of the best games of all time (and probably the best 'stealth game ever'). "

												This is the start of the series that really birthed the stealth genre, and it's still one of the best stealth games you can buy.

If you can look past the outdated graphics, you'll find a game experience full of atmosphere, intrigue, and suspense, that rewards methodical players. And after you're done, try to think of interesting ways to go back through and beat the levels(i.e. knock out all guards and throw them into water to drown!).  Highly suggest playing the other games in the series as well...third one is the ""worst"" of the series, but still decent, and the reboot ""Thief"" (4th installment) is excellent.

												I haven't finished the game yet, I'm trying to make it last. A ""pros and cons"" breakdown isn't working for me for this, so let's call this ""Observations on Thief Gold Thus Far"":Thief Gold got stealth right. The invisibility that some games call ""stealth"" for thieves, rogues and what have you, the standing in broad daylight directly in an enemy's eyeline and practically under their nose, without cover, and going unseen because a skill score is high enough, just doesn't do it for me. Actual invisibililty doing that is fine, that's a separate beast, but it doesn't feel like ""skill"" when it works that way. In Thief, there's an element of logic to stealth; the character Garrett has some training that's meant to make him better at it than the average Joe, and there's some limited tools (including improvised ones) to help, but stealth's otherwise based on player skill and common sense, not on a stat score. If you decide to waltz Garrett right in front of a guard in a well-lit room, better get those track shoes laced up tight!Thief is a game that uses sound well. Not just for ambience and effect, but for clues, and also as a warning that you're walking into trouble -- or that trouble's about to walk into you. Normally I have videos or music or maybe an audiobook going in the background when playing a game solo, but Thief plays best horror-game style: with the sound turned up and no distractions.If you hate mazelike levels and ""maps"" that are a few next to useless scribbles, this might not be the game for you. The thing is... I've never been a fan myself of bumbling around trying to find my way from X to Y in games where a single level goes well over the one-hour mark of wondering what I'm missing. (Or two hours; I admit it, I could get lost in my own backyard.)  But in Thief Gold, wandering around trying to get to my next goal has yet to make me want to stop playing -- take a break and come back fresh, yes, that's helped, but not quit for good -- or resort to looking up walkthroughs. With one exception, where I looked up just enough to be sure I wasn't up against a game glitch rather than a challenge (I wasn't), and then hastily closed the page. I'm not afraid to use game walkthroughs to get past a portion of a game that just isn't fun, or to drop a game that's become mostly the ""not fun"" bits, so it says something in Thief's favor that even with help at my fingertips, I didn't want to use it and I'm still playing the game. I think it's that there's stuff besides the way to the next main goal to find that makes the difference, be it shiny loot, a bit of overheard NPC dialogue, or a scene or a document that tells a piece of a story. (Documents aren't overdone in Thief by the way, and cutscenes are mostly a thing relegated to the beginnings and ends of levels where I'd say they belong. Instead, there are places where things can be heard as Garrett approaches, be it a conversation between NPCs, or... other things I'm not going to spoil...) It feels like there's actually stuff to find besides that which checks off the little boxes on the Objectives page, and that's nice. This is the other aspect of Thief that made a high-def mod nice to have.   So for the price, even if mazelike layouts aren't your favorite thing, I'd say it's still worth giving it a try.On looting the place:  Oh, how proud I was upon finishing a level, thinking I'd patiently and persistently gotten ALL the loot in that level! That lasted until I checked the Stats at the level-complete screen and learned I'd gotten three-fifths of the loot at best. *Bwaahh-bwaahh*... It was refreshing, after a number of more recent games left me feeling like the designers had forgotten how to challenge the player in ways besides beefing enemy health and damage, or allowing AI opponents to ""cheat the system"" for an advantage. (Or the ultimate challenge-designing cop-out in my eyes, counting on online PVP modes to provide the bulk of challenge in a game -- in which opponents cheating the system, because it's the lazy way to win, is often even more of an issue than with AI.) Thief is a solo game that doesn't feel like it has to cheat to challenge me, and I admire that about it. I also like that looting every last shiny object is optional, and that the nature of the character -- a thief -- encourages weighing pragmatic survival considerations against the fact he's, well, a thief, which makes looting the place a survival consideration too. After spending awhile huddled in a tiny cupboard while a guard stomped about just inches away, growling about what happens to thieves when they're caught, and having taken so many risks already, would Garrett leave with what he's got? Or look for more? Or stalk that guard, cosh him, stuff him in that very same cupboard, and then look for more? I had surprisingly little trouble getting the game running on a recent computer despite its age, so props to whoever may have had a hand in that. I'm having a lot of fun finally playing Thief Gold, if that's not already evident; it's a game I missed out on when it was new, and it's proving worth the wait.			"

												This is one of the first and best stealth first person shooter games ever made.  It's a shame there wasn't more done with the franchise.  Thief I and II both seem to line up game playwise but it started to fall apart after that.  It's a ton of fun and the storyline is great!  There's also a lot of community made mini games and levels you can download too!			"

												Shortly put? This is one of the best stealth games that you will ever play.But for those who want more than that:Gameplay: Let's put it like this: If I was ever going to become a thief and steal anything that's not nailed down in a fortified palace, I imagine it would feel pretty damn like Thief Gold. What I love about the stealth in this game is that it's realistic. While a game like Metal Gear Solid decks you out with a soliton radar and boots that make no noise whatsoever, Thief forces you to rely on your own senses and instinct. You must lean to see enemies around a corner. You must be aware of the surfaces you walk on, as certain surfaces make more noise than others. You must freaking press your ears against doors to HEAR if there's an enemy in the other room! It's absolutely fantastic and incredibly enjoyable. 10/10Soundtrack:Not so much a soundtrack, more like ambience. It makes sense that blaring music would feel intrinsically wrong in a stealth game and Thief realises this, so music is kept to a minimal. Where there is music however, it perfectly suits the scenario- case in point the mission in the opera house. On the other hand, there are instances where the same loud music is repeated again and again, and you find stealth has suddenly become much harder: in a negative way this time (case in point- the freaking first part of the downwind thieves guild mission). 7/10Story: Captivating. The first few missions feel, admittedly, a little disjointed and unrelated, but eventually the main plot reveals itself and it is a spectacle to behold. I for one very much enjoyed it. 8/10Extra content:Thief Gold improves on The Dark Project in that it brings three new missions. One completely unrelated to the story and two that fit nicely into the story (The mages tower mission is probably the best mission in the game!) 9/10Overall: See the first few sentences of this recommendation. 10/10			"

												Thief gold is an interesting and well created game that has ultimatley created mixed feelings within me. Ill start my review of with some pros and cons:Pros:          -Great level design        - Challenging levels        - somewhat interesting story        - A wide variety of tools and weapons that can help you during each level        - The game has good lenghCons:         - Dated graphics         - clunky controls         - You have to install a patch in order to play the cutscenes          - occasional glitches         - can often get lost within levelsFor me persoanlly the game started off very fun, I enjoyed sneaking into mansions and castle like structures, exploring, making sure I was collecting as much loot as possible and discovering the stories and lore the game has to hold. However towards the end of the game the levels started to be less about stealing and more about escaping and saving the world in which thief takes place. These levels are filled with ridiculously op enemies which are difficult to sneak past due to the rather confusing level design and the lack of recources. Apart from this, 'Thief Gold' is one of the best stealth games ive ever played and has become one of my most favourite games to date.Overall: 9/10			"

												It's a bit out of date, and it's age shows, but this game started it all and it's still damn good. Unlike most, I believe Thief II is far superior. However, that doesn't deter from the fact that Thief: The Dark Project is a damn near perfect title with one of the best narratives in the series and huge levels. This is the Thief Gold variant of the game, which is only a minor improvement, but is the definitve version. When it comes to Thief, the GOG versions are far more modern,  but it isn't difficult to update the Steam version. Still, highly recommended.			"

												If you don't buy this you're a taffer!Thief is a first person stealth game about a master-theif taught from the clan of the Keepers. You are hired to carry out many thefts for your clan.Garret is a master-thief, borne from shadows to steal from the rich, taught in the ways of picking locks and blacjacks. You as the player focus upon completing Garret's missions involving a clan that you work for, as contract work and fufillment. Thief's gameplay is based mainly on exploration and careful preparation and use of your equipment, to take out lights with arrowheads made of water and grass to mask light and sound of your footsteps, travel on ground covered with moss and use your blackjack to knock guards unconcious for their keys.

												Tired of saving the world, battling enemy armies, exploring galaxies? Do you want to experience something different? Do you want to do something you shouldn't be doing? Go somewhere you shouldn't be? Do you want to play a game that had a huge influence on video games design and stood the test of time?This absolute gem of a stealth game from Looking Glass Studios (who are responsible for games like System Shock and Ultima Underworld) wasn't meant to have stealth mechanics until few months away from the game's release!It’s one of the first FPS in which you are expected to be quick, sneaky and avoid enemies at all cost and not go guns blazing. This is a brilliant piece of game design. Amazing sound engine that is more advanced than most of the engines in games today. It runs great on modern hardware thanks to unofficial patch TFix. You simply have to play the game on headphones and turn on OpenAL and EAX. It puts modern games to shame.The game world has it’s logic and exprects you to follow it. You can’t move through a corridor because you make too much noise walking on the marble floors? Use moss to muffle your steps. You can’t sneak because the room is well lit and the guards will spot you? Use water arrow to put out torches. The path is set out. How you choose to reach the destination is really up to you.Garret, the game’s protagonist, doesn’t want to save the world. All he wants is to be left alone and get on with his life. He want to use his skills to steal loot. And there’s plenty of it hidden throughout the levels. Without spoiling the plot … Garret and his master thief skills get him into something much bigger than he ever anticipated.Amazing atmosphere, various items to help you during heists and well designed missions (mansions, cathedral, mines, prison) that can be explored in several different ways. You completed the game? The internet will provide you with multiple fan-made missions that will keep you busy until you pick up … Thief II.It's simply a masterful game that let's you become a master thief. I can’t imagine what stealth game genre would look like if it weren’t for Looking Glass Studios and their Thief: The Dark Project. I played this game when it was released and having hundreds hours under my belt I can safely say this game is still as immersive now as it was in 1998.Solid 9/10  "

												Deep, riveting and almost head-crushingly intense at times, Thief The Dark Project is one of the best stealth games ever made. The punishing difficulty and the occasional combat-orientated level may throw some players off, but Thief is otherwise a masterpiece of stealth gameplay.			"

												Quite possibly one of the greatest steath games of all time - and despite being almost 14 years old, it holds up remarkably well and features elements that you just don't see enough of in steath games these days - atmosphere and freedom.Any and all fans of steath gameplay MUST play this game.

												It is archaic and looks weird as ♥♥♥♥, but even to this day there's nothing out there that is as engrossing, tense, and involving. There is no other feeling like sneaking around the mansion and lifting everything that can be sold and then giggling like a schoolgirl on weed as you run away with your ill-gotten gains. And guess what: The sequel is even better.More info: http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/544-Thief-The-Dark-Project "

												One of the best games of all time, and certainly the best stealth game ever. A masterful amalgamation of steampunk aesthetics, tension-filled atmosphere and free-flowing, emergent gameplay. It's funny that even 15 years after its release, no other sneaker has even come close. Except Thief 2. They do not make them like this anymore.			"

												Fantastic, even so many years later. The game WILL try your patience because rushing in will get you killed fast and stealth will see you through more. It has a very engaging story and awesome environment (one of the few times steampunk actually WORKS as a theme) and Stephen Russell's occasional retorts as Garrett are very amusing. BUY THIS, and be sure to install the fan made widescreen patch.			"

												YES, my favourite game of all times!!!I remember the day I first played the demo of this amazing game. A dark and rainy day, as if it was made for gaming. I finished the demo after 2 hours. I explored as much as possible.And played it through again after finishing.The day the game finally came out I stood up early and was at the shop an hour before they opened to buy that game. I was not disappointed.Since that day I have played ""Thief: the dark project"" more than 30 times. No other game ever made me so addicted. I made 1-2 speedruns for my own, explored the hell out of the game, played every difficulty. I love beeing a stealthy thief... Even my brother still plays it, though most old games he defines as ""ugly junk"".Ok, enough of being a fanboy. Let's go to the core of the game.Technical:You are right if you think that this game is looking old. The game was made in the late 1990s and you can see that games developed quite much since then.(Thanks to a quite active modder-scene several mods have been released that make the game better looking.)In my case I don't care about that, because the game lives by a fascinating atmosphere, not by it's graphics.The sounds are amazing for the time being released. It is quite interesting how ""surround"" the sound is. And well, this game is the example for ""footsteps"". Listening to them you can define how far an enemy is, how loud you are and how much attaction you will get. So leave your stepdance-shoes alone and take the ""sneakers""...Gameplay:The controls work quite good, the stealth system is the best I've seen in a game so far.You should use the shadows (It has some reason the subtittle is ""the DARK project""), avoid noise, steal as much as you can and never be seen by the guards. Else the game will be quite short... So stay in the dark.You will see it takes a lot of patience for this game. Looking for gaps in the patrols, seeking the dark corners of a house, most time hidden. If you love modern shooters do me a favour and buy them, but not THIS game...The ""hud"" of the game has a small bar, that shows you how visible you are. A revolutionary concept in it's release. Did I mention: ""stay in the dark""?Loot is essential to buy stuff for the next level. Every worthy thing you steal will be sold and the money will be added to your funds. Buy a moss-arrow? Go for it. Buy some flash-bombs? Here you go. You need an water arrow to put out torches? You're welcome.Story:Well, I won't spoiler anything here now. You are a thief in the ""middle ages"". Stay in the dark and steal as much as you can. The rest you will see...To come to an end:A great game (in my case THE greatest game of all times) worth buying it (even after so many years)..........Did I mention: Stay in the dark?			"

Expert difficulty can run a bit demanding with loot totals on some levels. bad maps (this is good). zombies (this is bad). Unintrusive story. Multiple save slots.

												100% not worth buying. Why? It doesn't support 32bit resolutions out of the box, nor stuff like the intro and so forth works. I already owned an CD copy of this game and figured I'd buy it on steam incase the cd ever rotted. So glad this only cost me the price of a cup of coffee. Do not buy this if you have no clue how to get it working correctly, it will take a bit of time.			"
