												This is a hard review I really wanted to give this game a pass but unfortunately the execution was barely passable. Gameplay mechanics are overall clunky, the graphics are not there, and the progression is one dimensional.Here is a bit more depth to the review into the only 3 game modes included in the game:- Manage game mode: This is where you set up and expand your company. This could have been a great system if there was more interaction than just pressing buy on a skill or item until you run out of cash. That is as much dept as this has.- Control mode: It is basically a top down click the icon game. An assistance call comes in, you grab the nearest available car and click on the call location. Over and over, and over, ad nauseum. Extremely frustrating that there is absolutely no onboarding for any of the mechanics either. All of a sudden the month ends and you find out you did a poor job, just because the tow trucks you are sending out don't change tires... oh I had to sent out just a basic car? doesn't make sense that the guy on the tow truck can't help, doesn't it?- Missions mode: This one is the one you get pitched more but its as shallow as a dinner plate. New missions are only unlocked after grinding quite a bit on control mode. Given, the portrayal of the NPC's are something I can completely see happening in real life. Unfortunately the controls are clunky, clicking does not always respond to your input. You get random cars ghosting through the player, etc. To make things even more disappointing is that as soon as you do the mission once, you can do it with your eyes closed the next time. They repeat down to the last detail so there is absolutely no challenge.In conclusion I would give this game a pass. Wait for a sale or something as its not even worth the launch prize. I did get some entertainment out of it but, honestly, had I known I would have played something else.Graphics 6/10Gameplay 3/10Replayabilty 1/103/10 overall score			"

												Totally worth the 39 cents CDN via a bundle. Delivers a working and fun game as advertised.Ubisoft should learn from this. "

												I agree with the other reviewer when they say, ""..this should be called DISPATCH SIMULATOR.""  The ""missions"" where you diagnose the car hands-on are only about every-now-and-then.  It's very deceiving as the screenshots on the store page only show one pic of the map screen, however the game is played 90% of the time on that screen.  I don't recommend basing your purchase on the ""missions"".  It's a rather tedious icon-clicking-game.   I built a member base to around the mid-20k's, and am already bored of it.  It's somewhat entertaining at first, so with that being said, I honestly don't' think it's worth any more than $4-5.			"

												First review ever, for this money I could have bought a better game...The game is not what I expected, was hoping to get more of driving through the street and check the cars for problems (this only happens on the few missions you get when unlocked and you don't even drive to the client position). The rest of the time you work with a map overview were you just click on the appearing events to which you send your crew to help the people in need.Before you buy the game look for some videos like ""Let's play"" to make sure about what you are buying and if it is what you are looking for (should have done the same, I would not have bought this game).  PS.: English is not my native language so sorry for any grammatical errors, hope the review helps. "

												Have you ever paid $89.00 for a game and found it too be a big pile a unplayable rubbish. Well for this game i only paid $12.74 and for that price it has achieved a great deal more than some more costly games have. Its playable, no soul stealing bugs and it would give me entertainment on a rainy day. It probably should be defined as a casual simulator type game as its not realy a full on simulator. My only minor complaint would be that sometimes its hard to get your vehicle to its destination(rare). Thumbs up to the creators. Note: I have never forgotten a steam review where a reviewer compained about a 99 cent game. You get what you pay for, if you get more than what you pay for its a bonus and why complain.			"

												So I read through the reviews before I bought this game with a bit of trepidation - usually, lots of bad reviews are a bad sign. But, this was £2.50, so I though ""why not?"" took the plunge and went for it. 90 minutes in, I'm greatful I did.In terms of gameplay, it is limited, I'd admit. There are 3 modes, where you manage your fleet and staff's abilities, a mode where you dispatch units to regions that increase in size, and a mission mode, where you need to investigate and fix faults with customers cars (a bit like car mechanic sim).Overall, while gameplay is limited, this is a good little game, so if it comes up at a bargin price, get it, even if it just lasts a few hours, the relaxation and addictiveness is worth it for the time. I'm around half way through, and not sure of the replay value, but I'm grateful I went for it after all! "

												Well, I got it from a bundle and I 100%d the whole game. So, take that as you may.The game devolves into 2 parts: Finding/fixing issues with a client's car and a map-view strategic dispatching game that also has upgrades. It's hard to really talk about the game, so I'll say this much: It's pretty easy to 100%, it runs well and it's pretty simple, so you don't have to focus on it too much.Should you buy it for the full price? Nah.In a bundle? Yeah.Overall5/10(All games start off from a 5/10 and rise and lower based on pros/cons)			"

												Most of the time is spent playing a mini game where you select a truck and click on an icon on a map of someone who is broken down.The bit that would be vaguely interesting takes up a tiny bit of the time and it's really easily solvable.Massive let down of a game.

												Such a good game. You can find glithces though.. For example, on certain motorway missions, the vehicles on the other side will drive through the Crash barrier (in the middle,) and... yeah. Overall, such a good game, barely any lag, and I have a laggy Laptop. I 100% Reccomend it!!			"

												What can I say you get what you payed for. The game is at a low price which matches other games of its size and complexity. If you went to EGX 2016 then it's only £4 suitable for picking up games to play a bit varying what you play and content for YouTube videos.+one of a kind+easy to grasp controls- easy to forget controls+provides an endless gameplay (if your okay with the same style over and over+illustrates drivers how most drivers (and public) appear as on the internet (stupid AF (not us))-bugs that affect gameplay causing you to lose missions           - mouse doesn't register sometimes resulting in accidental movement of units-grinder-manual saving only (found out after I already had a crash and lost half hours worth of progress)+not a remake of previous games by same people eg gta5Cons:----Pros:+++++Overal:+6/10			"

												What could have been a novel car repair time-waster is handicapped by the inclusion of an incredibly tedious mini-game in which you dispatch recovery vehicles around a fictional county.90% of the time you'll spend with this game will be spent frustrated and bored wishing you could just do the next repair scenario.

												Not worth more than $4.99; if that. The game has a GREAT idea behind it. Do they actually use that great idea? No. 99% of your time is a dispatch telling cars to go from point A to point B in order to gain customers. The game its self I don't think has more then 20 missions that you can do. Thats also something the screen shots don't tell you. I was thinking this was going to be like, I get in my car and drive quickly to Aid someone and figure out what the problem is. Store the information in my Computer and start to RTB untill I get dispatched again. But No. You are the dispatcher and when you do get to do a dispatch you teleport there and its stupid things. Like no gas, or things the lights on the dash that every driver on the road should know about. Its games like this that make me want a refund.....			"
