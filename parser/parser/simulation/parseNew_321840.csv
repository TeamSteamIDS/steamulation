 TL:DR This is a visual novel and not a game. You make a few major choices at the climax to drive it to a specific conclusion. The story is short so you can finish within one sitting, that is if you are into reading. If the music annoys you, feel free to mute. If you do not like ramblings, then skip straight to pro and con list below.Don't let the negative comments get you from downloading this free game. It is known that story based ""games"" are not for everyone. Granted, when I first downloaded this game I was hoping for more then just dialogue and a few choices here and there. I stuck with it, however, and wanted to see where I would end up. I ended up following a story that goes further then just the stoic version of the protagonist which quickly breaks down later. Game critiques do what game critiques do, play for 10-20 minutes and base their critique off that short amount of time. Not trying to bash critiques as they are completing their objective the way they see fit. I on the other hand went through the entire game before making my critique. Pros   About 1-2 hour story, so does not drag on forever (will be continued in further installments like a book in a series).  Major choices at the end of the game, driving the final product.  Limited artwork so you concentrate more on the story (sorry, I come from a generation that cares more for words then             pretty pictures so be forewarned).  New age of openness by being gay within the story without being subjected to fan service art.  Music is astounding, however can become repetitive which leads me to my next pro.  Full set of options including fullscreen, audio control, and having the text auto advance if you do not want to be bothered by clicking. Cons   Limited choice selection, although major decisions towards the end.  Not really a game  Scenes repeat which may be boring for those interested more in art.  Story is a bit shallow at the beginning.  Character development for one of the characters is brought forth too rapidly ruining some of the mystery of the story.As a pun on the story and my conclusion, I let my heart decide my course of action and it led me to my desired ending.

												An engaging little VN. While the plot reads like a book, and only some of the decisions actually impact the story in any way, it's still fun and engaging, and i look forward to a sequel if one comes out.And hey, for the price, or lack thereof, it's certainly worth trying out!			"

												Not bad for a visual novel.+ It's free. + It's polished.+ The artwork is both nice and original. I liked it.+ Meaningful choices+ A complete adventure in a space ship.+ Varied cast of characters.+ Interesting story and setting.+ The protagonist is a gamer.- Some characters are either unbelievable or plain irritating. Three of them would be booted off the ship immediately if there was even a slightly intelligent command officer on board. Some types of conduct are absolutely unacceptable on a warship during an actual war, even if a character is quirky, endearing or competent. Especially ONE character has no place in her position, and it frankly shatters my suspension of disbelief to pieces. - The big bad is so glaringly obvious. Also, that person is so hilariously incompetent at what it does, making any attempts at spying or sabotage ridiculous. But they work... The crew is very special, you see.- One choice in the game feels VERY contrived. It's either go stupid good or reasonably evil. Then, other characters react... in a completely unbelievable way.Final verdict:Despite some glaring flaws in character development, this visual novel is engaging. Sure, most of the crew's reactions are unbelievable, but it's still better than in most Hollywood films. Artwork, music, plot hovewer, make this a good and a fun experience. I recommend. "

												Well, I downloaded this little gem out of pure curiosity not knowing what to expect. Have to admit, I don't do many Visual Novels. They aren't really ""games"" in the same since most people think of when hearing the word. If anything, I always think of them as ""Interactive Picture Books"". Which I don't think if a bad thing, I may not have played many Visual Novels, but I have played enough to where I can say that I know a good one from a bad one. And I've played bad ones. And this... is not one of them. It's a fantastic story actually, that kept me going all the way to the end in one sitting. I didn't stop till the it was over, and it was a very well done V.N. With some very miner grammar mistakes here and there, but to be honest, I don't think there is a single one I've read that didn't have at least a couple grammar errors. They did stick out, but nothing that really pulled me out of the story enough to be much of a bother. The story it's self is far from original, but that's not really a bad thing as long as it's told well. And this one is told very well. Honestly surprised a V.N. that is a free download would be this good. It actually reads more like a science fiction book than the more classic romanticized stories I typically come across when looking at these kind of ""games"". It's actually pretty refreshing to see one done in this way.The characters in this V.N. are all pretty colorful people. Maybe a bit stereotypical. but honestly there is nothing wrong with using classic stereotype characters, like the tsundere girl who act's superior to everyone, as long as these characters are used in the right way. And I personally believe they are here. Every character, be the a stereotype or not, fits into their respective role perfectly. Anyone who is a fan of Visual Novels, would probably like this one. I'm not even all that big on these kind of things, but I like it quite a lot. One of the best I've read even. And I wish the creators the best of luck in their efforts to make a sequel, cause I do want to know how the story ends with everyone in the story.Having said all that, the main issue I think anyone who already knows what to expect from a V.N. is going to have is the reader's ability to direct the flow of the story. Or rather the lack there of. It's kind of an important part of any V.N. to have reader choices that have a large part in controlling where and how events will happen, be they for better or worse. This story, as much as I like it, is a lot more linear than what I would like it to be. However I did read from the makers of this novel's kick starter that they plan to fix this in the next installment of the story, which I would love to read by the way. Giving readers more power over the protagonists actions and building or breaking relationships between your crew members. With that in mind, I do believe that is a worth while effort to support them in their kick starter, and help bring the next chapter to life. Those are my thoughts on this Novel, and my hopes for the next one.			"

												I've played through this game fully one time.  I hesitate to say game because it's not one.  It is a visual novel.  It has some interactive parts that let you make choices at times that may or may not influence then ending, but there is no ""gameplay.""  Some of them are obvious and some aren't.  All of them effect the story a little bit in what you get to read, whether it has an impact on the plot or not.  If you're looking for a sim rpg then move on.  The closest thing I can compare this to is the ""choose your own path"" books.  I've only gotten one ending so far, but I absolutely plan on playing through again and checking out the other paths.  If your looking for a fun story this is great.  Either way I recommend at least taking a look at.  I look forward to the sequel, and I look forward to reading the prequel Rising Angels: The Red Rose.On a slight side note, the sequel I mentioned will take into account the complaints about ""lack of interaction"" and will be pushing more into gameplay with two modes: story mode and ""investigation mode.""  Because of this, I highly recommend reading this, even if it's not your favorite type of thing.  If you don't you'll be missing out on a lot of backstory when Rising Angels: Fates is released.			"

												Rising Angels: Reborn being completely free, I was skeptical of the quality of this visual novel. I was surprised it turned out to be pretty decent. It was most definitely one of the more entertaining visual novels I have done, but that being said, I have not played ""a lot"" of visual novels. I myself don't really consider myself a fan of visual novels, but when a free one is just dropped in my lap the way this one was, I cant help myself but try it. I have got to say I did enjoy my ""playthrough"" of Rising Angels: Reborn, and if there is anyone looking for a free vn to try, I would recommended this one, not only because I enjoyed it, but because it is really truly free. I am going to be honest, I feel like I was rambling a little bit in my review, the fine points however still stand, I like Rising Angels: Reborn, even though I dont have alot of experience with visual novels. Therefore I think there is a good chance you may like it as well, so you should indeed try it!			"

A nice afternoon / evening space adventure with a heroine out to prove herself and her training, but whose inexperience as a tactics officer gets her into trouble.Not too adult, reminescient of Blue Rose but in space.

												Rising Angels: Reborn is a second novel in Rising Angels series. If you wish to know more about the world and backstory you can get the first novel, Rising Angels: The Red Rose, as well as other games kind of set in same universe directly from developer's website: http://www.idhasstudios.com/?page_id=19I played Rising Angels: Reborn before and wrote a small review back then. Republishing it here with small changes.---------------------I applaud to the artist who did character sprites - he or she had to work with the relatively big cast of nine characters and did a marvellous job. Each character identified by distinct silhouette using different body shapes, poses and features like ears, horns and wings. Sprites utilize poses and body language to convey information about the person, like Zuri is almost always shown in positions that imply motion or Stan often drawn covering his mouth with his hand in a gesture subconsciously associated with lying. I think wings were superfluous for character's design - they take too much screen space and people who have wings could be easily recognized without them - but it looks like each race appearances were already defined in earlier novel drawn by another artist and it's too late to change something now.In contrast to character sprites backgrounds look nice and clean, but also grey and unimpressive and there is too few of them, but it's understandable because most of action happens on board of a small spaceship. Game could definitely use more CGs as well; few CGs present are somewhat bland and characters appear noticeably different from their usual sprites. Also, if story takes place on a spaceship, it's almost necessary to show how this ship looks from outside, but I guess nobody in development team could do mechanical design.Music clearly was professional - it sounded like something I could hear before in some games or movie trailers. Perhaps it was licensed from some recording studio. Any sound effects are sadly missing. Adding little sound: footsteps, gunshots, ""woosh"" of spaceship door would only help immersion.The list of races itself is more what I expect to see in some Star Trek fanfic written by a schoolgirl, not standalone serious work of science fiction: generic fantasy races, angels and demons, furry people - all together in space. Just like in Star Trek, critically important ship personnel are sent with away teams to investigate dangerous planets, apparently unarmed. At least no officers were killed during planetary missions, despite all of them except one wearing red shirts.However, even if Rising Angels series started as mere fanfic, it came a long way and Reborn deserves being distributed through Steam.

												Disregard my play time as I've actually played this straight from the folder and not from the steam client due to the steam ingame overlay lagging oddly.This was a really great VN, the story was really nice with alot of tense moments here and there, the characters were enjoyable (you may or may not want to strangle one or two though.) and the music was great as well although may get repetitive for some people. It's also free, so bonus points for that too. There's yuri too, if you're into that.No, I didn't get this just for the yuri, really, trust me, I mean it.Nat x ZuriI want morePlease?			"

												I have mixed feelings towards this VN. The concept is interesting, art style was nice/decent, BGs and BGM were good. But the beginning is boring; I love VNs with a complex story, but Rising Angels: Reborn was simply boring at some points. Character development wasn’t the best either (some characters were cute but others were mostly annoying, they acted so cliche and childish that it made hard to believe that this is a militar ship with adults around). But I liked the fact that are multiple endings. This game is definitely better than a lot of paid VNs around Steam, but I hope that the sequel has some more action/plot twists. 6/10, if you like sci-fi stories, this one might be a good call!			"

												I started looking for a free game on steam to burn some time in boredom. What I found was a gripping, tense, emotional rollercoaster of a visual novel, that deserves a much better position then in the free to play game area it currently sits in. From the moment I started the characters personalities began to grip me, letting me know each part of their individual backstories, and how its shaped who they are in this story.By offering multiple choices while keeping a by the line save system, this game offers a perfect amount of replayablity, especially for those who wish to explore multiple options.Hopefully this game will be the first of many , if only so I can follow the exploits of these characters.10/10, need to play again.

The downside is the lack of a male protagonist but thats s very minor thing with visual novels. Another downside is the choices seem to do nothing except decide the end (not going to spoil it) but thats it very minor things that i found odd but overall its a nice thing to see on steam.			"

												I'm torn about this game.  It has heart.  And the core plot is kind of interesting--there's some decent SF in there.  There's certainly an ambition to explore the characters, what makes them tick and so on.  And I like the art.  The controls worked pretty well although occasionally I wished for a ""back"" button to look at the previous dialogue again.But if you're expecting anything like realism, expect again.  I just find it incredibly hard to believe in these people as anything resembling military personnel.  Half of them I find hard to believe in as adults capable of dressing themselves.  The main character herself is the least bad, but even her, while I find her emotional arc somewhat affecting, just systematically breaks her original image as someone who supposedly graduated first in her class and is remotely competent.  Not even the whiz she imagines herself to be at the beginning, just borderline capable of seeing things obvious as the nose on her face or taking basic operational security precautions.So for instance (really major spoiler here)We have the doctor, who she suspects of being an enemy spy, who has repeatedly tried to hamper the mission and given signs of knowing things he should not.  In his sickbay is a crewmember who has been poisoned.  He has pretended to have nothing to treat her with, until pressured by people who knew what was in his supplies.  She should have had him arrested for gross dereliction of duty so she could (a) make sure he didn't nobble the crewmember and (b) search his quarters and sickbay for incriminating evidence.  Instead she lets him continue treating this woman and goes off and forgets the whole thing.  What on  earth?!This kind of thing happens time after time, losing the thread or not bothering to follow up on clues or failing to spot or foresee the obvious.  Often because she's busy wallowing in self-pity, something she and some other crewmembers do at the drop of a hat, often just seconds after they've been given an uplifting pep talk and sworn renewed resolve.  And yet it's appropriate for her to be the heroine because despite these flaws she remains the most competent, level-headed person on the ship.  That's because most of the remainder of the crew are unbalanced and self-absorbed to the point of serious mental illness.  It boggles my mind that on a military vessel, over the course of the whole story I don't think anyone except the main character ever just does what they're told without a bunch of back-chat.  Do I recommend this game?  Is there a ""maybe"" button?  It was kind of fun, and ""free"" is an awfully attractive price point.  But I constantly wanted to yell at the screen.  And the characterization had possibilities but after laying it on with three or four trowels they seem to have decided that wasn't getting it done and went for the back-hoe.  In the end, I'll recommend it; it's worth more than they're charging.			"

												I rarely if ever write reviews, but I have played many VNs in my life (both Hentai and Non-H, hehe) so, upon stumbling on one that puts many +$15 visual novels to shame, I simply couldn't let this slip....-Story 10/10''Whom do you trust? And whom you shouldn't trust?'' This is a very mature topic in an even more mature story. So if you expect the choices to answer this question to be as Black and White as the ''Side with the Rebels against the Evil Tyrant, or side with the Evil Tyrant to crush the Rebels.'', then move along; you won't like this VN. But if you like plot full of mystery and doubt, betrayal and friendship, where one single wrong choice could end up dooming everything you care about and you like to feel the jarring tension and drama, then you'll love this work. -Art 7/10OK, this score is a bit viased; for a VN with so many endorphins-releasing situations, moments of sheer shock and fear.... I seriously expected more CGs of them, not just a black screen with the text. I know the most pivotal of them have CGs, but you can count those with one hand and there many, many more events that deserved a CG.As for what Art Style and Quality over all, this VN has better art than many paid VNs; I'd give it a 10 in here.-Sound 10/10The BGMs tend to be quite quiet and inconspicious when nothing of importance is happening, but when something big happens.... Well, the soundtrack kicks in just in the right way (to the point you might find yourself jumping in your seat if you favor headphones). All of the music is beautiful and perdfectly crafted for whatever events are taking place, and that's simply perfect. Love the opening soundtrack, too.-Characters 11/10This review is viased too; I love monster girls in all their shapes (Monster Musume be praised! And Okayado-sensei's previous hentai works too, heheh) so, to have a REAL GOOD STORY, one that's not about silly romantic comedy or pointless fanservice, in a setting with monster girls on it is golden.Going into the specifics, a good Female Protagonist (that isn't oversexualized), a Ditzy Dojikko Dragon with confidence issues, a Tsundere Ojou-sama Kitsune, a Lazy but Lovely Wolf Girl and a Cold and Harsh Elf spelled epicness to me. But, each of the characters is much, much deeper than just their physical traits; each of them feels and acts like a real living being; with virtues and faults, issues and traumas, and with unique and interesting personalities; characters you can relate to. (Such a thing is so rare these days).-Lenght 10/10At first I thought this was too short (beat in on 3 hours, and got the True End in just two tries) and I was about to complain about it. Then, I saw that Kickstarter page with a fully-funded sequel, and all my complains vanished and were replaced by the desire of it being released soon. If it's as epic as this one, I'll get it even if I have to pay.So, to sum up, if you're looking for a fanservice-packed romantic comedy, with lots of bouncing bewbs, panty shots and Gainaxing, then look elsewhere (try NekoPara, which is quite good in all the aforementioned, specially the last two). But, if you are looking for an epic drama filled with emotions and anxiety, then by all means, get this VN.			"

Basically its like a manga in video game form, so if you like to read and is patient, then this will suit you well. If you dislike reading or is not a patient person, then I suggest do not get it, its a waste of your time and not worth playing at all.			"

												The art, and UI is well done for a renpy game.I recommend this for Yuri (Lesbian Relationship) lovers out there.The game has 9 cgs.Spoilers:For a space crew tasked with a dangerous mission with little resources and man power sounds ridiculous. The story was  interesting but in the end this game just isn't ..working out for me.  I guess my decisions didn't much influence the course of the game. What really bothered me were the relationships. I really tried various ways to romance with Sol but this game only had 1 love interest which was a girl/half dragon named Zuri . Aside from that, Natalie was falling head over heals with Zuri as the story progresses even if I prefer talking to Sol. I feel like she fell in-love only because she was stressing out on how their missions didn't go too well and she was the only person she could rely on. It's just that I feel betrayed that this game was given to the general audience without a disclaimer that it's Yuri centric. I'm not a homophobe but I don't want to waste my time on relationship mechanics that doesn't align with my interest. It's misleading.There was less screen time for their captain to appear and be involved, and she's even less significant than Natalie. It would have been interesting if we can see other characters point of view while Natalie is doing something less interesting to at least give them more screentime. "

Additionally game have nice looking art and music is dynamical on parts that requires proper soundtrack.Hopefully follow up will be as entertaining.Short format of opening chapter can give you feel if you gonna like this kind of ""game"".Very important thing to notice is that this is visual novel in classic style if you don't like to read you gonna have bad time.

												I wanted to like this game. I really did. I still recommend it if you're into visual novels and can overlook minor imperfections. The characters are interesting and engaging, if unrealistic in a charming way. Though I can't fault it, since it tries very hard to overcome this limitation, the game is limited as most choose-your-own-adventure style stories are in that it attempts to tell an engaging story while creating the impression that your choices matter. Unfortunately, it falls short when it comes to explaining the protagonist's intentions where choices are to be made, and the small speech bubbles that resemble choices are very vague. Like I said, I can't fault it. This is how visual novels do things. I just had a few ""Comfort Misha"" moments, which ultimately spoiled my enjoyment of the game. Hopefully others might find it more enjoyable, as this certainly stands above the mediocre masses of VNs out there.			"

												Usually when I review a free game it goes something like ""well it wasn't great, but its free, so why not?"" However, I think if this game had charged something, it would have been justified. Its pretty good for a small visual novel. The story, though cliche, (resembled an episode of Star Trek) was well written and interesting. The art is ok, the music is suitable for its environment, and the characters are nicely fleshed out. The replay-ability is not fantastic, and the choices are pretty obvious, but its still enjoyable. The skip button doesn't always work, but that seems to be the only technicaly problem.

												An Awesome Visual Novel! This is a great novel for all ages, without the silly or ecchi humor as well. It's so good infact that i found my self seriously sitting for about 20 minutes trying to decide which choice i would make if it were myself in the character's role.I can't wait to find the other endings, so far i have #3 and 5.my only beef witht his novel is some of the still images you unlock seem a bit rushed or messy, other than that. Flawless.9/10			"

It's hard to believe this game was made for completely free, and I had to play it 3 times to see all the different endings and choices so it has a good replayability!			"

												I don't usually stay up until 4 AM, but for this game I did. I wouldn't say the story is all that exciting or surprising, but it somehow drew me in. I managed the true ending on my first try somehow, but still missed the 9th image in the gallery. Got it now, though.Really fun, loved the characters. I'd give it 4.5 stars out of 5, since I think 5 stars is stretching it a bit.			"

Only 2 choices and one(first one) of them most of the time means - ""You're dead, humiliated or abandoned""Romance way: is Lesbian route only, while Natalie says(in her mind) when she comes to ship that she have crush on Major Sol Hackett from long time ago. How come that his route isn't available? Or decisions making abilities to romance route? Maybe Nat want be one able to chose?			"

												To start my review with something positive, the art is quite good. The appearance of the characters could work in a different scenario. The personalities of some of them are disgusting though. Sol is the obligatory love interest which also takes the role of Onii-Chan, Zuri the obligatory clumsy best-friend type of girl, Faye is the obligatory recessive, sleepy girl, Kylie is the obligatory cute, little girl, Al the obligatory good person, Rasoona the obligatory stuck-up and Kika... well, I guess Kika IS quite unique and about the only character I eally liked. Even the protagonist which I'm supposed to sympathize with I did not like.The setting is also quite weird. I have never read a book/v-novel/seen a movie where fantasycreatures (as in demons and halfdragons) and space was a good mix and it looks like I yet have to see one.To put the cherry on top, even the authorities on this ship act like 15 year old teens.Personally I don't dig it.

												Slight spoilers ahead, but nothing major!I've only completed one route so far and it was short enough that I did it in one sitting, but the story was very interesting. The characters were all great, though with only going Zuri's route I haven't gone in-depth with any of the others. The supporting cast weren't too fleshed out, but again I've only done the one route. I really enjoyed the background music in all the scenes, it felt well placed in both action and easy going scenes, though there could stand to be a bit more diversity. I must say, the villain is a bit predictable...at least in Zuri's route, not sure if things go differently with the others. While short I think this novel has a lot of potential as a first chapter and I can say right now that I will be funding the kickstarter so that I can see more of the heroine and her friends. As well as pursue Zuri some more!			"

												     After spending several hours on the game, I was VERY impressed by the entire VN. Being a gamer, and also being a reader(Assuming I actually like the content), I found this to be a very satisfying hybrid between the two worlds. It's definitely worth trying out if you don't mind being sucked away from your day(Or weekend).     The storyline is very good in my opinion. For following an almost basic plot line(As most games do), this one does it extremely well. Coupled with the in-depth descriptions to get your imagination going and the great plot, I have to say I was really pulled in by the entire progression of the game. It's also very hard not to develop bonds with the characters within the game, as many of them are very amiable.      The art in the game is limited, but as mentioned before, the descriptions are nowhere near sub-standard. Whatever isn't supplied visually in-game, it is very easy to come up with your own picture for the object in question, thanks to the great details.     Coming from somebody who has a decent bit of gaming under their belt(I'm by no means an official reviewer, but I do think this review will carry a little weight for those interested in trying the game), I would give this game two thumbs up, and probably a 4.5/5 stars(I think it could just use a little more interaction from the player).

Highly Recommended if you want 3 dimensional characters with defining personalities in a greatly crafted sci-fi story. Cheers!			"

												Before I start my review, I have to say that I have played a number of Japanese Visual-Novels and have experience in the matter.Rising Angels: Reborn. Is it a good visual novel? Yes.To go into detail, I must say, the amount of detail in the dialogue is better than I expected from a free-to-play visual novel. The characters are believable. You feel that they are alive and that they mean something to you and not just some hollow arch-type character to move you along through the plot. The main story flows fluidly with the characters itself rather than the character-goes-here-for-the-plot type.The music is decent. I mean, for a free-to-play, what do you expect? But, I do have some problems with some scenes in having the wrong kind of soundtrack to play in a heartwarming or first-clenching scenes. Other than that, it was okay.But your main hook on this genre will not be the music, or the graphic (which is obviously CG drawn) or even the endings. Its the character development. You learn their history, their drive to their goal, their will. And you care for them across the story. With the amazing dialogue, I had no problem believing any of the hardships they went through together.In the end, I was left feeling, ""Wow, I wasn't expecting this good of an experience."" And was satisfied with how the plot ends. I cared for the characters and even for the ones that died. It managed to enter my personal territory and made me feel sad with each hardship they go through. I want them to succeed and I cheered for them. All done without paying a single penny towards the developer. (Which made me feel sour at the end for enjoying such a good experience without paying a single penny)You don't get a massive cliffhanger that makes you want to rip your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hair off, but it leaves enough plot to settle for a sequel (which they are working on and is being funded in a kickstarter)All in all, this was a Visual Novel worth of your 2-3 hour of spare time and definitely worth doing all the routes to all the ending. What's even great is it's free! (I wouldn't mind paying this for 5-10$ though)			"

												I'd give this game a 4.8 out of 5 stars. Reasons why to like it. Good Story, artwork, and there are choices. Difference on the 4.8 from a 5.0, is the regard of how long, sure scripts take a bit of reading but there seems like there could be more, options, routes, side stuff, but I digress. It made a lasting impression worth taking. Although free, I also seen the other work, very well done considering it's done by one person. Given that, I believe that they did a piece of well done work. I recommend it not only because it's free +(Bonus for a lot of us thanks to consideration) but also the fact that the story makes you think. Although there are some who think oh I don't want to play as a girl, it's how it was set. Enjoy it, let's not be dishonest, it's a good game. I recommend it because it filled the time and met my mark. Upon full review and I warn you SPOILERS AHEAD!!!I find that the pairings you have are limited and in CGFor instance I wouldn't have mind the elf-eared commander or the lupine girl as well on the route.As for the other instances, there could have been other endings with other characters.I did like how the game shifts scenarios and the music plays a wonderful opening.Highly replayable but the options and set scenarios do worry. For instance there's not much variation between routes to lead to end. Not any passive alternate ends either.Still I do digress there is nice moments in the game where I find myself attached. For instance the fact of multiple races. Just wish there was also some other interaction but this novel meets as it's intended. Still kinda wished for more.My range on this subject and opinion for game review and scale 4.2-4.8 out of 5.0 on an average just because it misses that if I'm talking about a full comparison to others that many have played.Still with the current resources that it was done by one person who did credit others. Duly noted on that, I do appreciate him taking the time to on his site write a review letter response which may have costed him fans but let's be honest. Not all of us take the time to make games with CG work and a Visual Story Line. Usually everyone is hyped over function and graphics. Well in this one, it's a VN for a reason hence why it meets the mark.			"

												Stellar visual novel, exceptionally well-written and able to fluidly transition from comedy to drama. The characters are, for the most part, engaging and well-written, and there's a lot of good to take from their interactions in general. The choices made are consistently difficult near the end of the game, and consistent with its overall themes of morality and what it means to be a hero; combined with a good mystery that invites the user to speculate and consider what will come of it all, Rising Angels: Reborn is engaging from start to finish. Production values are for the most part all very solid, and mood music is used with great effect. The CG stills are comparatively cheaper looking next to the rest of the game, but there's nothing overtly wrong with the game and so much of it is done very well.It's also free. So, you know, it's absolutely totally worth it. One of my favourite things I've found, will be sure to tell all my friends about it. Looking forward to more episodes!			"

												First of all, this is not your usual game of 'doing things', this is a Visual Novel, which means that you will, most of the time, be reading, getting filled with the atmosphere of the game and at some points making decisions about which path the protagonist will take.I like to read, and that's what it took me like 5 hours to finish my first run of the game, so you can finish it in one sit.I really liked the theme and the story of the game, but it feels too linear, maybe it could gain in depth with more choices, specially in the first stages. Later on, you will be able to do much more important choices that will change the ending of the game.The art is nice, although it may feel a bit too repetitive, as does the music, but you can always turn it down and concentrate more on the text, which is what this games are about.TL;DR:If you like reading and Visual Games, chances are that you will like this game.

												A good solid enjoyable visual novel game. I've paid for games I enjoyed far less than this free one.The writing and worldbuilding are well done, and the characters are interesting. The artwork and soundtrack are both enjoyable too. The story takes place on a ship in space, and there are enough intriguing and mysterious elements in the plot to keep you attentive and engaged.There are multiple endings to obtain too, and at the time of writing this review, several of the endings are getting their own sequel games under the umbrella title Rising Angels: Fates as part of a successful kickstarter campaign. There is also a prequel story called Rising Angels: Hope available as well.That the developers chose to make this game freely available is quite generous, because this is an enjoyable visual novel that could have easily justified a modest price tag in its own right.

												...I honestly expected the game to be better and more complex but ultimately it's one of those things where the same exact events happen except sometimes with SLIGHTLY different dialogue. This song made me feel like it would be awesomer than it was. It was alright, but not very open in terms of story-telling. You ultimately decide nothing except whether or not at the very end it will be a regular open-ended ending or a neutral or bad ending. Congratulations Rising Angels: Reborn. You wasted a good two hours of our lives.Now, I wouldn't be so critical if they had at least given us more room to establish a different romantic route for this game but nope. They went ahead and decided that for you too. It's always either vaguely (SPOILERS REDACTED) or already determined. I was honestly hoping for an Azaiah route. I personally go for the cool-headed, commanding glasses types. They are strict and stubborn, but their heart is always ultimately in the right place.But nope. They (SPOILERS REDACTED). So that's out.Everything is essentially decided for us except whether or not we're going to need to continue to the next game to have a REAL ending rather than what they called the ending of Rising Angels Reborn.And honestly, who didn't see the big reveal coming? It wasn't very suspenseful. I mean...you pretty much know the gist of what happens by the time you finish the trailer so apparently they probably have never heard the phrase ""it's better to conceal than reveal"".I only hope that they give us more of a challenge with Rising Angel: Fates, but, as with the chances of Fate/Extra CCC ever being translated, my hopes are low.

I could keep rattling off good things about this or you could just get the FREE game and play for yourself. Knowing me I might spoil something andnot put it in a tag line.Cons: character backstories are only availible in certain path choices making the gameplay a bit distancing at times but ensure multile playthroughs. Hmm that's not really a con, oh well I'll strike through it after I am done typing this review. "

I would definitely check out the ""help"" tab to learn all of the key shortcuts before really delving in, and be sure to use the full save option, rather than the icon on the screen.			"

												This game? No, allow me to rephrase it. A visual novel.Note: This review may be lengthy is obviously lengthy. Also, I only clocked 1.1hrs and have not finished the whole ""game"" when writing this review. Will edit if needed once I actually complete the ""game"".___________________________________________You're literally reading a book, and deciding on a few conversation choices that is seemingly pointless. From what I've experienced and been through in the hours I've clocked, I've made 4 conversation choices, 3 of which was pointless and could have either been taken out or just added to the storyline, but probably affects how your crew thinks of you. The only one that was actually a choice was the option to talk to the person of your choice.Storyline is great, but I do feel that it is a little draggy and slow. Nonetheless, when it starts to perk up to the mysteries, it kicks in well. Personally, I would have preferred to get to know each character slowly, but no. Everything was dumped on you right from the start. It's fine I guess, but that probably took up say about 30minutes of gameplay time(not accurate, just felt like it) to go around the spaceship to introduce yourself and do ice breakers with your crew.Not the best music, nor does it shout the worst music. It certainly does bring out the right atmosphere according to where you are in the story. The art style in this VN strikes the word odd to me. In the spaceship, all the backgrounds pops out at you with a feeling of being detailed. Yet when you leave the ship to an outdoor scene, the backgrounds are less detailed, seemingly a quick painting sketch(it still looks detailed, but how should I put it... unlined or dabbling paint blobs?) Even within the spaceship, some backgrounds look a bit more on the realistic side, and some other scenes more cartoonish. At the end of the day, it's alright I guess.So. Remember i started off with saying that this is a visual novel more than a game? Well at the end of the day, some people may find this VN engaging for the storyline, while some may deter from this for the lack of gameplay. Personally, Rising Angels isn't my cup of tea, no matter how much I like visual novel games. I believe that at it's price it is worth a try, but if you are looking for a more interactive type of Visual Novel game, you will try something else.			"

												Pretty nice free Visual Novel this is! Not the kind that focuses on inner world of main character or other deep questions. Instead it's more of actiony kind. Hooked me up once the first mystery kicked in, instead of boring up with continious amount of lines of how pathetic hero's past was. Not a lot of choices, not a lot of them have much of impact on story.And one thing that most people didn't like is that main hero, instead of trying to represent player, may act as character of it's own... At least it wasn't liked judging by day one reviews like ""I want to hit main hero with a book!"".			"

												There has never been a game with such a satisfying ending that made you wish there was more. One that jumble your emotions around made you wish you had friends like Natalie did, friends who you can call family. It took my 5.4 hours to finish one of the multiple endings to Rising Angels: Reborn and it was amazing. This is the first visual novel game I have ever played and I absolutely loved it. The choices you make have more of an impact on the story than most RPG’s have today. Characters like Sol and Natalie reminded me of me, I felt empathy for Zuri and characters like Kika and Fayfe (I think I spelled those names wrong) really made me laugh and reminded me of the young narcissistic version of myself. This game actually brought a tear to my eye once and a while. I truly recommend this game to anyone who wants a game with an excellently well written story which is also free.			"

												This was one of the better visual novels I have ever played. The story kept me interested and invested regardless of any romance paths. The story is about par for a mid level sci-fi story. Not the greatest work of literature ever created for its genere but enjoyable in every way if you are a fan of science fiction.There are some cirtiques with regards to the story, for one, it focuses far too heavily on Zuri as oposed to spreading the story more evenly amongst the entire cast. Secondly, there are some writing mistakes. Where the text for a section is inconsitient with the events that have transpired. These are relitively minor oversights though.The characters are charming and engaging in thier own way. I had my doubts with the cast of angels, demons, dragons, and furries, but each character managed to bring thier own personality to the front and such doubts faded away. The artwork is sparse, but well polished. Lastly playing from the persepctive of a female lead character was a rare treat, often neglected in the world of visual novels.This would be a good game for $5-$10, that this game is free makes it outstanding value as the quality is definately well abolve average.

												Rising Angels Reborn is a well drawn and well written visual novel with unique characters and outstanding music. It's not the most complex visual novel, it's almost completely linear if fact, but the choices you get to make do have an impact on the story and how far the game progresses before reaching one of the 5 or 6 endings. There's humor, intrigue, a little horror and some romance in there. The game isn't terribly long, depending on how fast you read I guess? 3-4 hours for an intense little romp through outer space with a colorful cast of characters felt just right and begging for a sequel that's already in development! If I had one complaint it would be a lack of artwork. I would have loved to have got to see pictures / artwork of the characters interacting more; the dinner scene, the arguments and other major events in the game needed there own artwork. Also where can I get the soundtrack! Seriously, where is it?			"

												I was pleasantly surprised by Rising Angels: Reborn. Being used to playing original Japanese visual novels, it was refreshing to read an English VN that gave off a Western feel rather than trying to emulate the Eastern tropes and storylines that show up all the time. The characters are great, the story gets you caught up in and caring about everything that goes on. It's a visual novel, meaning that it's meant to tell a story rather than deliver a gameplay experience, so if you're looking for a game this is not the place for you. It's short, sweet and to the point, and given it's low, low price that's more than enough.While it may fall short of many other visual novels, Rising Angels: Reborn is one of the best original English language visual novels that i've played and i'm looking forward to what IDHAS studios comes up with in the future.

It also had a good length to it of about three hours, (a bit more if you want all the endings), and included nice art and a good amount of dialogue for each character. It has a decent amount of endings and outcomes which is great for a free game, and all in all I really enjoyed it! I would love to see a sequal!			"

												The fact that you're joining the crew of a military ship that doesn't have any military-oriented equipment should be warning enough about the quality of this game. But, in the tradition of Billy Mays, there's more!The ""chain of command"" in this game is less of a chain and more of a pot of Campbell's Chunky soup. Bonus points go to the creator for confusing army and naval ranks, and/or simply not caring how ranks work.There's a ship named after a noble gas for no apparent reason.The creator seemingly tried to be punny and/or unique with the character and racial names, but they fell flat.The characters themselves are flat like an unfolded box.In short, its a very, VERY poor otome game disguised as a space epic.

												This is not really a game, it's an interactive story. The choices you have are very limited (didn't count but probably around 20 until reaching an ending) but can have a huge impact, especially near the end. So feel free to (quick)save if you want to explore all paths (though you can just skip to the next decision whenever you want to). Is it worth your time? For me it was, but it certainly depends on what you like. The focus on the game is less on action, but rather on characters and their relationships (e.g. girl-on-girl romance :D) as well as exploring the unknown and building all kinds of suspense in a sci-fi space ship environment. The music was nice: versatile and fitting. The race concept Don't let the supposedly cute manga/anime look fool you, the initially light-hearted story becomes actually rather mature and thrilling, because unlike most movies or series (I guess you could compare it a bit with Star Trek or Andromeda), this has multiple endings, allowing twists which can be good, bad or something inbetween and there are several dilemas that have no ""right"" answer.

												While not horrible, It was not that great, and definitely a waste of my time. The main character is stupid and annoying. Her “determination and skill” is an informed ability, in the story she messes up at every turn and how can someone be determined when they are to busy moping about said failures? A bit of a spoiler, but you learn that there is a potential traitor on board, our main character does probably everything wrong and can not hold a proper investigation to save her life.The other characters fair no better, all of them are children who struggle to form a coherent thought. Do not spend your time on this game, I'm sure there is a better graphic novel or fanfiction out there for free.			"

												Less a game and more a virtual novel, much like others have commented, Rising Angels: Reborn has a compelling story and very colorful characters.  It wasn't what I expected, nor did I read reviews beforehand, but it was a good game overall.  TL;DR - It's a good game, engaging, and chock-full of fun tidbits.Pros:-Great cast and detail put into the story's universe (read the Data section; worth it)-Wonderful musical choice.  I only wish it was available in a separate file to listen to outside of the game.-Relatively short.  You won't kill a week playing this (maybe a weekend).-Autosave saves.  You can go back easily to change a particular outcome if you don't want to read through the whole game again.Cons:-Limited replayability.  The plot is relatively set in stone, no matter the player's choice.  Some subtle changes.-Limited roleplaying.  More of an extended comic rather than ""choose your adventure.""  Not much choice divergence or opportunity.			"

												I have to say that in the protagonists shoes i would have killed myself long ago, for a multitude of reasons. Dumb crew, no positives to being a major, and the music is like living in a !@#$ing elevator. Long story short the fact that this has sim as part of the classification is sadly false because if these people were in any way realistic... well then i would encourage nuclear warfare.			"

												This is not the worst game I have played but it is dangerously close to sakura spirit levels of bad. Allow me to explain. Gameplay.The gameplay amounts to a few choices and nothing else. The gameplay is bearly there and what is there are, in my opinion, pointless. This might have been forgiven if the story and characters were amazing but that leads to problem number 2, the story and the characters. The characters and story.The characters are poorly developed and boring and its so easy to guess who the villain is. It also contains a bad romance system that is so half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it makes sick just thinking about it and to top it off some characters are hardly seen, like the engineer, so that when there in danger you dont feel a thing towards them. The story is boring and its barely there because the game is filled with filler dialog and it trys ramp up the stakes by just telling you that the stakes are high.The ArtworkThe Artwork is good and well done and is the best part of the game. Thats it, nothing more.ConclusionThis is not the worst game I have played but the problems just destroys it completely. My advise go play sunrider its free, fun and deeper then this game thats all.

												Wow. I mean, as far as visual-novel-esque games go, this one was amazing. I hope this review will satify my entertaining excitement my heart is bursting with right now, for a free game too!First off, story. Amazing, for what it is and how it is delivered. Also, free game, so the content and quality expectations aren't very high. Spoiler-free, you get transfered from a listening post on a space-rock to your first ship where you have a certain mission that you have to accomplish. The story follows a strict space-ship crew exploring / adventuring. The game was actually pretty lengthy but the actual exploring / adventuring that happens is pretty... Eh. 5.5 hrs is a lot for a free game, though. This is the most I can say without spoiling a single thing.Personally, I feel like the story takes pieces from stuff like Star Trek, Mass Effect, etc. The whole crew is of different races, the world that is described in this game piece-by-piece is suprisingly decent for how much you are given in the game itself, not including the codex in the data options menu. From my understanding, it's your classic world that is held together by alliances between major races and an intergalactic ""senate"", which I think is The Dictators in this game. I may be wrong.Music was amazing. It had the sad heart-felt music. The action-y music. The up-beat ""fun"" music. It just fit wherever it was played. The tracks are short, so they repeat if you don't read fast enough but they were good enough for me to not care.First off, from what I understand, the romance in this game only has a yuri(girl-on-girl romance in japanese or something)/lesbian romance as I've figured out there's only one romance ending. This game has an obligatory romance theme. Not that it's a bad thing because they do it amazingly well and classy. There's no nudity, so you can only expect excellent art and cute pictures whenever you get them, which are few and far between but still worth it when you get them. Of all the characters(unless I'm missing some hidden options), including the one you CAN romance, have the usual archetypes of usual personalities but they were still done pretty well. You're going to have to insult me here because I can't really explain them but they were all great.There's also a pretty cool ""data"" or extras section that has a bunch of codex/info you can read. It's amazing for world-building.This is a short review but overall in said and unsaid words, I would definitely recommend this. It's free and it has an amazing story and atmosphere to it. Obviously don't try it if you're not into visual novels or overal story-orientated games. I'd easily give this game an 8/10. It's not perfect and I feel like a legitimate, money-costing game could be made from this. If a free game like this could give at least 5-10 hours and make me feel like every hour was worth it, then yeah. I'm game. It gave me a Mass Effect amosphere but that might just be me.EDIT: For the romance stuff, not sure. I may be wrong but there MIGHT be only one result and it I don't think it's obligatory. I'm playing through / skippinng through the stuff I haven't read yet to figure this one out but I think there's really only one option. One female, two if you count the not-so-much-a-romance-conlcusion			"

												I'd give this one a pass if you, like me, want to do something more than passively read a story. There is hardly any sense of ""playing"" even for VN standards. In two hours of playing there was only a single point in time when I made a choice. If you cannot affect ""gameplay"" (in the case of VNs, routes, endings, splits in story branches) then what is the point? Incredibly boring.			"

												What did I just witness? Firstly, this is basically a novel. There is very very little interaction. Secondly, it's incredibly poorly written. The characters are unbelievably inept and the entire adventure plays out like you would expect if you put a bunch of fifteen year old junior high school students in charge of a space ship. They all act like small children. At one point you're in a room of officers discussing who has crushes on who. It was very weird. It's bad, it's cringeworthy, it has terrible pacing. Throughout the story most of the characters engage in extremely immature, childlike-banter. This includes when they are in serious and dangerous situations... ""Oh we have a spy on board, I better take a moment out of this staff meeting to discuss how clumsy and silly our security officer is."" What? The important point is that this is a school drama/relationship game. The ancient weapon plot is entirely in the background and barely relevant to what you spend most of your time doing: Gossiping with children.The art is pretty lacking (and kind of weird - furry alert), and the music does not match the text at all. You can be in a really serious part, but the music is all happy, go-lucky. The music not only does not add anything to this game, it seriously detracts from it and is better off muted.I might have liked this game more when I was ten, but probably not since story is incredibly boring. Objectively and subjectively this is a terrible outing for the developer since they took an interesting idea and threw it out the door to instead focus on middle school drama. Hope they have better luck on the sequel.			"

The protagonist.. Just made me feel like she should get shot and it might end up making the story more interesting. That and the fact that she's very opinionated and strict to the books so there wouldn't be a lot of deviation from being the perfect officer.. But this is just my opinion of the game.			"

												If your looking for a fun anime art syle game with interractive storylines and gameplay, than this game will be very dissapointing to you. All it is, is story. It doesnt stop until the end of the game. There is absolutely no exploration, which one of the biggest ingerdients in a good  game, and this has none. Before I installed this game, I thought it was gonna be a little like Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney. I was expecting to have fun. I like anime style games like that.Overall, this game is boring. Sure the story is well thought out, but theres no break. Like I stated before, this game has absolutely no exploration.I was playing this game for over an hour. Still no gameplay. Still no fun.This should be a book or a television show. Not a game. Long story short, Steam should not have made this available at all. Give us a good free game like Infinity Wars or anything before this point. ""Only If"" is better than this. "

												Wowza! So I thought the intro was some text-dialogue. I went through that for about 5 or so minutes. after about 5 minutes of reading every damn thing the screen said, I ran into my FIRST CHOICE!!! Then I got three more.Then I decided, what would happen if I skipped all of the text!, so it just went way fast forward for about seven minutes. In those seven minutes I got three choices. This game is boring. it's a book. pretty much.But really, if you want a good book, go out and buy one. This was a waste of my 13 minutes.			"

												Its more fun than watching Heavens Lost Property.... but that isnt saying much. If your a wierdo who enjoys nothing more than reading seemingly endless dialog in a video game then this is for you. If your like me and prefer such things to remain in book form, then dont bother.			"

												Rather interesting story, but this is barely interactive (Correct me if I got this wrong and it was mostly a visual novel)I have played other interactive novel games where all the time you are making choices.....I have gone over seas of text with only 3 or 4 picks. When I started to get desperate, I just started to fast forward, and about 80 dialog boxes, I get another choice! I wasn't reading, so I don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ to do! If this is an ""Interactive novel"", it doesn't feel as such, it's obviously more a visual novel thing. I have to say....If you like reading slightly cliche anime novels, this might be for you. Sadly, it isn't for me.OH YEAH! It's weeaboo material.			"

												This VN has catpeople (as in cat/human hybrids, not people who love cats), dogpeople, lizardpeople, demons, angels, elves, and hobbits. In space.If that horrible hodgepodge isn't enough to make you cringe, the body language and facial expressions of the characters surely will, because let me tell you, they're ret4rded.Also features a stunning total of about 7 backgrounds (that's what it seems like anyway), and a lame story about getting ""energy"" from crystals (lrn2physics pls) and following your ""heart"", when all you want to do is throw your disobedient, undisciplined subordinates in the brig.This VN might be free, but even so it's not worth the price tag.

												Even for a visual novel, this game is severely lacking in interaction.  Even from just a story standpoint, I didn't enjoy the game.  The main character's ""friend"" is so overtly racist and disgusting, and yet the story treats him like it's just some minor idiosyncrasy that's totally okay?  The sheer cognitive dissonance was too much for me and I just couldn't find the patience to finish the story.			"

												I am not sure whether I got through the intro - or is the game a collection of multiple dialogues via a mouse click? I wouldn`t or couldn`t recommend this software, beacause it dosn`t seem to have a point, or make one. I got very bored reading the character chat via cartoon. If it had been spoken by several actors to make it a drama, [which its not], I could have stuck with it. I have not got to the game, but given the intro, I don`t think i would want to play it anyway. 0 STARS.			"

												This isn't a game .... it's an interactive story.Sure, it's free-to-'play', but trying to sell it as a 'game' doesn't quite fit. I read/watched it for over an hour and had 2 choices. How is that a game?Anyway, the story was interesting enough that i did read it for that long. If this content had been the cutscences for a game with someting else to do, I would have enjoyed it even. That said, the completly static backgrounds/characters, and limited poses of those characters, make this something I myself wont be reading anymore.If you're into that sort of thing, this is probably a good one. If not you should probably look elsewhere... like I'm going to go do now.			"

												well the storyline of this game is very catchy and I like how it pulls me into it and keeps my attention and I have ADHD and I have a short attention span so if a game is boring I kinda stop playing it and push it aside and find something new but this game's storyline is simply amazing and so are the characters personally Zurie is my favorite character so I chose to be best friends with her lol BUT there is one HUGE issue I want to point out this game is mainly about talking all I'm doing is clicking to make every conversation move on ahead and to me that is frustrating I like games that have aventure and let you explore around the ship and talk to different crew members anytime you want before talking to the person your suppose to talk to sorry I'm just a player who likes action and I didn't get any of that it was all just talking and making choices as you go along now the making choices part is interesting it challenges your leading skills and needless to say I'm not a good leader the game made that very clear to me xD but I like how your crew supports you no matter what and they even put they're lives in your hand...um pressure much? xD anyways I'm not too sure if I would recomend this game for anyone to play but if you like games that have nothing but talking and choices to make then this game is for you lol but be warned there isn't a saving button that I can see so if you get out of the game and you have gotten really far into it watch out it WILL RESTART THE WHOLE GAME on you..I know because I made a horrible choice in that game and I decided to get out of it then get back in it to see if I could change my choice but it didn't instead it put me back at the begining again and it took me ALL DAY to get to where I was before so that was very angering and it made me rage quit and delete from my list of games in my library so again if you think this game is amazing looking or cool looking I highly suggest you think it over before installing it but if you do play it and find a  save button anywhere please tell me because I would really apreciate it and I might start playing it again if it does have a saving button other than a quick save button.

												At the beginning, I thought this game was an RPG that had a REALLY LONG starting cutscene, but it turned out that it was an interactive storybook. I do not reccommend this game if you don't like reading rather corny dialogues, as it has a LOT of that. also, just to give you a fair heads-up, this book (not game, as it isn't a game, it's just a digital book with a trivial choice here and there) is fairly short and very well-worth the time spent to play it. which is about...oh....maybe two or three hours? it took me about seven, but I click slowly, so....yeah. the soundtrack was mostly boring, but one song was WAY too 'action-packed' for a book like this. the presentation wasn't entirely what I had hoped for, and the characters lacked the level of depth that I am used to.Not to say this book was BAD or anything; I rather enjoyed it. It's just that it seems rather...lacking. still, not bad for free. when I finished reading, it said I had ""ending three"". implying that there are at least three endings. I rather like multiple ending-stuff, actually....however, I am still yet unsure whether or not I'll hit that 'uninstall button' yet. Playing as a special operative named 'Natalie', I find it odd how you almost never get to see the main protagonist, beyond a facial portrait. Still, I decided to stick with it until the end, because I don't leave things unfinished. As for this book, I am thoroughly unimpressed, even for a ""FTR"" book. (Free-To-Read.) it wasn't as bad as MOST novels nowadays, but the storytelling was dry, the tense action-parts had no excitement, the mystery-parts had almost no challenge, et cetera. I do not wish to give any spoilers, in case you want to try, then please, be my guest! go ahead. it costs nothing, and was a minor amusement while it lasted. but I'll have slightly lower expectations from part 2.I was expecting an RPG, because everyone was calling it an RPG when they reccommended it to me. what I found instead was a use for a windowed operation to be running while I do resolution tests for my monitor, and RP-chat with friends online in the background. Sadly, I cannot think of any ""good points"" for this book beyond that the main protagonist, the aforementioned 'Natalie', is slightly visually attractive. but if I wanted 'attractive visuals' and 'eye-pleasing female protagonists', I'd go watch the Vocaloids do their thing.It DID have some nice artwork in it, however....again, not saying much.

												This is a visual novel. Visual novels often disappoint me, but this one exceeds my expectations.You get to make a lot of decisions, and many more than a lot of pay for visual novels. Each decision changes the rest of the game, and that means that replaying is a must. You get to know each character, and listen to funny dialogue. Very interesting plot. In all honesty, this game is free, with many hours of gameplay. Have fun!10/10			"

												Disclosure: I have a high tolerance for anime animal people.  Also, this was the first 'visual novel' I've played through.In the past, I had kept away from visual novels, expecting them to be a creepy waste of time and money.   However, this one was free and I figured I had less to lose by giving it a shot.  I'll be vague to avoid spoiling story!I was hoping for an interesting story.  In my opinion, it delivered!  I also had extremely low expectations for gameplay, but it exceeded those expectations with some rare opportunities to choose the protagonist's response which could alter the story in some interesting ways.  After trying most of those options and triggering many things, I was further amused.In hindsight, I think I had previously become jaded about games/stories offering story choices, particularly games that had hyped the importantce of choices but failed to deliver both choice and importance (I'M LOOKIN' AT YOU, FABLE.)  For me, this story has rekindled an interest, and I'll find out whether or not I regret that interest later.To me, the three main drawbacks of this title are that parts of the story can feel a little forced, sometimes the behavior of the military characters can feel immersion-breaking, and in some cases there were typos and incorrect words used.  Taking the whole work into consideration, those faults seemed quite trivial and forgivable (and frankly my english isn't perfect either.)Final notes:-Once inside the game, the ""Data"" button can offer some backstory/worldbuilding.-During my replays, I never noticed the ""skip"" settings doing anything when I changed them, but I may just be confused about them.I would recommend Rising Angels: Reborn, though probably not to kids considering the story can get pretty dark.

												I would have to say that it’s a charming VN, first and foremost, and would probably deserved some of my money for all the effort and writing put into it. Mind, it isn’t enough to warrant being called a masterpiece, but I would most definitely recommend this to people looking for a good VN.There are five endings, with only the dying ones being particularly bad (and even then, it’s on the grey; it’s a morality issue/reflection). It’s not so hard to get ‘100%’ or what counts for it (completing the gallery since there are no achievements, and probably seeing all the endings) since the choices are obvious but at the same time impactful; they’re not the dreary and mindless ‘pick A for this ending and pick B for this ending’ kind we’re sometimes saddled with and you do have to put some effort into thinking what choice would get you where you want. Mostly, though, there are many choices where it’s hard to say which was the ‘right’ choice - the whole thing deals with differing views of morality and who to trust. In summary, the art is simple (not overtly beautiful, but not ugly; somewhere above passable), the music is agreeable (didn’t really stand out, but I think it did the work justice), the writing is well done (if a tad uncreative at some parts, but it is pretty well-written and gives you much to think about), and the decision points are the exact thing you want out of a Visual Novel (especially with how the decisions reflect on you as a person and your personal take on what should be done, encompassing morality, authority, loyalty, et al.).I can say I enjoyed going through this. I’d give it a solid 7/10 overall, but about an 8/10 where it matters (for the genre).			"

												I have played a lot of VNs but this one is in my top 10 VNs i would pay 10$ USD to get this game. Now as for story it was well done and there is little left to want form it for me that is may not be for you. the art is some of the better work i have seen. as for music i have found few VNs with good music this is one of the few.

												The story of this visual novel is fun and thoughtful. Your character spends her time making tough choices while learning about herself in the process. She has a whole crew of people to get to know, each with their own interesting stories and unique personalities. Yet when things start going amiss she finds herself in a struggle of trusting the people that she wants to believe in. If you love stories like this, playing the game more than once reveals so much more about your new friends each step you take. Over all the art is much better than most games in this genre, and you have a great story to be explored as well. I look forward to enjoying more titles from this series.			"

												This is a beautiful game. The characters are well drawn the colours vibriant and the storyline is awesome. Enough action and drama to keep anyone happy. I have to say no other game like this has ever made me cry like this one, you really identify with the characters and feel what they feel. I couldnt pull myself away and ran though the story in one night! However that was just one ending. IM not sure how many endings this has but im sure to find out. Its a free game and it keeps you content when you dont feel like the working too hard or getting stressed from dying in other games.			"

												Hi.This is my FIRST review of a game. So sorry if I'm not as good as others.I'm a fan of Anime and visual novels.What can I tell about this game? I played it a while ago. So it is not just played review. But what I can tell I enjoyed this game and its story line. It was better then I have expected :) I have wantted it to be longer, but still. It is not one of thous short ones. Charexters are good. They all have their own charisma and diferent races. Do not remember if there is diferent endings (sorry, it was a while since I played it).So I'm realy pleased with this game and grateful for this games.And maybe there will be a continue of a story line? :)So I realy recond this game for someone who likse this type of games.

												At the beginning, I thought this game was an RPG that had a REALLY LONG starting cutscene, but it turned out that it was an interactive storybook. I do not reccommend this game if you don't like reading rather corny dialogues, as it has a LOT of that. also, just to give you a fair heads-up, this book (not game, as it isn't a game, it's just a digital book with a trivial choice here and there) is fairly short and very well-worth the time spent to play it. which is about...oh....maybe two or three hours? it took me about seven, but I click slowly, so....yeah. the soundtrack was mostly boring, but one song was WAY too 'action-packed' for a book like this. the presentation wasn't entirely what I had hoped for, and the characters lacked the level of depth that I am used to.Not to say this book was BAD or anything; I rather enjoyed it. It's just that it seems rather...lacking. still, not bad for free. when I finished reading, it said I had ""ending three"". implying that there are at least three endings. I rather like multiple ending-stuff, actually....however, I am still yet unsure whether or not I'll hit that 'uninstall button' yet. Playing as a special operative named 'Natalie', I find it odd how you almost never get to see the main protagonist, beyond a facial portrait. Still, I decided to stick with it until the end, because I don't leave things unfinished. As for this book, I am thoroughly unimpressed, even for a ""FTR"" book. (Free-To-Read.) it wasn't as bad as MOST novels nowadays, but the storytelling was dry, the tense action-parts had no excitement, the mystery-parts had almost no challenge, et cetera. I do not wish to give any spoilers, in case you want to try, then please, be my guest! go ahead. it costs nothing, and was a minor amusement while it lasted. but I'll have slightly lower expectations from part 2.I was expecting an RPG, because everyone was calling it an RPG when they reccommended it to me. what I found instead was a use for a windowed operation to be running while I do resolution tests for my monitor, and RP-chat with friends online in the background. Sadly, I cannot think of any ""good points"" for this book beyond that the main protagonist, the aforementioned 'Natalie', is slightly visually attractive. but if I wanted 'attractive visuals' and 'eye-pleasing female protagonists', I'd go watch the Vocaloids do their thing.It DID have some nice artwork in it, however....again, not saying much.

												 What a find for me! I really like this game. For me, when I start to play a game, I want to get a feeling that just grabs me. Sometimes that happens right away and sometimes it takes awhile. It this case it happened almost right away. I found myself getting into the characters right away and really liking the way this was handled. The only thing I had that was a bit of a problem was that starting resolution was correct but in a window and I had to make it fullscreen. The game gave me an option for this and it popped right up to full screen at 1366x768 my monitor's default res.  Since I just played it for awhile, I look forward to playing it longer when I have more time (Was hard to stop!). It looks great.			"

												I thought this was a decent read for a free game.  I'm not really into Yuri so that aspect of it didn't really amaze me but it was still interesting enough.  The 'bad guy' and overall mystery was easy to call imo but I feel that way about most mystery's so I can't really knock it too much for that either.I do wish there were more romance options, or alternate stories depending on choices.  The lack of many defining choices would probably be my largest complaint in this game.  I like having a lot of different options when I play this style of game.  Overall it felt more like a sci-fi novel with pretty pics than an interactive game.  The complaints above aside, I'd say it's worth the read - particularly as it's free.  It was a good way to spend my free afternoon.  I don't regret having given it a shot.			"

												Nice VN with nice story, good graphics and solid sounds (no voice acting thou) and surprising its free (seen VN on sale that had worse story, bad graphic and also no voice acting).While its multi-ending its just one good ending (and one semi good) while the rest are bad endings. The good thing is you are quickly shown that you made wrong decision and get bad ending, so no need to replay half of the game for same decision.Unlike most VN there are only hints of romance, but even those are bordering friendship. Depends on what you like, I personaly hoped for more romance. "

Posted: November 3, 2015
												Where to start?I'm making this review having played through the game only once, having gotten the ""true end."" I'll try to keep spoilers at the very bottom below a warning. Characters: I have to agree with another review long before this. Three characters, at LEAST, wouldn't last long in an actual military situation. It's kind of possible to wave it off as Sol covering for them because they're trustable when it counts, but it still takes a lot of suspension of disbelief. As far as VN games go, it's not outside the acceptable for two of them. But Spoiler doesn't even fit into that. The main character is pretty good, though some of the choices she makes are insane, and that she doesn't figure out a few of the issues is pathetic with how obvious they are. The other characters are good, at least as far as characters go, but they have the same issues of ignoring obvious answers. Speaking of obvious answers with the characters, it would take the antithesis of Sherlock Holmes to fail to figure out who it is early on. Hint: Spoiler. All in all, enjoyable. Art: Hit and miss, really. Most of it is pretty good, some is great, and some is passable. All in the same picture, in one case. Again, it's good overall.Story: Basically, you're isolated to a single ship of a few people on a single mission that spirals out of control due in part to your failure. You go to the surface twice, with one instance possibly resulting in death. Having only played through once, I don't know if the choice in question gets you killed or not. The thing that you're looking for doesn't quite make sense, because it's from a dead civilization, yet Spoiler, despite it Spoiler.Sound: I can't really comment. I played with sound off. Overall, it's a good game with good art, good characters, and a good story. For a free game, I definitely recommend it. It's worth more playthroughs, and I'll definitely being going through it some more. ------Spoilers------The doctor is totally unbelievable. He doesn't know anything with medicine, apparently, he actively tries to prevent the medical treatment of an injured character and nobody bats an eye, and he's so clearly the bad guy that there's no tension. Even his ""grand plan"" is obvious. Poison the poisened character with a fake antidote and do it all for money. Not to mention that he SOMEHOW has something that can make someone's organs break down just sitting on the ship. Yeah, the smuggling issue sort of covers that, but surely something that bad would be regulated and require the captain to know about it. SOMETHING. Hint: IT'S THE DEMON WHO IS TOTALLY INCOMPETENT YET SOMEHOW IS OF HIGHER RANK THAN THE MAIN CHARACTER. THE ONE WHO IS CLEARLY LOOKS EVIL ON THE START SCREEN.It affects what's used for modern space travel despite the thing it affecting never being said to have other uses (other than ship radios) and only being found in three places throughout the whole galaxy.(Edit) Another spoiler that strains suspension of disbelief. After Stan killed someone, held a gun to Nat's head, tried to kill everyone on the ship, and poisoned Faye, shooting him causes Nat to lose herself. No option to keep the crystal to avoid the government getting it, no option to destroy it even though it wasn't being used in the engine, nothing. Just Nat and Zuri being depressed for the rest of their lives. That's just... too hard to believe. Further, choosing to hand over the crystal to the government says that the crystal was used for the engine even if it wasn't. Not huge, but one of a few small issues.			"

												I'm going to recommend this day after playing through multiple endings today. First: The characters as just people are fun, and when not likeable are at least enjoyable as antagonists or annoyances. Secondly: They... don't really act very strictly military. Partially, this is explained or at least commented on in-universe. Sol, this ships XO and the protagonist's friend, is constantly frustrated by his backwater no-name ship's crew and their lack of discipline. The ship itself? Small, and as you will learn, poorly equipped and outfitted. Some of the lack of professionalism in the crew can be explained by the fact that, honestly, you're serving on a ship in the dregs.The Art is mostly good. Character sprites, at least, are good. It's a VN, so don't expect them to be too dynamic, but damn the Zuri sprites are expressive and honestly it just made me like her a ton. Music is okay? Honestly the music is the weakest part. It's a VN, so that's not the worst sin, but a great VN has great music. It's not Juniper's Knot. The menu music is like super emo-kid Mayday Parade sounding, which personally I like but I know will make others roll their eyes.The Story? Good. This is pretty decent sci-fi, but do NOT expect hard scifi. And that's fine. Social SF is a thing, it's totally a thing, and this is what it looks like. You are tasked with uncovering a mystery both outside your ship, in the dark of space, and... well, you'll see. The investigation requires you to make a few choices, some of which seem kind of innocent at first. The innocent choices having later ramifcations is actually really interesting and refreshing. The foreshadowing is there, which is nice, but its a bit heavy handed. Overall? It's a decent story that has a lot of potential to be expanded upon in the SEQUEL that will be coming eventually. tl;dr: play it! It's free, it's fun, it's surprisingly good for a free game and a free Visual novel at that. You can make kissu faces at a cute dragon girl, save the universe, shoot people, and be on a crew with a space elf commander! Super fun. Godspeed.			"

												A short, free, character-driven space operetta visual novel.  If any of those things appeal to you, you would do yourself a disservice by not giving this game a try.  While shorter and with a smaller scope than Sunrider (the other free space-based VN), it presents an engaging story and believable, well-developed characters.  Even though it has no voice acting, I could hear Kika's voice in my head with each of her lines.  I found myself rooting for the characters, and I hope you will give them an opportunity too.			"

												Heeeey!! Pretty good game! I thought the plot was really good (except for the parts I thought everybody was suspicious XD). But yea! I got 2 endings by now and I am not sure how many there are but I intend on totally finding out :P The only things I would improve to make this game a 10/10 would be voice acting, a bit more of choices (maybe allow more interations with all characters in the game) and a little less of the ""warrior warrior"" talk all the time... (I thought it was a bit much). But for a free game it's AMAZING! Congratulations for the team who designed it! And I am anxious for the sequel!! (which seems to be coming soon!! - HOPEFULLY!)			"

												Where to start...geez. This is probably one of the best things I've played recently. Good mix of humor, serous topics, and important descisions. Got three of the endings (inclusing true ending) going back to get the rest. I really loved the unique soundtrack and all the different character personalities. I will be supporting the Fates Kickstarter for sure, and would recomend this to anyone who enjoys sci-fi/fantasy sims. I look forward very, very much to Fates release.			"

												I'm going to recommend this day after playing through multiple endings today. First: The characters as just people are fun, and when not likeable are at least enjoyable as antagonists or annoyances. Secondly: They... don't really act very strictly military. Partially, this is explained or at least commented on in-universe. Sol, this ships XO and the protagonist's friend, is constantly frustrated by his backwater no-name ship's crew and their lack of discipline. The ship itself? Small, and as you will learn, poorly equipped and outfitted. Some of the lack of professionalism in the crew can be explained by the fact that, honestly, you're serving on a ship in the dregs.The Art is mostly good. Character sprites, at least, are good. It's a VN, so don't expect them to be too dynamic, but damn the Zuri sprites are expressive and honestly it just made me like her a ton. Music is okay? Honestly the music is the weakest part. It's a VN, so that's not the worst sin, but a great VN has great music. It's not Juniper's Knot. The menu music is like super emo-kid Mayday Parade sounding, which personally I like but I know will make others roll their eyes.The Story? Good. This is pretty decent sci-fi, but do NOT expect hard scifi. And that's fine. Social SF is a thing, it's totally a thing, and this is what it looks like. You are tasked with uncovering a mystery both outside your ship, in the dark of space, and... well, you'll see. The investigation requires you to make a few choices, some of which seem kind of innocent at first. The innocent choices having later ramifcations is actually really interesting and refreshing. The foreshadowing is there, which is nice, but its a bit heavy handed. Overall? It's a decent story that has a lot of potential to be expanded upon in the SEQUEL that will be coming eventually. tl;dr: play it! It's free, it's fun, it's surprisingly good for a free game and a free Visual novel at that. You can make kissu faces at a cute dragon girl, save the universe, shoot people, and be on a crew with a space elf commander! Super fun. Godspeed.			"

												Just downloaded the game because I like to play around in the free section cause I'm poor. Saw the space ship theme and kinda >.> well jumped on it. It's very, very Anime and not so much true blue Military story but hey? With that cover art what do you expect? Over all I loved the music, I really liked the art (even the sometimes not so good art), and became enthralled in the story much more than I thought I would. Over all its not a polished game at all... but it's free so... yeah... that's like complaining over someone giving you a five dollar bill and telling you ""Your ugly"" It's and awkward thanks, but it's still a thanks. ... That analogy was a little of a stretch but my point stands. Personally I would love to see a continuation of this series, and would even be willing to put my limited money where my mouth is. It's a much better game than I thought it would be, and so far I'm leaving it installed on my desktop for future play throughs. It was a fun game, not for everyone, but I enjoyed it.			"

												 As a free to play novel I the game is worth downloading for a play through or two.  The numerous typos, and a volume option for speech/vocals that doesn't seem to server any purpose, left me wondering if the release was rushed or badly translated.I didn't dislike or like this game, but still found it entertaining overall.In full disclosure I must admit that I tried to play through more than once trying to avoid the romance ending.  I must be doing something wrong because no matter what choices I've made the romance happened anyway.   The story isn't bad, but too many of the player judgement/decision points only give the player two choices limiting the game's replay value in my opinion. As free to play I think the game is ok, and worth the price.  However, based on my feelings of the production quality put into I'm not planning on contributing antything to the kickstarter announced in the news section, and wouldn't recommend this game if it wasn't free to play.

												Nice VN with nice story, good graphics and solid sounds (no voice acting thou) and surprising its free (seen VN on sale that had worse story, bad graphic and also no voice acting).While its multi-ending its just one good ending (and one semi good) while the rest are bad endings. The good thing is you are quickly shown that you made wrong decision and get bad ending, so no need to replay half of the game for same decision.Unlike most VN there are only hints of romance, but even those are bordering friendship. Depends on what you like, I personaly hoped for more romance. "

												This was a really well done game. Especially for one that is free to play. While there were not a lot of choices to be made, those that did pop up really held weight within the story. The story itself was captivating and engaging. I didn't want it to end! The art style was pretty strong compared to some other free to play games. There were only a max of 2 instances where the anatomy was a little wonky to me. They were in two of the full frame images with characters interacting outside of the standard poses. And it was very minor. But otherwise, I thought the character designs were solid and consistant.The music was also appropriate to the moods within the scenes and the loops for long scenes did not have any jarring dead space when the loop started again. The music transitions between scenes/moods were fairly decent as well. The jump between was not too sudden, so it didn't break my immersion.I also enjoyed that the main character is female. There are so few games with a female main character, and of those there are even fewer that have a character that has a solid personality while still allowing the player to make choices that would align with both what the player wanted to do and what the character herself would choose to do. I found that to be most excellent and refreshing.I didn't try all the romances, yet, but I did romance the only female character. She was just too adorable to resist! Their interactions were solid and the buildup of the relationship seemed genuine. Excellent character development. It was so fluffy! I really loved how their budding relationship was portrayed. It gave me all the feels! Haha!All in all, it was a delightful space based story that can be completed in under 6 hours. Keep in mind that this does not include romancing all characters and getting all endings. But that can vary from player to player.I would love to play any sequel to this, though it appears that there is a prequel. (More research is needed on my part before going any further on that topic.)9/10 in my book and I definitely would recommend this game to others.			"

Rising Angels: Reborn is a Visual Novel with a lot of heart and enthusiasm, but the characterization can be weak.Overall, I did like the story, but there was more bickering than useful work being done on this ship, even between friends.  It creates tension when each crew member is different and they don't necessarily like one another.  It was hard to take seriously when conflicts played out and reminded me of childish fights with a sibling.The ideas of the different alien cultures are good, the gradual reveal of the Dreamon culture was good.  The characters themselves don't have a lot of subtlety, though, and show their hands before the time is right in the plot.It's odd that most of the crew are as unorganized as they are, even for rookies.  Perhaps it's that in similarly-themed series (Star Trek: TNG or Mass Effect), even the most inexperienced crew members are more organized, at least once the mission or survival is of primary importance.It was fun to see other choices and variations on further playthroughs, as the situations you end up in are fun to see, unfortunately some choices won't change a lot of the story.There aren't many choices for a love interest. It feels like you could have had more. The Main Character is only interested in women. Shame for anyone who may find the men interesting.This game puts an interesting spin on doomsday cliches, but I can't help but compare because I have a lot of Visual Novel and Sci-Fi media experience.  I wish the developers the best.  If you're looking for sci-fi stories that can be challenging, this VN is maddeningly close, but not quite there.TL;DR: This game is good in concept and execution, despite weak characterization.  Play it at least once if you love VNs, because it has something fun and unique to offer despite its flaws. "

												I enjoyed this visual novel and would have spent money on it, not too much though as it is a little short. I really liked the music. The graphics were a nice style although could have been drawn a little better. The spaceship setting with mythological races in it appeals to me as a fan of science fantasy, a lot of the character designs reminded me of Star Ocean, especially the main character who really does look and sound like Iria. The personalities of the characters are... kinda goofy but I prefer that style to realism. I have only seen one ending, which was uplifting and kinda adorable.			"

												I overall enjoyed it, the art was decent. The characters wern't flawless, and at times were extreamly annoying. For working on a military ship a majority of the characters didn't act like they had any military training. If you'r looking for romance routes there only seems to be one, although I would consider the route to be more platonic than romantic. The choices you get to make in the game are mostly minimal in the begging, it's only near the end that your choices dictate your route. If your looking for a short visual novel this is for you.			"

												I recommend this game, but I will freely admit that it will be very hit and miss depending on what kind of games and stories people like. Here's some basic points to touch on (I'm going to skip rating the story itself to prevent spoilers in such a small game; suffice to say that I liked it)Gameplay:Nonexistent. This is the epitome of a visual novel, click to advance text and watch the story unfold and occasionally you will be given a choice of actions to take. Some choices only let you hear varying lines of new dialogue, and others will affect which of the endings you will end up seeing. If you aren't a fan of visual novels, this one isn't inventive enough to change your mind and it will likely be the first thing someone can use as an excuse to avoid this game.Characters:I find the characters varied and they can be fun to interact with. Al and Sol are rather bland, but the hyperactive security officer Zuri and timid engineer Kylie can have some good moments. My only real complaints are that 1) the game isn't really long enough to flesh out any characters other than Kika and/or Zuri and 2) there aren't really enough opportunities presented that let the characters act as meaningful foils to play off of each other.My own personal bias towards the game will certainly be placed in this category. I personally resonated with Natalie's story and personality; not just her ""Why does everyone else get the fun jobs when I'm so much better suited than them?"" attitude. No, I mean the entire thing, mistakes an harsh self-realizations included.Linguistics:Okay, time to be brutally honest. While this feels like a natively English script rather than a translation like most visual novels are, there are a few typos (particularly later in the story) that can really be a distraction. I've dealt with far worse scripts in my time playing these kinds of games, but there were a few sentences that had me scratching my head trying to figure out what they meant before I realized it was simply a script error.

												Ah, this is a very debatable game as to whether this is an actual game or not.  Do the dialogue choices matter?  Do they change how the story unfolds?  I'm not sure.  All I know is that this is more or less borderline.It's up to who plays it considers what it is.Art style is nice, however.			"

												An interesting visual novel distributed free of charge by the developer.  It does have a minor bug near the end where a certain choice loops into another choice which doesn't make any sense in continuity.  There were basically two yuri (girl x girl relationship paths) to pursue and about 8 endings which can be picked up from in the sequel.   I recommend checking it out at the very least - especially if you enjoy manga-esque flavors.			"

												I overall enjoyed it, the art was decent. The characters wern't flawless, and at times were extreamly annoying. For working on a military ship a majority of the characters didn't act like they had any military training. If you'r looking for romance routes there only seems to be one, although I would consider the route to be more platonic than romantic. The choices you get to make in the game are mostly minimal in the begging, it's only near the end that your choices dictate your route. If your looking for a short visual novel this is for you.			"

												I recommend this game, but I will freely admit that it will be very hit and miss depending on what kind of games and stories people like. Here's some basic points to touch on (I'm going to skip rating the story itself to prevent spoilers in such a small game; suffice to say that I liked it)Gameplay:Nonexistent. This is the epitome of a visual novel, click to advance text and watch the story unfold and occasionally you will be given a choice of actions to take. Some choices only let you hear varying lines of new dialogue, and others will affect which of the endings you will end up seeing. If you aren't a fan of visual novels, this one isn't inventive enough to change your mind and it will likely be the first thing someone can use as an excuse to avoid this game.Characters:I find the characters varied and they can be fun to interact with. Al and Sol are rather bland, but the hyperactive security officer Zuri and timid engineer Kylie can have some good moments. My only real complaints are that 1) the game isn't really long enough to flesh out any characters other than Kika and/or Zuri and 2) there aren't really enough opportunities presented that let the characters act as meaningful foils to play off of each other.My own personal bias towards the game will certainly be placed in this category. I personally resonated with Natalie's story and personality; not just her ""Why does everyone else get the fun jobs when I'm so much better suited than them?"" attitude. No, I mean the entire thing, mistakes an harsh self-realizations included.Linguistics:Okay, time to be brutally honest. While this feels like a natively English script rather than a translation like most visual novels are, there are a few typos (particularly later in the story) that can really be a distraction. I've dealt with far worse scripts in my time playing these kinds of games, but there were a few sentences that had me scratching my head trying to figure out what they meant before I realized it was simply a script error. At time's like these, it feels less like the native script I mentioned and more like a good fan-sub that unfortunately didn't have enough time to proofread their later files before hitting deadline of some sort. This doesn't make the game unplayable by any means, but given that I've seen people condemn perfectly good games for far less, I felt I needed to come clean and mention it.Art: The visual presentation of the characters feels distinctly different from the raw anime/manga-inspired designs I've gotten used to, but I can't say that this style is bad. The characters all look pretty nice, and the backgrounds are pleasing to the eye...I still can't understand why anyone would curl their hair into drill shapes though. That will forever be an artistic mystery lost upon my uncultured upbringing I guess.Music:Appropriate for the settings. No individually memorable pieces, but I always felt it was enhancing the mood, not hindering it.Price: The game's free. Look, if you are on the edge about this game to read reviews about it, then get it. It will cost you no money, and it's not some huge, meandering AAA game that takes an ungodly amount of time to finally get into the main plot. I went on a 100% run without a walkthrough or any outside resources and completed everything in (*looks at logged playtime*) six hours.

												This game has taken my breath away.Even though I haven't finished it yet (though, I'm almost at that point, I think), I can't believe how amazing it is! Everything is smooth, and despite a few sentences that could have been worded better, the game is just amazing. Every moment has you on the edge of your seat, waiting to find out whether it ends well or not. There's humor, quirky characters, and drastic plot twists at every turn. One moment, you think you might have done something to save everyone and get a happy ending, but as the story progresses, the main character, the other characters, and yourself are always questioning whether what is being done is right.I also enjoyed how everything was questioned as it was. The characters never once just made assumptions, unless they were ones that they had no choice but to make. You never felt at ease and never felt ""safe"" unless the creators of this masterpiece wanted you to.Though, I was surprised by the lack of choices presented. For the most part, you feel like you're reading a story rather than playing a game. However, when you did make big decisions, they reminded me of Mass Effect and how EVERY decision you made affected the outcome, and not in little ways either.With all of that said, I would definitely recommend playing this game. And why wouldn't you? It's free and compatible with just about everything computer related. There would be nothing to lose, but quite an enjoyable ride to gain.(On a side note, I'm also looking forward to more games by these people thanks to being introduced to this one.)			"

												Simply one of the best visual novels i've played till date.without babbling for two hours like I usually do, i'll just write the pros and cons+amazing art+Interesting character design+Good story that never fails to stay interesting, even when the characters like to talk about silly things at times.+Great story, the characters feel very alive as they all have belivable personalities.-It sometimes feels like the main character is...useless... throught the story, the main character does nothing but tell them how to do their jobs and looking around.-there are very limited choices, and when there actually IS a choice, it comes around to be irrelevant (except one near the end).The characters feel unprofessional (an opinion, not letting this affect my rating).-I really disliked that in one part in the story, there was a big issue that was left unsolved and untalked about, it felt like the main character just decided to drop the problem until it's necessary for the story to unveil it again.all in all this game was simply a great experience, even with the setbacks that stop this from being the best visual novel ever created, you must give this game a try.8.7/10 "

												I finished this game today! I'm actually glad I did. I scored the good ending! But, time to back track and see what else is in store for the many other endings. I was expecting to see a lot more info about the characters and their past. I'd like to more about characters before I actually begin to adore them. Just knowing the kind of things they've been through is what a makes a character alive. But, since we are playing as Natalie Puccile, the main character, there really isn't any of that unless the others wish to share it themselves. I'm going to try playing it again to see what other endings there are if I didn't choose what I did. I like the characters and the idea of it being in space and the unique races there are. At first, I was completely skeptical about the game when I looked at the reviews, so I gave it a follow and downloaded it to give it a chance. And I did. Surprisingly, some of the characters weren't as annoying as I expected. There were times where I got annoyed but they didn't show up as often so there was no need to feel angry or irrate by them. I really feel there should be more times where we can decide instead of having certain situations where we SHOULD respond instead of it giving us the 'go' signal at unsuspecting times. There were times where I really wished I could choose a way. The art was easy on the eyes and the characters were nicely drawn. Although, there were times where you saw another bit of artwork but it looked a bit different from the current ones you see at every dialogue. Hopefully, it will look a bit better once part two of the game is out. I also appreciated that there wasn't any fanservice as any anime-related game would have. The girls wore modest uniforms and they all had normal, human proportions despite some of them being of a different species. Nor was there any kind of perverse ideas from the colonel, he was just odd and suspicious (which concludes why our main heroine lacks trust in him). I hope once part two is out, there will be more things for us and maybe some new and old characters that we will to love. I look forward to playing Fate.			"

												An overall interesting game. When I first looked at it, I was questioning whether or not to play it. I wasn't keen on the preview at first, and thought the art looked kinda ""Meh"". In the end, I decided I had nothing to lose by playing it, since it's free, and decided to give it a shot.I'm glad I did. The art kinda grew on me pretty quickly, and the characters were interesting, if some of them were a little cliche. The real highlight of this, however, is the story. It was tense, and had a lot of interesting points to it. Some of the options in-game didn't feel like they affected the outcome as much, but the number of options given overall still made it feel like I had control of the story. I only did one playthrough, so I can't speak for it's replayability, but it seems like the story would change a lot with a few other options taken, so I believe it should have decent replayability.I would definitely suggest giving it a try.

												The story of this visual novel is fun and thoughtful. Your character spends her time making tough choices while learning about herself in the process. She has a whole crew of people to get to know, each with their own interesting stories and unique personalities. Yet when things start going amiss she finds herself in a struggle of trusting the people that she wants to believe in. If you love stories like this, playing the game more than once reveals so much more about your new friends each step you take. Over all the art is much better than most games in this genre, and you have a great story to be explored as well. I look forward to enjoying more titles from this series.			"

												Simply one of the best visual novels i've played till date.without babbling for two hours like I usually do, i'll just write the pros and cons+amazing art+Interesting character design+Good story that never fails to stay interesting, even when the characters like to talk about silly things at times.+Great story, the characters feel very alive as they all have belivable personalities.-It sometimes feels like the main character is...useless... throught the story, the main character does nothing but tell them how to do their jobs and looking around.-there are very limited choices, and when there actually IS a choice, it comes around to be irrelevant (except one near the end).The characters feel unprofessional (an opinion, not letting this affect my rating).-I really disliked that in one part in the story, there was a big issue that was left unsolved and untalked about, it felt like the main character just decided to drop the problem until it's necessary for the story to unveil it again.all in all this game was simply a great experience, even with the setbacks that stop this from being the best visual novel ever created, you must give this game a try.8.7/10 "

												Rising Angels: Reborn is a visual novel. It's like reading a book with choice: phrase a => go to page X, phrase b => go to page Y. The game features nice graphics and a lot of text but not so many choices. I have been playing other visual novels, with rpg or strategy elements. Nothing like that is here, but the characters are nice, not black/white (I don't mean graphics colors) and the plot is interesting. If you like visual novels genre - try it, if you are not familiar with games like that - why not try it, if you are action gamer... keep looking for another game.			"

												A solid, Star Trek-like (feels somewhat inspired) visual novel. If you like sci-fi stories in that non-action-y sense, this is worth a read.One of the better VN's i've read despite its flaws (such as some of the characters being either a bit or far too underdeveloped and obvious; the admittedly basic plot; and fairly regular grammar errors), but the characters that were focused on did get a fair bit of background and character development, and I ended up liking most of them (pretty much all elicited an emotional reaction/attachment in some way).Some of the choices matter (there are several bad and a couple good endings), and overall it was a pleasant story.

												For a free VN, it's definitely really good. The art is a little inconsistent at times, but it's still fairly good. The story was enjoyable but nothing incredibly groundbreaking, and the characters were all right. Certain characters got more development than others, and their personalities are very tropey (as is the whole plot in general). It's worth at least one or two runthroughs, but as other reviews have mentioned it's a bit lacking in interactivity so it'll probably not be worth much more than that.I will personally be looking out for the sequel.

												I found this visual novel great to go through and the story was very engaging. There are only a few choices in the game but that to me makes it easier to see the different ending that the game has. The character art is good and all the characters in the story play an important role and for each you learn a little bit about their past. The background art is a little bit to on the grey side for me, but then it is a spaceship you are on, but it is well balanced with scenes that doesn't happen on the ship. I highly recommend this VN if you like VN.			"

												I would have to say that it’s a charming VN, first and foremost, and would probably deserved some of my money for all the effort and writing put into it. Mind, it isn’t enough to warrant being called a masterpiece, but I would most definitely recommend this to people looking for a good VN.There are five endings, with only the dying ones being particularly bad (and even then, it’s on the grey; it’s a morality issue/reflection). It’s not so hard to get ‘100%’ or what counts for it (completing the gallery since there are no achievements, and probably seeing all the endings) since the choices are obvious but at the same time impactful; they’re not the dreary and mindless ‘pick A for this ending and pick B for this ending’ kind we’re sometimes saddled with and you do have to put some effort into thinking what choice would get you where you want. Mostly, though, there are many choices where it’s hard to say which was the ‘right’ choice - the whole thing deals with differing views of morality and who to trust. In summary, the art is simple (not overtly beautiful, but not ugly; somewhere above passable), the music is agreeable (didn’t really stand out, but I think it did the work justice), the writing is well done (if a tad uncreative at some parts, but it is pretty well-written and gives you much to think about), and the decision points are the exact thing you want out of a Visual Novel (especially with how the decisions reflect on you as a person and your personal take on what should be done, encompassing morality, authority, loyalty, et al.).I can say I enjoyed going through this. I’d give it a solid 7/10 overall, but about an 8/10 where it matters (for the genre).			"

												I thought this was a decent read for a free game.  I'm not really into Yuri so that aspect of it didn't really amaze me but it was still interesting enough.  The 'bad guy' and overall mystery was easy to call imo but I feel that way about most mystery's so I can't really knock it too much for that either.I do wish there were more romance options, or alternate stories depending on choices.  The lack of many defining choices would probably be my largest complaint in this game.  I like having a lot of different options when I play this style of game.  Overall it felt more like a sci-fi novel with pretty pics than an interactive game.  The complaints above aside, I'd say it's worth the read - particularly as it's free.  It was a good way to spend my free afternoon.  I don't regret having given it a shot.			"

												Excellent visual novel with interesting enough story. I can only recommend it. But in staying honest, here are a few (for me minor) negative points: - It's unvoiced- Some text is filler- The writing is not the best ever written, but competentRuns well on Linux.			"

												The art is good and there is YURI option but that´s everything. The story is average. It is predicable and at times boring. There are very few choices and the main character is so stupid. If i have to be kind 5.5/10 (If i have there faults, sorry)			"

												Fun little game. For a free to play game it's amazing. Only problem is that the routes barely feel different, I hope it will change for their future games.			"

												I Highly reccomend this game, It's beautiful, It's sad and happy at the same time. The storyline is amazing and it's just so much fun to read. If your bored or just looking for something that has lots of feeling in it, I reccomend this visual novel. The music sounds great and the different paths you can have is an adventure. The personalities and backstory of the characters is just so interesting so read it!			"

												This was an enjoyable experience!It was a quick VN, to be sure.  I did wish it was longer.  But the price is right, so I can't complain too much about this.  I thought the story was pretty well written, and really sucked you in and made you want to keep reading and making choices to see how things turn out!  I liked the music also.  The characters were interesting.  In short, this didn't feel like a free game... this definitely felt like something I would pay for as far as quality goes (and unfortunately, I have paid for much worse!)  In fact, if this game was longer, I probably wouldn't mind paying a decent price for it!However, for you, since it's free and decent quality, definitely give this a go!			"

												Once again, I have been proven wrong.... It's my philosophy to never judge a book by its cover, however real life always chooses to trip you up when you choose to give the benefit of the doubt. It's made me rely more on my first impressions out of a fear of a disappointing or hurtful experience.On more than one occasion, the world of games has destroyed (nay, completely obliterated) this need to judge. I'm happy to say, for me this game is part of that experience. I'm ashamed to say, the only reasons I tried this game is because it was a yuri and it was free.Kudos to the people who worked so hard on this game - you have managed to inspire one more individual out there! There weren't as many choices and it felt like more of a story being told, but the choices that were there were absolutely soul-crushing, gut-wrenching ones and loads of fun! (I say that now, lol!) And you definitely made the story worthwile!			"

												This was an amazing Visual Novel. Note that I used ""Visual Novel"" and not ""game"", because thats exactly whats going on here. Its very text-and-reading-oriented. As a Visual Novel, I'd rate 7.5/10. Great art style, and comfortable to look at. Actually quite a bit of background infomation and plot. I appreciate the dialouge and AMAZING music, on the contrary, if played through too many times (e.g. exploring different choices, finding the 5 different endings), or just staying in the same scene for too long. the music can become a looping annoyance and the dialouge is repetitive. I will say that I appreciate the vast variety of details I find. Its focuses on a yuri between the main character and one of the crew members, but you are ""given the option"" to be straight. There's a tsundere case and a gay one too.  Overall, was a satisfying game that took me personally less than a hour to finish and explore and most definitely gave me more than I bargained for especially since this is a Free to Play ""game""./u Pros:*Great art style, that is easy and comfortable to look at*Awsome music*different Choices; Slight ""Choose your own adventure"" where choices affect the ending and dialouge*Interesting characters*Background/Lore infomation*Option to fast-forward to skip dialouge/u Cons:*Scenes and music can get repetitive through multiple playthroughs*Wanting to explore more than the same course of storyline*Would be nice to have more options; have more endings*If you're gonna put so much info and extra details, don't just let them sit idlelyIn case the developers see this:Personally I think this game has so much potential. I think it'd be great as a free roam, story focused game. I'd like to get to know the characters more, learn about this universe you have created, and have more choices. I'd love to do more than just be on a space ship. Granted I love this story of a saboteur and solving a mystery. Just implement all the details of different races, planets, events, and characters. Like I said before, this has so much potential, and I realize I'm asking for a lot, but I'd be so happy to see this grow so much higher than it deserves. "

												I just finished my first playthrough (about 7 hours) and what a ride. There was exploration, espionage, intrigue, drama and just a hint of romance that made Rising Angels: Reborn quite the satisfying experience. The intro song was enjoyable as well and I will definitely be looking into buying it. I must admit, I was hesitant to play Rising Angels as I am not one for sci fi/space games. But the space theme-while prominent to the story- was really more of a backdrop to a story about the human (and alien in this case) condition. It's a story about who we are, who we want to be, morals and ethics. About balancing emotions with duty, and trusting in others. Politics come into play, and at the end of the day our heroine Natalie has some big decisions to make. As far as decisions go however, there are not that many to make. From my first playthrough I'd estimate I made about 5 choices in 7 hours of game play. I do feel there were more points in the story where user choice would have been appropriate-but obviously that means more writing for the devs in an already fairly lengthy (but enjoyable) visual novel. Even though I didn't have that much control over the story, I was still able to immerse myself and empathize with Natalie and the rest of the characters. While not kinetic, Rising Angels is simply more novel than interactive experience, and that's ok. Oh, I had an experience though, I had a few. I balked at the obnoxiousness of some characters, smirked as Natalie put them in their place, smiled at the sunny dispositions of some, and glowered at the creepiness of others. I experienced frustration and tension, dread and relief. I almost (almost!) got misty eyed at some parts. Overall, the characters had depth and I became invested in them, and the mission. I did have a few qualms with the game, but nothing major. Overall I enjoyed the story and the adventure it took me on, and the characters I met. The few cons I have are lack of choices, a few spelling/grammer errors that made some sentences confusing, and a few points in the story where the writing/situations didn't make sense. The primary example of this for me is  when you have to decide whether or not to smash the crystal you found. When you obtain the crystal, everyone is musing about how durable it must be to survive the spaceship it was on being blown up. And a single touch of it takes out your own crystals. Yet both Sol and Zuri believe that Zuri would be able to smash it with her tail. This idea seems both illogical and dangerous. I can see Zuri suggesting it without thinking, but Sol should know better. Perhaps one could argue that they don't care if they take themselves out (and the rest of the crew) destroying it since they are so close to death anyway, however there is still the issue that they (especially Sol) think it can be so easily broken in the first place, since experience has shown otherwise. There were also some points where I felt like the characters were late to the party, figuring out stuff I had already or finally confirming my suspicions. Also there were some poorly timed humor attempts  (complaining about your video games after discovering your (former) commander dead in a blood pool, REALLY Natalie?) . But no writing is perfect and overall I enjoyed the story and the characters.Rising Angels: Reborn is a refreshing visual novel experience, especially if you are looking for something different than the plethora of school life romance otomes out there. I will definitely be replaying to explore the other paths, collect all the CGs, and learn more about the characters. Apparently it is part of a series so I will be checking into the other games as well. While I do that I suggest giving this one a go!ps: I didn't find out 'till after playing that it's yuri romance only. The romance (at least from my playthrough) is so understated that you could interpret it as close friendship or one sided if you prefer. If you usually don't play girlxgirl romance please still give this a try as it was an amazing story!			"

												What I liked--Good enough story to keep you busy for 2-3 hours depending on your reading pace.-Takes enough time to explore the characters.-User friendly VN controls.-Emphasis on friendship, love, loyalty, and trust.-The occasional choices and associated moral dilemma may provide food for thought for some philosophical minds.Rating- 6/10.

												I honestly loved the story of this game! There were little decisions but they are really meaningful to the story. The Yuri ending is the only one that I like, personally, but if you like anime, and reading, and you would like to acually play a role in one of those sci-fi / fantasy novels, then this is awesome for you.By the way There will be a continuation to this novel, which is awesome, so those of you (like me) that want to read more of this I suggest you to follow the comunity for this game.P.S.* This is my fovorite ""game"" now...its even better than CoD			"
