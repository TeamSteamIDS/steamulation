								Right... well where do i start, well firstly the ""game: Dead Sea"" if you can even call it one, is completely none representative of the pictures and videos you have been led to believe it actually is on youtube and on steam store.secondly you can experience what little there is by actually downloading a free copy of cryengine and running around a textured map you made yourself because there is literally nothing to do...  the DEV aka CAT, updated the game 3 or 4 times and he literally added a stone and a few health kits "" THAT is all "" it's a desert walking simulator with grass... as of right now it is the worst early access game I have ever seen on steam and there has been no explanation as to why the version available now is 0.0.2 but the version 0.5 is actually better and was released ages ago....... one update from the DEV literally said "" fix and balance games "" ... that is all, another update says "" new mission (rank 2) and all he added was a stone slab you have to find... and scattered health kits "" .....if you value your cash do not waste your time on this thankfully I have money to waste but for those who don't ... just wait at least 8 months if this game actually becomes a game that is, then maybe spend your money on it when it has more content then a man, a first person camera, some sand a health kit a sun and grass..... there isn't even a single tree			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game because of its concept. I thought it sounded really cool. I saw that most of the reviews were ♥♥♥♥♥♥ but the game was cheap and looked like it had so much potential so I bought it. That was the worst mistake I could ever make. This game in its current state is completely unplayable and you can't do ANYTHING AT ALL. You can walk and look at the floor which only has patches of grass. the rest is purple/pink You can also play on two maps that have you suspended on a platform which  you can pick up, throw, and drop blocks. This is going to be one of those games that the devs abandon after a little bit of work on it because it requires a bit of work. Just to tell you how bad this game is, I'm going to compare this to Ark, an early access survival game that has done early access survival correctly. Ark had stuff to do when it came out. It had basically the entire game when it first popped up on steam. However, Dead Sea did not. It has nothing to do. No content, N O T H I N G. Save your 5 bucks and just ♥♥♥♥ing IGNORE THIS PIECE OF♥♥♥♥♥♥ Don't do what I did and ignore the reviews. It has these♥♥♥♥♥♥reviews for a reason.  This is the worst game in my steam library. I'm getting a refund. Now, this may seem drastic but it honestly ♥♥♥♥ing deserves it. At Dead Sea's current state, it DESERVES a 0/10. There is not ONE redeeming quality about this game. Everything about it is terrible. There's not even a hud or pause menu! You can walk, pick up blocks, throw them, or drop them. The fact that this game is on steam is a disgrace to the gaming platform.Here is a petition to remove this game from the steam store:https://www.change.org/p/kiss-ltd-pheonix-studio-steam-to-remove-the-game-dead-sea-from-the-steam-store "

								I bought this game a while ago, tried it out and found literally nothing to do. Everywhere I ran, I died by the time my vitals went down. After a month I tried it again, noticed there was some water on the ground. Great. Still no indication of controls or any kind of clue where you might find anything. After more dying, I left it again. I come back to it months later, to find absolutely nothing has changed. The game is still useless, there's still no indication on what you have for controls (which is as simple as a little help screen).Seems like Dev's have given up on this game and so should we. Keep your money and find another game to help.			"

Early Access Review
								Dead on release (26/03/15). Non-working title. Game released to Early Access to the developers horror and to everyone that bought it. The mistake was according to Phoenix Studio, on Valves side in terms of its early early release. But remember very little confirmed infomation is given... and when I mean confirmed I mean none. Still many are taking what Phoenix Studio say as gospel. Either way customers have been purchasing the title regardness. To Phoenix Studio surprise no doubt, and much needed funds. Also its important to note that a demo v 1.5 on Youtube is nothing like the version you would have bought here, nor what is on display on Steam. 27/03/15 Fair dos the guys fixed the game, by simply adding a Dead Sea map, still they forgot to remove the non-working cryengine test maps. There is still no Dead Sea menu, the keyboard/mouse controls display off screen. The Dead Sea game map at this date has you wandering in a desert to a count down of your HP in the style of a timer. Pre-Alpha would be generous at this point in Dead Sea's development. Looking at Dead Seas Kickstarter they did not meet their goal.Currently there is 1% content of what makes a survival game so far. Its just the open world map although, its not even as pretty as their Steam still screenshots nor their youtube video would let you believe. Its just sand, rock and bush. But at the end of the day, at this point it shouldn't be on Early Access. Heard that its planned for full release at the end of the year (2015) They have work to do! I would question the level of polishing this title would get in that limited time.Currently £3.99 is for the 'Dead Sea' concept, Thats it. 'Potential' does not give Dead Sea a free pass to a postive review, nor will any game I review on that bases. Especially when its nothing more than concept art from a unknown developer. It's a game that may never see completion, looks like its being funded as it goes along. Looking at EAs statement "" This Early Access game is not complete and may or may not change further. If you are not excited to play this game in its current state, then you should wait to see if the game progresses further in development."" Little reminder of its current state, its a empty map.28/03/15The Dead Sea 0.0.2 map now has a goal to find a Golden Stone, with 1st aid kits laying about to combat this decreasing HP timer. Same map updated to 0.0.2, for now I'll forgive the fact that it seems to have turned from a survival game to a slenderman style hunt the pages game. Weirdly thou when I found the Stone which is more like a upright slab (if you think of the ten commandments). When I got closer to it, it has a picture of a spacecraft and text on the back of what appears to be for another game? (edit: it is from another game ""nimbus project"") 29/03/15 fantastic another update, seems to be another Dead Sea map! Called Excape! It gave me visions of running from something, or to get away from something life threating. The horror continues and my heart stops to see its now became a minecraft island in the sky block game. I see there is also a square island above me... I see controls! It says 'F' to pick up move, 'mouse wheel' to drop, and 'F1' to kill the game. Still no 'end game' menu.It takes me a while to pick up whatever I was trying to pick up? In my confussion and luck I pick up a block of the green stuff I'm standing on. I now get what I must do! Stairs I must build stairs, I line myself up and drop the block to the one side of me, not the front of me. Did I say it was also to the side of you, it sure makes, making block stairs interesting thats for sure.29/03/15Treated to another non-survival update! Keep this up and we'll be playing bloodly portal 3 next.... Its called Excape 2 this time excape next to water, with sharks but I wasn't wanting to mention that! Cus that makes it sound fun.Developers where asking, what is the communities thoughts was on a change of game engine and should it go ahead? From Cry to Unreal 4. The choice to change was already taken by Phoenix Studio before any input, was possible. Still Unreal seems to be Phoenix Studio prefered engine, I largely think most will not care as long as the end result is an enjoyable one.04/04/15All is quite quiet on the Eastern front, we have not heard much more from the Thai Developers. The game sits in 'Quarantine' in my steam library, hence it trys to infect my other games. Dead Sea's room mates are games of the same high caliber as 'Rekoil', 'Overcast' and 'Dementium  II'.10/04/15It's been 29/03/15, since we have had a update. Not a very long time of course, still reassurance that work is continuing would at least help the Developer keep intouch with the community.30/04/15full month with only very early progess screenshots on the facebook page for dead sea. I swear I got told that a up-date was due at the end of this month? A Mod of these forums has told me that in May a up-date will be coming with a crafting system in place. To the most unfinished EA game currently on steam. Avoid this game at all costs, until the devlopers can deliver. Keep a eye on it if you must and see how it develops. 1/06/15Still no update20/06/15Games on sale but still has been no update.28/06/2015Still no update, coming close to reporting the title to steam as a scam.01/07/2015Big update has yet to comeDO NOT BUY THIS!

								Review of Dead Sea 0.0.2:Ok, After the developer asked me to recheck again the new version after the update, i gave a go, and played it till my health allowed me to play, apparently there is a clue now, a part from the graphics that looks promising, the clue says: MISSION-Golden Stone...So i spawn in the middle of the desert and i start looking around for this Golden Stone..i wandered around till my health triggered me to death, (because the health slowly in the desert diminishes), but nothing..couldn't find this Stone! A part from that anytime i try to switch to 3rd person view or i press any F(f1 to f12) button the game crashes...i even found a medkit but couldn't use it because there's no inventory avaiable neither i could do any action...so what am i suggesting is that this game is not even a decent pre-alpha yet...i'm looking forward to update this review as it will change, (hopefully), at the moment it is an undecent experience...sorry guys, take your time and do a serious game out of it, the graphics seems  there already to impress, the context either, cmon, I'm waiting!Review of Dead Sea 0.0.1: What is this..a JOKE? Not fun...(i must state, i bought it at day1, apparently there was a mistake by steam to release it as it wasn't meant to be released yet, as it is written in many reviews, so i was up to wait till the game was ready and try it...today surprisingly there was an update of nearly 3 gigs, so i downloaded it and tried it....what is this supposed to be? A man that can't do actions a part from flying walking in a desert?)

It promises to deliver an experience with a day/night cycle, monsters, encampments, and also puzzles as well as the world being built in the cryengine. Now I don't know where the hell that game is but I would like to play instead of this repetitive mess.It has potential but I say stay away from this game.			"

The sun kills you far too quickly for you to make it to the third or fourth land mark, and the supplies you do find are just ♥♥♥♥ing sitting there on the ground. No reason, just a couple bottles of water in the middle of the ♥♥♥♥ing desert for no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason.There is literally no game here. No enjoyment. I will say that the reason I bought this game was for the aesthetic of it. The desert always looks nice, and the sound design here could be a lot worse. But you understand, this game has 0 gameplay value whatsoever. It is possible to make something good from this, but as it stands, it is one of the worst wastes of money I've ever spent on steam.And again, I'd just like to remind you that nearly everything the developers say was added in the logs was not added, and they're lying to you.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Not yet. Like I said, it is possible for it to be made into something good, but as it stands it's a nice looked empty map that has a timer counting down to your death.			"

Early Access Review
								I installed this game today (release date) and of course there were a few bugs in the options side of the menu system but as of yet I am unable to launch the single player mode. When I selected the single player option I was met with an error message that read:---------------------------------------------------------------------------!Failed to establish context! Couldn't establish context: LoadLevel failed---------------------------------------------------------------------------From that point the game crashed at each and every attempt and additionally, when it crashed it somehow changed my PC resolution from 1920 x 1080 to 1280 x 720. After reading the forums it would appear that I am not the only one who has encountered this issue. I do understand that early release games do come with it's bugs and glitches but not being able to launch the game itself is more frustrating and especially when you have to pay for the game even in its early release stage.There has been no new updates from the Phoenix Studio team so fingers crossed they will very soon because we are all itching to play this game.UPDATE 28.03.2015I have now played the early access and I am in a position to fully review it. I will post an additional review with an accompanying video in the next hour or so.UPDATE 28.03.2015 - my full review of Dead Sea and video below! I recorded in 60fps so not sure what the game is running at. Watch the video minimum of 720p for best visual experience of the game.

Menu interfaceIt is uncluttered and smooth to use with simplistic options for the player to decide how to play based on their own PC's performance.The mapThe developer has suggested that it will be an open world game. Game graphics & performanceI experienced minimal lag or frame drop. The graphics are smooth and the colours are vibrant which is to be expected from a game made on the Cryengine.In-game characteristicsThere is quite a bit of detail such as moving clouds and character footprint left behind in the sand and with the addition of being able to see the your characters legs (blue jeans and boots) clearly I did not think about my attire for my adventures in a hot place! The Oasis heat gives the landscapes the effect of distortion which is true of deserts IRL.SoundtrackPretty decent in-game background music and in-keeping with the mood of the desert.In-game effectsWhen your character is low on HP (health points) your screen accumulates blood which does actually move down the screen which is another good effect. Your character pants when running for a long period and heart beat are heard when you are dying.SummaryYou pay £3.99 to play the early access and all it will give you in a feel of how the game will look once the developers roll out the alpha and beta releases. There are no missions as such but just exploration of the world you spawn in. I will watch this game develop over time and with what I've experienced of it so far I believe it has potential to be a very good game. If they produce a polished and interesting game then I will certainly pay for and play the full release.FINAL UPDATE REVIEW VIDEO BELOW - 30.03.2015NOTE: This is my last update video of Dead Sea so I hope you can take something away from it when deciding whether to invest in this developer at this early stage of the game.

								I can honestly see a lot of potential in this game and as far as what's to come it looks promising, however as it is right now. The game still needs a lot of work.

								             I'd like to start by saying that while this game is still in its infancy, I support it because it has the potential to be something great if the developers don't give up on it. I know I won't. I've had the pleasure of some early access games and found few to my liking. Then there were some that really shouldn't have been made at all. This title as stated, can be something good if not great. Just needs a lot of work. To the developers I say again, don't give up on this. Dead Sea can become a great game if you guys along with the community put your heads together and make this work.			"

(EDIT* the only huge thing was the mistake i made assuming this)the developers obviously listen to investors and supporters so get involved it will be worth it.EDIT* The above changed and the developers dont do anything, no new content in over half a year, all there is is a test level and that is awful and doesnt even start for most people, they keep banging on about a facebook page! im a gamer not a socialite i dont care about facebook i care about gaming and if you care about gaming even 1 tiny bit you will NOT buy this game			"
