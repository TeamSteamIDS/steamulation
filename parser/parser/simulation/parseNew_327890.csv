												My opinion about the game overall:If you were expecting a funny/punny review then you came to the wrong review. I decided to make an actual helpful/serious review for the game. Let me start off saying this is a really great game and is a real and serious game despite looking like a joke, back when I saw this game in Greenlight I laughed and gave it a vote expecting it to be a game that wouldn't even get to a full release, when it first came out my friend bought it so I went to his place and played it for a few hours, after playing it a few times I decided to buy i. Aas it got more and more updates it got better. A lot of people say the game is hard to play with a keyboard but I disagree, back when I first played the game I didn't have a controller so I played it with a keyboard, after a while, I got a controller, and the only thing that was hard about playing with a controller was that sometimes I got confused with the buttons' names, overall it's better with a controller. Awesome game, they really put a lot of work to it and listened to the community throughout the making of the game.Cons and pros:+Remappable keyboard controls+Changable sensitivity+Graphic options also pretty customizable+Great graphics+Great support from the devlopers of the game in issues you might run into+Achievements-Controls can take time to get used to-New players can sometimes be annoyed by the game's challenge but that's pretty subjectiveGamemodes:Story mode: At the beginning of each level you are presented with some sort of letter about an insane guy who's also the house owner, you finish reading it or skip it and you then spawn as a  piece of bread at the start of the level, at some levels you have extras you can add to yourself like jam and butter which have some side effects. You travel through the level possibly using various objects on the way to eventually get to the toaster or pan or whatever else you want to fry yourself on, in most levels there is more than one way to toast yourself. You get a grade based on your edibility, tastiness and possibly your time but I'm not sure about that, grades are from A++ from F(you only get f if you didn't finish the level). Story mode is overall challenging and my personal favorite. There are 8 levels in the story mode game mode.Bagel Race: In this gamemode you spawn as a bagel in a different spawn than your spawn points at Story Mode, you need to run through the map using 3 and 4 keys(by default assuming you're using the keyboard) and the mouse and pass through checkpoints on the way to the end, you get a grade based on how fast you completed the race. There are 8 levels in the bagel race game mode. You have no edibility in this game mode.Rampage: In this game mode you play as a baguette. In this mode your goal is to cause as much damage as possible to various objects around the level, the more damage you cause the better grade you are gonna get. You have multiplier for everytime you smash a few things at once. You have no edibility in this game mode. Rampage has 8 levels. You have a time limit at this game mode.Cheese hunt: In this game mode you play as a crackbread. In this game mode you spawn as crackbread and start wandering around to find cheese and touch it so it sticks to you, as far as I know there are 5 pieces of cheese in each level. you lose ediblity by falling and/or hitting something too hard. You have no time limit in this game mode. There are 8 levels to Cheese Hunt.Zero G(ravity): In this game mode you play as a slice of bread. This game mode is pretty much the same as the regular gamemode only there isn't gravity and you need to fly around with jets attached to you. I cannot explain the controls to this game mode as they are very complicated to explain, the main difference from the main game mode is that your grade is also based off the amount of fuel you've used up(You have infinite fuel, you use up fuel when you use your jets). You have edibility in this game mode, you lose ediblity when you touch the floor as far as I know. There is no time limit in this game mode. There are 8 levels to Zero G(ravity).I'll edit this to explain about the gamemodes left soon.			"

								Left for BreadRed Bread RedemptionGranary Theft AutoKnead for SpeedBread RisingBagel-landsProject ZombreadYs-eastCall of Dough-ty … I could go on. I won’t. But I could.******************Due to popular demand Ive decided to add a more ‘wholemeal’ first look review for people who like that sort of thing. The game is essential qwop combined with the floor is lava. You navigate your slice of bread around various obstacles on a quest to get yourself nicely toasted (insert your own joke there).  Encountering dirty items reduces your edibility and therefore your overall score, whilst getting smothered in tasty tasty jam boosts it.The game controls exactly how you would imagine it does. Each corner is assigned a different button which when pressed holds that edge in place apparently regardless of the surface/physics. The mouse or thumb stick flicks the bread around of can be used to nudge it around for precise movements. Practiced or naturally skilled will surely be able to cartwheel their way onto the leaderboards quickly whilst people starting out will ultimately spend more time flailing around like a dying Magicarp. Your main opponent is your own frustration.If the play style is sounding very familiar that’s because it is. Anyone who has already played Surgeon Simulator or Octodad will immediately recognise the pattern of destruction and failure. This means that behind its freshly baked exterior the game is likely to become stale fairly quickly. Like its sister games there is a big potential for fun workshop content but ultimately you cannot judge a game on what could possibly be made by fans later on.It is worth pointing out that it is an early access game, meaning that it is essentially unfinished, although this game does feel a lot more complete than most. It is very much playable with the exception of a few minor bugs. Enabling the gif record mode makes the game basically unplayable and the music always seems to be coming out of a random corner of the room. I think overall most people will have already made a decision about this game, and whatever your thoughts they are probably correct. It’s ultimately a casual iPad-destined meme-maker but it clean fun and will give most people a few laughs for less than the price of an average cinema ticket. If flinging a slice of bread around for a few hours is the sort of thing that will brighten your day, then this is probably for you.			"

								I started the day as a slice of bread. Not the end piece, because no one likes the end piece. No, I was the second slice in. I emerged from my loaf in glorious fashion, spreading my crumbs all over as I flew from what I once called home. This was the start of my journey. I emerged in to a world of culinary decadence. To my left was Mt. Butter, and to my right was Jelly Valley. There were so many places to see, so many things to do. Life had finally begun.I began my voyage to Toaster Kingdom by first heading for Mt. Butter. It was always a dream of mine to stand-atop the hills on Mt. Butter, and I did just that. I paraded to the top in mere seconds, only to slide down Mt. Butter and splash right in to Jelly Valley. It was like a slip-n-slide of deliciousness.I emerged from Jelly Valley covered from bread to toe, only to come to the edge of the world. I could see it all from here; the vast landscapes of Breadland, the hills of Crumbilina, but most of all, I could see Toaster Kingdom, and I knew my journey was far from over.In a moment of serenity, I took a giant leap of faith, and I floated through space and time, in an absolute moment of glory. I didn't know what was waiting for me below, but I knew this was what had to be done.Falling for what seemed an eternity, I thought this to be the end. Just then, something emerges below me, and I land softly on to a giant looking board with wheels. My savior.I thanked it for saving me, and we bonded very quickly. It turns out, we are both heading to the same destination, and he agrees to let me travel on him. I hold on tight, and off we go. We travel through canyons, wastelands, hell, we even traveled through large ravines. We're almost there. We arrive at the Counter-Top Haven. The final stop before Toaster Kingdom. Just when we are in-reach of the Toaster Kingdom, my new friend informs me that he can go no further, for he is not capable of climbing. He entrusts me with a gift for King Toaster, a serum of sorts. He called it Maple Syrup. I am clueless what it would be used for, after-all the King is french. I don't understand what he would possibly do with such a thing. Nevertheless, I say thank you for everything, as a tear of jelly starts rolling down my face, and I start my ascent to reach the top of Counter-Top Haven.It's a rough climb. It takes me about a minute or two, as I seem to be slipping and sliding all over the cliffs and peaks of this place. Maybe it's the jelly, maybe it's the butter, but all's I know is that I must persevere. I must make it to Toaster Kingdom.I finally reach the top of Counter-Top Haven, and Toaster Kingdom and the Toaster King are in my line of sight. I flop towards them as fast as my nimble body can take me, battered and buttered and bruised. I reach the entrance to Toaster Kingdom. I can feel it now. I'm almost there. I only have to climb once more and I will have completed my first voyage.With all the strength I can muster, I grip tightly on to the walls of Toaster Kingdom. I manage to hoist myself a-top this beautiful landscape. I'm here. I made it. The Toaster King is in sight. I just have to decend to the throne room, and I will have fulfilled my purpose in life.Just as I am readying myself to decend towards the king, a gust of wind blows me off of the top of the kingdom. Down I fly, past Counter-Top Haven. Below I go, to the ends of the earth. No one to save me this time. I fall. I fall. I land in the dirt. Ruined.I wither and die.10 / 10. Would play again.			"

								Rather tricky, but very fun. You use 1,2,3,4 to 'grab' onto a surface, then you swing yourself to move! The goal is to get to the toaster on the other side of the room, and to toast yourself. It's definitely not as simple as it sounds, though!It's a fantastic game for its price. :>EDIT 12/04/14: I didn't expect this review to get so much attention, geez. x3A lot of people seem to be under the impression that it's free-play, and that there's no real goal or penalities, etc. I'll clear that up for you.There's no sandbox mode yet. The only real limitation you have, is not touching the floor. If you do so, it'll drain your 'health bar'.  There are a couple of different levels. Even if you manage to complete them all, the replay value is high, as there's multiple ways to complete each level! Despite being early access, this game feels perfectly complete! It's fun to play in 'bursts'. :>*some li'l genuis was complaining about everyones' playtime on it. It literally just came out yesterday (12/13), dork.			"

												Warning: Contains GlutenIn all reality I've actually had a lot of fun with this so far and I havent rated higher than an F. Playing with a controller as well though, I imagine the keyboard and mouse method is even more irritating.*Edit*I made it to day 3 and no longer only get F's. The amount of creativity the second level requires is enough to be worth $10. This isn't an A  to B type puzzle game. You not only have to figure out what's going to be your toaster, but how you're going to get there and make it capable of toasting.I've only gotten to try day 3 once so far but the fact the walls are dirty and I once again have no idea what is going to toast my bread adds a whole nother level of puzzle solving I was not expecting from such an outlandish game.Even after passing day 1 multiple times and day 2 once I still haven't managed to make my toast ""tastey"" though. I've only passed on the fact that I toasted bread without completely covering it in♥♥♥♥♥♥Definitely recommended and I haven't succesfully finished 5%.12 Grain/10			"

								At first, I thought this game terrible. I felt so bready to win until I played it. But as time went on It became really fun. You really knead to figure out the controls but once you get the hang of it its really fun. Some people say it is butter to play using the gamepad but I preferred keyboard. The huge stages you enter are jam-packed with fun things to do.  The feeling of satisfaction from getting from point A to point B is great. I love this game with every grain of my body. For me, this game will never be stale.			"

								  I liked I am Bread for its unique gameplay and ideas. You have to have a good controller though to really be able to play the game- keyboard and mouse isn't really playable. It's a platformer at it's core and you have to toast yourself to beat each level avoiding dirty food, walls, and floors. There are glitches and other bugs in the game but remeber- this review was made during open beta. I'm sure they will iron out all the glitches and add more content so I would recommend this game. 9/10 can be a bit difficult at times.			"

								Serious Review:Do I Recommend this game?Yes and No.The game is fun, and i love and adore physics based games.I Am Bread is a game where you play as a bread, trying to get through it's day to get toasted.However you must not touch the ground/floor.  That will kill the edibility of the bread.However trying to steer this bread or moving it it's extremly tedious... i HATE the controll sceme (I tried both Keyboard and Gamepad (xbox controller)  It's very hard and takes tons of time to get used with the controls.I spend over 18-25 minutes on the first level... trying to get this bread toasted.  it's very hard but managedable with a bit of cursing with tears in my eyes. the second level is even worse and i don't even want think about the rest.Then again i see how no other control sceme would work for this game.What i like:* Grapichs and physics* Fun to break stuff and climb onto things.What i hate:* How you control the bread...* How there was NOT any free roam/free play from the start where you can just mess around without having to worry about the floor.So there you have it.If they where kind enough to add a free roam to the game from the start where you could have a little fun i would be very pleased and give it a YES.But it seems you have to spend hours on trying to get toased and move on the next day, no idea if they will reward you with a free roam function.This is an early review of the game and i might change it later.For now, i do not recommend this game. to tedious.EDIT:I am not a hater of the game, as many comments below state.I know these type of games and i'm very femiliar with the Surgon simulator which is also very hard on the controlls.The idea is brilliant and the concept is fun and adoring, and i'm a working male who plays video games in my spare time and i'm quite the good player on most games, and i'm not ""bad"" just because i can't get passed day two.  It's early access and they want to listens to people's good and bad reports of it.I'm just saying the game show no remorse for a simple mistake. You fall, you die. Restart and spend another 25-30 minutes getting through the level. Don't take my word for it, read other people's negative reviews, they will state the same.People who says ""I'm a bread, got jelly on me and fell face down. 12/10"" is a part of this new ""funny steam review"" trend and don't take the game all to seriosly.  Thanks to people who actually cared for my review!			"

								Five days at Breaddy's is truly a work of art in the horror-simulation games department. The game puts you in the place of a lone slice of bread, lost in a large house with no idea of how he got there or how to get out. It perfectly represents all of the horrors bread goes through on a daily basis, such as but no limited to:-Climbing on the wall-Sticking to a box of chips-Getting stuck in the aforementioned box of chips-Riding on a skateboard-Touching the floor-Playing Jenga-Falling from the top of a refridgerator into a sink-Touching the floor-Forgetting which sides LT and RT are on-Doing cartwheels-and touching the floor.This game has no jumpscares, but has enough tension to make you go crazy. You'll constantly be thinking things like ""OH GOD I'M STUCK ON THE FLOOR! WHY CAN'T I STICK TO THE SKATEBOARD!?! LET ME ON THE SKATEBOOAAAARD!!!!"" and feeling true terror nearly all the time.I give it a Potato out of Rye. Really a must play.Are you ready for Breaddy?			"

								EDIT: You only need look at the top reviews for this game to realize why you should stay away. Almost every one of them is nothing but stupid bread related puns. Don't trust the user rating.Seems like it's just another ""zany"" game now that the goat simulator hype has died down.People who enjoy ""teh randumbs"" will probably enjoy this game, but I didn't personally enjoy this title after going through the first level.The game is quite simple. You try to guide a piece of bread across the room to a toaster and toast yourself inside of it. while trying to keep your ""freshness"" as high as possible without touching things like trails of ants or the floor..However, in my opinion, the physics are just awful. I would much rather the bread have QWOP's physics system than the system it has now. A problem I constantly run into is the bread not turning the right way, not properly turning, or just not turning at all.All in all, it may seem like a good purchase just because of how out there the game is, but you'll probably regret it after putting it down about 10 minutes later.

								I have completed the first release version (12/03)The game's purposely clunky controls are a little hard to get the hang of, but once you do, it turns out to be a great experience. Of course that being an unreleased product, it still needs optimization and polish. Considering its current length, I can't really say that I got my money's worth, but there's plenty of stuff to be added. I'm pretty happy with the base game and the potential it has to grow.			"

												When I first saw videos about I Am Bread. I thought this was just another one of those silly games that people play to rage on and get views and say silly things. Then I played the game myself and was overcome with expletives and rage myself. However underneath that buttery rage layer was something else. Something I didn't expect. There was a really fun and well made game. Its hard to explain the joy of flipping your toast and seeing it fly through the air and land that jump just right. Its insane. Its fun. Its insanely fun. However there is rage to be had. Sometimes you don't know what do or where to go. Experimentation is key and getting anywhere is a living pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ So be prepared.I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

												This turned out so much better than the promotional media and reviews make it out to be.This is not a gimmicky youtube fodder ""game""This is an actual challenging videogame with lots of content and depth to it. There is definitely more to it than just ""hahaha bread flops around wow so funny"" - thinking the opposite might just set you up for a pleasant surprise, though, as it did me.The control scheme is perfect, BUT you are pretty much required to have a controller. You can try with keyboard and mouse, but you'll be in for a frustrating experience.If you don't like hard games or don't have a controller, steer clear, but if you do, please get it immediately.			"

								This game is a groundbreading tale of a solitary slice of bread who leaves his loaf behind him. This slice yearns, nay, kneads to become the toast he was destined to be! You play as the eponymous slice of bread, and being one with the bread you must traverse, harsh terrains, and vanquish many obstacles and troubles, the yeast of which is ants which threaten to make you unedible! Bread must overcome many hardships to achieve his ultimate goal of toastdom. This game is not for the weak of heart or spirit. This game will test your endurance, patience, virtue, and above all, your breadness. Nobody ever said the life of Bread was easy. Your eager slice of Bread simply cannot wheat any longer to become toast, will you help him in his coming of age quest?Highly sophisticated bread simulation technology.10/10 would bread again.			"

			Today I'm playing I Am Bread from Bossa Studios. This game is currently available on Early Access and it's been great fun playing so far! Leave a like if you enjoyed and subscribe for more content.		

Honestly I expected this game to be trash but I was wrong. I've had a great time with this game some moments can get slightly frustrating but more often I'm laughing and just enjoying the insanity and weird situations you can find yourself in. Still finding more odd things you can interact with and so far the game is solid for it's early access state. Looking forward to the finished product!

For example, if you come across jam/jelly, and rub it on yourself, you gain 'deliciousness'. You also become quite adept at being a bread ninja as you progress through the levels. There are also multiple ways to toast yourself, so be creative.Soundtrack is also quite fitting too. I look forward to more additions through the EA campaign.			"

								There is nothing funny about the life of a bread. From the time it was a wheat plant blowing in the wind, to the time it was pounded into the fine dough then baked to perfection, it was its destiny to become a piece of finely buttered toast. Maybe with some tasty strawberry jam on it, or jelly. Too bad this fate was not to be as it fell on the dirty foot print covered checkered floor of the kitchen, only to have a plate with fish bones fall right on top of it.R.I.P Bread. Your heroic actions will be remembered as your fellow sliced brothers avenge your untimely demise as they too march on to the toaster of destiny.The struggle is real my friends.10/10 Would toast again.

								tl;dr - Use the money you'd spend on this game to buy an actual loaf of bread -- you'll have more fun with that._____I'd like to preface this review by saying that, truly, I was actually looking forward to this game.  It seemed quirky, sandbox-y, and hopefully enjoyable, and the reviews seemed to be overall positive.  It couldn't all have been just people rating it highly, just because you're playing as bread, right?  This had to be actually fun!  However, having now given this game a try, I can say that it doesn't live up to the hype at all.  First, I should state, from the trailers, it would seem like the game takes place in a sandbox-type game style.  Run around, cover yourself in crud, do stupid stuff, etc.  Tons of fun, right?  Well, if you're looking for that kind of gameplay, you've come to the wrong place, currently.  Perhaps when the game is more developed, there will be a free-play mode, but currently, there is only an objective mode, wherein you must make it from one side of the kitchen to the other, and toast yourself.  Still sounds fun, right?  Now, I imagine you may be sitting there going, ""At least you can cover yourself in all sorts of stuff!""  Except, you can't, or your edibility bar hits zero and you get a game-over.  ""Well, I can still climb all over the place, and swing from shelf to shelf like some gluten-based Tarzan, right?""  Well, bad news, you've only got a limited grip gauge that very quickly depletes, and you need to let it recharge again before you can grab anything, once it runs out.  Anddd when you hit the floor, your edibility quickly drops, as well.  I'm sure that, as it's early access, some of these issues will probably be addressed, but at this point, the trailers look much better than the game is.Still, you know what?  That could still be a fun, challenging game.  Could be.  That is, if not for what me be perhaps the worst problem with this game: the contols are just awful.  And no, I don't mean like Surgeon Simulator's ""haha this is hilarious"" awful, I mean ""why is the mouse suddenly inverted?  It didn't move like this before.  Why is it not responding to my movements?!"" awful.  Seemingly at random, the game decides that you're now pulling back when you're pushing forward, swinging left when pulling right, etc., and then, at the drop of a hat, decides to go back to normal again.  Usually while you're climbing the walls with your quickly depleting grip gauge, or trying to finagle your way into the toaster slot, resulting in you either falling to the floor (at which point, the process repeats until your health edibility bar hits zero) or you flinging the toaster down to the floor, where toasting is not really an option (again, inevitably resulting in the edibility gauge hitting zero, but even more heartbreaking is victory is wrested from your fingers.  Er... Crust?).  If these controls didn't decide at random not to work, perhaps I could have had fun.  Perhaps this could have been a worthwhile game.  However, as it stands, the game is not challenging, it is just downright frustrating, and it is NOT worth your money.  Wait for them to improve the handling (if they ever do).			"

												[review remade as of 12/20/16]So you know how you make toast in the morning? Wouldn't it be nice if it made itself?Oh wait, no, it wouldn't, because it would make a mess all over your house because everyone knows bread is the most stupid in the exact circumstance where it has no idea what is a good established way of walking, because it can only move itself based on its corners.I Am Bread is a game where you are bread, a cold, plain bread, so you must go to the toaster / microwave / heater / lawnmower with faulty circuits causing it to overheat for warmth, as most beings need to be warm to live. Also, being toast is one of your priorities that is solved by being warm. Plus, being rated as a delicious, A+ quality toast is important to bread society and as such you must be delicious in order to come out on top of society. However, there are several obstacles in the way of you flopping yourself into that toaster! Let's list them. Controls! You can only move by grabbing objects or terrain with the corners of your bread and pulling yourself up. If you mess up your wall climb, you may end up on the floor. Flooring! Everyone knows the floor is dirty, and potentially lava in some circumstances. Dirt usually contains bacteria, which are bad because they may eat you before you are toasted, and your primary life goal is to be toasted, and your secondary goal is to be delicious, so they stand in the way of your life goals.  Ants! Ants are devils. They will rip you up into crumbs and feed you to their queen. It is not optimal to be around ants, as they do not rate bread and therefore, you get the default score, 0.* Water! Soggy bread is not delicious bread. Also, sometimes, water contains bacteria. (see bullet point on flooring) Etc.However, these are not reasons to be discouraged! Many things will help you on your way. Butter makes you more delicious, and so does jam. Also there's a rocket in the first level. It helps I guess. But the goal of the game is to be at least edible and at most, delicious. Do you think that sounds fun? Well, I thought this game was fun, so you have one person out of the many hundreds of people who have played this game's opinion, which is yeah go buy it right now or maybe later or I don't know, just when you have the time.

												I wasn't here for the trip through early access, but coming into the launch version blind, my experience was one of endearment, gradually eclipsed by a roaring frustration. It's a lovely novel concept, the story (yes, there is one) is pretty good, and the level design ranges from open and flexible to linear and ♥♥♥♥ WHOEVER MADE THIS. Mercifully, there is a Super Guide equivalent to let you get through any level at the expense of a forced E rank, although even with that in place you can still be hard pressed to figure out how to toast yourself.I realize that the game is fumblecore at its heart, but it often seems to demand just a bit too much for what you can feasibly do with its unique blend of A) the controls, B) the physics, and C) the camera. The controls in and of themselves are generally manageable, but when attempting to swing like Bread Tarzan across a string of 6 or so sunflowers and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cocking things are just flailing about as though in a typhoon because of arbitrary WACKY physics, the game just starts to fall apart. If you manage to smash open a jam jar to coat yourself, you can spend a full couple of minutes wrestling with all of the broken glass trying to actually make contact with the jam -- and once coated it can actually make movement much more challenging, to the point that you'll be unable to detach from a surface until you've swiveled the camera to an angle where the controls feel like cooperating, assuming the camera also cooperates and doesn't get stuck inside a wall pointing at the ceiling. When levels last upwards of 10 minutes and have no checkpoints, getting dicked to death by the camera and/or how it interacts with the controls is not a fun experience. The epilogue took me 5 tries alone; once because it was my fault, three times in a row because the physics made my bread clip into the car and spaz out, the third time ending with me launching into space at infinite velocity. There's only a handful of levels in total but a few different modes to play them in and a standing possibility of more post-release content for free and/or as DLC. All in all I enjoyed it, but the physics and camera still definitely need work, and due to the prolonged format of the levels as compared to Surgeon Simulator, it's just a much more frustrating experience as a whole.As a final caveat, none of the achievements seem to work yet either.

								It's not often you find a game where the concept, gameplay, and story are all original, and it's even rarer to find one that executes all of the above in an engaging and entertaining way, but I Am Bread manages it with panache. As the game opens, you find yourself as the titular slice of bread in a typical kitchen with one straightforward goal: to become toast. There's no tutorial and no on-screen hints to guide your progress, but a little bit of exploration will make the control scheme clear - you can grab with any combination of corners at once, and nudge, flip or fling yourself toward furniture or objects scattered about the room.Sometimes the physics of interactive objects gets a little wonky; grabbing onto an object as it topples may sometimes hurl you in an unexpected direction, but the simulation is pretty solid otherwise. Hazardous elements of the environment are left for the player to discover; surfaces or objects that decrease the bread's ""ediblility"", hurting your score and eventually causing you to fail the level.Succeeding at becoming toast unlocks a new room and a little more of the backstory, hinting at a larger meaning beyond finding a way to brown oneself. The novelty of the concept and the control scheme make a simple game very enjoyable and eminently replayable.			"

It's sort of the best of both worlds.Not alot of levels atm, but it is Early Access after allFor some reason the most obvious way to toast bread is the one that's not worth it (not really a con, but it frustrates me)For the content provided right now, it might not be worth the $10.

												This game is amazing!  The main story is a fully immersive action, adventure, 3D platformer, roleplaying puzzle game with unexpectedly dark twists in the story.  It is truly an emotional roller coaster as you hang on for dear life, inches away from safety, flinging yourself upward with the little strength you have left in a desperation, only to fall to a painful death, alone, far from loaf of your family, on the cold hard floor.  Then you try again, and again, as frustration and you question whether it is even possible to reach you goal is this cruel world.  The feeling of accomplishment after finally succeeding makes it all worth it.  You learn, if a piece of bread can overcome all the odds and become toast, you might have a chance at succeeding in life too, if you stop playing this addicting game and go live it.  You also learn that alcohol compounds psychological issues.There is more to this bread simulator than the main story.  I was pleasantly surprised to unlock a thrilling time-trial racing simulator, a very realistic and somewhat more calming space exploration simulator, a destroy everything simulator, and even an annoying fetch-quest simulator.  They even added a free Star Wars parody game for May the 4th.  In short this game is much more than meets the eye.  It is extremely difficult and fun.  10/10			"

												There's challenging gameplay, there's unforgiving difficulty, and there's broken clumsy controls. The challenge in I am Bread doesn't come from the gameplay, or the missions, or the success conditions, but instead from fighting with the controller to do what you want it to do. If the player fails it should be due to his or her actions, not because the game decides to work against their inputs.The humour of the game wears off quickly and it isn't enough to carry the frustration that comes from the core gameplay. Rampage mode is a nice option and serves as pure catharsis. I would actually be more interested in playing a fully-fleshed out Katamari Damacy style game with the rampage mechanics.Overall, probably worth a try but I wouldn't pay full sticker price.			"

								To summarise my opinion on this game, the learning curve is like trying to climb an overhanging cliff, both literally and metaphorically.There isn't much really to say about it, the controls are almost unusable;, they worked in Surgeon Simulator where you where the camera was always the same, however in this the camera has a variable orientation, and so relying on the direction of the bread which isn't easily distinguishable when you're stuck on something of the horribly balanced first level or fell onto the floor because you don't want to move the camera around to see if the gap between the fridge and the cubbard is too big to gap (protip: the cubbard receeds so far in you cannot scale it whatsoever, avoid at all costs) and while you can get used to the controls, you do so in the manner someone who recently was disabled learns to use the toilet while in a wheelchair. I'd reccomend changing it so that the arrow keys move in relation to where the camera is facing, and WASD are fixatedly assigned to a corner, and overlap each other the further away they are from the camera.Also, the camera has the sensetivity of my rib cage being perforrated by the fingers of someone with anorexia. Even the slightest movement will cause it to jerk 180, and if you were grabbing onto something good luck getting where you were planning on going before you fall to the floor with the (at least what I interpreted) message ""♥♥♥♥ you thats what you get for trying to rotate the camera"".Also, the trailer is very misleading. While it advertises a simple game that tells the tale of a slice of bread on its quest to become toasted, when you get in game you get a happy upbeat song to the tune of a level whose traversability resembles that of a poorly made game with graphics that don't match the lacking quality of the level. The Jenga blocks are evil and you will get stuck on them because you're a loaf of bread with a big area and those jenga blocks don't leave much room on either side for you to pass.You are virtually immobile when not grabbing onto something, and I think that is just stupid. Grabbing should be a method to assist you to get from A to B, not be the only way to do it. Just have the bread flip and timble according to what edges/surfaces are touching what and in what direction the bread is travelling.Finally, make getting past the fridge easier. If you try to go up it you'll run out of grip before you realise there is no space at the top to climb over, and if you try to go in front of it you'll realise that the cubbard handles protrude so much that the stale bread you represent cannot bend the majority of its body mass around the corner of a fridge ever so slightly to grip the recessed area of the cubbard, which if you didn't know is basically everything except the handles.I said it once and I will say it again, stay away from the cubbard because it will ♥♥♥♥ you up.First level needs some SERIOUS rebalancing, music is too upbeat, camera is on steroine and the controls are aparaplegic. Those problems need to be fixed fast, because thats not how you add challenge to a game, thats how you make it unplayable, a hugely unappealing game, and a waste of €8.			"

								Let me start off by telling you what 'I am Bread' is. 'I am Bread' is one of the most moronic things ever created. It's a stupid little game where you play as a piece of bread and you have to toast yourself. That's it. The controls are absolutely terrible and the game is extremely difficult. This game is in very single way shape and form a piece of garbage. Which is exactly why you should buy it. You get to play as bread. If that doesn't appeal to you, then you're a sick and disgusting human being. As for the game being unplayably hard, that's the whole point of the game. No one said being a piece of bread was easy. No one really ever said it was hard, either, but they never said it was easy. This game is exactly what it was made to be. A stupid yet challenging game about being a damn slice of bread. I paid $8.49 to be a piece of bread. I'd pay it again if I could, it's that good. If you're the kind of person that thinks being a slice of bread would be fun, buy this game right now. If you're not that kind of person, then go kick puppies into a river or do whatever else it is that you party-poopers do.""12/10 would bread again."" John C. Calhoun, circa 1441 BC			"

								This game is great. Even though there are 4 levels in the game right now, I have fun playing them over again. (First level is the best :D). There are a lot of comments about how the controls aren't very good. They are 1, 2, 3, and 4 for gripping, and q,w,e, and r for locking the grip. Left click mouse to swing the bread, and right click to move the camera. I find the controls quite good actually. I got used to the controls really quickly despite everything else. To be honest, I couldn't see any other way for the controls to work anyways.Just some ideas that the devs could add are:co-op sandwich modeVS. mode (see who can get toasted with the highest quality)More stuff to smear in (jelly and butter are the examples in the game)A few more Easter Eggs just for the kicks. :)Overall I would give I am Bread a serious review of 9.5/10.Good job Bossa studios. This game has given me the inspiration to eat more and more bread.			"

								I don't often write reviews for games but I feel iI should for this, if you're at all interested in this game, but saw other youtubers play it and haven't gotten it yet because of how much they rage at the game, please just buy it. It's not NEARLY as difficult as on of the youtubers I've watched play it make it seem. I mean honestly the hardest part of this game is remembering your left from your right and figuring out how to get where you're going without lowering your edibility. So please ignore the let's players saying this game is really hard because it really isn't THAT difficult. Besides if it were easy it wouldn't be fun. Play with a controller though. The keyboard controls are not good.			"

												I am Bread is a third Steam game by Bossa Studios who are known thanks to their crazy Surgeon Simulator. If you've already seen (or played) the game, you know it challenges players by having difficult controls that makes it frustrating but also hilarious to play. In this case, they did it in pretty similar way, with important difference: You will be in control of a slice of bread that wants to get toasted. (A great potential friend for toaster from Red Dwarf!)Yes, it's a weird physics simulation game where you are trying to move bread towards a source of heat. Controls revolves around four buttons - a button for each bread's corner that makes it sticky. If you are now thinking about the movement, you have probably already thought out that all the movement is done by swinging and flinging on those stickied bread corners.I can't say it would be unexpected after Surgeon Simulator, but it's still important to say that I am Bread is a difficult game. It has a high level of difficulty, you'll be raging a lot because while you'll be trying to get to get toasted (by toaster or table lamp, for example), you'll also have to dodge all dirty and wet areas and objects. Don't even think about touching ground! It's like the floor is lava, it makes you taste bad which leads up to the game over screen. And one more thing, you have limited ""sticky timer"". You can hold on some place swinging just for a moment, then you have to lay somewhere to regain your energy for being sticky.While it's definitely a great game for skilled speedrunners, don't expect to get into it easily, you'll need a lot of practice to beat levels without getting dirty. Good thing is that the developers knew how begineers will suck at it, so after two times you lose a level, you'll get an option to remove the sticky timer and edibility meter (edibility is reduced by getting dirty).The main story mode offers a classic level list with funny short story, delivered via medical reports, about a man who gets crazy because he thinks that a slice of bread is destryoing everything in his house. But there's more! There's also a cheese hunt, bagel race (probably the easiest game mode), rampage (where you have to destroy everything with baguette), zero-g (to make you even more frustrated), and free play mode.It's worth mentioning that developers made a lot of free content for I am Bread later after release - Team Fortress 2 bread level, Goat Simulator mode (just change bread for goat) and Starch Wars mode, which is a kind of weird 3D space shooter with laser bread (referencing Star Wars, of course). Even if it's been done with the idea of cross brand marketing, I really appreciate that those updates came up for free!The game supports keyboard and mouse or gamepad controls. While other players had problems with controllers, I played with Xbox 360 controller without any problem, haven't seen any lag through my gameplay sessions.Conclusion:I am Bread is a perfect game for those who want something silly but difficult. It requires a lot of practice to get good at it, so depending on your perseverance, it can offer you many hours of entertainment and huge self-satisfaction in the end... or a lot of frustration. So it depends on your temper, but it's definitely worth buying.			"

								This game is basically ""the floor is lava"", except you are a sentient piece of bread whose quest is to become toast. Although the first level seems simple, there are multiple ways to achieve your goal, all with varying difficulty. You have to maintain your edibility level otherwise it's game over, because who the ♥♥♥♥ wants to eat a piece of toast covered in dirt and ants? You can also make yourself more delicious, if you so desire. Past the first level, the ways to become toast aren't exactly the most obvious, so you will spend time exploring the room and finding creative ways to reach toasty nirvana.The controls can be tricky to handle, and that's half the fun.. and all of the frustration. Although you can use your keyboard, using a controller is much simpler (assuming you can discern your left and right, otherwise it can be more frustrating). Overall, it's a stupidly fun game. Breadkin rejoice, your time to shine has come.			"

								First things first, the game is interesting and some what enjoyable when you really get moving. The game is still pretty frustrating as there are multiple ways to toast yourself but it doesn't really explain the mechanics to the game well at all and this one probably needs a real tutorial level or an info dump about things. Such as that most devices need to be prepaired before toasting, that jelly/jam helps you stick to wall when not gripping anything, or that if you toast wrong your edibility will go down. The camera controls should probably be less sensitive as they really mess with your controls some time.			"

												Like all wacky physics simulator games it's cute to play for a bit but ultimatly more frustrating than it's worth. And not frustrating in the makes-you-want-to-beat-it-more sense, but in the I-don't-understand-why-that-just-happened sense. The controls aren't meerly challenging as they are unpredictable. It's often difficult to tell what pressing forward will cause the bread to do; sometimes flopping one way or the other. The degree of motion is also somewhat confusing. Throwing the stick in a direction  can send the bread in a flying leap or have it just limply flop over. This sounds minor, until you factor in rediculous time limits and surfaces that can rapidly drain your health from a momentary touch. The physics engine can't behave itself (check the community page, it's like 60% gifs of the physics bugging out). Which again, is cute to see happen, but when you've spent 5 minutes making your way across a level, only to be thrown across the room by a bug, it quickly turns from cute to controller snapping frustrating. If you can pick it up for a couple of bucks the wackiness is certainly charming and distracting, but ultimatly the frustrating lack of agency in the game play will probably have you giving up long before you've explored most of the content.

												Not a game for everyone, lets just get that out of the way. But I do suspect Dark Souls players, such as myself, are in the right mind-set to understand I Am Bread, and enjoy it. Once I got the right idea, it became addictive and, amazingly, rather meditative.In terms of gameplay it's slow and takes loads precission and patience. If you're expecting run-and-gun instant satisfaction, look elsewhere, this is not a CoD generation experience. Make your way through a level at a snails pace, enjoying the journey, however, and victory is incredibly rewarding. Yes, the controls take getting used to, but it honestly didn't take as long as I thought to have my bread doing air-flips.One major issue that can't be ignored; the camera is not your friend. And in a game requiring such concentration and precission, that can be a right pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ (Likewise with Dark Souls.)All in all, I tip my hat to the developers for originality, incredible detail, and amazing sound design. (The music gets repetitive quick, but the sound of physical objects is outstadning.)			"

								TL;DR at bottom After Level one--------------------so far the game seems like a challenging one, and with my desire for challenge, this game was a good purchase. The controls are filled with freedom, I can put all sorts of muscle memory into these eight keys, allowing for quick, situation based reactions. I have just unlocked the second level but can not yet locate the toaster, I have scouted one half of the room, and soon I will check out the other. I am Bread has not yet gone stale, and I feel I could enjoy it for flours on end. It is enjoyable for me not only because of the challenge, but there is the fun appeal of being a bread, I'm not sure why but I feel as though I have always wanted to play as bread in a game. Luckily this isn't any sort of fake game like goat simulator, and I am excited to see what kinds of updates that could be in the future. The resolution settings are customizable like most games in case if the bread starts to look too grainy, and if you just barley make it to the toaster, but hit the ground, you have to wait until the next growing season.by playing this game I have reaped the rewards of being entertained and have recieved a hunger for bread. After level two--------------------Of course, I should've known, level two's toaster is  actually not a toaster. Apparently the game has some secrets up it's sleeve, hopefully it won't stump me for long next time. this game is just a sheaf of fun. On top of the controls, puzzles! Although maybe I was just too mesmerized by the bread to notice what wasn't intended to be a puzzle. Even if this game doesn't become the best or come out fully cooked, it plows the way for more innovative game designs. I thought I would do a short paragraph per level but realized I'd probably best slice the bread and cut to the chase. Sadly I could not part with all these puns.PROShardGood controls (so much muscle memory to be had)Sentient Breadinsane homeownerBushels of varietyCONSno multiplayer TL;DR If you like a hard game, and need some muscle memory fun, this is your game.

								At the moment, I can not recommend this game.  The controls are extremely confusing and frustrating.  Only once have I been able to get to the countertop in the first stage, and it was through sheer luck that I did it.The major problem I have is that climbing (or navigating at all) is not as simple as ""point in the direction you want to go"".  Numerous times, while wishing to scale the walls, I would press ""up"" on the controller (or keyboard, which is a bigger nightmare to use), and my bread would go down.  I would then press down, and my bread would move about half way, and be perpendicular to the wall.  Then, instead of pressing ""up"" at this point, I would have to rotate the stick 180 degrees around, and finally I could move forward.The game seems fun, but the control is extremely complex.  For a game like QWOP, which was a silly Flash game with no real purpose, this control scheme would be fine.  But this game seems to have multiple levels, each with varying levels of difficulty.  It's because of the control alone, and I can't recommend this game.At the very least, there should be an option to add in a simplified control, or to remap buttons.  Perhaps a less strict grip meter?  Make the floor not eat away at your edibility by just being stationary, but when you move?I understand this game is in early access, so I'm not being overly critical of it.  I do hope these ""problems"" are fixed though.  If they remain, I may not be able to play this game as I simply don't have the mental dexterity to handle it.			"

												I am bread trying to become toast. this sounds like something from Portal. This game is the ultmate bread simulator with a hint of goat simulator when you start to accidently fly and land on the floor. There shouldn't be anything fun about this, but the hillarity of clinging and yelling DON'T FALL to a piece of bread and then you fall and lose most edibility. Every time you play and watch others play, the outcomes are differient. I just wish they made multiplayer in their game.			"

								One dream. One Life. One slice of bread will make it's journey across the plains of a house to become, Toast. You will laugh, you will cry, you will throw your keyboard or gamepad across the room because the bread won't go in the toaster. Cover this slice of bread in butter, or jelly and become the most delicious piece of bread to exist, or y'know you could just fall on the floor and become the dirtiest piece of bread in existance on the brink of food poisoning.10/10 Baby(gamepad highly recommended)			"

												Wouldn't reccomend buying this game if you don't have a controller, I made that mistake. The game runs well, looks nice, and is funny at times, yet is extremely frustrating with the controls if you're just using the keyboard and mouse. What a shame, since this game did look pretty fun.

												This is more than just a joke game.  This is a masterpiece well worth your time.CONTROLS:First of all, personally I like the control system.  For the main story mode hold down a button to select a bread corner, then move it in the direction you want it to go.  Sure there is a short learning curve, but I find climbing and navigating the world with these kinds of control schemes very enjoyable.  The gifs you will find posted by the master players on the community hub are a joy to behold.  Don't be afraid.  Give it a go!If the controls still bother you there are plenty of game modes, (including a free roam mode) starring different characters who are mostly easier to control than a bread slice.Gameplay:The variety is what makes this game stand out against most joke simulators.There is plenty to do, and the game isn't reliant on humour to succeed.You can enjoy a Star Wars parody, you can hunt for cheese, you can race baguettes, and you can plate up the dirtiest piece of bread you have ever seen with a smile on your face after skateboarding through dust, ants and falling in the dish water.This is a unique fun game that deserves a chance.  Give it a go.			"

								I'm not one who's opinion of games is extremely critical, however, I must say this: the controls are out of whack!No matter what you set the controls to, this is an extremely frustrating game. I love the idea, however, it is nearly impossible until the player is fully used to the controls. If you are a gamer like me who cannot stand having weird controls, you may find yourself rage-quitting within 15 minutes of playthrough. I am also frustrated that whoever lives in this house doesn't put the Bread near the toaster! How inconsiderate! Doesn't the person even think about how long of a journey Bread has to travel to fulfill his dreams of becoming toast? In conclusion, I must say that I love the idea, and it has potential, but until the controls are decent, I think I'll stick to mostly first-person shooter games. In my opinion, no, I wouldn't play it much. But if YOU have always dreamed of a game in which you play as a piece of bread becoming animate who has to suffer through loss of inedibility, GO RIGHT AHEAD! THUMBS UP! 10/10 BREAD SLICES!!!			"

												For every moment of joy there's a moment ruined by the controls. The game seems to want very specific control of the bread, but only gives you the ablity to lean the bread, seemingly without any consistancy as to which direction on the analog stick leans the bread wich direction; forward is mostly forward, but sometmes back on the stick is forward. I don't know how many times I had to restart because left became forward and I landed in the eggs.			"

												This game is really great! and I know it looks like an intimidating buy, so I decided to put this together to help you decide!AHEM!!Darkness...Silence...And then,the flash of a knife in the dark I watch in horrible gut-wrenching anticipation I tenseand then...Pain!PAIN AS I HAVE NEVER FELT BEFORE!I wished with every precious milliecond of my short and inconsequential existance that the unbearable agony would cease!when suddenly...light....FREEDOMI pause... confused and exited. What is this wonderous feeling? for the first time, I wiggle my left corner... then my right... how? How is this possible? I squint around with my new found sight. At first the images make no coherent sense to me, colors and shapes swim before my eyes in a dance of choatic inanity. It seems to me that I am watching honey bear take supper with a family of badgers and a pair of rather snobish french ducklings. I see a butterfly flutter past, and my eyes follow it only to see it stop to perch on a Loaf of Bread.......could it be?surely my eyes must still be decieving me! but alas, as I peruse my surroundings for a second time I see nothing but a filthy kitchen with half empty bottles laying at random across the room. The counter top appeared to be overrun by a hoard of disgusting ants, and the table upon which I was laying seemed to have a Loaf of Bread sitting right in the middle, OF WHICH I WAS NOT A PART OF!I gasped in horrorIT WASN'T TRUE!it couldn't be!I? Seperated from my Loaf?I retreated within my self TRYING to regain the calm sense of quiet colaboration from which I was so violently torn!sure enough, I could no longer regain contact with my brethren.My soul despaired.but I am not one to sit and loaf about in a bad situation. I gripped the surface of the table with all of my might and flung myself headlong toward the edge. I peered over, shuddering to my self at the sight of the pathogen sullied floor a few feet below. I gazed across the gap at my destination, Took a moment to steele myself for the gravity defying leap, dug my corners into the table and pushed against it with such a force that it sent me careening into the air! There was a fleeting moment of despair as I realized that I would miss my intentended target, but I quickly regained my concentration to find a solution to my predicament. As I soared past the chair between the table and countertop, I managed to just grab the top with my left corner. For a moment I thought I was safe, but as I clung to the chair, it began to tip. Slowly at first, but then faster, and FASTER! I feared it would fall to the floor and crush me beneath its weight, but in mid fall the top of the chair hit the edge of the counter top... and stayed there! This was brilliant! I hoisted myself up from my precarius perch and up to the counter top just as the last of my grip strength ran out. I lay there gasping for breath as I let my tired corners rest. But it was no more than a minute or two's respite before I was compelled to flee from the newest danger of my harrowing journey. The ants. They ran on to me climbing up my white and fluffy sides as I tried hopelessly to shake them off. I could feel my precious edibility dropping as the ants crawled up and down my quivering body. I threw myself recklessly across the counter and began to climb the huge white expanse that was the refridgerator. As I climbed I began to feel better, as the ants were shaken off and hurled to their doom at the floor below. With a sudden realization I thought to myself that maybe... just maybe, this transformation from Loaf to Slice was a good thing! I was unlike any of my kind, I could move, I could breathe, I could SEE! I COULD HEAR! As I flipped myself over the top of the fridge I spied my destiation in the distance. A small, shiny metal toaster. Though the journey was far from over I knew it would be worth it, and I had many a reason to be encouraged. I was by all means, incredible! The soul triumph of NATURE! A GOD AMONG MY PEOPLE!!! I gaze at the lands over which I WILL NO DOUBT RULE!!!! and I find comfort in the fact that ....one day! I shall rule ALL GRAINS!!! every BAGEL and BAGUETTE!!! because from this moment on I AM KING!I... AM... BREAD!!!!...and that's only the first level!10/10 would rule again!			"

								9.5/10Only reason I give this a 9.5 is beacuse of the keyboard & mouse controlls, their a bit funky. With a controller, the game is pretty manageable. It's also a very fun and entertaining game, without a doubt. It's like Goat Simulator, but with bread. BREAD.If you like little quirky, fun, somewhat challenging, and bizzare games, this definately is well worth it. Now, I got it on sale for $8.49, and I believe $10 may be a bit much. For a game that's early access and is still somewhat buggy at times, I believe it's worth around $7.50. None the less, I reccomend this game if you like something you can♥♥♥♥♥♥around in.Once again, this game is almost made as a joke. Not implying that it's bad, but it's one of those jokes that in the past people would make fun of. ""HAH! Who'd want to play a game where you're a slice of bread?"" Apparently alot of people.KEEP IN MIND that the goal in this game is to become toast. By any means necessary. Be it Toaster or Radiator, your goal is to become toast.---Now i'll note why I believe the keyboard / mouse controlls are wonky.To grip onto things, you have 1,2,3, and 4. To grab things, you have Q,W,E, and R. To look around, you use Right Click, and to move around, you use Left Click. I believe this control scheme could have been improved in some fassion. Such as look around being locked onto the cursor.So ways I think they could improve the mouse & keyboard controlls;1. Make the camera snap to the cursor, so you look around by moving the mouse.2. Use a control layout that's a little bit more natural, for instance;---When I place my left hand on my keyboard, my fingers naturally will rest on (From left to right); Left Shift, A, W, D and the Space Bar. ---A Good Idea would be to change it from 1234 to LShift, A, D, and Space Bar, using W for push away from camera and S for being pull towards the camera (Or the direction that the camera is facing).---Another way to change the control scheme, is to do what's listed above, but change the camera look from mouse to arrow keys. This would make gameplay better on laptops, and users who prefer playing with a keyboard.The game is in early access, so again, things will change over time. Hopefully the controlls for keyboard/mouse will become more naturall over time.Aside from that, I do reccomend this fun quirky little game.			"

												Do I recommend this game? Yes and no is the simple answer. The more elaborated answer is a bit more... complicated.Yes, I recommend it because:+ The ultimate challenge for your patience+ wonderful, playful music+ nice graphics+ excellent ideaBut I don't recommend it because:- It's way too hard and unforgiving for its own good (imho).- Short soundtrack - all though lovely, I only played like 70 minutes, and I already got tired of the soundtrackI want to comment a little bit more elaborated on the ""too hard for its own good""-point here. I know this game is supposed to be hard, and I know it is the ultimate challenge. But in my opinion there are too many factors that makes you fail in order for this to be fun to play. Prior to ordering this game, I was just thinking that people were too bad gamers and soar loosers for down-voting this game due to its controls and being too hard. But now I understand them.It is hard enough to master navigating the bread; but once you learn that it's quite simple. HOWEVER, what I cannot grasp is why the most difficult aspect of this game is to get into the God forsaken toaster??? You've just been through hell to get to the toaster, and then you simply cannot get into the bloody thing. On the first story mission I mastered my skills to get to the toaster in like 3 - 4 minutes, which is quite good considering I just bought the game. But then you are rewarded by having to spend another 5 minutes to get the bread to actually go into the toaster. And that blew a fuse for me.The second thing that makes this game too difficult is how unforgiving it is; not only do you loose edibility (health), but also have a grip-counter which is way too short/small considering how you are sometimes supposed to hang above the floor infront of a grill in order to become toasted. It is also not rewarding enough. The grading scale in the end is way too demanding, which more often than not sends out a vibe that ""Hey, You suck ballz!"". I mean, I don't expect an A-grading for completing a mission in 10 minutes, but a D when I lost no health at all? That is just mean.So how to ""fix"" this game in my opinion? Make it a bit more forgiving; don't make it so difficult to get into the toaster after all the hell getting to the toaster, indicate WHAT is the toaster (it is difficult enough to get to it, you should not have to search for WHAT is the toaster), and make the toast more responsive to your controlls.All in all: If you like to torture yourself, and/or have an incredible amount of patience, this game is for you. The concept is brilliant. But considering the immense difficulty of the game I would not recommend this for the weak-minded (I guess I am a weak-minded gamer in this sense). My final verdict is a 7/10 for being a brilliant concept with good graphics and being a game that really stays true to its intended gameplay. But NO, I don't recommend this, unless you have some serious nerves of steel and is serious about sitting hours just to get through one or two levels of the game. "

												This was the first game I ever refunded. This game is brutally punishing. You might find yourself 30 minutes into a stage only to slip up and find yourself all the way back at the beginning. I'd be okay with that if the gameplay was enjoyable, but it isn't. You're a piece of bread and you move around with the agility you'd expect of a piece of bread. In many games like this, the bad controls add to the character or humor of the game. In Surgeon Simulator, for example, the failure is largely why the game is so much fun. But this is just bread. The humor doesn't last five minutes. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone.			"

												This is a good game but can be challenging. The controls are hard and clunky on purpose so if you hate games like that do not bother. The game also has a few camera issues but it does not really matter to me. The game lets you simulate many differant bread items in their daily life trying to become toast or destroy the empire or other things. Good game overall.			"

								After beating I am Bread, I can honestly say it is one of my favorite games. While it did only take me a little over two hours to beat story mode, there are lots of other modes that I have barely explored. You can be a bagel racing against the clock. Or you can be a peice of bread who has a goal of breaking everything. You can even fly through zero gravity. The controls are a bit hard at first (when using the computer), but I quickly got the hang of it.Pros:AWESOME game!Cons:Needs more levels in story modeOverall, I love I am Bread, it was well worth the money I paid for it.

												Of the numerous silly physics simulators, this one is the most artificially difficult and has the worst actual physics implementation: most movable objects will cause you to spaz out and possibly get launched across the level when you grab them, and your slice of bread has *way* too much mass -- I was able to hold a floor lamp by the lightbulb and Jerry Lewis it around the room with just my wiggling movements. That's one thing if I'm holding like an empty box, but a metal lamp? Few things behave like you expect them to, making each level less of a physics sandbox/puzzle and more of a trial and error hellscape. The final straw is the controls: mouse+kb is almost unusable, but you can rebind the keys, while a gamepad works pretty well, but is not rebindable -- so have fun with the god-awful default binds: you have to keep your fingers on the triggers *and* bumpers the whole time. This basically limits your gameplay time to 10-20 minutes, as any more than that will turn your hands into arthritic claws permanently. There are things to like about this game, but I wouldn't recommend spending more than $5 on it, and only then if you have a soft spot for goofy physics games. If they ever patch the physics to be less broken, it could be great, but as it stands, the physics are just too unpredictable.			"

												I Am Bread will look like a niche knock off broken simulator like Goat Sim at first glance, but look at the developer. The people who made this game also made Surgeon Simulator. It too is a wacky but functional simulator with unique mechanics. You are a slice of bread meant to become toast by using the map to heat up your slice. That is a goal, something real games have. Goat Sim's only progression is racking up points. In I Am Bread, each level begins with a psychiatrist's diagnosis card. That's a story. It seems that the owner of the house believes that somebody is breaking into his home, destroying his things, and leaving one single slice of toast. As you play the game, you will see what happens to the guy.I Am Bread is a good game with minimal bugs and a lot of features and puns since it got out of early access. It is best played with a gamepad though.			"

												Don't even think about trying this game with a keyboard and mouse. Their pun notice about ""kneading"" should be an indication of this.  Even with a controller I found the controls excruciating.  Learning the controls for a game should not take more than 20 minutes...I spent over an hour and still barely had a feel for them.Why spend a good 10min inching your way caustiously across the kitchen without getting dirt on yourself only to find that you can't even get in the toaster....and while trying to get in the toaster you fall off into a dog bowl of water.  I tried this several times..and took me 5 times before I actually toasted myself.  This is just not fun to me.Now if you outfit the bread with like grappling hooks to easily launch yourself or jam/honey packets that can be activated so you can stick better....that might be more fun.

								Good, silly experiences are hard to come by. Most end up just being one trick ponies and gimmick-a-thons. And the few decent ones end up being more like physics toys than actual games (Looking at you Turbo Dismount).I am Bread turns out to be an actual GAME rather than a toy. It's challenging, strategic and most importantly fun to play. The game is rather short. Right now there are 4 levels, each of which you could beat in 5 minutes (you won't, but you could). It took me 3 hours to complete. Might take a little longer if you choose to explore more.Most levels have alternate routes and if that's not enough you could just scoot along the ceiling.I've seen people complain about the controls, and I admit, the keyboard controls are pretty horrofic, so I suggest you use a controller. Learning and mastering the controls is the main challenge. You start out clumsily flopping around, smashing everything your way. And by the end you'll be making flips from wall to wall like a preschooler on acid.Cons mostly consist of some unwarranted failures due to wonky physics knocking over a toaster you desperately need. The learning curve is pretty harsh too. And the lack of real tutorial can be an issue if you get frustrated easily.Overall. The game if real fun. It didn't feel samey and I can't wait for more to come.A nod to the developers for showing us that a dumb game doesn't have to be braindead.			"

												BUY/SALE/PASS:  Sale - Wait for a sale priceAbout ten years ago, there came along a budget title out of Japan named Katamari Damacy.  In the tiny feet of a diminutive prince, players were tasked with picking up whatever random crap was strewn around a room/house/neighborhood/city/planet as fast as you can.  It was strange, yet strangely compelling; an oddity of video games that came out of nowhere and has since been milked dry as a concept; even the original creator has distanced himself from the series.  Weird games slowly drift by the wayside as video games break way into the mainstream, and things become normal.Then, in 2015, players were tasked with playing as a slice of bread.Bossa Studios, the creators of Surgeon Simulator 2013, bring us yet another bizarro creation.  As a single slice of bread, your mission in I am Bread is to get toasted by any means necessary.  Gripping the surfaces and objects around you with the corners of your bread slice (somehow…), you must traverse the various rooms of a house to find that sweet embrace of heat that will get you nice and crispy.  But don’t land anywhere gross or linty!  Otherwise you’ll end up inedible, and what will even be the point of being toasted?  The horror of such a thought!I am Bread is utter nonsense baked into a bizarre, fluffy bun.  Yet the gameplay is so fun and goofy, oftentimes creating some of the best accidentally funniest moments of any game released this year.  Purposefully frustrating controls leave the player pulling out their hair one moment and laughing the next.  There’s no escaping it.  You are bread.  And you will be toast, one way or another.  Delightful music, fun gameplay, funky concept, all worthy of a sale price purchase.			"

												I am Bread may strike people as a novelty game, but it has some real meat behind its fluffy appearance. The amazingly weird premise is bolstered by an intriguing control scheme and physics-based gameplay.  Though it has some crusty edges around its soft center, it has more than enough freshness to warrant a recommendation at its whole sale value. As an autonomous piece of bread, your main objective is to move from the rest of the stilted loaves to a place in the same room where you can become toasted. Environmental hazards like used band-aids and dirt reduce your edibility, forcing you to find different pathways as you jitter and flip your way around the house with the shoulder buttons and the left analog stick. The variety is surprising, as you'll find multiple ways to flip, toss, and jiggle your bread with the shoulder buttons. It might be weirdly unintuitive at first, but with practice, the controls become quite natural. It ultimately becomes a key part of the game from easily becoming a stale novelty. Suffice it to say though, a controller is a must. The keyboard and mouse combo would only wreck your hands. The crusty parts eluded to earlier involve a camera that can sometimes work against you. The angle can change quickly, altering the way the controls and forcing you to compensate for it. It happens infrequently, but leaves an irritating impression when it does happen. The environment could also use some life to it, as aside from the multiple ways to become toasted, there isn't much else to do in it. Some challenging trigger events like turning on the TV (which I found disappointingly unresponsive in the second level), or even a combo of related actions could have added much more value. Nonetheless, I am Bread provides fresh, delicious scent to an indie landscape overstuffed with me-too first-person shooter and rogue-lite games. Highly recommended for those looking for a new, action-oriented game and recommended still for everyone else.    "

I'm pretty sure this game broke my left bumper too....I got it 50% off, and I still feel like I didn't get my money's worth.			"

												In the same vein as Surgeon Simulator and QWOP, this game focuses on completing a seemingly simple task while using incredibly difficult controls. It's frustrating and I yelled a lot, but once I saw that golden brown toasty goodness (brushing off a stray bit of cat litter and broken glass here and there) I had to go back for more. Finally, a game that recognizes that the five-second rule is really only a suggestion.			"

I loved that they added ""Starch Wars"" when it was May the 4th. What's better than magical living bread on a mission to be toasted?.. SPACE BREAD. That's right. Nothing beats the satisfaction of passing a level.. even with an E grade! Worth every penny!  "

												If you've ever wondered what would happen if you mashed QWOP and OctoDad together I Am Bread is it. You play a piece of bread on a quest to get toasted in each level, using various items such as irons or radiators or frying pans. Touching the floor or any other dirty surface will reduce your edibility percentage and once that hits 0% you lose.Unfortunately, the game’s engine and programming also mean you will have to battle with the camera randomly adjusting itself on certain angles and the bread ragdolling around spastically from time to time. You can alleviate this to some degree by predicting which corner will contact next during a flip and hold that corner’s respective button down but even that can be a guessing game. Keeping in mind, your grip meter is counting down the entire time you are holding any buttons down so you’re on a time limit until you reach stable ground. After a few rounds of flailing and failure the game will throw you a bone by giving you an invincibility power up although using it basically removes any challenge from the game.I Am Bread is one of those games where you either love the concept or hate it, and I couldn’t find anything to love about it. Maybe it’s just me, but I would rather spend time fighting bad guys than my own controller. "

												A game where I am a piece of bread, made by the creators of Surgeon Simulator, with a decent premise and annoying controls... ""I'm so in,"" sucker me said. I fork out the asking price, start up and am impressed by the settings options better than some games. Choose controller option, then realize I can't navigate menus (including restarting) with my controller still need mouse for that, not fun annoyed starts. Ok start playing, controller seems way better then keyboard and OMG, I'm controlling a piece of bread go me... but soon I realized the controls are about 10 times more horrible then surgeon simulator, the collision detection is horrible, collision detection can also be influenced by camera angles, and the camera angels are forced and hard to get a decent line of sight. Furthermore the lacking camera angles prevent you from being able to see the level and the game lacks a free roam mode with no edibility so you can explore. I have played early access games thinking this has potential, however I feel this game isn't even developed to the point where you can tell yet. Also the question ""how do you control a piece of bread?"", was not answered very well by the devs. Until I see some major improvements in playability I would not recommend this game! If in the future this game does improve, I will update my review.UPDATE: So since my original review the game has receiceved quite a bit of content and polish. Of the content I enjoyed the startch wars, the controls were actually playable but couldn't figure out what to do after destroying three weak points on the main ship. I gave up on the bagel race but felt like the rampage control where pretty good. I also found 0-gravity mode fun but sill nearly impossible to controll, there was cheese hunt and free roam but those are thing I only do with my girl friend so I didn't give them a shot. I tried tutorial mode and it took my a minute to realize they disabled the joystick in tutorial mode which really made me think why!? am I alway suposed to be controlling my bread with the d-pad? The other thing I realized was that the menus are still not fully navigatable with a controller so overall I just can't recommend this game to people, the video makes it look like fun but then you play it's just too difficult to enjoy the experience.

Don't confuse I am Bread with an easy casual game where you can sit back and relax, you will be yelling at your computer and banging on the keyboard quite a lot. I love the difficult controls, it takes quite a while to learn them. It has a funny theme, and complex level design.  EDIT: Both glitches I mentioned are fixed now! Thanks, Bossa Studios, I guess you are really listening to your users!My only problems with this game has been that it doesn't work with my controller, a generic Logitech USB game controller. It also bugs out a lot when I try to move the camera, either making me look straight up, or directly down. Although these bugs are an aggravation, they are understandable, seeing that this game just reached it's full release about a week ago. Definitely a good game if you like crazy controls and excessive difficulty.			"

												You play as a piece of bread with a singular goal: stop at nothing to become toast!  But wait, you must also be edible, so no crawling around on the floor as you complete your quest for a toaster.You can individually control each of the four corners of your slice of bread, and each corner can be used to grab something.  The bread flops around with ragdoll physics as you strategically alternate between corners in order to flip your way to a suitable toaster.  Controlling the bread is unbelievably difficult, and made worse by poor camera movement, but you do get the hang of it after a few hours of severe frustration.  Thankfully, repeatedly failing every level allows you to optionally become invincible and complete the level without worrying about your edibility.If the toaster is broken how do I become toast?Each level has multiple methods that will allow you to become toast. You can turn on the radiator, break the tv, use the iron, light the grill... the list goes on.  There are also several possible paths to reach each, so you can play each level several times.The game has quite a bit of humor in it.  Story mode allows you to watch as your owner slowly goes insane.  Starch Wars mode allows you to fly around in a spaceship made from a slice of bread in order to save a baguette.  Team Fortress 2 mode requires you to become a Sandvich.  Other modes have you race around as a bagel, break things as a baguette, find cheese as a cracker, etc.  My personal favorite is Zero Gravity where you can soar through the house.I think the game is worth a shot, despite the incredibly difficult controls.  Just remember, Nobody wants to eat soggy bread. "

								As you have probably inferred, this is one of the many goofy ""simulator"" games that steam has become famous for.  However, going into the game with this in mind, you may have a surprise coming your way.  I'm actually really enjoying this games ""puzzles"".  If super monkey ball was a childhood favorite of yours, expect good things(that is honestly what came to mind while playing this).  As for my reccommendations for the developers... PLEASE  make a level involving nothing else aside from teleporting yourself for 3 days.  The reference cannot go undone.			"

												I Am Bread ♥♥♥♥in' ROCKS, lemme tell ya why.Pros:+Original concept+Wonky physics+Controller support+Many bread types to play as+Creative ways to toast yourself+Hard, but not impossible gameplay+Freaking bagel+Creative setupsCons:-Horrible keyboard controls-Sometimes the physics will break, and while this is mostly hilarious, it will kill you 99% of the time-Certain areas of walls and floor will kill you faster with no warning-Lots of trial and error (This can be a good thing, but here with the sometimes frustrating controls, it can get a little annoying)FINAL SCORE: 7/10With this game's wonderful concept and overall fun feel, you're bound to sink a few hours into it the first time you play. However, fragile physics and almost insta-kill areas of walls and floor can bog it down.			"

								This game is really fun to play when you have time spare, with its awesome level design , funky controls , endless possiblities and its great soundtrack (available for free) I would give it a 8/10. I would live to see some dlc for this game, maybe new types of bread that have pro's and con's ,maybe a christmas update just to bring in the festive cheer xD or maybe a co-op gamemode or mission to play with friends. Anyway, anyone who has'nt picked up this game yet should  definatly give it a try as it is relitevely cheap and has quite a lot of levels for the current state of development it is in.			"

""What even is toast?""Maybe there is a small piece of toast in each of us...Last words about the game... It might infact not be a game. But the meaning of life and the struggle we all go through on a cosmical scale while trying to find our own toaster.Toast is love, Toast is life. "

								Are you bready for this?I have played this game for a short amount of time as I've only gotten it today and I am albready addicted to it.The puns in this game are crumby and the controls for keyboard/mouse are stale. If you want the most out of this game I'd recommend using a controller.The sounds are firm and crispy and they did a good job with the physics of the game.I yet have to explore deeper into the game but so far it's great!Those puns dough!Buy it, buy it now!

								Do you like toasts? Dl you like toasting toasts? Do you like to toast toasts in toasters? Because if you do get this game. It will make you toast. If you don't like toasts well COME OUT OF THE TOASTER and get this game! It's fun, it's toasty and very crump like. Down sides: The game is absolutely impossible to play with just the keyboard. You need a controller. Playing without a controller is just like having a hardon in tight jeans. Not enjoyable and painful. Either ways, if you absolutely can't play with a controller for any reasons buy the game anyways because bread. 11/10 toasts out of 3 loaves			"

												When I saw this game for the first time, I thought it's just a ""meme"" cash grab kind of game, which will provide you with about 5 minutes of amusement. But let me tell you, that's nowhere near the truth.✓ The game is actually quite hard.✓ Full story mode.✓ Several game modes. (there's like 5)✓ Free updates.✓ Low price tag.✓ Devs listen to feedback.Also, I've seen few people say ""bad controls"" in the recommendation. I disagree, you can change the control scheme as you please. The difficulty of moving around is clearly a design choice, just like in Surgeon Simulator.After Surgeon Simulator, this game convinces me that Bossa Studios are a great development studio and I am excited to see what they manage to create in the future.

												Chcete hru, u které byste mlátili hlavou do klávesnice ? Kupte si I am bread. :DHodnocení:Pozitiva:+ Hra má hodně levelů.+ Hra podporuje ovladač a klávesnici.+ Spousta zábavy.Negativa:- Hra je v některých částí těžká (nejvíce asi ovládání které po chvilce tréninku zvládnete v pohodě)- Myslím si, že 12,99€ je na tuto hru moc, ale pokud si počkáte na slevu, tak tuto hru můžete dostat třeba za 5€ nebo méně jako jáCelkové hodnocení: 9/10Hru musím doporučit, i přes cenu.

												This game is meant to make you realize what you truly are. You play as a piece of bread who goes on a massive adventure to become toasted like it always wanted, and sometimes picks up unwanted things like fishbones or bandaids that wear down your edibility. But the deeper meaning is clear. The bread is you, as you traverse through obsticles of life to become what you always wanted, but along the way you collect memories that change who you are, and once you hit 0% you know your dreams are over. I cried a little after I realized what it meant, and I will never forget. I rate this masterpiece 10/10.			"

Don't touch the floor or anything else dirty otherwise no one will want to eat you, you may think this is a difficult task and yes you would be right but at the same time for a piece of bread you are pretty agile, climbing walls and leaping entire rooms too!!!

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine I am Bread is a game developed and published by Bossa Studios UKI liked I am Bread for its unique gameplay and ideas but it can get boring really quicklyYou have to have a good controller though (XBOX 360 controller recommended) to really be able to play the game, keyboard and mouse isn't really playableIt's a platformer at it's core and you have to toast yourself to beat each level avoiding dirty food, walls, and floorsThere are glitches and other bugs in the game. I'm sure they will iron out all the glitches and add more content in the near future so I would recommend this game only if you are not easily bored RECOMMENDED :)  "

												I am bread is a delicious game. It takes some time and a lot of patience before your bread flinging abilities become toast-worthy, and if you can get past the initial learning curve then you're in for a jam covered treat. The story mode for this game is amusing to play through and the gameplay offers challenging puzzles and various gamemodes.This is a well rounded game, fun for both killing time and spending days completing. My main comment would be to use a controller. Great game.			"

								I bought this game expecting a semi relaxing puzzle game but instead I got an inner insight to my own madness as I delved deeper into the what bread truly is. Bread is The Devil in edible form. Its inability to get toasted and my own determination to get the perfectly toasted morsel formed an ungodly combination  worthy of the book of revelations. I Would die and repeat as what little momentum I could generate was trampled under the ever darkening floor. As my many attempts of toasted glory ended up in trash I couldn't think clearly and the useall part of my brain that was used for sleeping eating and various other important tasks is filled with bread and anger towards the the most clingy hated force in the universe, Gravity. Would I recommend this game if you are sane and would like to stay sane? no. If you want to be insane and have yet to be then yes, but if you already have lost your marbles then you've already played the game and reading the review is waist of your time. You should be running naked down the streets.			"

												This is probably one of the best simulator games I have ever played. The fact that they have a free roaming mode to allow you to just do whatever the heck you want with infinite grip is amazing. It's everything you expect from the title and so much more shenanigans. Also... VCR bread is best bread. :3

												I am Bread, is well, about as plain as bread. I didn't enjoy it very much. If you have a tendancy to rage over games because you can't get your mind around it (like me) DO NOT BUY! This game is extremely frustrating, but at the same time the story is pretty interesting, some cool gamemodes, and your a piece of bread, you can do what you want. I will recommend this game because it's entertaining, but I got it on sale for 6.99$ CAD, I would not pay the full 14$ for this. If there was a mixed button for ""Would you  recommend I am Bread?"" I would press it, but it was just entertaining enough to be recommended.			"

								I was told this game was going to be an emotional story about a piece of bread that wants to be toasted. Bossa has delivered on this promise and given us the amazing game I am bread. My first try at level one was so bad that i won't go into details here. But when I got to level two i realised what was going on! This piece of bread is me trying to reach my goals in life. Struggling and sometimes getting dirty but getting there eventually then overtoasting myself.Hah just kidding its bread trying to be toasted, its fun and funny! Give it a shot!Highly recommend this game I would give it 11/10 and GOTY status. "

								This game truly spoke to me, a heartfelt story of a slice of bread, I cried multiple times and this isn't just a game. This is a masterpiece crafted from the bottom of one's heart and molded into the finest product ever released for our precious eyes to see. The soundtrack is also very emotional, it reminds me of a treacherous journey through the depths of the fires of hell with a pinch of distraught and hopelessness. All in all, this game is a must have for everyone, 10/10.			"

								This game would be a silly amusing time waster if the controls were better. As it stands, the keyboard controls are a nightmare and the game isnt picking up my Logitech f310 in either Dinput(standard controller) or Xinput (mimics an Xbox controller) mode. Pretty much all games that work with a microsoft controller work with Xinput mode so I dont know what the issue is. In any case, since I can only currently use the keyboard controls I have to base my review off of them, and they are terrible. Like not terrible-fun. Terrible as in ""spastic ragequit abomination"".Too bad, really. Heres hoping they fix the controls, cuz this game looks entertaining.			"

								Finally toasted above the wretched floor of the lounge room with 83% edibility.Started to invade the bedroom and set crumb in some greeny browny substance on the wall.Realised my mistake and darted over to the other side of the bed towards the window while bringing a beer with me.Got past the window and found a skateboard.Thought to myself ""FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN"" seeing as I know how to 'turn' a skateboard left and right with the help of physics.Got up on the skateboard, had a problem with my controller and then i fixed it.My piece of bread started spazzing out and then i tried to reach the edge of the skateboard to turn it.Skateboard spazzed out, I went flying with it and then flew to the bed and 'rubberbanded' as it looked like, between the shelf and bed.Fell on the carpet and gave the ants a good breakfast....10/10 best $10 ever spent on a life simulator "

												well you're bread..........and your goal is to become toast though i'm sure you already know that if you read the description.i am bread is a unique game about using your sticky corners to grip to the enviroinment and fling yourself to victory! though like any good game this is easier said than done, being bread you have to make sure that your eddibility doesn't go below 1% or you lose, so you need to avoid the floor, dirt, and other things you wouldn't want on you're toast. to be more specific on the controls on a key board you use the 1 2 3 and 4 keys to stick to objects the q w e r keys to hold objects and use the mouse to fling yourself whatever way depending on what keys your pressing (you can change these in the settings) but don't ignore the warning for most people it works WAAAAY better with a controller (i am not most people) if you use a controller these are the control equivelents: RB LB RT LB =  1 2 3 4 a b y x buttons = q w e rLS = mouseyou also have grades in this game A++ = best time, 90% eddibility, and never running out of grip F= failed the leveloh and that's another thing i should mention when you press any of your corners to make them sticky a grip meter starts running out if it runs out you automaticly let go of whatever you're holding ussally meaning you fall into some dirtthere's multiple modes in this game too there's cheese hunt where you play as a cracker and have to collect cheese no eddibility to worry about but you have integrity meaning if you smack yourself to hard or fall you lose integrity lose too much and you lose there's rampage where you're a beugettue and you have no gri[p meter no eddibility or integrityinstead you have a time limit to smash as much as you can there's zero G which puts the bread on rockets and you have to become toast like that. i could go on but i'm sure you want to be done reading this game has alot go buy it!BTW don't toast yourself in real life.

This tutorial level made me think ""Am I really going to torture myself by trying to actually play this one?"" The answer, of course, being ""no.""It is too bad, because the game itself is probably pretty neat.

												A game about bread with a life long ambition to become toast....there is no other game like it. humerous sillyness with an adept amount of skill required and patience. If your the sort of person who rages easily i wouldn't recommend it but if you think you have the skill then go forth and make all bread into toast.			"

								There is only one way to succeed in this game.There's a ea in bread and an ea in team. You and your breadthren have to become one with each other. After you have got the basics, and your mentality in check. It's time to Bread Willis your way to the toaster. Tis a silly game, full of easter eggs and laughs. The controls take a bit of practice, and you'll definetly die a lot. But the feeling of joy and relief when you've toasted yourself, is an experience to be had.			"

												Played this game for 15 minutes. Could not even get through the tutorial level because the control scheme is GODAWFUL.A tutorial level should ease you into the controls, and give you the feeling that you want to try out the game for real. This tutorial level made me think ""Am I really going to torture myself by trying to actually play this one?"" The answer, of course, being ""no.""It is too bad, because the game itself is probably pretty neat. But with controls like this, I will never experience it.There are too many pleasant games in the world to actually spend time trying to find enjoyment in this one.			"

												I personally enjoy being a floppy piece of bread that just has nothing to do in life but to flop around, and slither on my bready face around the floor and flip-ady-flop on the walls. Honestly I think I now classify my true gender identity as a (SpiderBread) and i shall too take action on silencing all those that apose my fellow bread and toasters I call my friends.       This game is recommended for people who have nothing to do than protend to be a piece of bread and try to toast yourself to profection, honestly kind of ♥♥♥♥ing pothetic but still fun. 8.6/10.			"

I forget that getting rank S 100% toasting isn't my biggest issue in my life.As long as I stay in game, the only problems I have in life are that I keep falling on the ground, getting crawled on by ants, grow mold out of no where, and can't have myself evenly toated on both sides with butter side down.

Early Access Review
								Now that I've had a decent amount of time with the controls & have played through all 4 available levels I believe I can write my own take on the game. Note: I'm not great at this game, I have failed countless times. This is all based on my experience as someone playing this for fun & taking my time towards the goal.I am Bread, from the makers of another favorite of mine Surgeon Simulator, leaves you in control of a slice of bread as you try to toast yourself by any means possible. I love the concept itself; it's silly, fun and frustrating beyond belief. It's more of a hit or miss if you'll like it. I'd suggest watching the game play and understanding that the controls are difficult and the game isn't completely serious before you buy it & suddenly find yourself upset because it's not perfect. It's Early Access & the developers are still adding a lot to this so I'm pretty content with what we have so far, though there's still a long way to go. *This means go to the Discussions and make suggestions, not whine over not besting the controls in 20 minutes* With that said...Pros:- You are bread- You can roll in jam & butter to aid you in your goal- Be creative! There are other ways to heat bread other than a toaster, have fun with it.- A short narrative that follows our destructive path.- You can crawl in cereal or other things.- Make your heat source with destruction.- Smash things.- Take your time, have fun!- Playing/Watching this over live broadcast with a group of friends is very entertaining.- Procrastination simulator.Cons:- The controls are hard. I don't see any way of this being improved, to be honest.

								Now that I've had a decent amount of time with the controls & have played through all 4 available levels I believe I can write my own take on the game. Note: I'm not great at this game, I have failed countless times. This is all based on my experience as someone playing this for fun & taking my time towards the goal.I am Bread, from the makers of another favorite of mine Surgeon Simulator, leaves you in control of a slice of bread as you try to toast yourself by any means possible. I love the concept itself; it's silly, fun and frustrating beyond belief. It's more of a hit or miss if you'll like it. I'd suggest watching the game play and understanding that the controls are difficult and the game isn't completely serious before you buy it & suddenly find yourself upset because it's not perfect. It's Early Access & the developers are still adding a lot to this so I'm pretty content with what we have so far, though there's still a long way to go. *This means go to the Discussions and make suggestions, not whine over not besting the controls in 20 minutes* With that said...Pros:- You are bread- You can roll in jam & butter to aid you in your goal- Be creative! There are other ways to heat bread other than a toaster, have fun with it.- A short narrative that follows our destructive path.- You can crawl in cereal or other things.- Make your heat source with destruction.- Smash things.- Take your time, have fun!- Playing/Watching this over live broadcast with a group of friends is very entertaining.- Procrastination simulator.Cons:- The controls are hard. I don't see any way of this being improved, to be honest. It takes time to get used to them but once you are it's more of a challenge of not touching the floor.- The floor is lava. - This guy's house is disgusting. There are some walls you can't touch without dying if you don't respond fast enough. The carpet is not always so forgiving depending where you land.- The grip meter is necessary but it goes from fun to frustrating when you spend all that time climbing but you miss a beat & drop onto the nasty carpet again.- The timer. I beat a level in 5 minutes without soiling my bread & I made a D at best. Unless you're hardcore going for that heat source I wouldn't expect a great rating.- The camra angles.- ^ I stepped on hair & couldn't see it at first.- He's worried about bread wrecking his house yet he has garbage/germs littered everywhere.

												Maybe I would find it fun if I gave it some more time, but I don't really feel like spending more time on something that requires so much practice for so little. The game seemingly punishes you for nothing (it's dirty surfaces, but just getting even remotely close to them kills you), physics are completely haywire (again, more random punishment, you've done good, and the game just slaps you back in the face) and it just isn't funny when there is mostly a sense of pointless punishment, rather than a good feeling of achievement. Got to the bathroom level and then I just ended up saying ""no"".I guess some of the jokes are funny enough, and the story seems interesting, but I was expecting Surgeon Simulator kind of fun. It just isn't. It's like portal's ""hard mode"" where they mistook frustrating for difficult.			"

Early Access Review
								The game has been fully released now s I thought it best to update my review.Still virtually unplayable with the controls it has. Moving around is beyond silly. What makes it worse is the lag in controls as well.  I'm running a i7 and this game still has delays within the control system.Graphics are mediocre at best. (And this is final version?)There IS a goal of trying to toast yourself. Exciting.Anyway, if you hit the floor you die very quickly. Move on other objects and they smash. Not sure if I am meant to smash all the objects or what but that seems the high point of gameplay.Its general control has improved slightly since alpha, BUT there is still virtually no control of the main player.  The bread apparently has suction cups on the corners but they only last a little while. You end up just flopping around and spinning in circles. Movement is based more on luck that skill.Game itself seems aimed at either little children who may get a thrill out of flopping around like soggy bread, or those that may be easily amused (or those with child like mentallity.) There is no real purpose to the levels or real storyline. I gather its meant to be a bit of a joke type game but really the gameplay is the joke. The developers seem to have had enough of the game, and released it as ""Final"" rather than fix up the bugs, poor graphics, poor gameplay and contolability issues.They did add some silly levels that appear to have been done in a rush just for basic content fill, but none of those add anything to the game overall.Contrary to all the silly coments and juvenile jokes, the only joke is developers charging for this.For anyone looking for a game that is challenging, fun to play, and value for money - LOOK ELSEWHERE! This game is not worth it, and although while it was in alpha I had slim hopes they would improve it, now that it supposedly finished, it is not worth the time of day.AVOID!If you want to join the kiddy clubs and make silly jokes then spend your ""bread"" on this, and enjoy a half baked crusty game.

												Played this game with my wife and daughter who managed to make a piece of toast with fluff and ants on it ... Really fun game but much more enjoyable with a controller. The camera can be quite shaky sometimes but generally it handles quite well considering you are basically just a wobbly piece of bread. The variety of ways you can cook yourself in all the levels is great which means there is alot of replay value, I managed to cook a peice of toast using a rocket ship and a TV for example.

If you've ever dreamed of riding a skateboard as a sentient piece of bread, this is the game for you!If your idea of a game is gritty realism and SRS BUSNESS, go elsewhere.  No, seriously, STAHP THE HATE.  This game is pure mindless FUN with a side of immense difficulty and some jam on top.			"

												This game is AMAZING. It has a fully immersive and well written story mod in a 3d world with physics that will blow your mind. Not only this but it also has a fully working, bread themed star wars parody where you fly a bread, thats right, ""Fly a bread"". In this mode you, the bread leader, have to save the rebels from the evil ironing board. 11/10			"

												Edit--The developer has reached out saying that there is a new control scheme to address some reviewer's concerns like mine. I will revisit this review and update accordingly once I try it out.Great that the developer took the time to read and respond to reviews nonetheless, regardless of how the scheme turns out.Old review--Recommended ONLY if you enjoy the likes of QWOP and other awkward control games and have a lot of time to master the controls. I mean a lot of time.There once was a time in my life where I would have loved to pour hours into overcoming these challenges, but with a job and an active life - this is no longer the case.Otherwise, hilarious game!

								The game is great, looks great, sounds great, but it plays...well I'm not sure. I bought this to play on my Macbook, but something like this has to be played with a controller. Trying to play on keyboard is more than just frustrating its near impossible. After 2 hours of trying I was never able to complete the first level, which you need to do to unlock any of the new updated features. I got close a couple times and I can see where if I were willing to continue playing I could probably get passed it. But at this point, I've lost my interest.  So if I had to do it all over again, no I wouldn't buy this. And I can only suggest this if you have a controller to enjoy it with. Otherwise there are a lot of other, keyboard and mouse friendly, humor type games on Steam.			"

												Hey so i wanted to review this game so other people who are wanting ""I Am Bread"" can read before deciding to get this game.So i added this game on my wishlist almost 2 years ago. . Almost two years later i got it.When i got it, i expected the controlls to be ""Bad"" because i watched jacksepticeye play it but man i did not expect it to be this bad.the controlls are... really hard to get the hang of. I  cant even climb up anythingXDit litterally spent  40-50  OR SO MINUTES I REPEAT 40-50 (even mabye 60) OR SO MINUTES GETTING INTO THE TOASTER ON THE KITCHEN LEVEL (The first level!) (I also had to find another way to toast my selfXD)I had to use the power up thing(Forgot the name sorry:/) to beat the first 2 levels on Story Mode.....But thats just me most likely....Moving on!The bagel rece is pretty fun (Though if you play it with out getting the hang of the controlls like i did. level number  3 is gonna be hard (You have to climb up walls)But then again this could be all me me just sucking at the controlls really bad.So you could like it mabye for you it wil be worth 15 bucks or you can get the concept of the controlls better.But i also played it for a little bit then stopped so i really have no place for making a reviewXDBut in my opinion i DON'T like this game. Mabye i will change My review, but i dont think i'll ever play that game againXDIf you stll want to get it after reading this then do it! :)Bye!			"

Far worse than Octodad, Surgeon Simulator, and any other games like that. I know it is the point, but I believe that they took it a little too far. There is a point where it is no longer funny. It is in early access, so maybe my thoughts will change as the game does.			"

I was expecting a difficult game like surgeon simulator where the controls are tricky but capable of mastering while the suroundings kept the challenge up, but instead I got a difficult game because the controls are so rediculous that it forces you to spend 10 minutes just to move a few feet. I dont know what it would take to make the controls more bearable, but if they dont fix it soon, i probably wont play it again. Sorry Bossa, but please try again.			"

								Where do I even start with this game? The emotions, the journey, all of it. Amazing. I cried at the end of the game. Such a touching ending. Truly, this gives one a true perspective of what it's like to be toast, and while doing so pokes at the qualities that make us who we are. This game was an emotional rollercoaster, going from fun and hilarious to serious and philosophical. This made me question reality itself, for I think I may have been a piece of toast in a past life. Like the glory of the sun, this game is a shining hope for humanity and gaming. Call of Duty and all those other ""next gen"" console games are nothing in comparison to this glorious and heartfelt game. All in all I give this game an 11/10, for this game has changed my life for the better.			"

												QWOP with toast.If you aren't familiar with QWOP, it is a game where you have to control someone's individual joints to make them run/walk. It is incredibly awkward as a control scheme and is basically a joke game.I Am Bread is basically that, except instead of controlling a person, you control a piece of toast. You can stick one or more of the corners of the bread to a surface in order to move, flipping over and over again to get around the level. You can stick to anything, and ultimately, the game is a bit of a physics puzzle.The problem is that the incredibly awkward controls are endlessly frustrating. Getting into the toaster in the first level is an arduous, unpleasant task which takes an enormous amount of work. The toast flops around freely and almost uncontrollably, and while it is not that hard to simply move around large, flat surfaces, any sort of specific positioning is an awful, awful chore.And that's just the first level.This game is endlessly frustrating and unless you actually, genuinely enjoyed QWOP, this game will drive you batty.

												The controls are frustrating to the point of not being any fun at all.  Movement is partially based on camera placement which can make things really awkward.  And that's not the worst of it.  The extra game modes bring in some interesting variety, but not enough.  There's no fun to be had here, there's not even any novelty that wears off quickly.  The controls are so hard to grasp that I didn't find myself having any fun and didn't have time to learn the controls before the novelty wore off.  Maybe if there was some sort of multiplayer this game might be worth the purchase, but I don't see it being worth anywhere near $10 at the moment.  Maybe $2.50.			"

								I just beat the last room in Early Access and I have to say that this is a great game. It’s quite simple; you are a piece of bread on a quest to become toasted. The controls definitely take some getting used to, as they are much different than many other games. After some time though, it becomes easier. But when you are falling to the floor because your grip ran out, it becomes a little hectic and difficult to get the right buttons. The music is catchy and tends to get stuck in your head. Though, in a good way. I would definitely recommend this.			"

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him. ""if you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate. you have to stop immediately."" Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exacly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me - ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through"". I agreed. At 27, i have never touched a cigarette. I must say. I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I can't believe they raised the price to $13, not worth it at all. Go buy something else like Octodad, or a Five Nights At Freddy's game. Portal is friggin' sweet to, just don't buy this!!!! The only reason you should buy this is if you have an X-Box controller, and even then it would probably suck. The controls are terrible, and frame rate often slows down, camera is also terrible to. The only way this game would be fun is if it had a lovable character like... oh, I don't know... OCTODAD?! Don't listen to all the others... unless you have an X-Box controller, this game SUCKS!!!!			"

												This game has some very hard controls but with a controller it is way better. The game is very fun and I do like Bossa Studios games because they do not give you the easiest controls they want to challenge you in a way you will rage. But boy does it feel good beating one of the levels, I have played up to level 3 in the story so far but there are other things to do like Rampage where you destroy everything. There is Ram-Page where you are the goat simulator goat destroying everything. There is Zero Gravity, that is where you just float around and try to get toasted. There is Starch Wars, where you are the piece of Bread like a tie-fighter, I haven't played starch wars too much so I do not no they objective. There is also bagel race where you are a bagel rolling around the house trying to get all the checkpoints and get to the finish line in the shortest amount of time. This game is extremley fun I would give it a 9/10. I ussualy give 10/10, but at first it is so hard that I had to take away 1 so. I just love this game, and so I also got surgeo simulator, MUCH HARDER, but still fun. I just love the way this game was developed and if you are really bad after failing for like 5 tries there is like a golden thing and if you get that you are invincible. So you dont lose edibility when you fall on the floor. Oh yeah I forget to say this game is about you, a piece of bread, trying to get toasted. Also if you have Octodad and like it, this is the game for you but with a different objective from octodad. Just I cant exspress how much I like this game I know I havent played it for like 100 hours like some people but I still just like this game very much even if I have only played it for 8.5 hours on record, but bossa studios keep up the good work on your games they are very, very enjoyable and raging, but the rage makes it fun.

								To play this game is to understand the compelled nature of a salmon each spawn. You'll face the same adversity as the noble Sockeye, adversity such as making seemingly impossible jumps, climbing amazing obstacles and defying physics as we understand them. The futility of life is put on beautiful display as each run ends with the death of our hero so that the species might propagate... into a bread slot.I feel like I learned about the monumental daily struggles of bread, and that I now have a much greater understanding of myself, of my place in this world.

I beat it, sure, but I vow for my own sanity to never touch this game ever again. Its unforviging, enfuriating, and rediculous. The controls cannot be more difficult. There are only 4 keys. The keys never do whta you want them to. After spending 20 minutes on one life, you will die, and realise, you just wasted 20 minutes on this piece of sh*t game. I literally wanted to die the entire time. For your own sake, dont touch this game. I used a controller too, by the way.			"

												This game has some very hard controls but with a controller it is way better. The game is very fun and I do like Bossa Studios games because they do not give you the easiest controls they want to challenge you in a way you will rage. But boy does it feel good beating one of the levels, I have played up to level 3 in the story so far but there are other things to do like Rampage where you destroy everything. There is Ram-Page where you are the goat simulator goat destroying everything. There is Zero Gravity, that is where you just float around and try to get toasted. There is Starch Wars, where you are the piece of Bread like a tie-fighter, I haven't played starch wars too much so I do not no they objective. There is also bagel race where you are a bagel rolling around the house trying to get all the checkpoints and get to the finish line in the shortest amount of time. This game is extremley fun I would give it a 9/10. I ussualy give 10/10, but at first it is so hard that I had to take away 1 so. I just love this game, and so I also got surgeo simulator, MUCH HARDER, but still fun. I just love the way this game was developed and if you are really bad after failing for like 5 tries there is like a golden thing and if you get that you are invincible. So you dont lose edibility when you fall on the floor. Oh yeah I forget to say this game is about you, a piece of bread, trying to get toasted. Also if you have Octodad and like it, this is the game for you but with a different objective from octodad. Just I cant exspress how much I like this game I know I havent played it for like 100 hours like some people but I still just like this game very much even if I have only played it for 8.5 hours on record, but bossa studios keep up the good work on your games they are very, very enjoyable and raging, but the rage makes it fun.

												I spent 1 hour into this and this is my story,-Becomes bread-Shuffles my way over to the table-Dies-Dies over and over again-Tries for the last time-Falls over on the floor by accident-Screams-Gets up with 70% edibility thinking I can still do this-My spirit gets me to the fabulous toaster-I feel amazing as I try my very best to get inside the toaster-Bread does 10 backflips in the air randomly and lands in cat litter-Dies-Rage Quit But, In all honesty, I actually think the game is slighty decent (but quite annoying and quite challenging) and I do think that the sound track its awesome, but the controls are really annoying and I think that if I were to get the game on a console or at least something with a controller, I would enjoy it a bit more (even though that is not the game fault, still (please read the below section  labelled UPDATE to answer this)). I am going to say though that this game isn't for everyone. I wouldn't reccommend this game for people who just rush into an area on COD with no mental stratergy or skill. You need to ability to stay calm in stressful situations and think about what you are going to do. However, on the Keyboard and Mouse, I don't think this game is any good. I dont think with a controller it is that good to buy. Even with all that said, I don't think the game is worth £10. I did get it on sale (but obviously requested a refund) for £2.49 but if it weren't on sale, I would say a good price is £4.99 or lower (in my opinion, I would rather get other games than this). 4/10 total but If I did have a controller (which isn't the games fault that I don't have a controller but stil), maybe 4.5/10UPDATE:A comment recently came in from the developer of the game (Colm_Ahern) telling me about controller support.Yeah I did realise there is controller support but a controller isn't the only problem with the game. The game is slighty decent in terms of graphics and humor but the controls of the game (the way you have to grip the corners in the way the bread moves) and don't even get me started on the toaster. I got to the toaster over 10 times and not once could I mangage to get the bread inside the toaster (not just me who struggled with that). Also, the camera angles are really annoying and the bread can sometimes do 10 backflips in the air when you get the toaster and lands somewhere in the level nowhere near the toaster for no apparent reason and then land somewhere in the level no where near the toaster. Futhermore, the bread can move a whole fullsize wooden chair but not a salt shaker? Really? I think to make this game good please, change the controls (the way the bread grips, not a controller - although a controller may help, the controls are still not good), fix the camera angles and I think that it the bread touches the top of the toaster, the bread should go inside the toaster, not the player having to do that. And I saw many friends and youtubers struggle with that aswell (alot of youtubers never even got inside the toaster).			"

												I went into this game expecting what everyone else was when they first saw this game. A physics based game like surgeon simulator, but a platformer. Surely this was headed towards amazing comedic effect and fun gameplay, right? well you're an idiot if you still think that after more than an hour of playing this processed horse urine. Not only does it control like a drunk clown trying to do a balancing act while sucking on a cats nipples, but it feels like walking through a pool of molasses and rusty nails. You could ram your head on the sidewalk outside of your house for an hour and get the same effect that this game would give you. I'm sick of people saying this game is funny, or fun in general. It looks like something a college freshman cooked up on unity with 20 minutes of work and a $3 budget. It makes me ashamed that I decided to play this trash, and i'm even more ashamed that i played all the game modes trying to find something good. Except bagel, Bagel knows whats up. but you cant even enjoy him because he only has like 6 levels; then it's back to the same awkward controls that give me a brain tumor. Maybe if you sat down and really tried to master this games controls while also ignoring the graphics that look like something a dog would throw up, but doing so would be cruel and unusual torture. This game makes me feel like hanging myself. the end			"

								To play this game is to understand the compelled nature of a salmon each spawn. You'll face the same adversity as the noble Sockeye, adversity such as making seemingly impossible jumps, climbing amazing obstacles and defying physics as we understand them. The futility of life is put on beautiful display as each run ends with the death of our hero so that the species might propagate... into a bread slot.I feel like I learned about the monumental daily struggles of bread, and that I now have a much greater understanding of myself, of my place in this world. At around 10.00USD, you too can experience this life-defining title.10/10			"

												As much as I love breaking glass and caressing my naked body with jam. When it comes to games I like to be able to use the camera controls to see the space infront of me, not to stare at the small patch of wall behind me whilst trying to blindly move.This game holds a mass of novelty factor that makes it playable, but once you get over that all thats left is a challenging game with horrid controls, extremely rigid camera settings and levels that punish you for small errors (which happen easily due to the controls and camera).7/10 for the first hour or so.Take away an additional 1/10 for every 5 minutes after you've became toast on a flaming tv that you crushed with a conveniently placed bowling bowl on the shelf above it.This game is worth if on a good sale but otherwise save your money for pizza :)))			"

												This game is buttered alot and it derserves it.  The game is obvioulsy following a piece of bread but your objective is to become toast.  The game has a story but yhe only way to find out about everything is reading the papers before each level.  The game  will become repetetive but it will be refreshed once you unlock the different modes and for the people who find this game rage inducing, just unlock ""rampage"" mode and become baguette and destroy the room that made you mad.  I definitely recomend this game if you have the patience to go through about half the levels to unlock the modes.			"

												The minimum requirements for the game says ""2.4 GHz"" for Windows, yet my processor bottlenecks it to barely reach 30fps when it is overclocked to 2.52 GHz (temps fine). As much as I'm sure it's a good game, I cannot recommend it since it had me buy the game based on minimum specs which were wrong.Still runs poorly on my new PC with CPU clock speed of 3700 MHz.Thanks for Linux support, review on gameplay coming soon.

								If you've heard anything about this game, then you already know that it's difficult. However, if you choose to play this game, then I can NOT stress enough the importance of keeping calm, throughout this game. The physics system is borderline non-existent, however the gameplay itself is actually kinda fun (in a uncontrollable laugh at the broken physics of the game, kinda way). This game can be a ton of fun, but for your own health, I strongly, strongly, STRONGLY recommend that you do NOT take this game seriously, for the game itself is a joke.			"

Then, i was at the top fair and square. No more moves to go. And guess what? i fell to the bottom again without doing any thing. i rate this game 0 out of 10. If the creators see this, then please make changes to the game.

												I Am Bread I guess would best be defined as a puzzle/adventure game, for it certainly has aspects of both genres. You may or may not like this game. If you're like me, you brought the game because of the interesting title name and backstory.That said backstory is that you literally play as bread. You are some guy's bread, and you need to move around his house haphazardly in order to 'toast' yourself. I thought this title would be worth a look, so I went ahead and brought it, and soon found out that this was a hard game.I'm not opposed to challenge. Some of the best games of all times were also the hardest. Challenge however shouldn't come in the form of bad camera angles and shoddy controls.The idea behind I am bread is interesting, but once the novelty wears off, you'll probably find the game to be lackluster. Spending ages climbing up a fridge only to have you work undone by the punishing game mechanics isn't fun. It's tedious and boring. And once you get to the top of the fridge, you have to  proceed down a linear path in order to climb the next obstacle.Ultimately, my point is this. You are apiece of bread which climbs things. There are literally only three or four game play elements that provide challenge. These game play elements are nothing new or exciting, and certainly not worth the price of this game.If you can get it on sale, it might be worth a try. As it stands however, I Am Bread leaves a lot to be desired with me. This could have been an interesting game, but it is just so... boring, repetitive and tedious.			"

												What a punny game! You knead to play it to dough what I mean, but I'll at yeast rye to baguette the message across. So you starch as a piece of bread and you have to bake your way to the other side of the room and toast yourself, whilst avoiding obstacles like sand,which makes you inedible. Sounds simple, but crust me, it's hard. Are you bready to rise to the challenge, or will crumble under the pressure? Sorry, I'll wrap this up now, that's enough punishment. I loaf this game.			"

								***A NOTE to those having issues on PC: I played on the lowest and the highest graphics settings with keyboard and mouse and although the game ran smoothly on my beefy computer in both cases, the bread handled absolutely terribly in low settings. In high settings the kayboard/mouse performed just as well if not better than when I played with a controller! So if you're having troubles experiment with different graphics settings. This issue may or may not get better as the game is worked on as it is currently in Early Access as I'm writing this review.***If the above or below is helpful to you please thumb up so it can be helpful to others as well :-)Here's the ""what you need to know"": Control the 4 corners of a piece of bread to navigate across levels and find a way to make yourself into toast. It's much harder than it sounds as the bread is quite difficult to control. You can move and break most anything in a level so sometimes it's fun getting sidetracked and just break stuff. As you move your way up along objects and walls your ""Grip"" meter diminishes and when it's empty you fall prey to gravity, but it recharges after a second of not climbing. Also, avoid gross things in a level, namely the floor, ants, etc, as coming into contact will decrease your edibility, which is the games equicalent of a health bar. THAT'S IT! That's everything you need to know to jump in and have fun with I Am Bread.I've posted a brief and comical video of my playtime with the game on the I Am Bread community page, which can be seen here if you want to see my experience with the game firsthand:

												I didn't realise making toast would be this hard, I mean it's hardely Brain Surgery.Oh how wrong I was, Literally. It took me 10 minutes to cook one slice of toast! Jokes aside, I'm having fun with it, There is no real story to it. The main aim of the game is that you are a piece of bread and you must make yourself Toast. Ever play the floor is lava? Well it's a bit like that. Nobody wants to eat dirty bread that's been rolling around on the floor right?The controls... Well You can either play with a keyboard and mouse or use a controller. My advice? Use the controller. *Insert Bread Pun here*.			"

Developers need to incorporate some clues into the game play so i dont have to flop a slice of bread around a room to figure out how to toast it!!! PS. 2nd level I WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU TOAST BREAD ON TOP OF A TV THAT JUST GOT SMASHED WITH A BOWLING BALL. The logic behind this game just does not make sense!  I could come up with more imaginative and realistic ways to toast bread that would be plausible!			"

								A fun casual game. It is silly and the music is charming. The controls remind me of qwop but is much easier to play with a controller. The ideas such as the health indicator are creative and pretty funny. You feel really stressed when your bread is about to become to gross to eat. The gameplay gets a little repetitious, find something hot to toast yourself on. I lost intrest in about lvl 3. Not a horrible game by any means but could have some other fun things to do with it, maybe differnt objectives other than becoming toast. 6.5/10			"

								Not what i was expecting but it's fun anyways, I mostly enjoy post-apocalyptic/simulator games but i always like to try new things. I know alot of people that enjoy these types of games. If you are going to buy this game watch some gameplay first, that was my first mistake. I NEVER watch gameplay videos before buying games hehe.			"

								I latched onto a rocket, and with my mind powers made me and it float. A really hard game but with great difficulty comes great reward. So if you like hard games like Surgeon Simulator then you probably will like this.And yes the premise is kinda weird but this really is a game, it has levels and a objective and different ways to go about getting to that objective. Overall it may not be worth the money right now to a lot of people Because there is not that many levels (only three right now but they are going to add more) If you don't care about that then YES you should get it.

								This game is horrible. Its just a game made to  lure youtubers in, so they get more sales. its just a pathetic attempt at making a game. The controls are very unresponsive and you mostly flail around everywhere, wasting you grip untill you fall because the game wouldnt let you stop floping around everywhere, making it impossible to even ATTEMPT a speed run. The only gamemodes i like is the free roam (though it gets very boring after a while) and the rampage gamemode. The game also give no indication of what you can use to heat yourself up. The garden level is the worst one of  them ALL. I dont recommend this game to anyone. Its a lazily sloped together game that shouldnt get this much popularity. Its just youtuber bait. I hate it.			"

												I really wanted to like this game as I really enjoyed Surgeon Simulator but could not get into it. It appears that the entire premise of the game is to put up with the rubbish controls. The entire UPS of the game is rubbish controls! I would rather spend the time learning the how to play I am Bread into playing a much better game, or putting the time towards learning something thats actually a worthwhile use of dexterity and coordination.

												Here's my take on this game: it's fun. It's a great concept, the game modes are different enough to keep you busy, and even the story is intriguing (props for the way its told too). And it's pretty challenging, which are all things I like. HOWEVER, I gave this game a thumbs up after much consideration, even though I wanted to give it a thumbs down first. READ BELOW. I CAN'T RECOMMEND THIS GAME NOR CAN I NOT RECOMMEND IT.Why? Because it doesn't work properly. Maybe it's my Windows version, maybe it's my controller, I don't know. Maybe it will work for you, but I had to do some work just to get it to run, and after that, I've had controller issues galore. This is a game that relies on precision timing and holding down buttons at the same time: imagine how WONDERFUL it is to have buttons randomly let go, making you fall down for no reason after wasting 30+ minutes getting from the starting point to around 80% of the level. Not to mention I have to literally mash any button in the menu to select items. I tried talking to the devs, they did give some suggestions, I tried them but they didn't work (with two different controllers, mind you) so in the end, it's too bad Steam doesn't offer a ""neutral"" recommendation option; working properly, it's a good game (keyboard-mouse work fine for me), but ""buyer beware"" as David Vincent would say.

								So, I've barely gotten more than half-an-hour on the game, but so far so good, I think.Your goal, as bread, is to become toast.  There are various scenarios, but since I haven't become toast yet, or even close, I can only speak to the first one.  You start off on the kitchen table and have to make your way to, presumably, a toaster, without touching the floor for too long.  The longer you are on the floor, the less edible you become until you finally lose the level.The mechanics are tough to get used to, even more menacing than Octodad.  Each side of the toast is assigned a key and you have to decide which corner is your pivot point and move the mouse.  You have a ""grip meter"" for moving up surfaces, like climbing the refrigerator or the cabinets, so this adds an extra, ""time sensitive"" element to it.Overall, I really have liked it so far.  Seems like it will provide a lot of very fun and challenging play.  If you want to see the gameplay, I did make a video:

												I Am Bread. The game where you play as a sad little piece of bread who dreams of becoming toast. Personally, I think I enjoy this game a little too much. The physics are fun, the gamemodes are phenominal, and the mash-ups just keep the game pumping with new things to do. My favorite mash-up is the TF2 one, where you dream of becoming a Sandvich. The difficult part about this game is that you need an Xbox or PS controller, or the controls are very difficult. Besides that, it's a great game in general. 9.5/10			"

I had seen it prior in many lets-play channles and I thought it was pretty funny despite the fact that the whole game itself is pretty wank.  She then went to go and tell me that the game had multiplayer. So knowing this i thought it would be hilarious if we would play it together. Went on♥♥♥♥♥and bought for a bargain and then lo and behold, no multiplayer.  Apparently this game can only play multiplayer through two seperate controllers.  So I bascially bought this game for no reason other than that I was shanghaied into buying it.  ... Games ♥♥♥♥ing funny regardless but still I'm kinda mad			"

												Have you ever wanted to be a slice of bread struggling for survival as you hold on to just about anything you can imagine just to keep off the floor so your owner can devour you? Then this is the game for you!

												I Am Bread. The game where you play as a sad little piece of bread who dreams of becoming toast. Personally, I think I enjoy this game a little too much. The physics are fun, the gamemodes are phenominal, and the mash-ups just keep the game pumping with new things to do. My favorite mash-up is the TF2 one, where you dream of becoming a Sandvich. The difficult part about this game is that you need an Xbox or PS controller, or the controls are very difficult. Besides that, it's a great game in general. 9.5/10			"

												Here's my take on this game: it's fun. It's a great concept, the game modes are different enough to keep you busy, and even the story is intriguing (props for the way its told too). And it's pretty challenging, which are all things I like. HOWEVER, I gave this game a thumbs up after much consideration, even though I wanted to give it a thumbs down first. READ BELOW. I CAN'T RECOMMEND THIS GAME NOR CAN I NOT RECOMMEND IT.Why? Because it doesn't work properly. Maybe it's my Windows version, maybe it's my controller, I don't know. Maybe it will work for you, but I had to do some work just to get it to run, and after that, I've had controller issues galore. This is a game that relies on precision timing and holding down buttons at the same time: imagine how WONDERFUL it is to have buttons randomly let go, making you fall down for no reason after wasting 30+ minutes getting from the starting point to around 80% of the level. Not to mention I have to literally mash any button in the menu to select items. I tried talking to the devs, they did give some suggestions, I tried them but they didn't work (with two different controllers, mind you) so in the end, it's too bad Steam doesn't offer a ""neutral"" recommendation option; working properly, it's a good game (keyboard-mouse work fine for me), but ""buyer beware"" as David Vincent would say.

												It's very good so far and very hard. The game suggests that you use a controller but I prefer to use keyboard. When you launch the game make sure to run it in the ""Force DX9"" because it is much faster. Some levels are creative (Lounge) but others are just hard (Bedroom). It is all very fun though and you can get nice screenshots of bread in weird places.			"

Early Access Review
								So, I've barely gotten more than half-an-hour on the game, but so far so good, I think.Your goal, as bread, is to become toast.  There are various scenarios, but since I haven't become toast yet, or even close, I can only speak to the first one.  You start off on the kitchen table and have to make your way to, presumably, a toaster, without touching the floor for too long.  The longer you are on the floor, the less edible you become until you finally lose the level.The mechanics are tough to get used to, even more menacing than Octodad.  Each side of the toast is assigned a key and you have to decide which corner is your pivot point and move the mouse.  You have a ""grip meter"" for moving up surfaces, like climbing the refrigerator or the cabinets, so this adds an extra, ""time sensitive"" element to it.Overall, I really have liked it so far.  Seems like it will provide a lot of very fun and challenging play.  If you want to see the gameplay, I did make a video:

												So I was just minding my own business when my friend decided to persuade me to buy this game.  I had seen it prior in many lets-play channles and I thought it was pretty funny despite the fact that the whole game itself is pretty wank.  She then went to go and tell me that the game had multiplayer. So knowing this i thought it would be hilarious if we would play it together. Went on♥♥♥♥♥and bought for a bargain and then lo and behold, no multiplayer.  Apparently this game can only play multiplayer through two seperate controllers.  So I bascially bought this game for no reason other than that I was shanghaied into buying it.  ... Games ♥♥♥♥ing funny regardless but still I'm kinda mad			"

												We were all told not to play with our food.  Now, our food plays... with us.Straight out, it's clear this is not a game for everyone.  Expecting a silly Bread 'Simulator' Youtube-sensation smash-em-up?  Look elsewhere.  I AM BREAD needs *surprising* amounts of skill and puzzle solving.  Surprising unless you've played Surgeon Simulator, Bossa's previous game, which likewise required you to train your brain to learn what keys WON'T hurl spoons and scalpels all over the theatre.  This'll sound scathing but some reviewers prefer the Bagel Racing because it's a lot more straight forward and not at all punishing.  If you're interested enough to read this, you'll laugh plenty while you play, yet I AM BREAD will make you feel like your mild-mannered alter-ego has been bashed around the head with a baguette.Story Mode: Yes, story mode about living bread.  The other modes are a very fun distraction but Story Mode hooked me in.  It's a surgeon simulator prequel!  As surreal and daft as that is, it works. You're taken on an adventure and the world really does become all about one thing: You aren't just bread; you must become TOAST.  You play through as a loaf possessed with life, each slice seeking any and all ways to become everyone's favourite morning accompaniment.  Story Mode takes place over the course of a week.  One of the joys is how the mission at hand engages you completely, and before long the escalating impact of your toasty obsession becomes deadly clear.  This loaf will stop at nothing, slowly pushing its owner into a frenzy while the world (or his therapist and security guards, at least) thinks him insane. Controls: You have complete control of every corner and every movement of your wholesome slice, and you will have to learn how not just to grip, but how to flip, how to leap, how to swing and hurl things about to get through the levels.  The levels aren't just kitchens and lounges and petrol stations, because there is an increasing requirement to learn what you've tried out in previous levels to get through the next.  This is one thing that makes I AM BREAD much more of a game than I think a lot of players give it credit for.  It takes timing and practice and a lot of patience - with yourself more than anything!! You'll totally flop on some key manoeuvre and curse your aching fingers, but you'll try again and figure it out.  The only difference between limping across a kitchen surface or crawling painfully up the side of a bin, and flipping across car bonnets or leaping across chasms and flipping gracefully over petrol station shelving, is YOU. Levels: Over the course of a week, you'll have to find heat sources, of which there are a few even in the same level, while avoiding anything that'll render you inedible.  Later you'll have to be a bit more creative (and destructive?) in your mission to toast yourself.  It requires level exploration until you spot something, it clicks, or you have that ""I wonder if..."" moment.  The levels are littered with everyday objects and I adored how everything seemed to move right, from bin lids to swinging petrol station signs, to individual piles of books and rolling gas tanks.  Some things break physics conveniently without going anywhere near the stupidity of something like goat simulator - switches move easily at a stroke, bread is surprisingly strong enough to hurl bricks at cars, and lighters will flick just by touching them.  These breaks are convenient and welcome!  If things get too difficult too often, you are offered a way to become edible no matter what you land on, but I recommend avoiding this.  Staying edible is half the game!Other Modes: Thanks to Bossa's intent on providing banquets rather than just the one offering (surgeon simulator had several modes by the time they were done), the other modes add content to this game each with its own brilliant twist.  Bagel Racing is easy to get to grips with, though I did initially expect to race other bagels and multiplayer bagels would have been fantastic.  Starch Wars is pretty epic in which you'll take on an evil ironing board and its Rye Fighters.  Rampage puts you in control of a very angry baguette intent on smashing everything, swinging itself about like a baseball bat.  Cheese hunt sees you take on a quest for several pieces of cheese in a room as a piece of Rye, but isn't so interesting.  Zero-G is surprisingly addictive and very nicely done.  I haven't completed the Team Fortress mode but its a quirky version of the same thing and looks a lot of fun as you interact with familiar objects and weapons from comatose Heavy Weapons Guy's world.It's not a long game, over with in a couple of evenings or maybe 4-6 hours (depending on what you do with the other modes).  It's very silly, great to play with mates or family around, it's got a nice dark glint in its eye, it's easy to play and difficult to master, but your patience and determination will be rewarded.  Remember this is a game in a true sense and you'll be ready - YOU WILL BE TOAST.  I am a fan.  If you've even read this far, just get it on offer and have a great time.No spoilers intended here but my girlfriend was absorbed in this game's story and right at the end just asked one question: ""Why doesn't Mr. Murton just make his bread into toast?  Then everyone would be happy.""  Why didn't you just, Mr. Murton?			"

								So, I've barely gotten more than half-an-hour on the game, but so far so good, I think.Your goal, as bread, is to become toast.  There are various scenarios, but since I haven't become toast yet, or even close, I can only speak to the first one.  You start off on the kitchen table and have to make your way to, presumably, a toaster, without touching the floor for too long.  The longer you are on the floor, the less edible you become until you finally lose the level.The mechanics are tough to get used to, even more menacing than Octodad.  Each side of the toast is assigned a key and you have to decide which corner is your pivot point and move the mouse.  You have a ""grip meter"" for moving up surfaces, like climbing the refrigerator or the cabinets, so this adds an extra, ""time sensitive"" element to it.Overall, I really have liked it so far.  Seems like it will provide a lot of very fun and challenging play.  If you want to see the gameplay, I did make a video:

												Really fun game but I don't like how the controls are. Everytime I move, I need to turn, but I can't, and there is a limited ammount of Grip. Then I have to end up touching the magic bottle and get unlimited Grip and Health, and that is boring. I just walk across the room and get toasted. To me its easy just to fall or lose grip. Movement is tight. I do not recommend playing this game/ buy it if your are not a Pro at games like these.			"

												Well as of writing this review I've played it less than an hour and to be honest I didn't acomplish much. While this game is a fun look at physics, as a game it lacks some of the more satisfying things we've come to love.I consider this to be much more of a test of frustration than anything. The controls are stiff and very hard to use. I've seen people complain about how hard it is with the mouse and keyboard so I opted to use the controller instead, and its still way too difficult for the average person to grasp. It demands motions that your brain isn't familiar with making and gives you very little time to work with it.Overall it's still a good game, and I plan on dedicating more time to it later, but its just not really fun to play right now.Pros:- The graphics are fun, and the music is nice to play to.- It seems like with a little work it COULD be fun to play.- As a physics game it is very solid.Cons:- The controls are awful. And when I say awful, I mean they are just not intuitive. It seems like there could easily be a better way to work them but they have elected to go with the most difficult non-intuitive choice possible. The only way it could get harder is if you had to order the bread around with your voice.- The game timer and edibility meter sucks. When you fall on the floor you have mere moments to react before you lose. And I understand ""Who wants to eat dirty bread?"" But it wouldn't be so bad if the controls weren't such crap to begin with.- It seems like the difficulty isn't in the placement of obstacles or even the fact that if you get too dirty you are trash, but rather it seems that they have chosen to make the controls as difficult to use as a way to make it a more difficult game, and that takes the competitiveness and fun right out of it. If they made the game's controls a whole lot easier to use and instead ramped up the difficulty with obstacles it would be a more successful game in my opinion. Instead it feels like lazy development.- You are going to get frustrated, and I mean at epic levels. Once you realize that the reason you cant get somewhere easily isnt because its a difficult game but that moving the bread around sucks horribly you will want to throw your controller out the window.All in all, I am still recommending this game for two reasons.1. Some people like these really difficult games and they do have a place in the market, and the game isn't terrible. I imagine if i wanted to dedicate like 12 hours just to learning the controls I could probably master it. The problem with this as I see it is I'm not learning to fly an airplane or drive a car here. I'm playing a video game. When a normal game could be finished in 12 hours and I'm still learning how to move a piece of bread around that might be a problem, but I digress.2. There is a game somewhere in here if I can find it, if I find more patience. With enough time I could master this and that is true of any strategy based game but is this one of those games?I wonder if your average person would waste the time needed to get good at this game or just uninstall it and chalk up the wasted money?I don't think unless you are a true fan of torture this game is worth full price, however if its on sale at least 50% it's worth a try.

												I loved this game, then it was fully released.   I got this game early on in developement and throughout it being in early access I have extremely enjoyed playing the game. After exstensive amounts of new content being added I did feel it was close to full release as long as the dogey controller support was fixed. The day it was released I turned on my computer (which during early access easily handled I Am Bread with medium graphics settings) and played the new level in story mode. The framerate dropped to below 30 fps and strobe lighting effects kicked in. It was basically un playable. To see whether or not it was that level I tried a different level, same results. After turning my graphics to low and shadowing off, the strobe lighting stopped but the framerate was still awfull and the game looked ugly. Same thing with the other modes to. It was impossible for me to actually make progress in the new level which seemed awesome. This wasn't because of bad playing skills, I had beaten every level in story mode up to the final release. Overall I think it just kneads a patch to fix this and the controller support.   Other than that, I would deffinately reccomend this. The devs did a great job on it and they might have upped the graphics and my computer couldn't handle it. If you have a beefy computer and think it can handle this game, get it.			"

												Dumb Part : You look at the game.See the name.You understand that it is Dumb.You go to the store page.See the reviews , Look at the Pictures and Videos.The you buy it.Gj Bossa.Serious : Well this game is amazing , very fun and Cool.With 6 Game modes , and 4 types of different Breads, Amazing soundtrack (Which is included For Free at the game files) , and a unique Gameplay.I have played the early access version for hours.But when I played the Full game i Noticed some Things and problems that the game has and Some were More likely In the Early access Version.For Example:1.The levels were Harder In the Early access (Specially the First level) , for exaple they changed  the toaster in the kitchen , Which in the early access was a typical toaster with 2 Holes Since they were SO Small , you would get mad till you can fit your self in it. But they changed it to a big opened toaster which is easy to get in .2. When you started the early access version there was a menu which you could choose what resolution and graphic quality you want but now i just cant find anything to change my graphics. Since my Laptop isnt very strong i have to run the game at it's ""Safe mode"" which surprisingly still has good graphics but the Lights and the Textures of the floor and other things just flash and give you a Headache.Now lets go to the good things about the Full version : 1. The HUD is a LOT better in the full version , with some Special effects and beeing Much Colorful.2. Full Story Mode !!!3. Inhanced Rampage mode. Rampage mode is The BEST part of the game in my idea. It was Great back then , And it is Still GREAT now. The improvement that they made is that They Re-Designed the maps Only for the Rampage mode. And There is a lot of BANG and BOOM sound right now because everything breaks in RAMPAGE MODE!!!!4. Something taht i like about the Full Version is that the Store page Has improved a lot !!! I like it This way !5. And finally Achievments and Trading cards which The Early access didnt have those.Thats all i can say about the game.Its fun , Amazing , And pretty Challenging.I love the Game.It is Definitely worth buying it.8.5 / 10Gj Bossa , Again.

								Having completed the game (as much of it as there is) I can't wholly recommend it. It's definitely a nice curiosity, and it has some entertainment value - But it can also be very frustrating due to the unpredictable nature of the physics.Obviously, getting used to it you'll get better at manoeuvering yourself around the environments, you'll still have difficulty executing an exact plan and making any fine adjustments. It's hard to imagine how they might improve the control system for mouse and keyboard, but one remains hopeful.The concept remains quite funny, and the bolt-on story serves to amuse as you progress, as well as give reason to the increasingly elaborate household gauntlets of various unpleasant substances strewn across your path.In short, as the novelty goes I think I would recommend the game - However from a purely critical perspective of enjoying the game itself and the content that exists as of yet, I would say go for it if you're interested, but only cautiously.

								Don't actually spend money on this game. It's novel for about 15 minutes and then it's just infuriating.EDIT:I spent $10 on this game. I usually am a fan of games that are hard even if they're a bit tedious. I enjoyed VVVVVV and Papers,Please. The problem with this game is that it's hard just for the sake of being hard. Even ignoring the less-than-ideal physics on account of it being early access. The game loses it's appeal quickly and has essentially no replay value. The controls are unessecarily complicated and there's not even any satisfaction in completing a level, because the next one is just as infuriating. It's like paying money for QWOP. If I could have gotten it for $1.99, the 15 minutes of entertainment struggling might have been worth it. But it wasn't worth $10.			"

								This game isn't the worst game ever! it plays smoothly with no framedrops. But one single issuse I have with this game is IT IS SO FRUSTRATING that I couldn't get past the 1ST LEVEL. The controls are so♥♥♥♥♥that I thought that the control was made by a 2 year old. Here are the controls: 1,2,3,4 and Q and E and the mouse. The 1st level puts you in an unfair situation as you need to toast yourself. Simple! But the toaster is ACROSS THE ENTIRE ROOM. plus you have to make it back to the plate with the ""ediblility"" meter still remaning. It may sound simple but you CANNOT touch the ground more than 1 MINUTE. If you stay on the ground, YOU WILL DIE! That's not only the ground! Here is a list of enemies that you CAN'T fight:-Ants-Sharp Objects-etc.Things you CAN fight:-NothingSome people have trouble using their Gamepad. I'm one of them. The gamepad NEVER works.But the biggest problem is: The Grip Meter. The grip meter is so short that I barely got up to a counter. It's so short!The goods things are: -Good Grpahics -Smooth Framerate -Good MusicThings that are bad:-Controls-The Grip Meter -Glitches-The Ground HURTS YOU!This game is a good game in it's core but it's held back by it's♥♥♥♥♥controls. I know they made Sergeon Simulator but that game have a better control scheme than this. and nothing kills you in that game aside from your paitent dying. I was excited for this but I got extremley dissapoited.This game gets a          3/10 "

								I don't recomend this game at all. It's ridiculously short of content for it's price (even if it is in beta)It feels like another game like goat simulator where you'll get 1 or 2 hours of gameplay and then you're finished.It takes about 3 years to complete a level and the controls are ridiculous and impossible to master unlike bossa's masterpiece surgeon simulator.I wouldn't buy this game. You'll get VERY little out of it and you'll lose your cash.Overall: it's quite the cashgrab, very much like goat simulator. I would'nt ever bother with either.			"

								To be perfectly honest, I was expecting bad reviews across the board on this game. However, I find it offers a unique perspective on a puzzle platformer that kept my attention through the end of the early release levels. I'm always on the lookout for quirky and bizarre titles that can pick at my brain while making me laugh at the same time. Butter side up! Would fall into the toilet again for giggles.			"

								This is terrible, or at least it is in the current state it's in. Ever since I bought it about a week ago there's been something affecting my game called the ""zero-g glitch"", which makes it absolutely unplayable because everything just floats away like Mary Poppins in a hurricane. I'm not saying you shouldn't play this (the game looks like oodles of fun in videos), but I highly recommend waiting for a bit for the game to be patched/updated. After that point, I may make another review (assuming that's possible.)			"

												This game should be renamed ""I am sh*t"".It starts out with a splash screen declaring that it's best played with a controller.Then it doesn't use the controller and seems to imply pressing number keys and cursor keys (the latter of which wasn't explained).  After a few minutes' fumbling I still hadn't 100% grasped the control system.Over 2Gb for this.  I hope that one day they decide to make it playable, but for now it's uninstalled and probably won't be played ever again.			"

For me, at least, it is insanely difficult, and I almost end up rage quitting every time I try and pick it up again. If you like feeling a seemingly simple game obliterate your gamer's pride, this one is definitely for you. I'll never stop trying, but Its something that puts a lot of people in a bad mood after a while.			"

YouTube™ Video: I Am Bread Gameplay : Pt1. It's Dough-licious 

			Views: 218		

			Brandon Dayton review and gameplay of I am Bread by Bossa Studios. Posted with permission on indiegamebundles.com. I am not actually bread. Though now I kind of wish I was. Regret cuts like a knife.		

Full text w/ photos: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/review-i-am-bread/Simulator games are in their hayday to be sure. There’s a simulator for everything you ever wanted to be, as well as games for a couple things you had no idea you wanted to be. I Am Bread has become the supreme frontrunner of the latter category in my book. The story is hysterical, told via psychiatrist statements about a man with rooms in his house being destroyed, and swearing that bread can move. The music is spot on, and the controls can take a lot of getting used to, but are completely fair. Made by Bossa Studios, it’s not a far throw from Surgeon Simulator, except that it features a wonderfully huge open world to explore, rather than just some dude’s chest cavity. You’ve been a goat, a deer, a gorilla, a farmer, a prisoner, a spaceman, and a rock. Now it’s finally time to pinch your inner loaf… Or something like that. Lets take a closer look at I Am Bread.The first thing you’ll probably notice when you get into the game is the strange controls. Q,W,E,R (Or LT/LB RT/LB) are each assigned to a corner of your slice, pressing that button will cause the bread to grab, then you can fling yourself around using your mouse or control stick.  It sounds so simple, but much pain went into perfecting its execution… I’d say it was almost an hour before I became the ninja-bread man I never knew I longed to be. Once you finally stop nudging your bread along like Granny Gumgums, the music starts to click. It’s jazzy and quick and it makes my wall-crawling bread feel like he’s truly on the most dramatic adventure of his life. Hell, it probably is. It’s just a slice of bread after all.Once you’ve mastered your abilities, you must complete the mission of getting toasted. Some lowly peons will tell you to use a toaster. Poppycock! I say find the nearest blow-dryer and just do what comes most natural. You also must stay off the floor, and away from gross stuff like trash and dishwater, as it will deplete your edibility bar. Once bread is no longer edible, it’s dead. Dead bread. The world is amazingly interactive. Almost everything can be broken or flung across the room via wonky physics, with delightful results! There is only one puzzle, “How can I become toast?”, but the answers are multiple, and as creative as you care to make them.Now the ugly. The game does crash quite a bit… Which made recording at any length a bit frustrating. The controls are strange, but it’s likely on purpose, to increase the wackiness. That doesn’t do much for the extreme difficulty spike between the first level and the second, but there is time to adjust that as well. I also have to point out that the hardest part is wiggling yourself into the toaster. It caused me SO much heartache… You finally get to the toaster, only to discover that the real struggle has just begun. Overall though, I had a lot of fun with this game, and will likely return to it in the future. The environments are varied, and the freedom to solve a puzzle by riding on a rocket or skateboard, or simply scooting along the rug in a pot amuses me to no end.Summary: A zany bread-simulator game with an open world and loads of freedom.Final Score: 7/10 for gameplay, physics, and replayability. 9/10 with smaller difficulty curve.

												It's Qwop. In 3d. With bread. I can't be arsed to finish the ♥♥♥♥ing thing so I have no idea whether the theme of bread will make sense at the end or if it's just for the lulz so random factor.Fact is it could be a lot of fun. It certainly looks fun anyway. When it works, it is fun. But the camera is atrocious, and since your bread rotate based on where the camera stands all it takes is making a few steps of progress for whatever angle you had on your bread to change and thus having to do a frustrating balancing act with both joystiq when all it would take to make the game actually playable would be to have the camera fixed. The camera doesn't move unless you move it.That's all it would take to make the game three times more enjoyable. It's that one tiny little thing that makes the game pretty much unbearable. Perhaps that's the point, it's cleverly designed to be just at the frontier between fun and complete garbage.Whatever the case, wait for a sale. Don't pay full price. It's not worth it.			"

												Easily one of the worst games i have ever played it has given me new found respect for youtubers like pewdiepie who can manage to entertain people while playing this garbage. The gameplay is really simple but near impossiple thanks to the constant unbearable lag, if you want fair difficulty go play bloodborne. The game features a wide variety of modes that are all unplayable. The music sounds like aborted elevator music and the graphics completly suck. So why is the lag SO bad? If I can run most of todays top role playing games with little lag then i believe the problem is with this game in itself. I'm tapped out at three hours with this game. I never expected it to be good but I thought it would be a good laugh with a few friends buts its not. Its almost shocking how bad it is it wasnt worth the three dollars i spent on it during the steam summer sale. If I were to rate it I'd give it a 1/10			"

								At the start, it takes a while to get used to the controls.By the third level you start to get the hang of it.Everything is kind of interesting when you are a piece of bread.There is heaps of good physics and interactivity in the game.You have to figure out what is the easiest way to toast yourself... there are usually more than one.All in all a good game there is nothing like it.  You know you want to buy it.  You knead it!			"

								This game is amazing! Overall, I give it two crumbs up! Anyone with taste and the ability to get themself out of a jam in a jiffy should buy this game.At first, your spirits may go flat, unleavened, as you fail to grain control of your floppy, four cornered friend. But soon, you realize that, after a flour or two of playing, this game is everything that you could possibly imagine. I mean, you're a freaking slice of bread. It is classified as one of the main food groups!This game promotes a healthy lifestyle. Nothing is healthier than rolling, tripping, and flipping around your house (who needs feet anyways?) as you coat your body in various condiments, all towards the ultimate goal of making yourself  attractive... er... tasty... for that special someone... er..... crazy man who knows you're destroying his home.

												I do kind of wish there was a ""Neutral"" option for this review.This game falls under the category of games such as Goat Simulator that expects you to find it funny on premise alone, and sadly it's one joke that lands for very few and even if it does land for you it's unlikely you'll find it funny for several hours.So... Why is this a recommendation?-Unlike Goat Simulator, there isn't a grand total of one joke per level. It's ridiculous how many puns are packed into the game and some of the more subtle ones actually made me chuckle. There are no shortage of bread puns in this game.-This game succeeds in the same way Surgeon Simulator succeeded- It actually has merit above just being a game with bad controls. Both this and Surgeon Sim are games with actual learning curves and the potential of mastery- Games where you can actually get better and better at them and earn your A++ rank.-Actually really, really hard. I'm not even joking, this game is pretty tough especially if you want high rankings.-Surprisingly open levels. Your goal is to become toast, but there are many different ways to do that- Making your way to a toaster is one, but you could also toast yourself inside an oven or on a BBQ. How you get to something that can make you into toast is also completely up to you, as long as it doesn't consist of crawling along dirty surfaces such as the floor- But even then, skilful play can get you across the floor with minimal damage, too.But there's a lot of things that drag this game down, too, unfortunately.-Like Surgeon Simulator's A&E Edition it outstays its welcome. The campaign mode is at a pretty good length, but if you want 100% completion in this game it will be an incredibly painful and boring experience. They mix it up with different kinds of bread but it isn't really different enough to work particularly well. Especially with all the extra stuff they've added through updates. It's very unlikely you'll actually have the interest to play every extra level at least once.-The controls are actually TOO bad. Surgeon Sim is a game that appears to have bad controls to the uninitiated, but all you need to do is actually learn the controls and the controls will no longer be an obstacle to your play. I Am Bread, on the other hand, doesn't appear to have that quality- No matter how good you get the game's physics engine will still screw you over at times because your very movement is dependent on the game's physics engine. This may have been because of the fact I didn't use a controller but I still feel like even movement felt more difficult than it needed to be.-Once again, it may be because I didn't use a controller, but those zero-gravity levels... UGH.-There didn't appear to be any secrets or secret levels like there were in Surgeon Simulator. Surgeon Sim had this titanic number of easter eggs and so on that were pieced together in order to discover an amazing secret level- I Am Bread doesn't have anything like that.Overall I Am Bread is IMO not as good as Surgeon Simulator was. It still manages to do what games of its type consistently fail to do but it's a downgrade to what Surgeon Sim was. It's not exactly a game I can muster up a ""Not Recommended"" rating for because it does have merit especially if this kind of game is what you're looking for, but I'd still recommend you pick up Surgeon Sim instead of this.

												well, the reviews werent lying about the fact that this is hard. its nearing impossible. thats not a bad thing though. even though the controls are strange and new, i feel ill warm up to the game once i play it more. the graphics were alright, but i felt at some points in the game it lagged a little bit. overall, this game is good. difficult, but good.

This level of challenge is for the good, though. Wait, you say there's such thing as Goat Bread? OMG THIS GAME IS INSTANTLY 8/8, M8!!1! But in reality, I totally recommend this game and if you have 13 bucks to spare, this is what I think you should spend it on.			"

												From the ""game developers"" who brought you Surgeon Simulator, I am Bread is just another product meant soley to sell to the Youtube Let's Players. It's not really fun, hell it's not even funny, it's just weird and caught the attention of Pewdiepie and Markiplier. Surgeon Simulator at least had 5 minutes of haha, this game was bad from the beginning.			"

												Got this as a gift from a friend, kind of relieved I didn't pay money for this.It's supposed to ""LOL SO RANDOM!"" and honestly it's not a bad concept, if the controls were somewhat refined this could be a hit but as it is it's a chore to play.I swear it's like Octodad is the only good one of these ""Bad Controls On Purpose"" games.I really wanted to like this.

								I... I admit I was hype when my friend linked me this. Then I was like ""DOOIE THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥IS AMAZING WE HAVE TO GET IT!"" So he bought two copies and gave me one. I started it up and after two crashes I was able to play. It's... Like octodad but, um... Not as good I guess, it's not very fun in my opinion but it's not HORRIBLE. I wouldn't recommend it but I wouldn't say it's HORRIBLE but not as good as other games. Get it while it's on sale if you want. If not get Octodad or something.  "

If not, then don't get this game- you won't complete a single level.If you're using a keyboard and mouse, the controls are very tough. The game itself is tough too- in story mode, you have to toast yourself by getting to a heat source without getting yourself dirty.			"

												I DO NOT recommend this game AT ALL! It is the hardest, most difficult game ever put on Steam. There is a flash game called ""The World's Hardest Game"" as we all know but it's name should be changed to ""The World's Second Hardest Game"" and this game should be changed to ""The Worlds Hardest Game"" instead. Even with a remote it is still excrutiatingly hard. You can tell because a youtuber who everyone knows about called Markiplier played this game and he smashed his remote to bits in anger and he openly admitted that he could not play this game and it has made him ""more angry than he has ever been in his entire life"". Honestly I do not blame him.So if you are thinking about buying this game; don't bother. It's a complete waste of time and money and YES I have tried it myself and I had to get a refund because I could not do it. I regret buying this game and I don't even know why I got it in the first place. It's that bad. :(			"

								Just learned that if you cover yourself with jam, you can rest on walls. This solves my main problem with the game.This makes the game far less irritating. It's still challenging, if you make a wrong move, you'll end up on the ground and become inedible.I find bread with jam far more enjoyable. I think they should make that feature more obvious.--------It looks like fun, but it gets pretty tedious. Many indie games use poor controls as a humourous gameplay mechanic, eg Octodad. But here it is an exercise in frustration. This is mainly due to the Grip meter. You can only hold on to things for a certain amount of time, so if you're not quick enough you'll have to do the same thing over and over and over.While Octodads challenge comes from the poor controls, the challenge here comes from the timer. This makes the game irritating instead of humourous.Maybe they'll remove the ""timer"" based challenge to something more substantial. But until that happens I wouldn't recommend this game.			"

								Just purchased ""I am Bread"" for my grandson this evening.  I read about the fact that the game might crash, but didn't expect it to be so faulty that it couldn't even open without crashing.  I plan to contact my credit card company and stop the charge for a game that isn't even worth the $10 I paid for it.  Very disappointed.Now, in my attempt to post a review, I'm given the message ""You need to have used this product for at least 5 minutes before posting a review for it.""  Unfortunately, he has not been able to get it to work for 5 minutes in order to satisfy the 5 minute requirement! "

												Yet another ""hilariously"" bad game that embraces its own awfulness. The challenge of the game lies solely in fighting the God-awful controls. That said, the concept behind the game is solid; you're a piece of bread trying to get from point A to point B while navigating the environment without touching the floor. It could have been a surprisingly fun title if the the develepor wasn't trying so hard to capture lightning in a bottle again as they did with the equally atrocious, and undeservedly popular, Surgeon Simulator 2013. I would seek a refund if I hadn't recieved my copy from a Humble Bundle. 1/10, don't waste your time with this title even if somebody offers you a free copy.			"

												my review no longer matters because unfortunately the developers have in fact won, disregard my 7 hours of gameplay as about 6.5 of it is idle time. this game. like goat simulator. is a worthless youtube cannon fodder game. youtubers buy it, play it, and their autistic screaming fans also buy it thinking it will be great and then never actually play it, the few of us who bought this based on personal opinion like myself who actually intended to play this will all be disapointed by it's supreme lack of anything.

												I am Bread... Theres not much to say. The game is so simple but way to hard in my opinion, and takes way to long to complete. When a game like this has a good concept, like this game, it takes several vesions of the game to perfect it. The game takes way to long to finsih, let alone getting off the table! To the developer!: Make the game more intresting. I lost intrest so early becasue of how hard it was and I got so bored and mad. I think that game has a future. But not this version. Make it not so simple. Make other things to do besides getting into the toaster.			"

												A game geared towards autistic man children that lacks in the mental capacity for real games.This game is visually repulsive and the controls are so clunky and off base that it's not even worth all the aggravation.I just can't justify pricing this game over 1 dollar tbhThis game is so basic and plain (white bread, get it? lol) that it doesn't really warrant pricing it at over 10 bucks lolIn my opinion the devs should have made it a free to play game and just call it a day.All in all, a tremendous waste of time.

								This game is infuriatingly hard.The first hour, I didn't really do anything. I couldn't figure out the controls, so I just kindof loafed around.Eventually, I finally figured out how to tip myself over, and subsequently how to toss myself around.My first goal: The counter. I prepared myself to swing right over there.Bready, Set, Dough!Whoops, undershot it by the entire distance and fell on the floor.After a while, I finally got the hang of it.Okay, tip off the loaf, roll into this jar. Spread jam all over myself. Now, fling into the backboard of this chair, and tip it over to the counter. Roll up the side. YES! I made it to the counter! Now I just- Oh dough, ants.I'm starting to think I'll never be toast.I am bread, and I may always be bread.			"

A  WHOLE GRADE GONE BECAUSE OF CRAP CONTROLS. This game will leave you in frustrating tears and will make you want to smash someting. The only part of this game I enjoyed was the playing as a baguette and smashing a random guys plates and wine glasses, but even then the controls will screw you over and you will rage. I do not recommend this game unless you are totally cool with the 'restart' button being your favorite button to push, and expect to see E and D grades alot.			"

There's nothing to worry about, you don't need a job or a wife, people don't put pressure on a baguette to be a crispbread, you don't need to pretend to be something you're not. You can just sit on the kitchen counter and look out upon the vast view of your kitchen dominion, or huddle up on a stormy night in the bread bin with all your bread kin.I would recommend becoming bread to all my friends.

The controls are VERY UNIQUE to say the least, and it adds to the impossibility of moving but, it also makes getting toasted much much much more satisfying. The struggle between you and the game is the motive. Good on you Devs for creating a game that puts my gaming skills to the absolute limit!			"

												Bossa Studios has done it again. This is a joke game, but not the kind like Goat Simulator or Grass Simulator; one that's actually a game, like Octodad or Surgeon Simulator.It's sorta a cross between the floor is lava and Shadow of the Colossus; your aim is to reach something in the room to toast yourself, but without touching the floor (or other nasty surfaces). You can climb around in a bready fashion, but your climbing around has a limited grip meter, which makes it pretty tough. Serious/silly fun.			"

												The fun factor is the sole reason why I bought this game. My initial expectation with simulator games is always on the positive note. I am a bread and I need to go to the toaster to toast myself. It took me quite a few minutes to come up with a faster way of defying gravity using the four controls: *ehem* swing mechanism *ehem*. But alas, I got to the toaster and it took me 30 minutes of hell trying to fit myself (as a bread) inside that freaking toaster. I gave up, and thought maybe I should have covered myself with butter first? Seemingly, impatience has overpowered the potential of this game to be fun. Maybe in the future I'll try again. But I still need to collect and calm myself.			"

												Great idea, horrible execution.Controls are cool, but just too random. And this isn't the funny awkward kind of random, but the annoying ""What the hell is it doing"" kind. I try to move past things and either my bread humps the butter or flings itself right off the table. Like, controlled movement isn't possible at all.Then, when my bread finally humped its way through the dangers of the kitchen to the toaster... its dream was shattered by the seemingly impossible task of getting into the damn thing. Climbing up wasn't enough. Humping to eventually slide in didn't work either. (Poor bread would be a horrible lover.) The amazing stunt of climbing to the bottom of the cupboard above the toaster and falling right ontop of it failed as well. So, after a good hour of trying, I gave up.Beside that, the camera was constantly moving to the most annoying positions. It got stuck at objects, behind walls or zoomed extremely close. And the longer I played, the worse got the lag. At the beginning, there wasn't any lag at all. As expected, considering my hardware. But for some reason it started lagging and getting worse over time.Despite the humping bread, which gave me a good laugh, I consider this a waste of time and money.			"

												I never knew how terrifying and stressful can floors be before playing this game. I might even reconsider leaving dirty dishes on my table because that could mean ants, and ants are evil. And don't even let me start on sinks full of water. So many thimgs which stand between an adventurous loaf of bread and the crunchy victory. I've only played the game with a controller, so I can't judge how well it can be controlled with a keyboard. However, the controls were okay for me. Stressful, maddening, which-corner-of-the-bread-is-this line of thought all the time, but okay.It's true it might get boring after a while, but I developed a masochistic instinct which keeps whispering in my head ""Go try if your bread wall climbing skills improved!"". So yeah, it drags you back. Overall, recommended. It's a simulator that gives you something to think about. Like, feeling guilty about the bread you consumed without toasting it.			"

								This is, without a doubt, the best bread simulator I've ever played. For years now, I have found games lacking. ""If only I could be bread in this game,"" I thought, ""Everything would be so much better.""I've finally gotten my wish with I Am Bread. The storyline is wonderful and cute. I am deeply moved by the desire of the bread to get toasted and the lengths it goes to. The level design is fun and creative, and I look forward to them adding more, as there are only four levels right now.There are a few bugs, of course, as it's currently in early access, but nothing major.I visited my family recently, and my little sister (10), my little brother (14), my dad, and my fiancé all saw me playing, and wanted a go, and thought it was amazing!I do wish there were an endless play mode, where you could explore the whole house, or perhaps a mode with no grip limit so I could get to know the levels.Keep up the amazing work, Dev team, and I look forward to more.

												The controls in this game are atrocious. Even with my hours of experience, even with my 100% completion, I will never like the controls of this game. That said, eventually you pick up tricks to make movement easier and more tolerable, and honestly that makes the game fun for me. But the controls at first will be a major negative for a lot of people. Beyond that, the premise is humorous, there's actually somewhat of a plot, and the levels are varied pretty well. I'd recommend this game for some silly fun, but I don't expect anyone to stick with it as long as I did.			"

												although I only have a small ammount of time on this ♥♥♥♥ing game, its so frustrating at times, especially the toaster on the first level, the control scheme is so ♥♥♥♥ing awful that it takes such precise twitch movements, and one ♥♥♥♥up means that you fling yourself across the room only the land on the floor and become lower than 80% edibility, and you know what that means?? A  WHOLE GRADE GONE BECAUSE OF CRAP CONTROLS. This game will leave you in frustrating tears and will make you want to smash someting. The only part of this game I enjoyed was the playing as a baguette and smashing a random guys plates and wine glasses, but even then the controls will screw you over and you will rage. I do not recommend this game unless you are totally cool with the 'restart' button being your favorite button to push, and expect to see E and D grades alot.			"

												and your goal, is to be Toast. You, a single slice, of soft white bread, wishes to adventure away from the loaf and find a source of heat. If you are strong, and wise, you will find a path that allows you to find your goal before being covered in filth. If one becomes covered by the darkness of sins that cover the lands between your home and your destination then you will become trapped and unable to continue your quest. Although, if you are able to travel the rough lands and find the holy lands of warmth, you must be able to perfectly bask in the warmth to allow yourself to become what you were born to be. . . TOAST. . . . Just don't burn yourself, no one likes to eat charcoal.			"

												I tried, I really did.I enjoyed Surgeon Simulator.  The difficulty of being asked to do simple but precise tasks with intentionally cumbersome controls?  That concept is a winner.The problem with I am Bread though, is that there are rampant collision bugs.  This creates inconsitancies that are a total deal breaker.  When a corner of my bread gets stuck in the counter and cant dislodge, that kinda ruins the experience.If those collision bugs were worked out, I'd be happy to come back and give it some more time.

								“Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.”The controls, camera, and movement are all tied together and become an exercise in frustration. My rage over this, if its energy harnessed, could easily power the world three fold – but I digress. Objects here and elsewhere, fall broken into pieces as soon as you touch them (sometimes even if you don't), and everything else will move around, but never in a way that's useful. You'll begin by planning your route, being extra careful and resetting frequently to achieve perfection. This optimism will not last. After the fatigue sets in and your initial happiness turns into bile, you'll desperately try to haul your disgusting slice as far as the game will allow. Your sighs, lamentations and loud wailings will resound through the starless air. And when the game awards all your pain and suffering with a D grade, you will not feel shame, but elation, for the struggle as finally come to an end. An end that is short lived, as it serves only to reveal to you the next circle of hell. But, like every masochistic addict, you will not cowardly make the great refusal. You must go deeper into greater pain, for necessity brings you here, not pleasure. And when you emerge from your room to return to the bright world, without care of having any rest, you can hold your head up high and know that you could face no greater test. You are bread.			"

Components+ Graphically, I AM BREAD gets it right, if it were extremely realistic, the game wouldn’t be as humorous and enjoyable, as when things get realistic, it feels to grown up and focused rather than fun and enjoyable. And I AM BREAD is all about enjoying being a slice of bread with a mission of getting toasted. Although the levels of I AM BREAD is very well designed, easy to distinguish which area is dirty and which is clean, and the effect it has on your bread as it comes in contact with certain substances.+ Gameplay is rather self explanatory, four keys for each limb and an extra button for each to lock the limb, and with the compatibility of the Xbox Controller, it makes it easier to control as well. The developers do a great job on getting reactions from players, because accidents always happen, the controls can be confusing when under pressure, thus panic and overwhelming emotions, all of which make the experience enjoyable.+- Gamemode is very simple, just get toasted, but I think they could expand on this like Goat Simulator did, which was make it an MMO, allowing for more interaction with other players. I am guessing they could make I AM BREAD larger with multiplayer modes, who could get toasted quicker or something like that, you can challenge your friends on a level at the same time. Because a singular game mode will be easy to get bored of, adding more, or specifically multiplayer, it would probably benefit the game largely.+ The amount of room you have to be your slice of bread is good factor. Because you have multiple ways and approaches to getting toasted and what to slather yourself with before you do. Because the toy is only as good as the room you play it in.+ And I think with the continuous involvement of the I AM BREAD community, they will continue to improve, and maybe with the addition of the Steam Workshop which could alter your type of bread, or add more levels to play, I AM BREAD will be a long lasting game.OverallI AM BREAD is without a doubt a very fun simulator game, it has never been done before and that is what gamers like to see, something unique and amazing. People might’ve thought of making a simulator for ridiculous things but never thought they will pull it off so they kept to the cliché simulators, which are vehicles.But I AM BREAD has been pulled off spectacularly well; it is most definitely fun experience, playing as bread with the mission of getting toasted. The idea was ridiculous but the developers made it happen. It’s an ambitious and successful idea, which deserves all the support it gets. Well worth the price and the experience. I suggest this game to simulator lovers and people who just like to play ridiculous yet great games (Goat Sim | BroForce).			"

												I found about the game two days before it was released and my bf got it for me a day after it was released, as a gift for my birthday. At first I was a bit scared to play it and not like it, fortunately this wasn't the case at all. The game is really fun to play, but trying to control the bread is horribly difficult on a keyboard. The game is really exciting and, for not very experienced players like me, it can be frustrating at times. However I'd recommend it a lot, fun to play, not as easy (or boring) and you can explore and walk around, discovering stuff; or just go as fast as you can and try to get an A++. Just don't touch the floor!!... or the water, or footprints, or... :'(			"

												For a game that a first glance seems like some LOLSOFUNNEHXD youtuber bait, it's actually quite fun and hasn't gone stale just yet.EDIT: Now that the full release has came out, I wouldn't reccomend this game anymore (at least for people like me). Ironically enough, a game about bread cannot run decently on a (metaphorical) toaster like the pre-release could. The game suffers horrible framerate drops, and the lighting flickers on and off like crazy with gif recording enabled. In the beta, an option came up on launch to choose your graphics settings and you could set it to a max performace setting. Not only are similar options unavailable, but the game runs like crap on the lowest setting I could get it to. It really sucks that I can't bearably run this game anymore, especially since there seems to be a lot of new cool and fun content.AND ANOTHER EDIT: It works relatively fine on toasters now. Gif recording still causes some weird flickering with the lighting, dough.			"

												I'm currently finding the game unplayably difficult. It's glitchy with my controller and the controls don't make enough sense. Personally - I think the game wasn't worth buying however others may disagree. It'd be nice to control the front and back pieces with one button instead of two, since I found it nearly impossible to play although the concept was funny enough for me to want to try this. However - the graphics are really well done, and the premise is good. Too hard for me to play though. Best of luck to anyone that can play this though and hope they find it fun.			"

												I wanted to get I Am Bread because of all of the positive reviews it had but after playing for a little while I felt like there was more hype than enough entertainment value to back the game. It's unique and looks and feels well made for the most part but it didn't hold my attention long. I tried getting toasted a few times then did a little bagel racing but had more fun while smashing everything. This is an Interesting idea for a game and parts of it are challanging but I would wait to find it in a bundle or during a really good sale. I don't remember how I got this game but I wouldn't suggest buying it anywhere near full price unless you've extensively tested it out on a friends PC and you know what you're going to buy.			"

												I love games like this, they're goofy, fun, and challenging. There are people who may not consider this as a true ""game,"" but the point of games like these is that they break the mould, and discover new ways to entertain. Also, doesn't usually fail in making you laugh in the end.Upon starting up the game, I was using a keyboard. Yes, it is difficult, but just like with any game, you learn how it works. It took me a hilarious hour to finish the tutorial. I don't regret it. Went into free roam next to get a better handle on controls, check out the environment. Being each type of bread can present its own difficulties surprisingly. I did connect one of my controllers up to play this, and it is much easier. Although, if you just set your ""grips"" to comfortable keys close together, it shouldn't be much of a problem to use a keyboard. Going through the game, there are a lot of little things to find, and interact with. At the end of one game session, all that I could see of my little toast was chips, eggs, and jam/jelly sitting in a pile of mass destruction. You can try to skateboard, but I seem to fail that, and just send myself flying. Curiosity sent me into a garbage can. All in all, this is a game you'd love if you like challenging physics, comedy, bread, and a bit of mini sandbox exploration.			"

												first off i love games that are infirariating second i don't get why people say that you can't get used to the controlls. ussally i lose becuse im not fast enough or i make a mistake wich can all get better with time and practice. This is probably the second sillyest game i have seen second becuse of battle block theater and my eyes are burning for amneisa dosnt make the whole game the sillyest. I think that if you like rage games like i do then buy it its lovley at its job and pretty fun while its at unlike unfair mario ect. and again second sillyest game i have ever boughten. i know you'll love it if your karkat. so come on and play this wonderful game.

												This game is very unique, fun, and challenging! It's like the Goat Simulator of bread. If you enjoy Goat Simulator, or games where you can mess around in general, or just want to pass time, this is for you! This is one of the best gaming experiences I've ever been through. And what's better is you can free roam around the map after finishing it in the story! I reccommend playing this game with an XBox 360/One or PS3/PS4 controller. I use the XBox 360 controller with this, and I cannot emphasize enough that it makes the gameplay a LOT more easy. The keyboard is very well useable for gameplay, but controllers are best IMO.I really feel that this game is something that I could play for hours on end and not get bored. I just played it for 70 mins before deciding to write a review, and haven't found anything I don't like about it yet. The gameplay is very straight forward and easy to figure out. And if you're worried about forgetting controls - fear not! it displays the buttons you can press on the corners of the bread as you play.I highly reccomend this game. Good job, Bossa.			"

												This game is so freaking random, I honestly don't have an idea about why I ended up buying this game, let alone questioning its existence. Though, I've come to realize that this game can be quite enjoyable with a gamepad. (by enjoyable I mean hours of swearing out loud at a stupid slice of bread falling on the floor which was dirtied by the house's owner who wears shoes inside his house and doesn't even bother to clean it) Some episodes were ridiculously hard but that makes me enjoy the game even more (and waste more time on it) It's also a great way to relieve stress, especially rampage mode.You might get bored very quickly though.

								So imagine that Mount Your Friends got an extra dimension and became less suggestive, open world, and also bread. You play a slice of bread and your objective is to become toast. You have an edibility bar that is effectively your health. The floor and other dirty places will lower that and once it hits 0 you fail the level. You have no time limit, but if you take too long, you get a worse rating. I finished the first level three times. I got E, D, and C. The next level didn’t unlock till I got a C. Controls were frustrating at first and after an hour of play.... were still rather frustrating. That said there are two possible schemes of control: mouse/keyboard and controller. They both will give you a different level of control. You have 4 buttons corresponding to the corners of the bread slice you control. Pressing a button will cause that corner to stick to the environment. You then can use the mouse or analog stick to move yourself. With a mouse you have far more force behind your movements. With an analog stick, it feels like the bread is struggling to move. You also have a limited amount of time for consecutive grip.Despite the odd feel of the controls, the game has some fun moments. There is something special about sliding across the wall like a piece of spider-bread. The feeling of mastering the controls is a rewarding experience if nothing else. It’s an interesting and unique game that I expect to become into something more interesting, if Surgeon Simulator is an example.In conclusion: Wonky controls, not much content, but an early access game that’s been out for about a week or so. If you don’t buy now but are still interested, keep an eye on its development to see what comes of it.			"
