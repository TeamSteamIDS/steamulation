												For a video game the mechanics are pretty reasonable. Over i enjoy Pinball fx, its a bit of a dlc pain but its whatever. Personally i enjoy the Plants vs Zombies map being its one of the best put together in my opinion. Some tables could of used some more refinement.EDITED!!!! ...

												They introduced an EULA after the fact which includes parts that directly violate any consideration for data protection. In there they allow themselves and ""third parties"" to mine your data in a lot of ways. They also allow themselves to change it again whenever they want. If you don't agree, you lose access to your tables and can't play anymore. That's absolutely unacceptable behavior in my opinion.Introducing an EULA after the fact is unacceptable on its own without offering a full refund since I couldn't have known about the new EULA when I bought the tables. But then even adding such privacy violating terms that's the last straw.And they closed a thread in the forums here, where it was discussed with no good reason at all.All in all I'm disgusted by their behavior and I therefore regret the money I put into this game. If I had known what I know now, I wouldn't have bought any of the tables.EDIT 05.07.2015: They promised a revised EULA. Nothing happened. We have been waiting since May 12, 2015 now. That's when the new EULA was introduced. So we have been waiting for almost 8 weeks now to play the game we paid (a lot of) money for. And the only thing that happens is they lock threads where this is talked about.My advice would be to ask for a refund for every table now. It's been long enough waiting for them to resolve this, they had plenty of time and did nothing. Changing the EULA after the fact should be reason enough to get a refund even if you have played the game for more than 2 hours before the EULA change.EDIT 15.08.2015: As of today, more than 3 months after the newly introduced EULA, nothing  substantial has changed. I'm still locked out of the game I purchased (through DLC, game itself is marketed as F2P) without having to agree to any EULA at all and still can't play without accepting one now which still has questionable parts I don't want to agree to.Again we're promised major changes for the better in the forum and there's a discussion about that existing customers shouldn't have seen the new EULA pop up at all. But we have. And we can't play without accepting it.Well, we'll see where it all leads, but in any case, it's been more than THREE MONTHS without a solution which says a lot in my opinion. I would still like to see a good solution though, obviously, which should be: Anyone who bought the game (which essentially means DLC for the game) before they introduced the new EULA (any EULA at all) should be able to play the game without the enforcement of said EULA. Any new buyers should at least be shown the EULA BEFORE they buy/download the game. I have no idea how they would do that technically, distinguishing these two types of players ingame, however. So even better: Drop that EULA crap completely, like almost every other game does.Edit 17.09.2015: Still no update, although they promised again and again. Instead they locked the ""New EULA"" thread again. Why? Because in there they were called again on their let's name it ""misbehaviour"", you all know what I would rather name it, but I'll try to be civil here although they aren't. The Community Manager for Zen Studios Barbie Bob-omb says it's locked because of arguing (which is exactly what that thread and a forum is for) and to avoid banning, so clearly threatens to ban (without a good reason). Clearly the real reason is to have that thread disappear on the second page again. It's not the first time they did it (see above). They even ban people for voicing their  opinion.So we are at 4 ( in words: four ! ) months waiting time for them to solve this now. I'm starting to miss the right words to express how disgusted I am about their behaviour in this whole matter. That includes their forum moderation.One thing's for sure, whatever they do now, I will avoid them like the plague in the future. They will never see another cent from me. I know that's not helping to motivate them to solve this, but I'm just done with them. I've never seen a developer/publisher treat their customers with that much disrespect over such a long time. And I've seen a lot of crap in that regard.EDIT: 02.10.2015: One last edit. After 4.5 months they finally admitted that the new EULA is here to stay even for existing customers. So I won't be able to play this game ever again although it was paid a lot of money for. I don't have to tell you how much that sucks.I recommend everyone to ask Steam for a refund. If you refer to the new EULA, where there wasn't one when you bought the game, in your request for a refund, Steam should approve your request even though you probably played a lot longer than two hours. Unfortunately I got all my tables as gifts and Steam doesn't do refunds for gifts, so I can't ask for one. Otherwise I would have done so months ago and not wasted so much time trying to debate with this rotten developer.			"

												So I grew up around real-life pinball tables yet never spent much time on them.  The reason is that I had 'better' things to do at the arcade: Space Invaders, Asteroids, Galaga, Paperboy, Double Dragon, etc. were all more important to me than pinball.  But this game has me wishing that wasn't the case! In fact, if I had a time machine I would go back and try all of those tables in real life!I know I haven't said much about the game itself, and I'm not going to either.  The truth is I don't even know much about pinball.  I'll just give you a couple reasons why I think this game is such a success to me:--each table feels genuinely different which adds to replayability--the leaderboard system is great: it got me to add friends for chasing high scores and I've also been telling family members to try this out--there's nothing like beating your sister or cousin or even long lost uncle!--everyone gets a free table, which is a pretty good one in and of itself (just try it!)--love the sound bytes (especially for Star Wars tables) as they really add to the overall atmosphere--it's still fun even if your not very good at it (like me)--it got me to write this review "

												This was a pretty good pinball game, once upon a time.Still probably is, until they locked me out of playing it with an EULA that prevented me from playing until I agreed to let them collect data. To quote: ""the data we process on you may include, but is not limited to: email address, device ID, IP-address, user names and passwords.""So to bounce a ball around on a computer screen, apparently they suddenly needed access to my IP and passwords. Note that they didn't need this or any other kind of special EULA before, when I purchased the product; suddenly I was only getting a ""license"" for software that required access to anything the KGB/NSA/Zen Studios felt was useful.At this point, I've had my pocket picked unless I'd rather have whatever on my hard drive Zen considers relevant data for their processing made subject to electronic discovery. Also, they gleefully lock, delete, and ban on the forum when someone raise legitimate questions about why hitting a digital silver ball with a paddle requires data that ""may include, but is not limited to...""Well, what is it limited to? Don't ask on the forum, it'll get locked and deleted.			"

												""If you have performed diagonal nudge with keyboard or d-pad, we now pronounce you a cheater.  We will reset and restart everything, with a weaker cheat ability.""As bizarre as that may sound, that is Zen Studios' idea of ""fairness.""  Which is why every paid customer's score on every table upto September 2015 since launch has been relegated to a frozen ""archive.""If you are interested, you can see for yourself how this policy came about, and what kind of person initiated it for what motive, in this thread.Also, there have been many occasion of savegame wipes without notice, despite players' advice to the contrary.  It's painfully obvious Zen doesn't respect nor value your time and effort invested in their game.  Which means they most likely won't hesitate to repeat the practice in the future.Save your time and money.  You deserve better pinball experience.  The sport of pinball deserves better officiating.

												Having *HAD* to agree to a new EULA that allows them to ""mine"" for data.. including passwords is just a tad overboard.   I have put a ton of hours into this game, have purchased every table..Since  then the EULA has had that sentence about passwords removed..  hey good..  fact is they *DID* it in the first place. I had to agree to another agreement.. and here they go changing it, and if I want to continue to use the software I have to agree. Well I have bought every table.. and would have, ordinarily given this tite a resounding YES, ITS GREAT...  a thumbs down on account of the trust this company has squandered.Untill an acceptable (via majority in the thread) EULA comes out..  this still stands.  Nice that they are trying to work it out however, until they do.. this review will stand..What wont these companies try today after they start to get popular.    Too bad really, these tables used to be a second one buy for me.   There are a couple new ones coming out.   I might just consider passing. Shame. EDITED for removal of current password mining changes and wording changes..			"

												Beautiful game let down heavily by the studio who created it. Zen Studios just doesn't listen at all to the community and is by now just a simple money making machine, going for lucrative license projects. So many things are missing that could make this game a lot better on especially the PC tablet form factor but Zen is not at all interested in improving the basic framework. They'd rather churn out new tables and keep rolling in $$$.Also worth noting is the blatant deleting of all the high scores.. randomly and without asking the community. Extremely annoying especially for the people who put hundreds of hours on the game.You'll be slightly better off with Pinball Arcade (though Far Sight, the developer, is not much better than Zen. Their coding platform is a buggy mess and they just do not seem all that talented). Best option is to get VisualPinball or the new Unity pinball 3D thing which seems very promising.			"

												""We're altering the deal. Pray we don't alter it any further."" What is the point of agreeing to a EULA when the ""agreement"" can get ripped up at anytime and you're forced to agree to another one with unacceptable terms just to use what you've already paid for? Sorry to say these data thieves got my money now I have to agree to their spyware to keep using. Completely unethical company. Be warned.Update 4. Since Zen expects you to send them a photo of your setup to unlock portrait mode, I made this quip about  multimonitor support; ""You must email them a photo of yourself naked with two monitors and holding a recent copy of The New York Times with the headline clearly visible before they will unlock the second monitor support."" Result? Deleted and permaban for ""inappropriate comment"". Seriously.  Update 3. Well they've updated the EULA yet again (23/9/15). STILL provides for adware and Zen sucking up your data (they've toned down the language but the effect is still there). Europeans have to consent to Zen exporting their data out of the EU, also users who purchased prior to Zen imposing this wretched EULA are still locked out unless they agree. Update 2. Here's the forum comment on page 36 in the NEW EULA thread that got me banned (and they deleted).""There was a slight hiccup. Zen's lawyer drafted a plain English version of the EULA for them. You agree: 1. We are god.2. You are nothing. Zen rejected it as they thought paragraph 2 might confer too many rights on the user.""Banned for ""derailing topic/posting false information"". Evidently they were unable to determine I was joking.Update 1. Well they updated the EULA again and other than some minor tweaks still provides for Zen spyware and ad injection. Request for refund denied. It beggars belief Zen can do this and keep the money.			"

												Ever since I was a young boy, I played the silver ball.  No, wait, I'm thinking of Tommy.  Either way, pinball has been an important part of my life whenever it has been.  Time marches on though, and you can't just go play pinball like you used to.  Down at the local hangout, by the soda fountain, with flippers flipping, balls always bouncing, to the left and to the right, lights flashing, eplileptic kids flailing about on the floor, those days, back then, they're gone.     All is not lost though.  Pinball FX2 is here to fill that void left by the demise of the pinball machine with software pinball that surpasses the original in every way except for those it does not.  When it comes down to it, what you really lose is having an actual pinball table in front of you.  You can never recreate that exact feel, the solid wood gripped firmly in your hands as you aim for ever higher scores while deftly avoiding the flailing epileptic kids.     That's just the way it has to be though, and there are plenty of good things about virtual pinball that makes it well worth a play.  The tables can be more elaborate than a real pinball table ever could, and they certainly are lovely to look at.  Any pinball table you want is right there on your television, no need for a huge arcade to house all of your games.  Heck, with a wireless xbox controller, you even get some vibration when you shake the table.     If you loved pinball when you were a kid, or know someone who did, give Pinball FX2 a try.  It's the next best thing to being there again, reliving those memories, and best of all, you won't have to step over any epileptics to do it.			"

Graphics are great and most of the tables are fun to play. There are a few that are really hard to get good scores on but not enough to make me quit playing them.  Get ready to spend a lot of time with this title if you get it, it will keep you busy. And with so many tables you'll never get bored of it either.			"

												Zen Studios did a great favor to all the digital pinball enthusiasts - they didn't go for a simulation.Let me explain it before I get back in the game. You can always try to be more realistic, more physics-respecting, more simulating game. And you will probably fail miserably because there's a sweet magic of analogue mechanisms of pinball machines no computer will be able to understand and process... EVER.BUT... if you take a concept of pinball game which says 'keep that ball up for as long as possible and score as many points as you possibly can', slap it on crazy fun tables with various themes and make playing digital pinball FUN thing to do, either solo or with friends - yes, you will be coming back for one more and yes, you will never stop.So, thank you, Zen Studios for nothing making Pinball FX2 mediocre simulation pinball game, but a super fun arcade pinball game.

												Zen, when this game first came out, it was absolutely amazing, especially for a free title. However, over the years, you have done many stupid things such as forcibly introducing spyware and malware into the game, wiping people's progress and scores, and deeming using the game's coded physics a certain way as ""cheating."" You do not listen to your fanbase, and seem to be intent on screwing them over. But guess what? I have never purchased, nor will I purchase a single DLC package from you, and as I have had this game uninstalled since before these new EULA practices have been introduced, your spyware is nowhere on my machine, and thus, you cannot collect my data.

												At launch, Pinball FX 2 was already a fantastic game. Originally released on the Xbox 360, it featured backwards compatibility with the original Pinball FX, and this allowed an already burgeoning title to be filled with even more Pinball goodness. As it stands, there are over 30 tables in the game as of this writing, and each and every one is free to try, with the standout Sorcerer's Lair being completely free.It's a little sad knowing that the arcade is no longer truly viable, and I'll never again experience the giddy joy of pumping coins into a table, longing for the extra ball and multiball modes we all love, or watching to see if the numbers matched and I won a free game. But while the arcade as a destination may be on it's final legs, the pinball experience presented in FX 2 is pure unadulterated joy. Those fond memories are brought to the forefront with this version, the ultimate version of Pinball FX 2. As a free download, this game should find a place in just about every gamer's library, and with tables based on many themes, there are sure to be some you'll love. Each table has their own achievements, backstory, missions, combos, and design.For most of the tables, the cost is approximate to what would cost a single game of pinball at the arcade, so value wise the game is excellent value. The hours upon hours of gameplay possibility and replayability is enormous, and there really is something for everyone here - from Ancient Rome to Boba Fett.In addition, the table design is above and beyond what can be done with conventional pinball, with full video mini games and hidden extras. Nothing is truly over the top, though there aren't any dead spots either. With seven angles to play from, and a free view angle to fly around the table close up, you'll find plenty to play for. Ramps, drop balls, lit targets, missions, and more are available on each table.Finely integrated leaderboards will see you play against friends and the community on each and every table, with an overall score representing your prowess across all tables. Local leaderboards and multiplayer should see FX 2 become a staple quick fire up and play at home as well.The sound and graphics are really well done - with the narrator both chastising and egging you on to play better, and with rewarding sound bites when you do well. The sound effects are particularly fantastic on Secrets of the Deep, an underwater themed table, and there are classic themes and sound effects on the Star Wars and Marvel themed tables, respectively. The game is a joy to watch in action. The design and execution of the tables really cannot be overstated. There are multiple views and options to tune the game to your liking, and the low requirements make this an ideal game for every steam user. Pinball FX 2 is a beautiful game, not just a beautiful pinball game.Overall this is a game too easy not to enjoy. The low cost and low barrier to entry make this an easy recommend, and the many hours of replayability, the freedom to pick up and play, and just the genuine fun available make this the best virtual pinball title ever made available. It's well worth your time.9.0/10.			"

												On Steam there is what I consider kind of a holy trinity of pinball games.If I want realism I go for Pinball Arcade and their collection of classic solid state tables.If I want something with a real challenge I go for Zaccaria and their more offbeat but still excellent European tables.On the other hand, if I want sheer creativity and the experience that makes the most of what video pinball has to offer... I turn to Pinball FX2.Where both Pinball Arcade and Zaccaria turn their sites toward emulating experiences of the past and trying to give users a taste of what classic arcade pinball was all about, Pinball FX2 takes full advantage of the opportunity to show what can be done with the basic concepts of the game when neither money nor physical limitations can get in the way of the experience. The result is tables that are fun first and foremost. Tables are liberal with their ball saves, kickbacks, and extra balls, with the goal being to direct your attention more toward the goals the tables ask you to accomplish rather than making you focus simply on keeping the ball in play. Tables feature animated props and backgrounds, and oftentimes integrate these animated elements into the gameplay itself, with lightsabers beaming your ball from one side of the playfield to another, starship battles, even monsters walking across the field begging you to destroy them.If Pinball FX2 has one area where it does suffer it would be in score bloat. Anyone with experience with actual pinball tables -- or even the other games mentioned above -- will immediately feel the modern bent of Pinball FX2's scoring treatment, with scores in the millions of points being common, even expected of players. This, combined with the game's relative ease in comparison to its competition, means that the leaderboards for the game are filled with seemingly impossible scores that often can represent hours of gameplay on a single table, even in a single session. As a result, score standing in the games is typically a product less of one's pinball skill and more of attrition, since many of the tables are gentle enough that a solid player will likely tire of playing before they're in any real danger of losing (Droids being a particularly bothersome table in this regard.)Pinball FX2 is a great pinball game for anyone looking more for a modernized, friendly experience rather than a more classically accurate one. Fun tables with a variety of themes and features impossible to replicate in an actual physical unit makes for a one-of-a-kind experience that almost anyone can enjoy.			"

												zen pinball fx2 is awsome but...the agreement is garbage. when a game company (microsoft) needs to tak information off your pc such as passwords,on the other hand look at  windows 10 by downloading and acepting the terms you give microsoft the right to take any information on your entire hard drive and send it anywhere it wants. other companies the police or government,look it up and see what windows 10 is all about. so im sorry to say that in light of this new agreement i have to uninstall fx2and thats a shame beause it is without a doubt one of the best pinball games for pc of all time.

												The days when we could go out with a pocket full of change and spend hours on end playing pinball at the arcades are long gone and apart from the odd pinball machine in a pub here and there most of us will have a hard time finding a real machine. If we want to play pinball today we probably have to do it virtually and Pinball FX2 delivers one of the most enjoyable virtual pinball experiences.I'm pretty sure the basic concept of pinball needs no introduction but just in case you've been living under rock: You use your flippers to direct a small steel ball around the pinball table and aim for different targets to score as many points as possible while at the same time you try to prevent the ball from falling into the drain or one of the side lanes.Pinball FX2 already offers a variety of tables and new ones are released regularly. All the tables differ widely from each other in terms of gameplay, looks and underlying theme. Some have a somewhat minimalistic layout with only few ramps and extras, others feel almost overloaded with features. Some are easy to get into, others are very challenging and have a steep learning curve. Fans of the Marvel and Star Wars franchises will be delighted to have the opportunity to choose from a selection of acordingly themed tables.You can compete with friends in local hotseat multiplayer matches or chase highscores to climb up local and online leaderboards but the competion gets most intense with friend score challenges when you have some other players in your Steam friendlist.The game supports keyboard, mouse and controller.Unlike Pinball Arcade (another great pinball simulation available right here on Steam), that offers authentic recreations of real-life tables licenced from pinball machine manufacturers, all Pinball FX2 tables are original creations by the games developer Zen Studios. This can be a drawback if you want to relive your pinball memories with your favourite tables from the past but it's also an advantage because it allows for more artistic freedom. A freedom the developers put to good use with stunning effects that wouldn't be physically possible in reality, like Marvel characters battling each other across the table, among other things.Additional tables come at a decent price, especially if you consider the many hours of entertainment that every single one provides. With the wide variety of genuinely different tables, everyone, casuals and hardcore pinball fanatics alike, will find some tailored to their individual taste. There's really no reason to hesitate to get some pinball action right away.			"

												- Fixed an issue where nudging the table by simultaneously pressing multiple nudge keys on the keyboard resulted in unfairly powerful nudges. (WORD FOR WORD FROM ZEN)what you dont see yet is it nerfs diagonal nudging in general a feature/tactic that made the game unique ""bang backs"" is gone, i like pinball arcade even tho you cant bang back but you can control the ball a little, its mostly because if its something they did not want then they should have changed it when they released zen pinball ""one"" on ps3 in 2009 because thats how long its been around ya 2009i was a long time fan of pinball fx2 and Zen studios and now its just being disrespectful it pains me to type this it really does but its painfully true we have been betrayed i never thought this would happen i cant even get a refund even if i wanted to no biggie really but im sure some will try . many of us asked for a normal and hard mode + leaderboards so  this could stay in some way but still have or not have bang backs added challenge is fine but this :/im done for now UNINSTALLEDFYI: I NEVER USED ANY BS THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE THAT SEEMS TO BE A CAUSE OF ALL THIS SO I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW IT NERFED NUDGING ACROSS THE BOARD


Kudos to ZEN for caring about the integrity of their product.  Disappointing that some used scripting tools for gain.

												If I can even convince 1 person to save their money on this title I'd be happy.  (If it was jivjov I'd be ecstatic!)  But in general do not support any Zen Studios products because they are likely to change your legal terms, say anything they want and you'll be forced to agree or lose your money.HUGE CON:Zen/Microsoft added a EULA to the title.  That in and of itself isn't the problem.  As long as the EULA was added BEOFRE consumers purchased the title that would be fine.  The problem is that they are holding every license/subscription hostage for all of the EXISTING consumers who owned this title BEFORE the EULA was added.  e.g. They added the EULA a few months ago and consumers are FORCED to agree to it before they can play the title again.  There's been a consistently ongoing discussion about their actions in http://steamcommunity.com/app/226980/discussions/0/620712999988337987.So do not support an anti-consumer, anti-EU laws, anti-moral compassed company.  They could have easily avoided this issue IF they left FX2 alone and created an FX3 which contained the EULA and let consumer DECIDE.The worst part is that when directly asked as per the instructions of the EULA, Zen will not disclose what it is they/3rd parties are collecting.PROS:Some tables were fun.  Not all.  But at least you could spend about 3 minutes trying each board before you purchased it.SUGGESTION to Steam & 3rd party Publishers/Developers:Steam/VALVe should reset the refund clock if a Publisher/Developer adds a EULA to a title AFTER the title has been released.  That way consumers can actually make a choice:A) 'I accepting your new legal terms' (and letting the publisher keep the spent money)ORB) 'I don't agree to your new terms' (and I'll be getting my money back.  You should have had the EULA when I originally purchased the title or learned not to add it post-sale.)			"

												I'm a pretty big fan of pinball. I'm not a big fan at all of Pinball FX and the tables therein. Visually, they're fantastic, but only if you're watching someone else. It's a real pain when Spider Man swings in front of your flippers, or you have massive explosions going off that distract your tracking from the hyper-kinetic ball. Pinball FX is not going for realism or emulating pinball, and is very much invested in maximizing the potential of digital pinball, thus the games feel faster than what you would see in traditional pinball, or even something like The Pinball Arcade. This is usually to the game's detriment, in my eyes.Personally, I dislike the feel of the game. At no point does the ball feel controllable, and in some instances, the physics are simply wrong or buggy. Drop catches and live catches are rare but seemingly possible; they don't seem like something you can actively do as the technique looks to me more of a strange collision bug than actual skill and timing.  I found myself having less fun playing the game due to inconsistencies in physics reactions, shots not registering, and collision bugs with flippers, ramps, other balls and walls. Table rules are deeper than necessary, requiring detailed study of the rule sheet. Which, by itself is fine, however there is a bit of an issue when you can't figure out what you need to shoot for due to information not being presented clearly by the game. Firing up a game and learning the rules intrinsically is just not going to happen. Additionally, many modes require simply grinding shots, which to me, is remarkably boring. Coupled with the shot registration bugs, actually working toward a mode or a strategy tends to be more infuriating than it's worth.Many of the tables borrow shot concepts from existing pinball tables, which is great! However, they seem to only have borrowed the mechanic, but have not paid any attention to ball flow and angle after the fact - many shots are simply drains waiting to happen. You are literally being punished with a ball drain for successfully making a shot. Additionally, some concepts are used, but simply fail to work. For instance, the Venom table looks to attempt the outlane gate nudge-back concept used on Bally's Centaur... which would be amazing if the designers understood that having the bounce post about a mile away from the gate and the sensitivity for tilting cranked on the game makes the gate-save concept useless.Overall, if you're looking for something different in the pinball space, try a table from Pinball FX, but do so knowing you're going to be playing tables made by people who don't seem to grasp the idea of game layout or rules design.

Why not recommended:I played pinball for years when I was younger (as my dad worked in a bar part-time) and later I went through town to specific pinball tables.The tables in this game are purely fantasy. They could not be built in real life.And whats more: You play on a 2D table - and then 3D objects just pop up (like Plants vs. Zombies), which really.. does not match the feeling of a flat pinball table.Also you can feel that physics is nearly, but not exacly as in real life. Sometimes it feels to fast, then to slow, then you have camera zoom in on an element. All nicely done; all nothing to do with a real pinball table.So far the best virtual tables I know are still the old TimeShock! and bus driver thingy which name I don't remember right now. They are decades old and still look great; sadly do not come with high res/controller support (which is why I tried this one) and don't work as nicely on some machines due to DOS emulation :-/Why you might still like it:Pinball tables are nicely designed, have lots of different elements (although some feel generic) and use their specific themed sounds, graphics etc. So if you know the movie/game the table is based on, it does provide a nice ""ahh, I know that"" feeling.Also I did not encounter any performance issues or bugs, controller handling is fine, too.So if you don't mind the not-quite-real-feeling, you can give it a try, as it is not a rip-off or anything. Just not what I am looking for/prefer.			"

Then if you get hooked you can buy single tables or packs of three or four (I recommend the marvel packs and star wars). Till  Nov 28th 2013 you can get a bundle with lots of tables much, much cheaper than usually right here, totally recommended: https://www.humblebundle.com/weeklyI played this game for at least a dozen hours on xbox 360 and now I'm hooked all over again!

												I wouldn't have written this review, but I wanted to hopefully share some sanity to the recent reviews for one of my favorite games.Anybody who is afraid of this ""terrible bad datamining EULA that transmits your passwords"" should read the EULA and privacy policy for themselves. Maybe it was worse before, and maybe they changed it. There's no ""virus miner"" and certainly no terms in the EULA to allow them putting one in. This is how the EULA stands currently, in layman's terms:* If you access their website, they will give you cookies* If you sign up for ZEN services, they will store your username, profile avatar, and ZEN password* If you use non-steam versions of Pinball FX2, they will show you targetted advertising (They included permission to do this in Steam too, but I don't notice any ads in the game)* If you provide any information or make any forum posts, they will store that information and analyze it for ads. They may disclose it to third parties. If you don't want people seeing your information, don't share it.* They reserve the right to store more data than what they mentioned, but unless you're a conspiracy theorist, you will hopefully understand that they don't have the physical ability to store more data than what you provide to them. People have claimed that the game contains a data miner, but haven't provided any evidence other than the EULA saying they share your data with third parties.Their full privacy policy is here: http://blog.zenstudios.com/privacy_policy_pc_steam.html And the EULA, which is a blanket that covers ZEN software in general, is in the yellow box to the right of the steam page.Yes, they use the data you provide them, and yes, they will target ads (if you view their website and affiliated ads on the net), but this is completely ordinary nowadays. Just look at the EULA for any AAA publisher and they'll cover their bases in a similar way.As for the game itself, it's great. The free table is very enjoyable, and I always come back to it, despite owning a lot of the paid ones. The physics are good, though the ball could feel a bit more weighty IMO. It's a fairly videogamey sort of pinball. It's definitely not a simulator like Pinball Arcade or Timeshock.Give the game a try if you like pinball! "

												I've played many real and video pinball machines over the years and, to be totally honest, while the tables in Pinball FX2 are beautiful and make good use of modern video game graphics, there are issues that make the game less than stellar (and even less than playable) in my book.First and foremost, the flippers are apparently insanely powerful. I've played pinball machines with strong flippers, but these are just impossible. Even on the near end of the flipper, the ball is launched off of it with nearly the same or exactly the same speed as if you flipped it from the distant end. Second, and nearly as bad, is the ball itself has just the most baffling physical properties. When you strike it with the flippers, it feels almost hollow and just flies off, even on top of the flipper hinge, even if you're trying not to even move the ball at all. If you try to catch the ball by holding the flipper when it comes down one of the side lanes, it rolls completely off the end of the flipper, every single time. You can flip it cleanly up a normal ramp and it will stop dead not even an inch up the ramp as if it lost momentum from spinning/rubbing against the side of the ramp, but then it comes straight back at nearly the same speed it had when you struck it (which is to say, maximum speed, because it always seems to be moving very fast), almost like you flipped it up a 60° incline with no friction at all. This happens in exceedingly random fashion as well; you can hit the same ramp at the same speed and it can go up normally...or not. There doesn't appear to be any rhyme or reason to it.Now, those things on their face make the game unplayable for me. If the underlying physics of the game engine behaved in a predictable way, it might have been different. The table designs themselves look pretty nice. That said, the dichotomy between the free table's design features that are reminiscent of actual pinball machine designs from the 90's and the essentially impossible design features that are only possible because it's a video game are a bit off-putting. I would prefer a table that's designed one way or the other. Especially if I'm going to be asked to put my initials into the Sorcerer's Lair table with the flipper buttons like some kind of non-keyboard-having troglodyte, a table that if it existed in reality would have to be LITERALLY haunted in order to have the same kinds of display features. The camera could use some work too, and yes, I tried all of the different view settings, none of them really helped me, especially when it came to trying to gauge distance on skill shots.Given the amount of graphical polish in the game, I really have to wonder how it ended up being this way. I was excited to try the game because the tables look beautiful and well designed, but instead I came away with that weird feeling of disappointment mixed with doubt that makes me wonder if I should keep trying it once again to see if my perception was incorrect. Unfortunately, I kept coming away with the same conclusions each time. Well, at least there's a free table.Edit: Haters gonna hate. I consider the downvotes validation of everything I said, and you should too. Clarified physics complaints slightly and made other minor changes. Moved edit info to bottom.			"

												One of favorite Marvel movies as a pinball table?!Unfortunately, this table just doesn't live up to the title. The two pre-game modes get very repetitive and make repeat gameplay nearly impossible. There are plenty of positives about this table, but they simply don't outweigh the negatives.Save your money and try some of the other Marvel tables (Ant-Man or Captain America are my personal favorites).

												EDIT:As of 10/2015 this review is turned to negative.The way in which the company handles its customer base is apalling.First the EULA who where to spy on all your information.And now they Reset all scoreboards, accusing all the top players as cheaters.I can not recomend this game any more.---------------I must admit, this is a pretty well made game, i had quite some fun trying out the few tables i have so far (one table is free for everyone, so you can try it out). There is lots of different modes and things to discover, the mechanics feel natural and good to me. The high score system that is connected with your friendslist on steam gives you another reason to play it,  to try and beat your buddies high scores.I was initially turned off by the DLC model they made, but the tables are very different from each other and really well made, so it seems they are worth their price when bought in a sale. I will surly get all the tables at the next opportunity.Give it a try, you might like this game =)			"

												My favorite computer version of pinball ever. A wide variety of tables are available. Even though I'm not a fan of many of the licenses used, the tables based on them are still fun. Of course, it can be even cooler for those tables based on properties I do enjoy. Table quality does vary, but overall I have spent so many hours with this game, and it's just the perfect spot for a quick, short session. The tables themselves are definitely computer-based; there are events that could never happen on a physical table. So if someone is looking for a super-authentic recreation of physical pinball, this might not be a great choice. For me, though, it replicates the joy I felt when I first encountered pinball as a kid.			"

												A pinball game that simulates the real life of being at a arcade with different pinball tables. Note that the base game is free, but all the other tables cost money.Each table is a paid for DLC. Although this kinda puts me off the game, they do let you sample the tables with a demo on each. This is great for to choose which table you wish to buy on their dlc's. For example, i really like their western themed table and have taken screenshots of it. I even wishlisted that table because i really like it.As for the control for the game, i use a Logitech F310. I have issues on it with the right flipper. This might be due to my personal controller though.If you are a pinball fan, don't hesitate to try this little gem.			"

												I did enjoy this game for some time.  Eventually I had purchased a few more additional tables but had not played them yet.  About 2 weeks after purchasing the tables I went to go play them and there was a new EULA with concerns regarding collection of information and advertisements.  Many people posted against the changes and devs said it would be rewritten.  It's been a long time with no change as they've waited for it to just blow over.  As such I feel I must change my review and warn people against supporting this game and its devs.My old review from April 5, 2015:I never played much real pinball and never cared for the ones that usually came with windows so I can't really make any comparisons, however I have enjoyed this game so far.   Some things I liked, the initial game is free so you can basically demo it and not have to uninstall/reinstall.  Most of the packs aren't too expensive, I picked up the south park and one of the star wars packs giving me 6 different pinball machines to work with, although I don't much care for the default machine the game gives you for free.  Each machine is configured differently and follows a theme, there are some neat little bonuses that work sort of like mini games, and they also have objectives marked out on the top left to let you know when you've done something right and how to proceed.  All in all I feel a robust 3d pinball game that offers you the choice of your favorite theme and leaderboard for both people on the same computer but steam friends as well.			"

												Barely started playing it but this is a quality pinball game. The game isn't a real 'pinball simulation' but the gameplay is tight, holds true to it's own brand of physics and it adds gameplay elements impossible to implement in real tables. Basically unless you dislike anything but true to life pinball and 100% accurate simulations based on that, you should really, really enjoy this game and the one free table is awesome so... just do it. Also if you got windows 8 you can install this game through games for windows and get the MARS table for free as well which is also excellent.Update xmas 2013...Yeah this game is awesome. Some tables are better than others but overall this thing gets video game pinball right and plays to the strenght of the platform adding cool gameplay mechanics that take full advantage of the virtual medium... so get it if you like good games that reward skill play (well in most cases).

												I just LOVE this game. Fantastic graphics, great audio. The physics are as good as you could wish for. I love the 'unreal' element this brings to the genre. That is to say the firery balls, the characters flying all over the screen and other visual effects that could never be on a real table.  If you find these get in your way then maybe you are missing the whole point, and Pinball Arcade may suit your ball skills. But for me this game scratches every itch. And comes with fantastic support, even 3 years after its release its still getting great, fresh new tables. 10/10. 5 stars			"

												Amazing fun for hours. Great time killer. The tables are interesting and engaging with lots of tricks to learn. I don't always like the DLC philosophy of game design but if there was ever a perfect fit for it, it is with Pinball FX2. The core graphix and physics really dont need an update, so with DLC it allows the developers to focus their energy on continuing to produce top notch tables. That is exactly what they do. Buy the tables that you want, skip the ones you dont, and you even get to try before you buy. How great is that. Also the price of the tables is crazy reasonable, especially if you catch it on sale. This purchase is a no brainer!			"

 Pinball FX2 Lets all play Pinball FX2, today, tomorrow, and who knows maybe next week and next year and so on. The best way for me to discribe Pinball FX2 is that it has been washed, scrubed and blow dryed and now its been refreshed and revitalised. I myself like to play Pinball for pure fun and joy and if I get a great score Im happy, but if not then Im still happy I had my few hours enjoyment and satisfaction. I only play Pinball if Im in the right mood anyway, as Im not a pro at it, and nor do I want to be. But I do love and admire all the great scores my friends share on it, and I know they enjoyed thier time playing the game and so earning those genuine and honest fantastic scores. It takes a great deal of consentration, very good fine motor skills and plenty and I mean plenty of constant practice and patience to become a Pinball King and or Wizard to be the best of the best and we have plenty of fantastic best of the best Pinballers that have put thier hearts and soles and many, many hundreds and thousands of hours into the game to master it and they do it ever so well, and who knows i could become 1 too some day. But Im not going to, because its way out of my league anyway, and Im not as passionate as others are. With regards to these tables and my personal experiance with these tables, is that I have prefered them over any other Pinball tables that steam has to offer, and thats not ment to put other companys down niether. I personally like and prefere most of Pinball FX tables but some are more prefered and fun than others and we all have our personal favourites and thats fine too.Im not a Pro Pinball play and so I cant explain the game play as such, just that Pinball is Pinball, and I love these Pinball tables. I am very proud to have some of the much loved best of the best Pinball players as my friends and I hope and pray that they never give up, and keep striving to be the best of the best and perhaps just take much needed breaks as I do when required as breaks are very important in life, they help clear the air and make way for fresh vitalised restarts ;)Dont give up on Pinball FX, give the game a go. The game is not easy, nor is it difficult as such, and it may not be for everyone. But the game sure is a lot of fun if you can get into it. I cant get the big scores, but it sure is fun trying to achieve and aim for your next more improved score anyway.Im going to give Pinball FX2 a 9/10If you dont agree, thats fine too.			"

												I love playing FX2 Pinball!BUT…….!!! WARNING !!!Please be aware that, even though the Store Page makes no mention, every Zen Studios FX2 Pinball table or package you buy is actually “early access”, and as such is almost guaranteed to not only have bugs (not just on new tables, but also old and unfixed bugs on tables well over a year old), but most tables continue to generate a more or less constant stream of new bug issues (over 200 since 10/2015.) Zen does little or nothing to notify players when (or IF) problems are ever resolved. I have more than 825 games, yet Zen Studios, FX2 Pinball remains one of the worst, least responsive, most deliberately unpleasant and obtuse Steam vendors I’ve had the displeasure to encounter. I have gone from quite certainly being among the MOST supportive of FX2 players, to perhaps the MOST bitterly disappointed.And if you raise questions, be prepared to be treated as ""enemy"", as has been the case for numerous of Zen's most concerned and passionate customers, in a bizarre business strategy I've not encountered before in nearly 40 years in business.I love playing most of these tables, but no one should buy them without being aware of the potential for failure and frustration, and the possibility your scores will never even be recorded properly. As well, Zen Studies has, in the past 6 months alone (since approx.. mid ’15) wiped ALL scores for EVERY player on one table (Avengers – Ultron), and on EVERY one of 55 tables for EVERY player in another score wipe shortly after. This effectively eliminated up to two year’s efforts or more for 202,000 customers, including many disabled players. In doing so, Zen accused players of cheating for utilizing a specific pinball attribute that Zen themselves enabled, and is still available on other FX2 platforms other than Steam. Numerous of the world’s best players, and most helpful and conscientious of pinball advocates, left in protest, abandoning all hope of making use of their OWN significant financial and time investments.Following the SECOND Steam score wipe (early Oct. ‘15) which Zen Studios repeatedly promised NOT to perform, 90%, or 180,000 registered players, had NOT returned in the 3 months following.But if you love pinball as much as I do, this is simply a very annoying, irritating and frustrating price to be paid. But enough is enough…….Thank you.			"

												I have played alot of pinball in my life, starting with real pin tables in the 1960s. I buy every pinball game I can find, regardless of platform. Pinball FX2 is perhaps the very best virtual pinball game that I have ever played. Let it be known though that there are currently 57 tables available on Steam counting all 8 Super League Football (Soccer) team variants, and I own them all. On October 21st of this year they will release four more tables in a pack. More on those tables in a moment.Unlike many virtual pinball games the table designs and ball physics are rock-solid. Approx. 30% of their tables are totally original, as in non-licensed. My personal favorite of these is Socerer's Lair. In the interest of completness my least favorite of these is V12, but it may be just me as it's really hard for me to score well on this table. There are two South Park tables, which I love. My favorite is South Park's Super Sweet Pinball. I can spend hours playing that one. There is also a Portal table, which some gamers think of as Portal 3, because it takes place after the events of Portal 2. There is also a table based on The Walking Dead and one, which I love alot, based on the video game franchise Splosion Man. Well, more closely on the second game in the series Ms. Splosion Man, which is what it's called. It has a very anime feel to it that I like. It also reminds me abit of the Sega game for the Dreamcast Space Channel 5.Disney must love Zen Studios, as approx. 60% of the tables are either based on Star Wars or on Marvel comics and/or films and TV series. Zen recently renewed their licensing agreement for both franchises. Overall these tables range from good to excellent. Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back is one of the really good ones, with alot of mini-games. Darth Vader has a stand out line in this one - ""I'm altering the game. Pray I don't alter it further."" :)Zen Studios has added a new source to license properties for their tables from, Fox Digital. This is where the newest tables come in, to be released on Steam on October 21st as part of a four table pack entitled ""Balls of Glory."" Reminds me of the old virtual pinball game ""Balls of Steel."" The pack to be sold on Steam is rumored to sell for $9.95, which is very reasonable. The tables are American Dad Pinball, Archer Pinball, Bob's Burgers Pinball, and Family Guy Pinball. All are based on Fox animated TV series, although Archer airs on FX and FXX (both Fox owned). This deal opens the door for The Simpsons Pinball and Futurama Pinball. In fact it opens the door to alot of possibilities.There are only two downsides to Pinball FX2, and that is the EULA and the recent Leaderboards reset. Both bother many. Neither bothers me. The amount of data you fork over isn't nearly as much as is the case with the Steam version of Dream Pinball 3D (see my review), and Pinball FX2 is more stable. In fact it has never crashed on me - ever! The Leaderboards were reset to fix a bug that Zen discovered in the game. Rather than leave it in they took it out, but decided in fairness that this fix, which took out some exploits, made the tables harder to score on, at least for those (like me) who didn't even know that they were there. So they reset the Leaderboards. But they retained the old ones, called Legacy Leaderboards. The Local scores achieved in Hotseat Mode where left intact. If you don't like the EULA I don't recall there being one with the Android Apps.There is one Zen table currently unavailable on Steam as it is an Xbox 360 exclusive, and that's Rocky & Bullwinkle. Alot of people, including myself, have requested this table. But Zen no longer has the franchise rights, which means in order for them to release it on Steam they would have to renew that license. I hope they do. In 1993 Data East released a real pin machine, The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle & Friends, but FarSight hasn't released it yet as part of their The Pinball Arcade game. I hope they will. They've been releasing more Data East tables of late. But I digress.Zen Studios must be doing something right. They started off with 4 employees and now have 75 (see the article on Zen Studios in the June 2015 issue of Game Informer magazine for more information. That would be issue #266).  Zen supports alot of platforms. In addition to the PC via Steam, the ""Balls of Glory"" pack of tables will be released for iOS, Android (the trailers are already on my Android device in the Zen Pinball app), the PS3, PS4, PS Vita, and the Xbox one. They have more Marvel, Star Wars, and originals confirmed.The controls are quite good, both with Keyboard and Control Pad. I am currently using a Logitech Xbox 360 controller set for X Mode, although D Mode does work as well. Not all games seem to be compatible with D Mode, but as I stated Pinball FX2 is. I use X Mode simply because it's compatible with most other games.Currently 150 friends on Steam own this game.			"

 A  lot of FUD being slung hereI have to wonder how many of those slinging FUD are ones that were banned for cheating, because if you actually READ the EULA It spells everything out quite clearly..if you wanna have access to the leaderboards? You use the latest client...that's it. No secret spying, none of the BS being slung by the reviews here, simply you can't use old clients if you want to put your name on the leaderboards. Considering every other time I've seen such a thing it was because  they were having serious issues with pirates and hacked game clients? I think we can all guess who is doing the FUD slinging.As for the game itself? in a word FUN with a capital F! The tables are great, with so many mini-games and cool animations the first few times you play you'll lose because you were too busy gawking at all the cool stuff, its a real blast. Great physics, fair tables, you'll wish you could get real life tables that can do what these do!			"

												The games Look Fantastic but there is a slight lag time to the flippers (For Me) and this makes enjoyable playing impossible.The flippers (Most Important Part of any Pinball Machine) have to be Very Responsive like on a real pinball machine. ANY lag time just can't be tolerated. I Wished there was a fix for this, but I didn't see anything in the settings or help section.			"

												Most pinball games out in the world are designed with one goal in mind; take your quarters.Zen has designed their tables with a different goal in mind; enjoy pinball so much that you want to buy the next table, and the next and the next etc etc.Which I'm doing.  For the cost of a few trips to the arcade (yes they still exist and have some fun games to play) you could easily have 10-20 tables, depending on the sales at the time....Is what I would post as my review if I didn't have to agree to a new EULA to play my tables that I purchased under different licence agreement.

												It's a pretty good game of pinball. Specifically, video game pinball. The physics work pretty well, and the graphics are solid. Very rarely have I encountered a problem while playing. I can only remember one instance of a ball getting stuck because of a bug.  Edit: Something I wanted to point about my video game pinball comment. What I mean is that these tables are designed to be played longer than the real life counterpart(because they want your money of course). Therefore they have more extra balls you can earn, kickbacks and so on. You can even nudge the table in ways you couldn't do in real life, either because of personal injury or damaging the table itself. Be warned though, most tables will only give you two chances in a period of time before tilting out on you, but it sure can be fun to save a ball that otherwise would have been lost. One last thing that relates to the fact this is video game pinball, when you exit out a game in progress, the game will be saved, so don't worry if something comes up, or if you're just having a really good game but you can't play in one sitting.The one thing that appeals to me about pinball is that you're always trying to get better, so that you can continue to improve and of course get a better score. One thing that also helps is comparing how well you do with your friends. I have a number of Steam friends just so I can have scores to compare with and try to beat. I would say overall, the quality of the tables are fantastic. If I have any complaints, it's mostly about the selection-it's that Star Wars and Marvel theme tables dominate the catalog. Now don't get me wrong, I like Star Wars, and I love the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it would be cool to see different properties more often. (BTW, get Guardians of the Galaxy, and the Star Wars Balance of the Force pack-Starfighter Assault is my favorite table) I play with my X-Box 360 controller, it works really well with the game. I also have my second monitor on portrait mode, which makes a huge difference in seeing the table. If you can have that setup I totally recommend it.I never got to play real pinball that much, there's no arcades where I live, and of course getting a real machine is very expensive, so I think this is a good alternative. And the price for tables is decent.Also, there is a free table, and you can try all the tables to see what they're like. I recommend this game. Have fun, and may the bumpers be with you.			"

												Sick of others who want to stick their nose where it has no place.  Zen does not care about your privacy and in my opinion is no different than a majority of others who would sell You out for a profit in a heartbeat.  FIX YOUR EULA Zen Studios and dont say you have when you havent...  Untill then I think of Zen Studios as a crap developer. with no morals.  And for the record, there is more in life than Marvel and Star Wars and I agree with the others who say enough already.			"

												As a videogame (pinball or otherwise) available on Steam, this is one of the rare 10 out of 10 ways to spend your money.First, This game appeals to both the traditional ""get-off-my-lawn"" pinball wizard and the younger ""never seen a real pin"" crowd.Fantastic original table designs with satisfying rule-sets and replayability.Ball physics that nail the difficult to emulate real-world pinball experience without being artificially hard, and builds up the 'one-more-time' mentality with the occasional flirt into controller breaking frustration territory (but in a good way).Fantastic graphics and sound. Excellent use of licensed IP (though I prefer the original IP tables).Native Multi-Monitor Support (You can play this without much trouble on a Virtual Pin Cabinet).Wide range of gameplay within the table selection, though I do wish they would release a table or two that capture the EM feel. I buy all the tables and think they are all FUN, but if you are looking for a handful of real winners:Epic Quest - It isn't Medieval Madness but I get the same enjoyment.The (Your Team Here) Soccer Table - Fantastic goal oriented (pun intended) design.Plants verses Zombies - Another well defined rule-set with long-term playability.Thor - Excellent Ritchie like shot flow.

												Fantastic pinball game with many, many unique tables. This is not trying to be authentic recreations of real tables like Pinball Arcade, but rather visually stunning, interactive, and digital pinball. There are many licensed tables and also unique tables created by Zen that can hold your attention for hours on end. I am a huge fan of real pinball table recreations but these Zen tables are well done and incredibly fun to play, even for non-pinball players. Highly recommend.			"

												Pretty good pinball. Each table has a bunch of different features and modes on it, and some tables go all out with significant gimmicks that affect the entire play experience. The Marvel Avengers table, for example, lets you switch out between six differently-colored balls each with their own special abilities (higher multipliers, less hits to activate features, longer ball save, etc).You typically get between 1 and 3 tables in each pack, and you can easily sink a couple of hours into each table if you're score attacking.

												Very good pinball physics. Maybe not always exactly like the real thing in terms of ball movement and speed, but certainly lots of fun to play. Zen also makes some very original and creative tables. Pinball tables capable of transforming as you play them. Some of these tables could never exist this way in real life with current pinball technology. Tables you could never play anywhere else.  The interface is also pretty good. Not hard to navigate even without using a mouse. On top of all that, the tables have good animation, sound and voicing.			"

												I quite like this game. A great many tables to choose from, and you even get the first table for free. (if you want to check it out.)There are a few tables that are just annoying to play, but most of them can give a satifying feeling of a good game even after the last ball drains.Pricing per table is not too expensive, but might seem a bit high if you plan on buying all the tables in one go. I recommend starting off with one of the packs, which gives you 4 tables, and buy tables as you go along. And as I've found, returning to old tables after your skill increases, the replay value is there. 3D works great if you've got the gear for it, and at first I only played 3D and anytime I looked at the tables in 2D, they looked flat and strange, and I couldn't play them. Although as my skill increases, the difference between 60hz/eye & 120hz is simply too big, so I play in 2D these days. (atleast untill I can find a monitor that let's me have a high refresh rate for 3D.=)			"

												Whenever I'm upset playing other Steam oh-so-serious games, I run to casuals. PinballFX, honestly, is one of them.With the game, whether you just want to play the game casually, or to stomp your friends' high score, it's all catered. With tons of tables to play with (woooo thanks Humble Bundle) and well made tables, makes the experience fun.The gameplay is the same old, you only need to jump directly and play. All you need to do is to keep the ball inside your table and don't let it fall off. But unlike other pinball games I've played, this one offers an in-tables quests depending on where we aim the ball to thus makes the session more interesting to play and achieving higher personal scores isn't like a long mindless grind. And if you ever are confused with the tables, there's a help file (just pause the game and click on help) so you know of the table's objectives and on what to do.The tables designs are full with vibrant color and light, more than enough to please my eyes. And they're not fully static, with several addons side characters and mini tables (quest result), you're not just seeing a ball bouncing right and left.The tables are sold separately as 'DLC's. Make sure you read the appropriate store page of each DLC to know how many tables you're getting (yes, some are packaged together as one DLC, so 4 tables-for-one is not surprising). For tables reviews, refer to each Store Page's review, as it's too expansive to be reviewed in this single writing.Game natively supports local hot seat, but I personally would've liked to have a MP versus with friends thru internet, would've been much easier to play together. Not a big deal for missing the feature though.If you're unsure if you're interested enough, you can try the tables for a limited time and see for yourself. I personally haven't bought/gotten every single tables, but I'm quite sure the more tables I have, the merrier it will be.			"

												The strength of this game is how good the tables are. The tables complexity is the one of an actual good table. There's a lot to do in each one of them, and i didn't feel the mechanics from table to table were repetitive. Each table is unique.The game is free to play, but most of the tables you have to buy. You can try the paid tables as many times as you want, but each game you make on them is time-limited, so you can't never progress much. There's a free table (Sorcerer's Lair) that is free. I bought some tables, but i would say the free one is actually better than some of the paid ones, so even if you are not thinking to invest in this game, you should still try the free table and chances are you'll be having fun.I think 2€/3€ for a table is a fair price. They are really a piece of art. But if you think that price point is a bit excessive, try it first in-game to see if it's your cup of tea and wait for a sale.			"

												This is a fast paced pinball game. The ball speed is faster compared to real pinball tables. Though weirdly, that doesn't seem to make it more difficult. It seems the tables are designed to compensate for that. It's also not trying to be like real pinball; there are mechanics and effects in this game that are impossible to do in reality. Like spaceships flying over the table or characters walking around shooting guns or getting involved in sword fights, the ball catching fire, multiball modes where gravity is reversed and the balls are levitating... you name it.The tables are well designed, though some more so than others. The tables that seem more fun to me are mostly the unlicensed ones, with Epic Quest, Secrets of the deep, Pasha, Tesla and Mars providing the best gameplay. Not that the rest is dull or anything, but after a while the 3D animations and character voices on the Star Wars and Marvel tables can get on your nerves. They overdid it on that department, and this sometimes overshadows the tables themselves. ""Too much of a good thing.""There's also an issue with input lag. Fortunately, it's not too big of a problem once you change your driver settings (setting ""maximum pre-rendered frames"" to 1 in the NVidia control panel). But even after configuring it that way, there's still a bit of input lag left. It doesn't make the game unplayable or anything, but it's still a minor annoyance. Unfortunately, the issue is being completely ignored by Zen Studios, even though people have repeatedly reported the problem on their forums. Hopefully Zen will change their attitude at some point (though I doubt it.)The only real downsides with this game though is the missing online multiplayer on PC (I think the console versions have that) and the price; nearly 100€ to get all tables is quite steep. I bought the game and a good selection of table packs when it came on Humble Bundle, and then more tables on Steam's Fall Sale. Otherwise it would simply be way too expensive. So if you downloaded the core game along with the Sorcerer's Lair table (those are for free, so just try it out) and you like what you see, it might be best to wait until the tables are on sale again.Bottom line: loads of fun, but why the heck isn't there online multiplayer on PC?

												Just picked up Plants Vs. Zombies Table the other day. Fun Stuff. Must RTFM on this one cause I'm just hitting the ball. But still another great build, in fact this is from the original Zen Pinball If I do belive.Curious. I've looked atr the new Super League Football for about 10 seconds on the demo. LOL and is there any difference between all these tables or do you just buy a table for the team you like. Anyone wanna help me out cause I've bought every table in the FX² series as well as Pinball Arcade 1,2 and 3.buying all the same tables for SLF seems redundent. Am I missing something here. "

												Well, it's a pinball game so you know what to expect. It's a free game with no free tables so it's not really free now, is it ? Weird.Some of the tables are definitely worth the money though, like the Star Wars (Star Wars Episode 4-6) and Marvel (World War Hulk) tables. But that's personal of course. If you like to relax once in a while, like me, Pinball FX2 is just the game for you.[Rating: 80/100]			"

												First, I want to say that this is not a pinball simulator. As far as I know, none of the tables are modeled from physical tables, and many of the effects, toys, and ball behavior would be difficult, if not impossible, to replicate on a physical machine. Also, the physics engine seems to be the first to suffer when the program is running slow, which can be annoying. All that being said, I really love these tables. Each feels very unique, but there's enough carried over from one design to the next that learning one helps improve your skill on many more of them. The graphics and characters are fun, the voice acting is usually quite good, and many of them have a surprisingly nice story flow. Having even just a few tables gives you a really nice set of choices. I have 33 tables, and I would say most feel completely unique from the others. The physics on some of the tables can be a bit wonky, but as long as the program is running well, the physics is consistant and I had no trouble getting used to the occasionally strange ball behavior.

												Got my first tables for this game in a Humble Bundle. I honestly wouldn't have bought 'em without that opportunity... and boy would I have missed something. If you happen to feel nostalgic about those times when there was a pinball table in every pub and you would throw coins at it in hope to beat your friends' scores, this game is a must have.The only con point I can find about this game is the fact that it is all DLC. But hey, you got a free table (which is lots of fun) with the base game and you can try each other one for a short time so that you don't buy blind.All in all, the game's replayability, the variety of tables and it's party game potential (thanks to local MP) make it a really good buy, which you probably won't regret. And if you still feel doubtful, just get the base game and play the free table for a while. There's no risk in trying... apart from the risk of getting addicted ;)			"

												Pinball FX 2 makes me feel so conflicted. Some days it's 'OH GOD THIS GAME IS FANTASTIC I NEED MORE' and some days it's ""SCREW YOU PINBALL YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ME"". Despite the polarity and mental abuse that it gives, I still find myself coming back for more. It could be the stellar pinball physics, it could be the cool table designs, or it could be I just love it despite what it does to me so I can't bear to not play it. All in all, it's pretty great. All it's missing is the smell of dirty ashtrays and over fried grease of my truckstop pinball days of the 80's. Oh, and the rack of nudie mags that they used to stand next to the Addams Family table at my truckstop back in the days too. That'd be nice.			"

												For a game whose sole mechanics could be summed up as ""hit a ball with flippers to score points"", Pinball FX2 absolutely shines with invention. Ball physics are generally top notch with only a couple of tables that love to see you fail (Civil War to name one); both the Marvel and Star Wars theme tables are spread across a wide sub-genre of characters, films, comics and cartoons; high score tables are implemented perfectly well, with notifications in-game to spur you on as you edge closer to a friend's score.It's pretty much the best Pinball game since Pinball Dreams - and while it may look like the developers are attempting to nickel and dime you with the amount of available packs, you'd be better off to pick them up one at a time and learn the tactics involved with each set. The 4-table packs can easily see you playing for 2 to 3 hours (per table) in order to truly appreciate where your high scores can be bettered, and there's rarely a dud table amongst them all.If you've the remotest interest or nostalgia for Pinball then do yourself a favour and pick up a pack or two, you won't regret it.

												Is it nerdy of me that this is the first game I purchased on Steam (the Star Wars Pinball: Balance of the Force pack that is)? In truth, I bought this game not only because I adore pinball and Star Wars but because I couldn't add friends without buying something on my first day using Steam (oh how lonely that would be). So lo and behold, I have a confession: yes, I am a nerd and playing Star Wars pinball to me is like nerd heaven! To tell you how much I love Star Wars, I used an exacto knife to make snowflakes in the shape of such awesome things like Death Stars and Boba Fett heads. The Star Wars pack from Pinball FX2 boasts amazing graphics, fun and rapid gameplay, exciting movie scenes and special battles that you'll feel like you're truly in the Star Wars-verse. If you want to satiate your inner Star Wars fan and you love pinball (and have always wanted to go to that pinball Hall of Fame Museum in Vegas), then this is a must-play!			"

												This is the best pinball game I've played on the PC so far. Pinball FX2 offers a large variety of tables with plenty of action and lots of cool visual effects. All of the tables have lots of ramps and rails to shoot. I would say some of the tables are even overly busy which makes it difficult sometimes to see where you have to shoot the ball to complete objectives. The different camera angles help, but I don't like the close up camera angles because it reduces the overall field of view. The one major dislike for me is the lack of table friction. The ball skates around like it's on ice moving at blazing speeds and removes the genuine feel of a real pinball machine. The Epic Quest table is my favorite providing some engaging monster slaying with a few RPG elements--a really great game complete with good music and voice.			"

												Since Pinball Dreams (1992) I was playing back then, Pinball FX2 is probably the best pinball arcade I've been playing.More than 40+ tables amongst which Star Wars hits offer a good variety of genres. The leaderboards system is cool and the in-game system tells when you are about to beat your friend's score which enhances the lust for direct challenges.On a few sidenotes.There is also a tournament mode but I haven't seen any recently.If you really look into some details, you might notice that the scoring  system isn't the same from one table to another meaning that reaching 10 million points can be extremely difficult compared to others where you reach that level in less than 5 minutes.Besides those aspects, great set of tables, nice mechanics, cool music and sound effects and above all, replay value!

												As someone that played ""Full Tilt"" frequently, Pinball FX2 is a huge improvement.It's not so much a pinball game, as it is a ball physics simulator, that you can use on different tables.  The ball feels absolutely great as well(no innuendo intended).  It has good weight, and acts almost exactly as a pinball on an actual table would.  The flippers(for me at least) feel like the mechanical paddles on the few tables I frequent(LotR, Avatar, Terminator), and have a slight travel time that provides the illusion that there is some mechanism between my keystroke and the motion onscreen.  That's not to say they are delayed at all, they just have a touch of weight and travel that adds to the authenticity(note that some people have some kind of flipper lag bug, look into that before making the decision to purchase any dlc).The included table is actually wonderful.  The setting is a little cringy(a sort of goosebumps style horror theme), but the design of the table is fantastic.  It's got great visibility, a huge variety of different obstacles and targets, and a few really inventive quests to complete, my favorite of which being a mission where portals block all of the ramps, redirecting the ball until you summon a ghost which helps you destroy them(I'm aware it sounds moronic, but it really is good fun if you've got an accurate shot!).  The 3d models that flesh out the space are used very subtly as well, and do a great job of adding to the atmosphere, while not making the table seem inauthentic or impossible.  It's a table I'll deffinately be frequenting for a while to come.The free offering of this game is, I think, a phenominal value, and I highly suggest you give it a try as well.  I've purchased some additional tables, and will be reviewing them on their respective pages.If you love pinball(and don't have whatever flipper troubles that seem to be semi-common), and have a few hours to kill, I can't reccomend the free offering of Pinball FX2 enough!

												Well I really like this game.. what else can I say! Everything is pretty simple to follow and you do have a few options you can do with the settings although a couple of the controller ones might need a bit of work. Of course you can change the keys if you use a keyboard and there is a number of display and audio options. The restriction there is that the game is full screen - no windowed mode. It does have an orientation setting so you can even flip the game to portrait (90deg)- I was even stupid enough to try this and play it, now that was weird, but fun! I even toyed with trying to flip my monitor on my desk to match. Sheesh I mist be pitiful ;-)The game itself is great, everything any pinball lover would want and it comes installed free of charge with 1 fully working pinball table, and it's no cheap table either - it's one of the better ones. Speaking of tables, well I haven't got them all yet and I guess thats the beauty of this system. You can try any of the available tables first in the game, it gives you a fairly brief period of time to play, just enough to get an idea of the table, then if you like it you can go buy it as DLC. Some tables are sold separately and there are also table packs (3 or 4 tables in the pack) which works out slightly cheaper.My favourite table so far is Ms Splosion Man, it's kinda crazy - a bit like me I suspect. I have the 2nd highest score amongst my pinball friends on it - yet another thing about the game, you can add your friends or others with Pinball FX2 and see their scores in your game. That gives a bit of motivation to try and beat them. leaderboards, Wizard Scores and apparently tournaments - but I've not participated in one of those yet.Most of the tables can be a bit daunting the first time you play, especially if you are like me and don't bother reading anything and just jump in and play. Thankfully however, there are guides for every table within the game, you can actually pause out and read what you are supposed to be doing during the game if you like. The guides are pretty good overall, they give you enough info on the various things you can do in a table without making you have to read forever. Fairly well set out as well.Definitely worth the free download price and even more so worth spending money on for more tables to play. Get it!			"

												One thing about the game is that it feels more organic.  In most pinball games, the game feels like it in entirely on rails, not just the visible ones placed on the table.  Once you learned how these rails work, earning large scores becomes an easy task.That rail feeling is not a problem in this game.  The way that the ball moves, it feels more organic.  While where the ball is when you use the flippers is important, ball speed and bounciness are also a factor.  This makes that a shot that worked the first time will not necessarily work again the next time.  Having the ball move as it does in real life, it means that ball control is much more important in order to succeed.The biggest draw about the game is seeing everything moving around on the boards.  Most modern pinball games have things that move around as things happen.  However, these movements are always simple that you can see even before the game start.  Once you trigger that movement, seeing it happen again is interesting only if it builds your score.What makes the game unique among most pinball games is that game table feels alive.  As you trigger certain targets, things will happen that would never happen in a normal pinball game.  In Earth Defense, a giant robot is trying to attack you.  If its lasers connect, it will cause your ball to change direction.  In The Empire Strikes Back, Darth Vader will use his force powers to block and even destroy your ball if you get close to him.  Even in Infinity Gauntlet, Thanos will alter the gameplay by swapping the controls and even turning the table upside down.  With all the special movements that can happen, it makes it worth it to experience the special moments of each table.Adding to the uniqueness are the games within the games.  Most pinball games will try to add more by simply using the scoreboard in order to play a bad video minigame.  Working with the video game format, these tables hold more than any physical table can hold.  In Moon Knight, he will use the ball as ammo to fire as hiding villains.  Tesla's table has a smaller table where you try to enter a goal using electro flippers.  In Paranormal, the ball can enter a higher second table in the attic in order to search for ghosts.  In what has to be the collection's highlight, in Star Wars: Starfighter Assault, you will go outside the table completely to shoot TIE fighter in what looks like the old-school game Galaga.  Knowing that there is more in store, spending additional time to explore them completely is a necessity.The one sticking point with the game is the price.  They give everybody one table, Sorcerer’s Lair, as a free table.  For all the rest, you have to pay for them separately.  With individual tables costing three dollars and a pack costing 10, it can get expensive to buy the full game.  If you want the full package, it is necessary to pay over 100 dollars.  At that price, the best way to get them all is to try to get them through a bundle.  Without a bundle, you need to make sure you try each table before buying.			"

The physics are consistent and fun, providing fast paced action with all of the nuance and subtlety of the real thing, even if it is not an exact and realistic simulation. You will have to master tricky flipper work and timely table nudges along with knowledge of the table and twitch reflexes.

												Finally! Not since Pinball Dreams/Fantasies have I played a pinball game this polished and this enjoyable. The key that makes this stand out, in my view, is the viewing angle & dynamic camera work along with the precise 'feeling of control' you can achieve with the ball. Most pinball games just don't get it right!It doesn't have simulator accuracy but it is so fun! This does have an advantage as there are unique things on many tables you simply cannot do with a conventional 'real' pinball table design.Tables all come alive with beautiful sound, animations & mini-games; the Star Wars tables have to be my favs!  Price of the tables is a little high when you add them all up, but you do get quality and all have great replayablity. Achievements are hard to get!

												I just recently started playing this game thanks to my boyfriend, and while I can't exactly say that I'm a fan of pinball, this game is actually a lot of fun. I've never played on a real pinball machine, so I can't compare this to the real thing. The game itself is free and comes with one table, but there are a lot of other ones available for purchase, and they seem to be making new ones every now and then. Most of the tables look very nice and are very well-made. I was lucky enough to get ahold of quite a few tables through Humble Bundle at a great price, as well as one or two on sale on Steam, and at those prices it's worth it even if you might not be a hardcore pinball fan. Some tables are more difficult to get high scores on than others, and every table has two achievements, so there's always a challenge waiting. My personal favourite is the Darth Vader table (both because I'm a fan of him, and because it's one of the few tables I'm decent at), but all the Star Wars tables are great in my opinion. So, in short: Fun game. :)			"

												It could've been a great game, but... there is one HUGE but... In great pinball games, like Pro Pinball series, when you are on a mission, you have enough time to read mission description before the ball is released.In this game, on most tables, mission description does not hold the ball, so you can't track the mission and the ball at the same time. It wuoldn't be a huge problem if the tables were intuitive enough, but no. On most of them stuff is flashing without any reason so you don't know if you're supposed to shoto the ramp, avoid the ramp, shoot something else.To answer the question: Do you recommend tihs game? - I'd say yes, but only if you're not interested in mastering scores. Reading the table description before playing it should not happen in 2013.Also, scoring across tables should be more consistent. On some tables scoring 10,000,000 is nothing while on others it's a rarity.			"

												All round excellent pinball game, good physics engine and a nice variety of tables. Graphically very slick also. Highly recommended tables would include 'Plants vs Zombies', 'Ms Splosion man' (don't let the pink put ya off), and 'Quest for epic loot' (hope I got the name of that one right). The free table 'Sorcerer's lair' also has a high degree of replayability and a nice little 'mini game / sub table' section to add to the fun. Personally I play with a game pad but I see no reason why this would be any less fun playing with keys.			"

												Did you grow up playing the default pinball game on windows? Think of this as effectively the same thing - it's a good time-passer, looks nice, plays well, and generally I've found a few tables that I've had a blast playing.Some tables are, as would be expected, hit or miss with some people. I've played some that I've frankly disliked and continued to dislike from the instant I started playing them, and other that just clicked.So far, I've found that the game is solid, and if you're looking to have fun, picking it up on sale is not a bad idea. I would personally recommend Paranormal, Earth Defense and Secrets of the Deep (being the three tables I've played primarily).Hardcore pinball players or fans of the real deal might not be 100% satisfied with this, as it has obvious physics flaws that some veterans will pick up on rather quickly, especially regarding momentum and velocity of the ball, so keep this in mind.All in all, if you see this on sale and are asking yourself if you want to buy a table or two, consider this:Do you enjoy pinball? Consider it.Do you value realism? Rethink whether you actually want this game or not. Tables tend to lean more on the fantastic side.Do you want a timesink or something that you can pick up and put down quickly? It's pretty fast to boot and close and tables are up and running PDQ. The load times are not that bad.Overall, a great fantasy pinball game, and plenty of fun to be had, but if you're looking to play realistic pinball, look elsewhere.			"

												When I was younger I use to play a game called Extreme Pinball.  It was an awesome game, and I've spent years trying to find a game to rival it.  Pinball FX2 (also known as Zen Pinball?)  definitely steps up to the plate.  The game gets some flack for not having realistic tables, but that doesn't mean they aren't awesome fun!  If you have some friends playing, competing for high score is also very addictive.They give you one of their best tables for free, and sell additional tables for relatively low prices, especially if you grab them on sale.  If you remember the good old days of arcades filled with pinball machines or are just fascinated by the idea there is very little reason not to give this game a shot.			"

												These pinball tables do not refect real life pinball tables but are built around fantasy themes and idea's, as a result things can take place that can not happen in the real world  EG: characters flying around. So think of the program as a pinball game and not a pinball simulation and you will enjoy every moment. Have steam friends? you can try and beat their scores as a superscode mode keeps tabs.Each table is is only a few dollars and well worth it for a lifetimme of play. 10 out of 10			"

												Their are only 2 pinball games that are worth ANY time, Pinball FX2 being one of them. When this first hit the xbox platform I finally found a reason to play xbox, well, other than the Forza series. Though, I probably even still spent more time in Pinball FX2. And now being on PC, I get to spend all my PC time (well, iMac time. Yes, it plays perfect on iMac too via CrossOver) again with my first true love, pinball. Of all the fantastic tables available, I think still to this day Secrets of the Deep in the FX2 core pack is still a huge favorite of mine. The crazy multi-ball on this table is just like awesome, and the music also helps take you from the real world and into pinball world. Yes, their really is a pinball world, though if you do EVER make it their, you will NEVER want to leave :)…  Each table has loads of variety and will keep you entertained for many many hours. If you even think you could love pinball, of even if you don’t, you owe it to yourself to try this. The FREE table it does come with, Sorcerer’s Lair was just one of the ones I purchased on xbox due to the fact its also a really good table. If I had to pick 1 issue with Pinball FX2, other than not being a native mac port, it would have to be I was really disappointed to not see the weekly leaderboard scores. But hey, it just means more hours to get the really big score to hit the top ten all-time leaderboards after all. Sorry, have to leave now to go find an opening to pinball world.. See you their…….

												Great game, and exclusively comes with a free table! Lots of different tables to choose/buy from! For example 'The walking Dead', 'Plants vs Zombies', 'Marvel' and loads more! There are 8 different table views to choose from. There are great graphics, resolution and some tables are really hard to earn lots of points and finish the table or even beat somebody’s high score! Sometimes at the beginning of the game, the ball sometimes glitches a bit, but although the ball glitches sometimes, it doesn’t mean that the game is terrible!Usually without any glitches, breaks, and crashes, (usually doesn’t crash anyway) the game is really great, almost beginning to be extremely great. There is single-player hotseat (like co-op) and also on locked tables (not bought tables) you can have a demo with limited score and you have to quit.			"

												These are some of the most lovingly crafted virtual tables I've ever played. Features I'd like to see:-Ability to see which tables users are currently playing. Could be a good way to keep rivalries going.-Unlockable alternate tracks. I sometimes find myself muting the tables I've spent the most time on.			"

												Easily one of the best possible adaptations of a physical genre into a digital medium. This game literally reinvents what pinball is , what it can be, and how it can be delivered in the modern gaming era. Highly recommended to all players of all skill levels. If you like this, you should also try the Pinball Arcade. Similar format, real tables.			"

												Their are only 2 pinball games that are worth ANY time, Pinball FX2 being one of them. When this first hit the xbox platform I finally found a reason to play xbox, well, other than the Forza series. Though, I probably even still spent more time in Pinball FX2. And now being on PC, I get to spend all my PC time (well, iMac time. Yes, it plays perfect on iMac too via CrossOver) again with my first true love, pinball. Of all the fantastic tables available, I think still to this day Secrets of the Deep in the FX2 core pack is still a huge favorite of mine. The crazy multi-ball on this table is just like awesome, and the music also helps take you from the real world and into pinball world. Yes, their really is a pinball world, though if you do EVER make it their, you will NEVER want to leave :)…  Each table has loads of variety and will keep you entertained for many many hours. If you even think you could love pinball, of even if you don’t, you owe it to yourself to try this. The FREE table it does come with, Sorcerer’s Lair was just one of the ones I purchased on xbox due to the fact its also a really good table. If I had to pick 1 issue with Pinball FX2, other than not being a native mac port, it would have to be I was really disappointed to not see the weekly leaderboard scores. But hey, it just means more hours to get the really big score to hit the top ten all-time leaderboards after all. Sorry, have to leave now to go find an opening to pinball world.. See you their……. If you make it...			"

												You like pinball? This is best pinball, no questions asked. Remember Space Cadet? It's that on steroids.The tables are a fantastic mix of realism and crazy stuff you'd never be able to pull of on a physical table while maintaining the logic and feel of the real deal. Most tables are pretty deep and, as you'd expect, pretty difficult to master and figure out. Really, if you have a passing interest in these type of games, give one of the tables a spin, see if you don't end up hooked.			"

												One of the best pinball games ever made. Only pinball dreams and fantasies on Amiga 500 is close enough. Been playing almost all pinball simulations released. One often common problem is that they try to hard to make it realistic so it gets  frustrating because emmulation of the ball physics is crap. Or they make it to arcadish or silly. Pinball FX2 is a perfect pinball simulation/arcarde machine with great physics and a amazing set of tables.GFx - 8/10SFx - 10/10Music - 8/10Gamemechanics in other words gameplay - 10/10I already own this game on PS3. PS Vita and X360 so i will have to wait untill a big pricedrop before getting all tables on pc as well. Anyway cant recommend this game enough. Download the game and you will understand why its so popular.			"

												( TL;DR Just play the free table and stick with it or buy one or two more if you like their trials enough ^_^ )FULL FEATURED FREE TABLE included with the core download so I just have to recommend everyone to try this out. It is one of the best of Pinball FX2 so that is definitely much more than just a demo. (Played it for 3 hours so far.) Also all other tables have time limited trials so it's pretty fun to try them out too.Pinball FX2 is arguably the best digital pinball game you'll ever play. Finally there's game competing what Pro-Pinball gave a near perfect example in the late 90's. None of these tables are bad but with current selection of themes (what Steam version currently supports) are still 52% Marvel Comics. 14 tables with other themes are still unreleased on this platform but I bet they are coming eventually.It's also fair to mention that each table stays in development from 6-9 months which definitely justifies that $3€ price tag but you don't really need more than the free one and maybe an additional table to start with. (This version finally supports vertical view for those weirdos who actually own a tiltable screen for some reason =P)			"

												Pinball FX2 Review - Raymond KTLet me make this abundantly clear, Pinball FX 2 is definitely a PC game that should be experienced by all gamers out there, from the hard-core pinball fanatic to the casual pinball player alike. Pinball FX2 is the best, I said the best pinball game *(virtually) that I’ve ever played! The game is free to play with one table included. You can try the other tables out for a limited score. You can buy the other tables individually or as bundles. I just bought most of the tables from a humble bundle deal where you pay what you want. Those complaining about micro-transactions have no ground to stand on because the game is free to play. Even for a relative pinball novice like me, Pinball FX2 has a lot to offer. The feel of real pinball is here, in a game that takes full advantage of its freedom from physical restraints.Pinball FX 2 isn't a game so much as it's a platform on which to purchase, download, and play games. The games in question are different pinball tables, and at launch there are no fewer than 13 of them available. It's a good selection, and what all of the tables have in common is that they look and sound great, they behave realistically, and they get a little better every time another of your friends shows up on the robust leaderboard system. Pinball FX 2 is free to download, while tables are reasonably priced at 800 points for packs of four and 200 points each for those that are available to purchase individually. If you enjoy pinball, downloading Pinball FX 2 is a no-brainer. – Game spotYou certainly don't need to be a pinball wizard to have fun with Pinball FX 2, or even to rack up some respectable scores. Some of the tables are quite challenging, though, and a couple of them can be frustrating if you have trouble making specific shots that they demand of you. On the flip side, other tables are easy enough that you can score millions and hit plenty of cool-looking rails without having to try too hard. "

												Pinball FX2 is an involved, high-level game that requires your complete and undivided focus. It does not take much to play on a casual level, but for the driven and determined it is only the tip of the iceberg. In order to prove your worth in the FX2 leagues, you must provide every single ounce of your skill, awareness, flipper precision, and table bumping mastery to even begin on the lower levels of the ladder system. From there is a grueling journey upwards to being the very best at pinball. Perhaps, if you are enough of a video game master, you will able to top the high score of the Pinball Wizard for the ultimate in Pinball FX2 prestige. Pinball FX2, it's okay.			"

												Graphics/Design - 8.0Sound - 7.5Gameplay - 9.5Value - 9.5Single Player Playtime - N/AOverall 8.7Here's a game I've spent a lot of time with.  The graphics are what you'd expect from a game where you only see a pinball table most of the time and the graphical options are minimal.  However, the great detail put into the tables and into the various minigames are where the game really makes it's mark in quality.  With all the crazy elements the average map has going on while you're playing, this obviously isn't a game trying to replicate an authentic pinball experience and Zen Studios uses this to their full advantage.  On Star Wars tables you might have X-Wings and Tie Fighters shooting at each other or anti-aircraft guns shooting at them.  You might see Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker fighting or Boba Fett in action.  Whether it's Star Wars, Marvel characters or any of the other tables, the table design, mini games and action on the sides have all been crafted to fit in with the reality of each tables fictional (or in some cases real life) universe.  There's nearly 50 maps out currently and you will find a dud here and there if you played every map but the number of high quality fun maps available is awesome.  The sound is decent, nothing particulary stands out there.  Considering how long you can last on some of the maps, it's the perfect game to listen to your own music while you play.  Some of the maps can feel cheap at times.  When you hit a seemingly good shot then it goes in one of the side gutters without giving you a chance to stop it, it can feel cheap.  You always want to feel like the reason you lost is because of a mistake you made, not because the table is designed to be very unforgiving to shots at certain angles.  The value someone can get out of this game is endless really.  There's enough maps out there to last hundreds of hours and hundreds more hours spent to truly master them all.  It's a great game with maps and patches that are still being put out for it.  Highly Recommended.			"

												All round excellent pinball game, good physics engine and a nice variety of tables. Graphically very slick also. Highly recommended tables would include 'Plants vs Zombies', 'Ms Splosion man' (don't let the pink put ya off), and 'Quest for epic loot' (hope I got the name of that one right). The free table 'Sorcerer's lair' also has a high degree of replayability and a nice little 'mini game / sub table' section to add to the fun. Personally I play with a game pad but I see no reason why this would be any less fun playing with keys.			"

												I played this game VERY extensively on the Xbox 360 and loved it -- in fact, I have purchased every table.  I recently built an arcade cabinet (with flipper buttons on the sides) and figured Pinball FX2 would be wonderful on it.  Sadly, the flipper lag is just enough to take you out of the pinball experience.  Try playing ""Future Pinball"" and you'll see what I mean.  When flippers in a pinball game are responsive, you forget that you're not playing on a real pinball table.Edit: After doing some research, I discovered that by disabling VSYNC and setting my pre-rendered frames to 1 (both done in the Nvidea control panel), the flippers became perfectly responsive.  As such, I can recommend this game without hesitation.My only hope now is for a nice sale on the tables.  I don't really want to re-purchase $100 worth of tables I've already bought on my 360.			"

												Great game. It's ""Free to Play,"" but only comes with one starter table, ""The Sorceror's Lair."" The free table, however, is one of my favorites. Additional tables are reasonably priced. Most of them are really enjoyable. If you're just looking for something to kill 20-30 minutes of time, you can hit up a few tables, and have some casual gaming fun. If you're a huge pinball fan, you'll probably love this game. The tables have a variety of objectives for those who have the skill to achieve them. If you hate pinball, you'll probably hate this. I sometimes find it frustrating in the same way I find a physical pinball machine to be frustrating. I am horrible at pinball. It shows every time I play this game, yet I've already logged 6 hours into this and keep purchasing new tables to try out. I couldn't play this for hours at a time, but for small doses when I don't have the attention span for story-based games, this is one of my top choices to play.The animations and voiceovers are interesting and there are 8 different table views, which is a great feature. If you don't like the camera angle on a table, you can easily swap it to another at any time with the touch of a button. You can tweak your settings, too, if you don't mind giving up the leaderboards. When I really like a table, I will sometimes increase my ball count to 10 just to keep playing the same table and see how high I can get my score.			"

												The two biggest video pinball games on Steam are Pinball Arcade and this game. Both have similar revenue models (free with paid tables) and both offer dynamic viewpoints for optimal play. But while Pinball Arcade's legacy tables are nice, I would have to say Pinball FX2 is a superior product. It's not just the Marvel and Star Wars licensed tables (though they certainly help) but I feel Pinball FX2 definitely takes advantage of the fact that it is a video game and therefore its tables can do things that are incredibly difficult if not impossible on a real table (including mechanics and animated models) while still keeping realistic pinball physics. Pinball FX2 does not insult customers by offering ""professional"" versions of tables. All tables feature operator menus and certain tables feature special balls (The Avengers table in fact makes it a gameplay mechanic). Besides Star Wars and Marvel, Pinball FX2 offers many tables that are a joy to play and very engaging. The Super League Football table in particular has become a table I am incredibly fond of. And lest not forget there is a free table in the form of Sorcerer’s Lair which is nothing to sneeze at. It's just as fun and of good quality as any of the paid tables.For me, personally apart from the quality of the product, one of the biggest draws that encourages me to keep playing is the native integration with Steamworks so that all of your friends' high scores for any give table are automatically displayed in game. Thus it becomes a game in itself to see if you can best your friends' high scores.Overall this is a wonderful product if you enjoy pinball. I don't want to say its ""better"" than Pinball Arcade due to the different roles they fill, but it definitely has a much better pricing model. Must play.			"

												Absolutely stunning graphics, fabulous physics and challenging design makes the Pinball FX2 series a must-have for arcade pinball enthusiasts.  I have purchased all the tables with the exception of the new Dr. Strange, and played all a number of times.   I must say, the diversity of challenges and overall feel of the different tables is truly incredible.  Some flipper and ball action is lightning fast on newer tables, while others are true to their original old-school roots; those found in the Zen Classics Pack play slower and more subdued; you can almost feel the bulk of the flippers, with less flashy play and heavier movement.  Be it the 3D environments of the Star Wars or Marvel tables, the minimalism of V12, El Dorado or Mars, the flash of Ms. Splosion or the charm of Epic Quest and Earth Defense, there is something for everyone here.   IMHO, V12 and Tesla are the hardest to score points on; V12 has a rather brutal left lane gap that is an unholy drain of the worst order.  But for either a quick pick-up game or lengthy marathon, you can't go wrong with this re-imagining of an arcade staple.  You have your choice of 360 controller support (which is quite responsive) or keyboard bashing.  And the community score leaders and Pinball Wizard status allows you to not only challenge friends, but challenge yourself to reach the pinnacle of others playing a particular table.  Superb overview of achievements and table layouts compliment your quest, and you will find yourself unlocking new challenges at every turn. Highly recommended.			"

												TL;DR: Feels great because the sound design is amazing, the controls are snappy and the ball physics are spot on. Comes free with one good table but all others cost money (about £2 for single tables, £7 for the bundles). Has well integrated worldwide and friends leaderboards to extend that further. Overall, outstanding - controller recommended.Full:It's good at introducing new players:This game really is something special. The tables all come with guides telling you what to do, you can choose between camera angles until you get something that feels comfortable and you can pan your camera around the table at any point to see what joins to what and where everything is making it an excellent game for newcomers like myself. There are even options to change different things about each table to make the game easier or harder as you see fit (though that does disqualify the results of altered games from the leaderboards).It feels really good:The balls handle really well (hehehe) and feel really realistic (hehehe) and feels really awesome if you use an Xbox controller (With the triggers acting as the flippers - which is the default control scheme) which the game can detect quickly without having to restart. This is down - I think - to how responsive the controls are and the really good sound design assisted by the care put into making almost everything seem like it's actually part of a physical pinball table.The pricing is surprisingly fair:All this on top of the game itself being free. It only comes with one table to begin with but it's a fun table which shows off all the crazy things the tables can do (Minigames away from the table, minigames on the table, animatronic things, etc.) as well as showing off just how responsive the game feels. All the other tables do cost but the prices are low (<£3 for each table, £7 for bundles of 4) and I've found that each can keep me engaged for large swathes of time - even more so when switching between them.

Before this game, I thought I understood pinball, but I didn't really, I was just flipping the flippers defensively, trying to make sure the ball didn't fall out of play.

												This game is surprisingly good. Each of the pinball tables has features that are significantly deeper than you would expect. At its heart it is 'just' pinballl but each table has its own set of mini games and mechanics...so much so that it actually becomes a bit of a puzzle game, you could quite easily put a couple of hours into a single table and see some stuff that you might not have seen before.If you have a spare moment then give it a go...it is free to download and now comes with a decent free table (so you can compete on the leaderboards with people on your friends list) and you can also try any of the other tables in the game as trials.

												This is a review for the Star Wars: Balance of the Force PackThough I’m not a huge Star Wars fan, the films and games have always been a part of my life, and I’ve always appreciated them in the same way one might appreciate anything good, like ice cream, or water slides. These pinball tables, created by Zen Studios, make the best use of the Star Wars license that I’ve ever seen. The touch and feel, the music, the sounds, the reproduced dialogue spoken by sound-alike voice actors, everything is on point. I’m surprised that more people on my friends list don’t play this.Pinball FX 2 has quite a few incredible Star Wars themed tables, but I wanted to highlight this pack, because I feel it is among the best. The Star Wars, Episode VI: Return of the Jedi Table draws out all of the best scenes from the films, had incredible character models, awesome game modes, and multi-ball. There is a speeder bike mini-game which is a blast. The Darth Vader Tribute table brings together scenes from all the films, beginning with an optimal story mode of Vader’s assembly and the infamous “No!” The table is really well-designed and polished, and has a trench battle mini-game where you finally get to play as one of cinema’s greatest villains. Last but not least, the Starfighter Assault table is an astonishing achievement. I can imagine someone trying to create a dual pinball table and failing miserably, but here it works so well. It gives me nostalgia for long afternoons spent playing X-wing on the PC as a teen. You can choose to align with the Empire or the Rebels, and each mode is different enough to make it worth it to play again with the opposing faction. These tables should be in your library, even if you aren’t the biggest Star Wars fan.  "

												It's been a long time since I've seen a really good pinball video game.  Pinball FX2 pushes all the right buttons, bringing me back to when I used to play Epic Pinball on my 486 machine 20 years ago.  It fully supports both keyboard and gamepad control and both work very well.  My only gripe with controls is that manual control over the plunger is very difficult to use and only seems to utilize less than half of a thumbstick's range.The main strength of this game is the table design.  Since all the tables are original, they aren't constrained by the laws of physics or physical design limitations like real tables are.  It allows the tables to all have their own unique feel and utilize game mechanics that are only possible here.  Unfortunately this brings with it some wonky ball physics in some places, mostly from balls rolling back down ramps though I believe this was done on purpose to avoid straight gutter balls.The game utilizes global and friend leaderboards as well as having 2 achievements per table to add to replayability.  It's great fun beating your friends' scores and hunting down the achievements, some of which are extremely difficult.On the downside, some of the tables have some minor performance problems such as stuttering when transitioning between the main table and a sub-table for a minigame.  Some people also experience input lag though I believe it is pretty rare.  Overall, the graphics are fantastic and it runs very smoothly so it's easy to ignore the sporadic problems.  A bigger issue for me is that the character banter on some of the tables (especially the licensed ones) can get quite tiring.  There does not seem to be any way to disable it without turning off the sound completely.Some people may also be put off by having to buy tables separately.  They come in packs of 3-4 for $10 or single tables for $3 which seems pretty reasonable to me.  On sale, it's a bargain.  In addition, you can demo any table for a couple minutes before you buy to see if you like it before spending any money.  The game also has one free table that everyone can enjoy.If you like pinball, this is the game for you.			"

												It's a damn shame u only start with one free table, but in saying that, you will not be disappointed if you bought some :D Great pinball game, great physics, fantastic sound and graphics and exciting gameplay... Great for those that grew up in the 80's and 90's... and spent all their pocket money at timezone... Most of today's generation are too stupid to appreciate pinball and other coin-ops... stuff em, they can have their Magic, Yu-Ghi-Oh and Poke-YoMum cards...

												I tried this initially as a curiosity, and now own all tables, and buy any new ones as they come out. This from a guy who's Father bought a Pinball Machine back in the day, had it at home. It truly brings Pinball into the computer age in stunningly impressive fashion, takes it to the next level and beyond. There isn't just scoring opportunity, there are layers, and many of them, and throught time you find the secrets to higher scoring, you can compete with friends or with the world, there's even Guides for the specific games, and beyond that it enhances fans of Marvel Comics, or Star Wars, and the latest one (as of this writing) with Soccer is an absolute blast, and I know nothing about soccer. Pinball FX2 is a gift that keeps on giving. Their most major competition, 'Pinball Arcade' is also good, and as they bring old school machines into your Steam, Pinball FX2 is the new school, and even ahead of its time. You simply can't go wrong with either, but this one dazzles...and dazzles layer by layer of accomplishments, scoring, competion, graphics and the one word to describe it all...FUN. Absolutely worth it.			"

												Pinball FX2 is definantly an interesting game on steam that has the label of being free, with that said only one of the countless tables, the sorcerers lair, is actually free, the the rest must be purchased with an average of about $2 per tableWith that being said I personnally think this is great, the way I see it for one play on a real pinball table is about 50 cents, so if you play one table that you buy at least 4 times you have got your moneys worth, the rest is essentially BonusNow on to the gameplay, the tables are complicated and despite each one having a guide you will just have to play them to learn them which I think is part of the fun, especially when you learn how to hit jackpots consistantly, you control the flippers, and can even shake the table as if it were a real machine, and it will warn you not to do itThe only real complaint I have for the gameplay is that with a real pinball machine if you hit the flipper button harder it will flip harder, however you can't really emulate that on a keyboard, this isn't necesarrily the games fault it just is a problemNow as far as the tables go, I personnally have played almost all of them across all platforms, and will say they are for the most part great across the board, there are some exceptions like Deadpool table and Civil War table which seem too random, which is a shame because I love the source materialThe tables are all unique they are not just cosmetically different from each other and each has thier own set of objectives and goals, most even have minigames to be played which is a nice change of pace sometimesOverall I would say that Pinball FX2 is the best way of playing pinball out there short of going to an arcade and playing real pinball tables, do not let the appearance of pay to play stop you from buying a table, because you will definintly get your moneys worth			"

												If you want to be serious about playing this game, you will have to fork over some $$ to play. While it says it's lets you try each board, it's for an EXTREMELY short amount of time. It's so quick that you won't be able to finish a game before it says your time is up. If you're interested in learning to play pinball, I recommend this game. I love the Star Wars Empire Strikes Back board. I recommend getting at least it and maybe another SW board.			"

												The two biggest video pinball games on Steam are Pinball Arcade and this game. Both have similar revenue models (free with paid tables) and both offer dynamic viewpoints for optimal play. But while Pinball Arcade's legacy tables are nice, I would have to say Pinball FX2 is a superior product. It's not just the Marvel and Star Wars licensed tables (though they certainly help) but I feel Pinball FX2 definitely takes advantage of the fact that it is a video game and therefore its tables can do things that are incredibly difficult if not impossible on a real table (including mechanics and animated models) while still keeping realistic pinball physics. Pinball FX2 does not insult customers by offering ""professional"" versions of tables. All tables feature operator menus and certain tables feature special balls (The Avengers table in fact makes it a gameplay mechanic). Besides Star Wars and Marvel, Pinball FX2 offers many tables that are a joy to play and very engaging. The Super League Football table in particular has become a table I am incredibly fond of. And lest not forget there is a free table in the form of Sorcerer’s Lair which is nothing to sneeze at. It's just as fun and of good quality as any of the paid tables.For me, personally apart from the quality of the product, one of the biggest draws that encourages me to keep playing is the native integration with Steamworks so that all of your friends' high scores for any give table are automatically displayed in game. Thus it becomes a game in itself to see if you can best your friends' high scores.Overall this is a wonderful product if you enjoy pinball. I don't want to say its ""better"" than Pinball Arcade due to the different roles they fill, but it definitely has a much better pricing model. Must play.			"

												Absolutely stunning graphics, fabulous physics and challenging design makes the Pinball FX2 series a must-have for arcade pinball enthusiasts.  I have purchased all the tables with the exception of the new Dr. Strange, and played all a number of times.   I must say, the diversity of challenges and overall feel of the different tables is truly incredible.  Some flipper and ball action is lightning fast on newer tables, while others are true to their original old-school roots; those found in the Zen Classics Pack play slower and more subdued; you can almost feel the bulk of the flippers, with less flashy play and heavier movement.  Be it the 3D environments of the Star Wars or Marvel tables, the minimalism of V12, El Dorado or Mars, the flash of Ms. Splosion or the charm of Epic Quest and Earth Defense, there is something for everyone here.   IMHO, V12 and Tesla are the hardest to score points on; V12 has a rather brutal left lane gap that is an unholy drain of the worst order.  But for either a quick pick-up game or lengthy marathon, you can't go wrong with this re-imagining of an arcade staple.  You have your choice of 360 controller support (which is quite responsive) or keyboard bashing.  And the community score leaders and Pinball Wizard status allows you to not only challenge friends, but challenge yourself to reach the pinnacle of others playing a particular table.  Superb overview of achievements and table layouts compliment your quest, and you will find yourself unlocking new challenges at every turn. Highly recommended.			"

												TL;DR: Feels great because the sound design is amazing, the controls are snappy and the ball physics are spot on. Comes free with one good table but all others cost money (about £2 for single tables, £7 for the bundles). Has well integrated worldwide and friends leaderboards to extend that further. Overall, outstanding - controller recommended.Full:It's good at introducing new players:This game really is something special. The tables all come with guides telling you what to do, you can choose between camera angles until you get something that feels comfortable and you can pan your camera around the table at any point to see what joins to what and where everything is making it an excellent game for newcomers like myself. There are even options to change different things about each table to make the game easier or harder as you see fit (though that does disqualify the results of altered games from the leaderboards).It feels really good:The balls handle really well (hehehe) and feel really realistic (hehehe) and feels really awesome if you use an Xbox controller (With the triggers acting as the flippers - which is the default control scheme) which the game can detect quickly without having to restart. This is down - I think - to how responsive the controls are and the really good sound design assisted by the care put into making almost everything seem like it's actually part of a physical pinball table.The pricing is surprisingly fair:All this on top of the game itself being free. It only comes with one table to begin with but it's a fun table which shows off all the crazy things the tables can do (Minigames away from the table, minigames on the table, animatronic things, etc.) as well as showing off just how responsive the game feels. All the other tables do cost but the prices are low (<£3 for each table, £7 for bundles of 4) and I've found that each can keep me engaged for large swathes of time - even more so when switching between them.

												Pinball FX2 Review - Raymond KTLet me make this abundantly clear, Pinball FX 2 is definitely a PC game that should be experienced by all gamers out there, from the hard-core pinball fanatic to the casual pinball player alike. Pinball FX2 is the best, I said the best pinball game *(virtually) that I’ve ever played! The game is free to play with one table included. You can try the other tables out for a limited score. You can buy the other tables individually or as bundles. I just bought most of the tables from a humble bundle deal where you pay what you want. Those complaining about micro-transactions have no ground to stand on because the game is free to play. Even for a relative pinball novice like me, Pinball FX2 has a lot to offer. The feel of real pinball is here, in a game that takes full advantage of its freedom from physical restraints.Pinball FX 2 isn't a game so much as it's a platform on which to purchase, download, and play games. The games in question are different pinball tables, and at launch there are no fewer than 13 of them available. It's a good selection, and what all of the tables have in common is that they look and sound great, they behave realistically, and they get a little better every time another of your friends shows up on the robust leaderboard system. Pinball FX 2 is free to download, while tables are reasonably priced at 800 points for packs of four and 200 points each for those that are available to purchase individually. If you enjoy pinball, downloading Pinball FX 2 is a no-brainer. – Game spotYou certainly don't need to be a pinball wizard to have fun with Pinball FX 2, or even to rack up some respectable scores. Some of the tables are quite challenging, though, and a couple of them can be frustrating if you have trouble making specific shots that they demand of you. On the flip side, other tables are easy enough that you can score millions and hit plenty of cool-looking rails without having to try too hard. "

												( TL;DR Just play the free table and stick with it or buy one or two more if you like their trials enough ^_^ )FULL FEATURED FREE TABLE included with the core download so I just have to recommend everyone to try this out. It is one of the best of Pinball FX2 so that is definitely much more than just a demo. (Played it for 3 hours so far.) Also all other tables have time limited trials so it's pretty fun to try them out too.Pinball FX2 is arguably the best digital pinball game you'll ever play. Finally there's game competing what Pro-Pinball gave a near perfect example in the late 90's. None of these tables are bad but with current selection of themes (what Steam version currently supports) are still 52% Marvel Comics. 14 tables with other themes are still unreleased on this platform but I bet they are coming eventually.It's also fair to mention that each table stays in development from 6-9 months which definitely justifies that $3€ price tag but you don't really need more than the free one and maybe an additional table to start with. (This version finally supports vertical view for those weirdos who actually own a tiltable screen for some reason =P)			"

Fifa - NOPE Rugby game : NOPE Don Bradman Cricket 2014: HELL NO Peggle: Maybe Miniclip 8 Ball Pool: JEEZ NOSo yeah it's the roundest ball. There's loads of tables themed on different things. The Star Wars tables are based on that famous scene where Boba Fett tries to shoot a tiny ball with a laser. But that was in the bad trilogy of Star Wars films so you probably don't remember it. There's a competent high score system and I don't understand where I'm getting all the points from. Only problem is I haven't played Pinball FX1 so I don't have any idea about the plot. But this is a good game and I'd start here for pinball fun on the computer gaming system.			"

												If you grew up with Pinball in real life like me this is a must have! If you never played pinball, try the free table and see if you like it. It takes the classic Pinball and makes it a Digital Pinball fest. The things that happen on the tables would be imposible to recreate in real life but it's so much fun to play. Finding some friends to compete in leaderboards is also fun and makes me keep coming back for that perfect score, :).			"

												I simply am not aware of a better pinball simulator.  Zen Studios has made a very solid-playing pinball game, and has the best licensing to boot.  Sure, it's a bit of a downer that you can't unlock more tables without paying for them, as the number of free tables you get to start with is pretty small.  However, the tables are of very high production quality, and CAN be had for relatively cheap if you're patient enough to wait for them to go on sale.  Either way, the value is there.The replay value speaks for itself, and while you may eventually reach your limit for how much pinball you can handle in one sitting, with them CONSTANTLY adding new content you'll likely never get bored of playing Pinball FX2.  If you can, hook this up to your big sceen tv at your next party.  I guarantee it will be a hit.Now if only they would go and get the rights to and do remakes of all those old Bally-Midway pinball games from the 70's 80's and 90's...			"

												Pinball FX 2 offers over 50 tables, which is huge! Most are good tables where the physics of the ball is very realistic with the rest of the board. The sound is also very nice. There are often plenty of missions per tray to do and it is often fun and enjoyable to play. PFX2 does not have too many bugs (but I have discovered some of them all the same). Graphically it's very beautiful too. It just lacks the ability to compete online tournaments with players from around the world. This is the big black point of the game if I had to give one (because finding everything perfect would be amazing anyway). However this is a very good game of pinball that I recommend. And then 3 € per table can seem a lot if you want them all, but do not forget that it's only 3 € where with a real pinball machine it was about 1 € per game! So buy Pinball FX 2!			"

												EULA is a joke.  They want you to pay for something without giving you any rights for what you buy.  They can take it away at any time they choose and you will not be entitled to a refund.  They want you to allow them to monitor you and collect data about you that they can then sell to others anywhere in the world.  Then they also want you to give them ownership of all content that you create and they can use, sell, or make money from your content and you will not be entitled to anything.  Zen can go choke on a donkey |}ick and the owners deserve to rot and burn in Hell.  It is a shame that some people allow their self to become so evil and greedy.  I like money just like everyone else but these clowns must not care about anything other than money.  Well they will not get any of mine.As far as the game goes, it is hit and miss.   There are a few good tables, several decent tables, and the rest are crap.  When you preview a table they do not even let you play a full game.  The trial is on a timer and that timer ends before you even get a good grasp of what the table has to offer.			"

												this game is ridiculously good....ive NEVER come across a pinball video game that feels as close to playing a realt table as this does....the graphics, the sounds, and most of all the physics....the ball responds exactly how you would expect a real pinball to respond....the only way it could come any closer is if there was a controller that was a box with two buttons on the sides for the flippers, a spring handle for launching the ball and motion support to smack it around for tilting....also, the online leaderboards are cool....i have a lot of fun trying to beat peoples scores...it also has a free table you can play all you want...so if youre curious even in the least about this game, download it and try the free table...i guarantee you that if you ever liked playing pinball machines at any point in your life, that youll be dishing out some cash for more tables....10/10 for sure...

The most recent tables are really starting to push the boundaries of pinball and yet it's done with obvious respect for the core mechanics of pinball.I love both. Many of you will too.

												I think it's about time to share a few words about this game with people that might be looking for a reason to give this a try.Well I certainly hope that you know what pinball is. Even if you never came in contact with the real thing you probably played the old pinball on Windows XP or at least heard about it right? No? WELL WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE THAN? Real pinball works on a basic principle. You throw in a quarter and it usually gives you 3 balls to play with.You are trying to not let the ball drain with your flippers while getting a score for anything you do. Once all your balls are lost, the game ends and you take place on the leaderboards. Sounds simple and it can be, depends how you look at it and what table are you playing.Which brings us to this electronic pinball game. It's not going to ask you for quarters to play! In fact, it's like you have your own pinball machine at home where you just push start and you are given free balls to play with. But this thing is not going to cost you hundreds up to thousands of dollars and it's not going to take up a big space. This game will only take up space on your HDD and each table will cost you 2.99€ or your regional equivalent.There's one free table for you to play with and every other table you can just try for free. The free table in question is Sorcerer's Lair and it's alot of fun! You'll find many hours of enjoyement on this free table alone and it will give you a good idea about how the game works and if it suits you.The physics are very real, if it could be any closer to its real counterpart, it would be just scary. The speed might seem to be a bit too high but there are many realy tables that are even faster. This is still very fair but will make damn sure to test your fast hands out. Your ball can drain without you knowing what just happened, but that's the way it is. As you play more and more, you will eventually get better too.If you are by a chance a fan of MARVEL or Star Wars, you are going to be happy as there are many tables in these themes. At the time of writing this there are 2 South Park tables, a Walking Dead table (based on the first game by telltale games), a plants vs. zombies table and many original design tables for you to choose from. Some are easy, some are hard, some are not worth getting as much as the others. But they are all quality products and you can really see that alot of hard work went into all of them. And as I said, you can ""try before you buy"" so you won't have to blindly buy into things you might not like in the end.The community is really friendly and if you find yourself playing pinball FX2 alot, you might want to go check out an amazing steam group by the name of ""Pinball Family"" and ask for an invite. We are competing there each week on a different table, players of all skills!All in all: if you are looking for a quallity electronic pinball, don't look any further, you found it! It's not going to cost you a fortune to play any table you'd like. The tables behave like the real thing and are filled with eye candy in form of 3D models that you wouldn't find on real tables... At least for now, once holograms are going to be a normal daily thing, you might find some 3D animated models in real pinball tables.			"

												A kids game. Avoid.Nowhere close to a real pinball experience. A game(not a simulation) in every sense of the word. Anyone who has played a real machine and expects the same from this ""game"" will be disappointed. From poor flipper response and unrealistic physics this is just about selling DLC in the form of tables. If the tables were true thats one thing but its just a merchandising effort, plain and simple.I'm guessing the reviewers have never grown up playing actual pinball tables and the reviews show it.Play the free tables, see how poorly the flippers react and the general physics are then spend a few hundred and buy your own table. I did and i'd rather play one real table than spend the same amount playing 50 awful tables with average physics and no soul.Saving your game also ruins the experience of an already sold out game. Save your cash.			"

It's a delay that you have to train yourself for, and will likely affect your performance in other games.   I thought this glitch might be a design feature, but it is far too annoying to be such.

												I usualy dont play pinball and to be honest I am not biggest fan of sames. But this Pinball FX2 is reallllly worth checking out. Tables are waried, all have diffrent events on them happening (they are not all just one view on table and two-thre bumper) I mean on Star Wars tables I had X-wing and Tie fighter combat in the game of pinball... (choosed tie fighter of course) Graphics are great and colourfoll and really is fun to play.Originaly their pay-by-table model did set me off but prices of tables are not that big (3 or 5 or 10 euros) and on one tabel you can get A LOT diffrent events happenin.Music is great and this game is really worth your time.I see lots of people giving negative review cause of recent highscore reset, I myself play pinball to relax I dont give damn for highscores and I see lots of them not playing this game not even hour, in my opinion if you wanna properly review a video game you need to play that game more then one hour.Anyway if you wanna play good pinball trust me this is game for you!

												This is a brilliant collection of 23  pinball tables  sold in six  separate packs (the Star Wars pack  has 3, the rest four tables each).  These are the  most beautiful tables I've ever played.  They almost feel like playing on a real table, the graphics are so good.  You can compare your high scores for each table with your friends, and  the accumulated high scores for each table   also place you on a separate   score table.Ball physics is as good as it gets.  I do feel some of the tables lack the ability  to play skill shots,  they re more  about lucky than anything, but other tables compensate for  that.  If you like pinball games I recommend you don't wait till the sales and get them now.  I thought at first   the  full cost was prohibitive, but when you consider you are getting 23 tables,  it's actually a steal as each table works out at less than £1.40 each (approx $2)			"

												I love Pinball FX2. It's the best pinball game I have ever played and most tables fall somewhere between ""really good"" and ""awesome"" for me. I like that you can purchase only the tables you want (one of the only games in existence, where I think the DLC model makes a lot of sense). So if you are a fan of for example Star Wars, get one or two of the packs and have HOURS of fun with the tables. You like South Park? Get the two South Park tables... Honestly if you like the subject of a table you can hardly go wrong. And even tables based on stuff I didn't know before or didn't care for are almost all really enjoyable.The only issue I had with it was the very long play times that could be achieved with reliable bang backs, that not only made the game a touch too hard, but were also required to master, if you wanted to have higher scores. But they changed that and now I am enjoying it just a touch more than before. ^^So if you have only the faintest interest in video game pinball (and/or have played classics like Pro Pinball - Timeshock) do yourself a favor: stop reading here and try it.For the rest, that want my opinion on why the latest reviews seem so negative read on:The above mentioned ""Bang-Back-Issue"" is apparently a great source of anger in the forums and I don't really understand why it has to necessarily affect reviews of the game. I have watched a great deal of videos to get better at the game, but on some tables in particular it just seemed that the best score is achieved with a lot of dexterity playing the same shots over and over, while essentially having unlimited playtime, due to being able to really 100% bang back the ball. I didn't mind too much, since I personally could not do it all of the time so my playtime was in fact limited, but on the other hand did I not have any ambition to play for global high scores and when my friends lost intrest there was nobody to realistically beat anymore. xD I feel with the new changes and a bit of practice it would not be out of the question to reach maybe some High Scores (but time will tell ;P)Haven't heard of the unfair EULA thing that seems to be discussed here. It might be important to know and maybe it's not the best practice to change it after such a long time, but on the other hand they almost certainly reserved the right to change it and it doesn't change the fact, that the game is excellent. I just despise people playing something for like 500 hours and then ""changing their opinion"" to ""not recommended""... New technical issues arrising or the game suddenly not working on the newest Windows 11 I could understand.Also: get off your high horses with the developer ""not listening to the community"". First of all, I am pretty sure they do read a lot of the stuff that gets posted, second: just because YOU think an issue is present doesn't mean everybody else would be okay with the change or lack thereof (regarding the nudge debate). In the end it is the developers choice and if they want to reset the High Scores and change some internals, then they are going to do it. PERIODYou have the choice to not buy future tables and just enjoy everything you have purchased thus far.			"

												Just simply the best video pinball game I have ever played. But what is even better are the DLC tables. The tables are original and well designed and just great fun to play. I am terrible at both real and video pinball, but it really doesn't matter, the games are just good fun. I must have played over 30 real pinball tables at Play Expo Manchester 2015 and I didn't really enjoy playing a lot of them. The ball speed and flipper response just didn't feel smooth and natural, I can't explain why.  Or the tables seemed boring. Great art but no substance. Playing this game with the xbox controller feels great, very natural and responsive. And the tables designs are just really up there with the best of the real pinball tables.

												EDIT:I am changing my review to a positive one after numerous concerns regarding user privacy were addressed by ZEN and Steam-specific EULA was created (and being implemented as of Aug 2015), clarifying ZEN's policy on type of user data collected and/or shared with Microsoft.That said, the game itself functions like a collection of pinball tables, thematically divided into anything from Star Wars to legend of Excalibur. Though all tables are vastly different in terms of level design, difficulty and feel, all tables feature outstanding music and/or voice acting, tight controls and outstanding visuals (though somewhat problematic camera view).All in all, recommended to lovers of pinballs (both the physical and digital varieties).

												Absolutely great. Yes, you have to pay for tables; no, it's no more than you'd spend at an arcade if you really enjoy pinball. Meh. Do you need ALL the tables? --then this probably isn't for you. Do you want a few tables? --get some and game on :D You can also try every table for free (though it stops tracking your score after the time/score limits are reached.			"

												The people who are complaingin about the EULA agreement have not read it.   There is nothing out of the ordinary compared to ANY other EULA argeement on any game they have purchased in the last 10 years.   These detractors are spreading  misinformation based on ignorance.Zen IS NOT, and COULD NOT ""mine"" your PC for ""passwords"" or your ""e-mails"" to gather information about your friends or proclivities.  That's an absurd claim without basis along with any ""malware"" accusations.   I'm sure every one of these people carry an Apple or Android controlled phone that DOES do these things, yet they are happy to comply. Nothing in the Zen agreement comes even close to these claims.    Zen's EULA pertains to ONLY the information about the use of the game off and online as well as any info you have chosen to share with them pertaining your account at Zen ( i.e., high scores or messages sent to other users using their service)   If you have not told them, or sent a message through their service, about the only thing they can know about you are the licenses you own and how long you've played each table and what your scores are.    Anyone claiming otherwise has not actually READ the agreement - or probably any other EULA agreements.    If Highscore erasure from time to time is a complete dealbreaker, then I guess you have a claim to be mad.  Why not just buck up and play again to see how good you still are?   Most erasures are a result of cheating and the scores are cleared to make the charts fair to all those who don't play unfairly.  High scores aret commandments written in stone.It's a game, for crying out loud - in the 80's, sometimes the macine got unplugged and your high score got erased.  Oh well, we didn't go crying home to momma that my life accomplishment was erased from history.   For the price of a hamburger, you are getting a highly polished, physically realistic pinball simulation that is lightyears ahead of almost any other video pinball game ever made.  Keep things in perspective and enjoy it for what it is:  a tremedous amount of entertainment value, with a high production value, with great detail and crafted with great care -  for a pittance.			"

												Pinball FX2 has a great sense of direction.  It is taking the modern age of computer graphics and incorporating new and refreshing tables for pinball enthuisits that no longer have the arcades in their hometown anymore.  The sound effects resonate like the original pinball machines and the feel is pretty accurate.  It comes with 1 free table you can play endlessly and there are a ton of extra tables you can get as downloadable content.  I recommend picking up your table of choices when they are on sale as the price point otherwise seems a bit steep.   Here is my review of the product.  Have a great day gaming!

												I love pinball and fx2 is fantastic.  I wish I could say same for your website.  It lacks order, so much so It's unusable for me.  I'm dislexic.   I've reached a point fx pinball where I can't improve my score because I don't understand how to play the tables.  I wish your website was better, but I doubt that you will do anything to fix it.drd.crabb41@gmail.com "

												The Venom table came out recently. Just got it tonight. It looks cool and it's challenging. It's another great table of MANY great tables that have come out this year.Hey developers!!!!!!! How about a Batman '66 table?-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is BY FAR the best pinball game out there. The variety of tables is great. The other pinball game is very expensive....and, frankly, these tables feel modern. I like that. This is the game I always come back to. Maybe it's because it's playable and there's an opportunity to feel like you can get good at it. A lot of games seem impossible. Some people love that kind of challenge....getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off....throwing the controller across the room.....smashing the keyboard in frustration. I prefer to feel like I have a chance.....that there's a light at the end of the tunnel..and even if it's a train.....I can press ""d"" or ""a"", or shift left or right with my controller, and get out of the way. Too many games feel like they aren't very inviting to the casual player. This game isn't that at all. You can have fun.....and if you want to compete.....you can try to beat the best scores (Are those scores real? They seem a bit over the top to me)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------edit:The Star Wars tables are mostly great, Spiderman table is glitchy for some reason.....the other Marvel tables are mostly cool. The newer ones are better. South Park Tables rock (didn't expect that). Deadpool is very hard (and the animations are a bit much). The Walking Dead table is GREAT.I can't really compain about much because this is the game I keep coming back to. I play a table or two almost every day ....just to wind down . -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------My ONE serious complaint is that you get no credit for buying these tables (on  at least one other platform?) You could get a game code you could use once. It seems fair to me.			"

												picked this up late 2014 in a humble bundle with lots of Star Wars and lots of Marvel tables, plus several others. was a big fan of pinball when i was young (early to late 80's) and remembered liking the one included with Windows forever ago. PROStables feel solid, very much realistic in their physics; can feel almost just as satisfying as any table i used to play IRL. i think they have done a good job balancing the fact that you can overcome physical limitations with keeping the play very much realistic in a physical sense, for the most part. the tables seem to cover most of the common pinball tropes that i recall; as well as having some devices of their own that can be seen to resonate through various parts of the collection.also, in general, i think they've done a good job of keeping the challenge level to a similar level you would find on real pinball tables; a few of the tables feel a bit overly-inclined to take you to the drain down the side slots, or to throw the ball in the dead center of the flippers; but most have a decently long 'grace period' in which the ball is auto-relaunched if you end up draining quickly after launch. also, the competitive part of the system is interesting; there are theoretically tournaments from time to time; but it's got good tracking of your ranking compared to your friends, with the stats being accessible easily, and a little trophy on the icon for each table for which you've got top score among your friends. the menu UI is fairly intuitive and i have no real complaints in that department; it's not terribly inspired, but it's not a PITA either.CONSthe flippers seem to only be available (i could have missed something somewhere) as ""left flipper""/""right flipper"" control mapping, which can be a real pain on a few of the tables where this means you're constantly banging the ball into a flipper that should be on a separate button, or on an inverted control scheme. (e.g. an upper set of flippers mapped backwards.) mostly, though, this hasn't been a huge issue, but it's definitely a constant annoyance, and it's one difference from most real pinball tables and also at least one other pinball game i've played, 'Pinball Arcade'. also, either the game or the tables seem to be poorly optimized; i get more frame-rate issues and the like on this than i do on the majority of immersive 3D games i play; and i have played another pinball title (Pinball Arcade, focused on emulating actual tables rather than creating new ones) which has no issues at all on my machine.  if you have such issues, you'll need to figure out how to enable triple buffering for your machine, which can be a hassle.still, well worth the effort IMO; but c'mon Zen! the game has been out there for a long time now, and IMO there's no reason at all not to be able to fix these problems; at least using the known solution that seems to fix the issues on most systems. why not just spend the few days/weeks of developer time to at least enable that much of a fix on the majority of the systems that having the issue rather than leaving your customers, some of whom are going to be far from technical, to have to find and implement what can be a quirky PITA solution? and for that matter, you ought to be optimizing this thing so it sings; it's very disappointing, after having seen what was perfectly acceptable performance for a pinball game way back—on a Pentium with a PCI video card—to be left with the feeling that the game is at least moderately sluggish in some cases. and, yes, i know it's more complex than that, but the point is that this really isn't rocket science here, guys, and optimizing the engine should have been a top priority.SUMMARYif you like pinball in one form or another, and especially if you like the themes of the tables offered, this is a good game to have; for the number of hours of entertainment, seems hard to go wrong here. if you hit it at the appropriate time you can even get it for practically a steal; and i'm assuming more sales will be on in the future. generally this seems like a good one to go for if you are just looking for the pinball feel, and think you would enjoy the themes for which you can get tables...if you are an oldskool pinball enthusiast, however, i would recommend checking out ""Pinball Arcade"" before FX2: it has emulations of many *real* tables, and can be a relatively fair price if you buy the Season packs rather than individual tables. i certainly can't afford it, but if thats the kind of experience you're looking for you're not likely to find a better deal. (or any other deal at all that i'm aware of!)			"

												This game reminds me of my golden amiga days spending my youth playing ""Pinball Dreams"", ""Pinball Illusions"", ""Slamtilt"" and the like.The only thing not so good about this game is that there is no scrolling when played in horizontal screen orientation BUT you can switch it to a 90 degree rotated screen display so the whole table is displayed on your screen at once and now that's a very neat feature after all. Of course you have to rotate your display too to play it properly in this scenario for best gaming experience ... ;)What annoys me a little is that the position of the flipper table's LCDs can't be fixed to the full width bottom or top of the screen like in good old amiga pinball games. Having this feature built in it would make it to the best modern pinball game known to me today (still filing ""Slamtilt"" under modern I must assume at this point ... ;).I totally recommend this game to you.Go buy it now! Presumably when it's on discount !!!(At the moment I'm writing this review you will get one table for free what makes it a really good offer even more than it is normally. What more can a true pinball addict ask for?)			"

												It's one of the best pinball games.  What else can I say?No really!  The physics are great, the animation is perfect, and the store front to buy additional table do not feel like a ripoff.  The audio cues are stimulating, and the presentation are both retro and futuristic, without being over the top or cheap.At the very least, you can try the free table and be content with it.  There is nothing to lose.As for the paying tables... well, you will have to try their individual demos, because each of them deserve their own reviews.  Thankfully, none of them feels amateurish.  The people behind this definitely are craftsmen.			"

												Since the 90s, EPIC Pinball was the ultimate pinball video game choice. With the arrival of Pinball FX on XBOX 360 in 2007, it finally found its match, and 3 years later with Pinball FX 2, it got its successor, a new pinball king.Zen Studios brought into the virtual pinball world, something that we have not seen before. Stellar ideas, ingenious presentation and perfect gameplay. Each table is a masterpiece of its own. So much to do on each of them and so much going on. Enriched with beautiful musical scores, great sound effects and animated 3D characters jumping around the tables.If you take a few minutes away from the action, and hold the camera button while moving the mouse around, you can look at all the details and love that was put in every square inch of every table and also of the surronding area where the tables are standing. I love and play every single table that was made, except 1, Extreme, which is not present in Steam version anyway.With so many tables present, with new ones coming all the time, you really cannot get bored, because when you make the whole circle through all the tables, the inital ones will feel so new and fresh again, you are ready for another tour, and another,.....Whatever the system, you're playing on, Zen Studios' pinball game is deffinitely the one you should not stay without.EDIT: 2 years laterNew tables keep on coming. Plenty of new ones for Marvel and Star Wars fans, but, which I appreciate most, several new original tables, conceived and designed entirely from scratch by Zen Studios. As much as I love the license based ones (Can't wait to get my hands on Aliens vs Predator tables. Hopefully I'll be able to get them during Summer Sale 2017), I am most excited by completely original tables. Understandably there are more of the linensed ones, but for the same reason, each new original feels that more special. If you look back we got scenarios like, fending off alien invasion, Don Quixote-like knight adventure to save a damzel, Indiana Jones-like quest for prescious artifacts, sneaking into wizards lair, mission to Mars, Roman conquests, exploration of the great ocean abyss,... And more recently we received a wild west cowboy adventure and got to play an actual football (soccer) match on a pinball table (Unfortunatelly, licenses for the European football teams have expired and are no longer available. But, the fictious Zen Football Team should be back as soon as possible, so you will still have the chance to buy it.).With the most recent Star Wars, Aliens and Marvel releases, hopefully a new original should be right around the corner.All I can do is recommend this game even more. I've been playing Zen Studios' pinball's, for around 8 years I guess, across 4 systems and I keep wanting more, and more is what I deffinitely get.If you like virtual pinballs you cannot miss out with this one. You have a chance to have a short demo of each and every table in the game, before deciding to pay for it, so no excuse not to give it at least a try.			"

												I like this game. It reminds me of similar games I use to play in the old days; Pinball Fantasies, Pinball Dreams, Epic Pinball, Balls of Steel, etc.I originally wasn't interested in the 'free' table, instead I was drawn to the 'popular culture' themed tables (which I may review individually in the future).What was a nice surprise though, was that the 'free' table is actually quite good fun. It has atleast three different multiball modes and if you are skilled enough you can end up chaining from one multiball mode to the next. The graphics, special effects and ball physics are all well done and each table appears to have alot of different things to do.This game has various leaderboards and scorecharts; even includes comparing your scores with your steam friends.Plus, the game allows you to try out all the tables beforehand so you can see what you think before buying them.

My fav game to try a new keyboard: make it or die!Pros:+ Graphics+ Physics+ HUDGE choice of tables+ Audio effect are quite realistic+ Will make you get a ""good"" keyboardCons: There must be some....- You need to pay for each table and there is a lot so better wait for a sale or a bundle discount- Does ruin your keyboard on the long term :D but there is no pinball without some keyboard slamming!Overall, I do recommend this title for all pinball wizards out there! By the way, that's one table they are definitely missing....Please bring us THE pinball wizard table from the movie, that would be AWSOME!) "

												Virtual pinball at its finest.  What more is there to say except ""It's Pinball?""  If you love pinball, then you'll love this game, and if you love creative tables that can ONLY be found in the virtual world, then you'll absolutely love this game as well.  Some of the tables are hit or miss depending on how you want to look at them, but they're still very fun to play.  If you love pinball, or creative video games, then give this game a shot.  The base game is free, so that's also a plus.This is also one of the few games that does a pay wall right, but you really can't go wrong with pinball.  You only have to buy the DLC IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT A NEW TABLE!  You get to try it for free to see if you like it, and then you can buy it if you like it.  Just like with the Pinball Arcade. "

												Randomly found this game, downloaded it, played for 10 min and was instantly hooked.  Immediately went back and bought 20+ new tables (during Holiday sale), some tables for as low as $1, and packs of 4 for $3.49, incredible value.  Value aside, the game play, physics, visual stimulation are unbelievably outstanding.  I mean, it's so real, plays so much like real pinball, the physics are perfect.  Gameplay and physics aside, the best part about this, is it got my gf and family into it, whereas they would never be into Call of Duty or like Skyrim, they all absoltutely love pinball, everyone loves pinball.  So in that sense, it's a great family game and brings ppl together, it's competitive in a fun way in that you can always get a better score, and it's fun challenging friends and family.  Absolute must buy if you even remotely like pinball.			"

There are both bad and good tables and, from what I've played so far (5 or 6 tables) the name brand ones (star wars and marvel ones) are not nearly as good as the weird original ones (Tesla is pretty cool).  If I recall you can demo the program/tables, so there's that.Right now there are about 30ish tables available, so there's a lot of variety.  On the few I've played so far there hasn't been a lot of skilled play so much as flipper mashing, but that's also true for a lot of boards (I've only played one or two that were actually quite fantastic in real life).Anyway, if you like pinball to an unhealthy degree this might be worth checking out, although there are also pinball emulators out there that have real tables on them, so you might consider that as well.  As a buy?  Not terrible, I guess, but I would investigate the dlc (tables) further before you make a purchase of one.  I was pretty disappointed with the Marvel ones.			"

												I keep coming back to this game over and over. It's compulsively satisfying, and offers new experiences with each board. It's unfortunate that each board or group of boards is a separate purchase. However, if you like the board after a demo, you can absolutely get your money's worth with each board.I've lamented the lack of pinball games in arcades, but this is absolutely satisfying pinball experience that is certainly cheaper in the long run than the quarter eating arcade machines.

												Pinball FX2 is a modern take on the pinball pastime, with fun modern tables and updated graphics its a game most Pinball fans will enjoy. It comes with one free table and lets you try all the other tables free before you buy them. The type of tables you can expect to find in Pinball FX2 are for example, Avengers, X-men, or now even Plants vs Zombies tables. There are a ton more tables though and the game is free so there is no harm seeing for yourself if you like this or not.			"

												The Star Wars tables and Avengers Chronicles tables are the best in my opinion. Of the Star Wars tables, I enjoy the Return of the Jedi table in the Balance of the Force pack the most, but they are all fun. The Avengers table itself is a MUST play. I got the Avengers tables mostly for Infinity Gauntlet, but it is a strange table to play. On the plus side, it has the element of surprise much like the old school tables that sucked quarters in the 80s. You can DEMO all the tables, but there are so many now, you could miss out, so thought I would mention these as ones to check out for sure.Some tables become much more playable when you change the default angles and things, but you can't count those scores. I'd like to see something more done with the community on modding tables, or voting on what they'd like to see changed and competing on that ""community table"" of the month or something.			"

												Really awesome game!Of course for those who like (or love!) the old real pinball tables.The game is extremely well done, the physics, the sound, the look and feel. I can say that, because i play pinball before, at the end of the 80's at the flipperama houses. But i think even people who never play it before can enjoy it.That is a free table to play, and i think it's one of the better. Just try... :)Despite the problems at launch, they manage to fix them all.They put the ""free to play"" label, although at this time Pinball FX had no free tables. A lot of people refuses to buy and a little before they change the label, lastly including the free table. Now the game can be named free to play, but they decided to don't.I really enjoy all tables i bought until now. And worth the full price.			"

												Pinball FX2 is the best pinball simulator that I have ever played. The variety of tables is fantastic and they aren't very expensive, especially if you buy them in packs. You feel like you're playing an actual story on many of the tables. I love the Star Wars and Marvel ones (the Fear Itself table is a true standout...a perfect package of challenge, depth, and a great soundtrack). You can toggle through several different views while playing, including the traditional overhead view in case the 3D views seem too awkward.Download the free game and buy a pack or two during a sale. You won't regret it.			"

												TL;DC: Honestly I'm surprised how much fun this game is. WIth the varity of tables, amazing physics & graphics, and endless replay value, this is one of my top games.My previous experience with this game is a LOT of hours on Xbox, but I just got this on steam so that I could play on my monitor that tilts sideways for a better pinball experience. The key for me to getting a lot of enjoyment from each a table is to learn the rules, tricks and storyline (but don't try to do it all at once) - over time you'll learn to progress the table's story and / or help rack up your points. Eventually you'll master a table and by that point you'll already be addicted. A single 3-ball game can last quite a while once you've mastered a table. If you just aren't into a particular table, move to another. The table demos do a poor job of giving you a feel for how a game will play out over time, but at least you get an idea of the design. I purchased most of my tables based on reviews. A great first board is Epic Quest. A lot of players also love Fear Itself as a good starter table. By starter I don't mean they are ""easy"", it's just these boards are loved by a lot of players. Picking a dud as your first table could ruin your experience.The table designs are mesmerizing. The game play is much deeper than you might imagine. Every time I load up a new board, it feels intimidating, but I try to just focus on passages and taking it step-by-step. I never just read through the entire table guide. I'll learn part of it, master it, and then move on to learn something new. Unlocking a table's secrets on your own is half the fun, and every single table is differnt.I'm truely amazed at the creativity behind each table layout. Some are hareder than others, some more rewarding, some more about story, some about scores, and in the end, everything comes down to just how you play a particular table.			"

SO since those 2 games  are classic/old games this one took their place as my favorite pinball game on todays graphics and animations. Tables are made in nice interactive 3D graphics;  sound, physics and switching table-zones or with some extra taks makes each table unique.  My review is: NICE Work! They worked great on the tables - some are better some are less good. Tables are not that cheap, but in Bundles or on sale, prices are fair. And to mention this:  you can test the game! 1 table is completely free and all others can be tested least 1 ball / a specific and small ammount of gamepoints. So you won't waste your money like so many other games when you are not able to test a game before you buy.Update: since today new tables are integrated.

												This is most probably the best Pinball game out there. Yes these tables are not physically realstic in real-world , but they are still so much fun to play and watch, and most importantly the ball physics itself is excellent.You will sure find a table or two that appeals to you, and could spend the whole time playing them and not asking for more. They keep adding more tables and the collection is getting bigger and better. I like that they let you play each table for couple of minutes to get the feel of it before you buy.Only one thing I really don't like: You can't transfer tables from/to other platforms. I don't see why Zen Studios can't implement a unified system for all platforms. This is probably not a big issue, as I found myself enjoying the game on Xbox and the big TV instead of steam, so that's where I am going to invest in. I just thougt I would give this game a positive review for what it's in general, regardless of which platform you will enjoy playing on.			"

If you are looking to build a digital pinball table it includes an option to set the game to table mode which is really cool.

Sorcerer's Lair is a classic and I also like Pasha and Secrets of the Deep. Star Wars themed tables are very nice. I turned my monitor 90 degrees, connected a PS3 gamepad and tweaked some GPU settings that affected responsiveness, so now I have a really smooth and immersive pinball experience.			"

The hulk table drives me nuts because of all the repeated talking he does, you will find out  its repeated every 2 minutes. Ugh. The hulk table is nice and I did enjoy it minus the voice talking. Earth Defense is a nice table with plenty of space and lots of action and no cheap ball drops. For pinball fans this is a no brainer pick some up and enjoy.			"

												Overall I really like the physics, the ball feels like it has a lot of actual mass to it. Play is smooth and fluid.You can get a couple minutes with each table that you don't own to try it out. Personally I wish you got two whole games per new table, 2 minutes or so is not really enough time to judge a table, especially when I haven't drained at all yet. The scores from these games wouldn't get posted to the leaderboards or anything, they're just acting as a couple test credits before deciding to dump all your quarters in.Still reccomend though.			"

												Edit - The below review was meant to be a review of the Super Football League (Zen Team) table.This was a table I spotted released a while back, and I was excited about it.  Sports is a common theme for actual pinball, and it is nice to Zen take a dip into that genre.  I jumped on the -50% price during the summer sale, and I am not disappointed.  For what is the price of 3 plays (at 0.50 ea),  You get a very original table that really puts you into the illusion that you are playing a game of football (soccer).  I like the fact that the table hinges on hitting mostly ramp shots instead of a lot of gimmicks, but it does a nice job of building up the pressure on you to score when the time is right.  You almost forget you are playing pinball but not in a bad way.  This is a great table, and it doesn't seem to matter which team you choose as they seem to be the same except for the colors and individual players named through the course of the game.			"

												I have far too often been disappointed with following comments I read ahead and follow. Same with my own prejudices which must fall to the wayside in the decision for or against. I have personal preferences in favor of Bruce Lee, Jet Li and Steven Seagal; the directorial work of Robert Rodriguez and Tsui Hark; but I find that following my own preconceived notions do not work when deciding on something new.However, my friend recommended Pinball FX2, and I do like pinball games as a rule. I went ahead and took the free download and I must say the *free* Sorcerer's Lair table is pretty good; and being free, well ... if I was to be disappointed, I can't ask for much of a return. On this score I tried Pinball Arcade, and that one did indeed serve me great disappointment, even though it was free.My interest in this version has grown and this morning I looked for and found the Fantastic Four table at a price I thought to be a bargain; and well, here is my review. I caution any gamer, movie-goer, book reader or - well - consumer - to make up their own mind, this is my own opinion - It's a great game!			"

												Simply put, one of the most immediately addicting games I have ever played; gorgeous and cleverly designed tables galore.If you don't like pinball, you probably won't enjoy this title. It does innovate, but it doesn't change what it is at it's core. +Endless replayable hi-score fun. +Original tables from the dev's with rich themes and additions that wouldn't be possible on a real table. +Graphics and sounds are what you would expect.+Leaderboards and stats galore. -From what I can tell, no real life tables. Those seem to be the focus of the other pinball game on steam, Pinball Arcade. Unfortunately, that game charges an insanely high amount for their table recreations - but that's exactly what they are, recreations of real tables, which is what Pinball FX2 lacks. My main gripe is that some tables made by Zen for Pinball FX are a little broken, whereas the tables in Pinball Arcade are based on real life tables which seem to be balanced better overall. The tables in Pinball FX2 are sold at a very fair price.			"

The hulk table drives me nuts because of all the repeated talking he does, you will find out  its repeated every 2 minutes. Ugh. The hulk table is nice and I did enjoy it minus the voice talking. Earth Defense is a nice table with plenty of space and lots of action and no cheap ball drops. For pinball fans this is a no brainer pick some up and enjoy.			"

												Obviously it's not exactly fair to call this a ""free"". That being said, the free table included with the game is very fun, and practically worth the download on it's own. But beware, you will most likely get sucked into buying more tables.			"

												Completely recommended!!! I loved pinball when I was younger, and the tables FX2 has to offer are simply amazing. This is just great when you're tired and don't really want to do nothing else but relax. Sometimes you might end up stressing a bit more but that doesn't make it any less fun, as contradictory as it might sound.			"

												HIGHLY ADDICTIVE !!!.Yes, this is pinball but, not a classic pinball.Lot of characters doing something, very alive.Missions are key for good scores and, missions are variate and include a few mini games in each table.You can dowload for FREE and try every table for free (up to certain score and/or time).Socerer's Lair table IS FREE. And, btw, one of the best tables of this game.Try that one to have an overall impression of this game			"

												Seriously this is one of the best ♥♥♥♥ing things on Steam. Now that one of the best tables of all, Sorcerer's Lair, is completely free to play, you have no excuse not to play this. Also, buy the Zen Classics pack, the Core Pack, Epic Quest and Paranormal for the full set of non-license tables, most of which are amazing (epic quest and biolab in particular) - but I cannot recommend the Star Wars set highly enough, it's ridiculously smooth and well done. Even if you don't buy anything just play Sorcerer's Lair, if you don't you're doing yourself a disservice. (and then buy Epic Quest because it's awesome and RPG progression in pinball owns).			"

												This is a great pinball game with tons of memorable tables, but be warned: this is a DLC based game. The game is cheap all by itself, but it may look intimidating to see the number of available tables and see the total price to get them all. However, it's not essential to get them all (not at all). Moreover, the tables always get discounted during Steam's huge sales (summer/winter). So, just buy a few every sales and it won't be that expensive.			"

												Played for only 2 hours So I decided to give this game a review. Here are the Pros n Cons of this game****Pros****1) Graphics are really nice, it can run on high quality graphics on a low computer2) Controls are easy, and even better if you have an Xbox 360 controller3) The download is quick, maybe 30 min to an hour.4) Tables are cheap and quick to get, there are collections you can unlock for dirt cheap prices. ****Cons****1) You get ONE free table, kinda sucks In my opinion, but they're cheap as i mentioned above.2) This is basically the same exact game as the Xbox has, just not with all the unlocked tables, if you want to spend $20 on a 360 game go ahead, otherwise get this game and buy only tables you want, for much cheaper prices.that's what I got so far. I rate it 9/10. Because of how fun it is.			"

For example in Zaccaria pinball you need to pay 9.99 euro to be able to adjust camera, in Pinball Arcade you need to use outside unknown software to adjust cameras and support cabinet mode.Pinball FX2 is what you looking for!Anyway, i compared this software to all others, FX2 have no competition.Good job guys, very good job ZEN Studios. Keep it up - it will be even better!Have a nice day. I'm going to buy some tables.			"

												A great and realistic game, but where it really, really starts to be several times more enjoyable is if you're playing it on a widescreen monitor in portrait/vertical orientation (ie, same shape as a pinball table). If you've got it in mode 1, there's no sea-sickness as it swooshes around. Try it. Even better if you lie it down somewhere too! (see my avatar for what I've been playing it on)My Favourite table is the Plants Vs Zombies one.(Note: I got this game from Humble, and have been playing this in offline mode on a PC which is only ever connected to the internet if I'm downloading something, so the current time of 27 minutes isn't accurate. As of the time of writing, I've probably clocked up about 4-5 hours on it.)			"

												One of the best remaining reasons to boot up Windows.  This is good stuff and I love pinball.  Lots of fun original tables each sold for a price, although some can be bundled.  The prices are reasonable.  I have a mediocre sytem and get good framerates on 42"" with HD.  They does seem to be a few milliseconds delay between button presses and the flipper reacting which does not seem to be tied to framerates.  I feel I have encountered this same delay on real tables.  It can easiliy be compensated for.  Keyboard or gamepad both work fine.  Don't listen to me though there is a free table, download it naow.			"

												Edit - The below review was meant to be a review of the Super Football League (Zen Team) table.This was a table I spotted released a while back, and I was excited about it.  Sports is a common theme for actual pinball, and it is nice to Zen take a dip into that genre.  I jumped on the -50% price during the summer sale, and I am not disappointed.  For what is the price of 3 plays (at 0.50 ea),  You get a very original table that really puts you into the illusion that you are playing a game of football (soccer).  I like the fact that the table hinges on hitting mostly ramp shots instead of a lot of gimmicks, but it does a nice job of building up the pressure on you to score when the time is right.  You almost forget you are playing pinball but not in a bad way.  This is a great table, and it doesn't seem to matter which team you choose as they seem to be the same except for the colors and individual players named through the course of the game.			"

												Best video pinball game hands down.  Zen knows what they are doing... If you like simulation pinball it may take a little while for you to get used to it but it is well worth it, trust me.  This is an excellent game because not only does it not try to emulate a ""true pinball experience"" a-la the Midway collection, but instead concentrates on making the best Video Pinball experience ever.

												Simply put, one of the most immediately addicting games I have ever played; gorgeous and cleverly designed tables galore.If you don't like pinball, you probably won't enjoy this title. It does innovate, but it doesn't change what it is at it's core. +Endless replayable hi-score fun. +Original tables from the dev's with rich themes and additions that wouldn't be possible on a real table. +Graphics and sounds are what you would expect.+Leaderboards and stats galore. -From what I can tell, no real life tables. Those seem to be the focus of the other pinball game on steam, Pinball Arcade. Unfortunately, that game charges an insanely high amount for their table recreations - but that's exactly what they are, recreations of real tables, which is what Pinball FX2 lacks. My main gripe is that some tables made by Zen for Pinball FX are a little broken, whereas the tables in Pinball Arcade are based on real life tables which seem to be balanced better overall. The tables in Pinball FX2 are sold at a very fair price.			"

												Good game not all tables are great but most are very good. The avenger pack with fear and avengers is a little on the annoying side because of all the ramps you need to hit to get anything going and the more then not balls drains down the middle and sides a lot more then should be. Mars is a great table along with the star wars tables and epic quest is a  nice easy table that flow nicely. Blade is another good one for just having a good ball flow. The hulk table drives me nuts because of all the repeated talking he does, you will find out  its repeated every 2 minutes. Ugh. The hulk table is nice and I did enjoy it minus the voice talking. Earth Defense is a nice table with plenty of space and lots of action and no cheap ball drops. For pinball fans this is a no brainer pick some up and enjoy.			"

Looks and plays just like the real deal.  So much so, that if you put this in a pinball cabinet with full screens I'd swear I was playing a real pinball game. The free download comes with a free table and you can try all the other tables before you buy them at very resonable prices.  With several original, Marvel, and Star Wars tables and more being added all the time you're bound to find a favorite table.See if you can beat my scores!!			"

Unless you produce Devil`s Crush (much more fantastical design style, as opposed to the realism of these tables - yet a classic).			"

Ever since i rarely saw any pinball games except for a few tiny titles every so often, none matching the quality and fun of a good pinball game. Then Pinball FX 2 appeared on steam and it was like i got a toy i always wanted as a kid, but never got.Pinball Fx2 is a perfect pinball game that makes use of current tech (Yet not too much) to make for a fun game that can run on a wide scale of systems. Sure it aint perfect as on rare occassion a physics glitch occurs, but it comes far closer to perfect then any other title i know of.Only real downside is the hefty price-tag if you are planning to get all Tables.

I purchased, and repurchased it for PS3, Wii U, Xbox 360, and finally Steam, each platform being better than the last.  The pinball physics, variety and challenges are endless, with each table being better than the last.  The old tables have not aged well, but there is a lot of fun to be had here.			"

Also, buy the Zen Classics pack, the Core Pack, Epic Quest and Paranormal for the full set of non-license tables, most of which are amazing (epic quest and biolab in particular) - but I cannot recommend the Star Wars set highly enough, it's ridiculously smooth and well done. Even if you don't buy anything just play Sorcerer's Lair, if you don't you're doing yourself a disservice. (and then buy Epic Quest because it's awesome and RPG progression in pinball owns).			"

												Pinball FX2 goes beyond what real world pinball tables could do, making extraordinarily deep and varied experiences. Tables vary a bit in quality, from very good to wonderful, and I've yet to find a table I didn't enjoy at least a little bit.  But be warned, tables do have to bought separately (or in some small bundles), so the upfront cost is not the final cost.  But as long as you're aware of that, this is the best computer pinball there is (Pinball Arcade is a close second, with its focus on real world table recreations, so if that's what you're looking for, go there instead).

												Pinball FX2 is a very polished product. The tables are diverse and well thought out, and common shots and ramps rarely drain directly unless you've put some weird spin on the ball.In terms of bugs, the game is solid, but for me required a couple of system tweaks to make it playable due to what was otherwise pronounced input lag (disable v-sync and drop the ""maximum pre-rendered frames"" setting to 1 in your video drivers). Check out the pinned thread in the Steam forums for more details. Additionally, for me, the Spiderman table is completely unplayable as a ball goes missing half way through a game and never reappears.Neither of the above problems was resolved when I recently refreshed my system with a new install of Windows 8 64, upgraded from Windows 7 64.A huge amount of work has gone into table designs, every table puts its own unique spin on things and all are originals. This means that they are also a little more forgiving than many real world tables as they don't have to factor in eating your money.All tables reward skill, and generally offer a good variety of modes, multiballs and combos to keep things interesting.The ball physics are excellent, although ball speeds are perhaps a little bit faster than real world tables (noticeably faster on some tables, less so on others). Regardless, if you are already a fan of real-world pinball you won't have any trouble picking things up where you left off.Even though I've been a die-hard pinball fan for many years, I've tended to shy away from electronic versions as they've not given me the same satisfying real world sense of interactivity, from the slap of the flipper buttons to nudging the table.Pinball FX2 doesn't solve this lack of physical interactivity, in that controls are simply left and right space bars for the flippers and the control keys and space bar to nudge the table.In my case, however, I've recently acquired a new mechanical keyboard, and if you're like me and need a bit more physical feedback to recreate the experience you're used to I can highly recommend the investment. My mechanical keys now provide exactly the right tactile slap from hitting the flippers.I also find that, as I'm a decent player, most tables are generous in awarding kickbacks, and therefore my main reason for nudging is rarely necessary (and if you're not a decent player, why would you even try?).The sound is quite effective at ball-clack noises, bumpers and the like.My biggest gripe with the game is that some tables get carried away with the video-game potential through such things as glowing balls, sped-up balls in certain game modes, and full video-game style mini games. If you are someone, like me, who prefers a more 'pure' pinball experience, you will find that these tables can get irritating very quickly. Thankfully, there is enough variety (if you can afford it) to largely stay away from the more painful examples. I've also turned off ball glow trails in options as I was finding the ball glow was sometimes interfering with my ability to read the ball.As you will observe with a quick overview of the available DLC, Zen Studios have taken full advantage of its Star Wars and Marvel licenses. In my view this is a shame as the non-licensed tables feel far more creative, original and varied than those heavily reliant on movie imagery and sound-bites.Overall, however, I've had a lot of fun with Pinball FX2 and can enthusiastically recommend it.

												You have to ask yourself one question.  How long can you keep Isaac Newton from laughing about your balls?This.  This is my favorite game on Steam.  Pinball Arcade is just as good, but the currently impossible-to-manufacture tables that aren't trying to chew your quarters really lets your mind go to a zen state, and then a Logitech F310 or controller of choice becomes an extension of your consciousness.  Don't play for a high score, or for extra balls, the only one that matters is the last one on the table.  It's difficult to tell people what drives a person to play this game, but it's easy to recommend to everyone, if you are in the right mood to battle physics.9,5/10 equal to Pinball Arcade.  Play for fun, and keep this bit of trivia in mind: it costs $2 to play one game of pinball in real life.  Play a table in this game 100 times over the course of a year or more?  The value doesn't even make sense unless you remember being in an arcade with these competing with Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter.  Here, you don't have anyone judging your technique, there's a guide for every table a Start button or Esc key away explaining every detail you could ask about how to destroy a table.  Video guides if you have a friend you really want to beat, but your opponent is really yourself - Guardians of the Galaxy is a really energetic, fun table, and so is the South Park pack if you like the show.  The Walking Dead table is amazing if you've played the Telltale RPG series.			"

												Edit: According to some other reviews on here, there is a new Terms of Service with some questionable new policies. My review is of the game itself and I have not played in several weeks so I was unaware of it. Check out some of the other reviews here or research a bit before downloading. I apologize for the outdated review. I'm 23. Though nowhere near old enough to have memories of arcade pinball machines, I am old enough to have nostalgia over virtual pinball games! Simple games are often the best in my opinion, and everyone knows how to play pinball. It is quite literally two buttons. Pinball is a concept any kid can understand. My free time after school often consisted of running home to play, of all things, Microsoft Windows Pinball. Looking back, it's amazing to me - a game that came free with our operating system had captured my attention for hours. On the go, I had 1999's Pokemon Pinball on my GameBoy Color. Now this one was more advanced - it had the Red table, and the Blue table (named after the Pokemon Red and Blue games), and they were different. I was amazed. I was addicted. I mentioned I like simplicity. To me, there is something to the objective of getting a high score. Challenging yourself, topping a friend's score, the way your heart starts beating fast as you realize you're edging in on a top score - these are some of the best feelings in gaming.Pinball FX2 gets that. It understands the simplicity of the fun that comes from hitting a little silver ball around a table, trying to top that last score. It eggs you on. It notifies you when you're about to beat that score, or a friend's score. It also understands my childish excitement when I saw Pokemon Pinball had two options for tables. It has dozens of tables, and I have yet to play one I didn't greatly enjoy. Zen has many original tables within the game, and there are some great licensed tables as well. You can find tables from the Marvel and Star Wars Universe. Some more series you will recognize are The Walking Dead, South Park, and Plants vs. Zombies. I will say Pinball FX2 is a bit heavy on the Marvel and Star Wars (so if you're not into those, there are a reduced number of tables you'll be interested in), but since you buy tables separately, you can just choose not to buy them. The quality and originality of every table has impressed me every time I try a new one, so even if you're not into the ""lore"" (as I'm not crazy on the Marvel universe), you may find the tables still well worth playing.Here is also a bit about the ""pay structure"" - the game is ""free to play"" technically. Everyone who downloads Pinball FX2 gets the Sorcerer's Lair table, which to be honest is a fantastic table you could entertain yourself on for hours. One of my favorites for sure. Anything else is sold separately, in ""packs"" (ie. the Star Wars and Marvel packs) or as individual tables. They are ALWAYS on sale during Steam sales so if you are eyeing a table but don't want to pay full price, I recommend just adding it to your wishlist and waiting!If you love pinball games, give it a go. Try the free table, see what you think. There is something to kicking that little (virtual) ball around the table, which must be why I'm 23 and still playing the same game I was when I was 8.			"

												Keeping in mind that I only bought two tables, I can't really recommend this pinball game at all.  The tables, while slick and great looking, just aren't that much fun to play.  The tables are short, and there are no clear goals defined at all.  Also it's really easy to rack up a bunch of points, so the tables aren't that challenging.  If you want a pinball game that merely looks good, and toy-filled tables that jus don't seem to do much, buy this.  For a better pinball experience, I'd go with Pinball Arcade			"

												I installed it out of nostalgia for the old Windows flipper but the only things this game has are is its graphics and BO. The gameplay was lame, and unless that's because of my PC, each loading screen too impossible time. This is nothing worth money at all as far as I am concerned. So after I began to play with the free core features, annoyed to have to put up with the opening cutscene which presents the flipper, each time I began a new game, just as much as I was frustrated with the loading screens, I finally decided to buy a DLC, hoping to discover new gameplay options that would explain the prices... But as far as I'm concerned, all the DLC I saw were rather dull sets of skins and sounds. By all means, the old windows game was much better in the means that it was lighter and completely free.			"

So tell me of this mysterious gameAhhh, Pinball, a superficially simple but subtly complex game.A game where heroes are forged in the fires of force and geometry, a game where dreams are shattered by that evil temptress called gravity.A game that separates the men from the boys, the women from the girls and the Wizards from them all!Welcome to the intense, extreme and often emotional sport of Pinball!I wish to be a wizard separated from boys and girls! This isn’t a journey to be undertaken lightly my friend, but if you are sure, I will teach you!Come with me as we traverse the pleasures and pitfalls of this wild and exhilarating sport.Throughout the course of this review we’ll journey through the basics, the concepts, the joys and the jargon.I’m going to give you all the information you’ll need to be a pro, as for becoming a wizard?Well that’ll take hard work and dedication, but I have faith in you my prodigy.Field of Dreams As a potential paragon of pinball, you will first need to be aware of the forum of the faithful that is the arena for this glorious sport.This arena or playing field takes the form of a table, but not just any table, this is a table with a slant, rising upward before you like the altar of aspiration it truly is.As an aspiring Baron of the Balls, you will take your place at the base of this tilted table of temptation. You should strive to feel comfortable here; this is where dreams are made.Balls of SteelOn to this table you can launch a steel ball, your avatar on this plateau of promise.The tormenting tilt of the table will then conspire with gravity to defeat you as your ball succumbs to their merciless grip and begins to roll downwards towards impending doom.Impending Doom?That’s right. At the base of this alluring alter of ambition lies the abhorrent abyss of agony, the pit, the void, the gaping mouth where all balls are inevitably sucked.Despite your skill level, this will eventually happen to you. It is the destiny of every ball to be sucked into the mouth eventually.But fear not friend, you are not defenceless, you can fight back.They Call Him FlipperOn this tilted board of dreams you also have some interactive devices the pros like to call “flippers”At the press of a button you can utilise these “flippers” in an attempt to intercept the rolling steel ball and change its path, hopefully away from the previously mentioned hole which is waiting to consume your ball.Nice PinsIf that isn’t enough excitement for you, the table also has strategically placed targets which we’ll call pins.Although your primary objective should always be to avoid the devouring pit of doom at the base of the table, you also have the secondary goal of trying to hit the various pins with your mighty ball of steel.So it’s a game of pins, balls and tables.If you want to sound like a “real pro” you should refer to this pinned platform of perils as a “Pinball Table”Pinball WizardBut wait, there’s even more. The order in which you strike these “pins” can also be important.If you strike the correct targets consecutively you may be awarded with additional points to help boost your score.That’s right; the pinball table isn’t only there to confound you with its attempts to swallow your balls.You can also quantify your prowess through the facility of a score.This is where the true pinball wizards achieve their bragging rights.If only there was some sort of training simulatorSo, now you’re ready to master the mechanics of the fickle mistress that is pinball, but which game should you choose to hone your developing pinball powers?Surprisingly, when looking for the simulated experience of this seductive sport, you’ll find that the market isn’t exactly flooded with titles.Sure, there are a few options out there, but if you’re serious about your pinball wizardry then the “go to” game at the time of writing is Pinball FX2 and best of all the price of admission is free.Free is GoodMost of us can afford “Free”, in fact it’s my favourite price point for a game.So what do you get for an investment of zero? A pretty well designed pinball table with all the bells and whistles you’d expect from a digital version of the game, that’s what.As well as the free table to cut your teeth on (which will likely give you many hours of game time on its own before you get bored), you also get the chance to enjoy a few minutes play time on many of the additional tables available to purchase in the game.More PleaseWhen you do decide to move on from the starting table, the choice is vast, from the generically themed tables of Rome and Tesla through to Star Wars and The Walking Dead, you’re sure to find a table to suit your mood.The additional tables are reasonably priced, and although you’ll undoubtedly have your own favourites, they are all of a high standard, expertly designed and fun to play (and yes, I’ve played through most of them)Let’s Get PhysicalThe physics in Pinball FX2  is spot on. The ball bounces around exactly as you’d expect it too, the motion is fluid, the flippers respond smoothly and no matter how frantic the action gets, everything rolls along nicely.Master your BallsPinball FX2 is an outstanding title in the genre; it sounds good, it looks amazing and it plays better than the real thing.There’s a score table out there waiting to put your name up in lights. It is time for the student to become the master.Go now, Show the world what you can do with your balls!( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/ )			"

												In general, PFX2 physics, table layouts, and rulesets contribute to an imbalanced, boring slog of a pinball game. Constant dead shots that score little and contribute to nothing worthwhile. Too-short hurry up timers across the majority of tables. Visual clutter and irritating voice samples are the norm.The fact that it's fictional pinball is rarely leveraged in a good or meaningful way. Many tables are adorned with cheesy 3D models that contribute nothing--often sucking up time with bad animations, or actively obscuring the playfield.It was the only game in town for a couple years, but Pinball Arcade puts it to shame now.

												As beautiful as this game may seem in the beginning, the offered tables are pretty boring and lame. They are really simple and unrealistic, there isn't too much to do on each table. It is no match to famous Pro Pinball series, in which each and every single game has many more options than all tables included in Pinball FX2 combined... and it was almost 20 years ago!Almost forgot to mention that many ramps, orbits and other components are placed so unintuitively that while you're sure the ball will come from left, it unexpectedly comes from right. Also, all the blinking lights are so small and hard to notice, so combined with almost everything (missions, etc.) being strictly time-limited it makes game unenjoyable - you will constantly miss skill shots and fail missions simply not knowhing where to shot.

												I played a lot of Pinball games on the pc and other consoles.  It was never so much fun as with FX2. Lots of tables and they all feel different. If you like Pinball this is Paradise.Edit after 160 hours of gameplay the last couple of years:I keep coming back every week to play a few rounds of Pinball. I now have more than a hundred Pinball friends on Steam and it's a lot of fun chasing each others high scores. The competition factor in Pinball Fx is realy nice. You'll be informed while playing if you get close to your own or your friends highscore. The tension..........  Fun!			"

												Pinball FX2 (known on some platfroms as Zen Pinball 2) a solid pinball game with tight controls and good physics. What helps to set this apart from other pinball simulators is that the game is not limited to things that are possible on real tables, such as character interaction or varying minigames, also the wide array of licensed tables (mostly from Mavel and Star Wars) might be a draw.The biggest downside i've seen of this game so far is that the game is sold in pieces, which may or may not be a good thing depending on your tastes. There are various packs, single table purchases, and bundles to choose choose from that it might be overwhelming, but the game does allow for you to demo every table for a few moments. Also because this is how the game is set it, its constantly reminding you of the content you do not own.There is also a ton of customization options from graphical settings to viewing angles that you can find the layout that works best for you. Sadly, this version of the game is missing its online multiplayer component, leaving the only form of competition you can have up to various leaderboards that can be in general or between your Steam friends.Ultimately if you need one Pinball game, this one can do the job nicely between its feel and wide table variety, just dont be weary of the game being sold in pieces.DISCLAIMER: There is apparently some nasty documentation with the wording in the End User License Agreement that could allow the game to be updated to serve as spyware on your PC. I have done some research before I ever downloaded the game and discovered the game itself (as of this review) does not do this at all. Zen Studio's also recieved a big enough backlash that they said they'd ammend the EULA some time ago but have yet to for reasons unknown. I am personally confident both developer Zen Studio's and publisher Microsoft Studio's would not be so foolish at this point in time to gather untold information outside of the game itself at this point. If the presense of this info on the EULA still is making you uneasy or you do not wish to keep tabs on this situation, i'd remomend just waiting until the EULA is altered to either remove that portion entierly or to adjust it to clearly state they are only gathering background information in-game on your   usage and purchase habits(in the context of providing a better service or selection to its users).

The rest have one, ONE ramp that does anything, the rest are extra scenarios after that. So i spend all my balls trying to start a mini-game or anything and as soon as i can ""start the game"" i lose my last ball. Seriously, this game is so friggin hard - the nudge never works either... gosh i want my money bacl.			"

												""Reminds me how bad I am at pinball."" 8/10These days pinball machines are nowhere near as popular as they once were, and even for a kid like me who grew up in the 90's before the whole ""internet"" thing really took over; pinball still wasn't very popular back then either. But it's been around for as long as most people can remember, and as far as I can tell, it's not going anywhere anytime soon. And I'm totally okay with that, because it's usually the simplest games that are the most fun to play, and are typically the hardest to master. At least, I think people can master pinball.If you've ever played pinball and enjoyed it, then I'm sure there was something about the machine that drew you to it in particular; maybe it was 'Star Wars' themed, or maybe it was modeled after ‘NASCAR’, or perhaps you liked the one based on 'The Sopranos'; regardless of your taste, the beauty of 'Pinball FX 2' is how many choices you get in tables. It's got everything you could ask for in terms of themes, and each table offers it's own unique story and intricacies, making them all feel different and original. And new ones are still being released too, so there’s always something to look forward to up on the horizon.Despite the significant drop in popularity, pinball machines are still being produced today, and typically appear in bars for drunks to enjoy. But if there aren’t any in sight, and you still feel the need to get your pinball on, this is a great replacement to sit back with a sixer, and try and run up some high scores. And the best part about each table is that you get to test it out for a few minutes before deciding whether or not you want to purchase it. There are a few pinball games on Steam, but I have to assume this is the best one out there. Download it today and give it a try, you've got nothing to lose; not even a quarter!			"

												I really enjoy this game. It's free and absolutely fun to play. I plan on buying The Walking Dead board and perhaps a Star Wars board. That's the beauty you can just buy the boards you want. Yeah, if you want many boards the money will add up quick, but you don't need too many to have a good time playing pinball. I prefer to play with my XBOX ONE controller because the triggers just feel incredibly natural rather than using the keyboard and it works perfectly. These guys take the IPs and do great work with them. I recommend this game fully. How can I not? It's free and even without any purchased boards it's a blast to play.			"

												One of the most popular pinball games. Follow your senses and let the days of the Star Wars series pinball machines get your light saber fingers moving. Or kick off a soccer game with your friends and then go play with South Park tables. No, then sit back and try your hand at the many other tables found in this collection of fun tables. Challenge your frineds to beat you or play with them in multiplayer mode for instant action. The more friends you have that play this game the higher your score will be in the end with shared point accumulator. This is not a slow paced game, eye and hand coordination is key. Being drunk, high or under the influence will not help your game. Distractions like children and pets can bring your game down so try to give them something else to do while you play. Enjoy your game and don't forget about the real world. Stop, go outside, stretch and visit the bathroom before returning to the game. Please pause the game if your child needs you and remember this is only a game.			"

What is not to like? A couple more winners from FX2 to add to your collection. Electronic pinball is amazing. Where else can you amass such a large collection of tables? If you are a pinball enthusiast you dont need a table review; you just need to play! Thanks for FX2 for keeping the tables coming.

It is not a realistic Pinball per say, as you will find mechanics, which wouldn't be possible on a physical machine. But you are not playing on a real table, are you?You don't like Pinball? - oh well, give it a bash anyway. The free table is good, and you can try all the others before purchasing.			"

												This can be a great game.  There are boards that are inspired, (many of the Marvel and most of the Star Wars boards). Unfortunately I must warn you, tho the boards referenced,  (Marvel and Star Wars) have many good voice-overs, the newest boards I have tried, (which as of this writing are on-sale: bobs brgrs,, Archer, etc.), they have no voice-overs and have  ABSOLUTELY NO LIFE OR REAL REFERENCE to their source material.  It is like playing a generic pinball game that has nothing at all to do with the few images that the ball flits past.  PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AS I FOOLISHLY DID!There is no vo or character to either of the Archer or Bobs brgr bds, they should not have been created as they are..			"

												I have only played this for a little while.When I was little and Windows XP came with Pinball, it was one of the only games I played. I loved it because it was something to do...Now here we are a decade later and I find this game. While it is annoying you don't have more than one table free, it is pretty realistic. The UI is slick, the themes are pretty accurate, and there's something about it that gives you nostalgia. Now, I'm not old enough to remember Arcade Pinballs but I have played a real game before. This is pretty accurate to the formula. If it were any more realistic it'd be scary.Oh and a plus you can get the Portal table half off if you own the games.			"

												Pinball FX2 is frankly the best pinball game you will find on Steam. I'll keep this review short since it's just pinball and quite frankly there's little to say, but anyone interested in having a solid arcade feeling pinball experience should get this game.PROSFunGood Selection of tables Solid Feeling Controls, everything feels responsive and you never feel like you missed a ball thanks to a delayed flipper or anything else. Multiple table aesthetics to suit anyone's taste. Want an underwater themed table? It's there. Want a wild west themed table? It's there. Want a space themed table? It's there.Multiple camera angles to play around with so anyone can adjust the camera to their playstyle if they want a larger view of the table or just want to follow the ball. Plus they look cool and can be used to switch things up if it gets boring.The music and sounds for each table are niceIt looks pretty  CONS The game gives you one free table but you'll quickly get bored of that and want to buy some other tables which frankly feel like a rip. Most tables are three dollars which isn't that bad for the amount of quality you get with these tables, but still feels a little bit too expensive. I would just drop 10$ on the core pack which gives you some of the best tables in the game and buy the others which seem of interest to you. While not a big flaw for a free game, it's something to consider.Many of the tables are promotional tables for Star Wars, Marvel, or Football(Soccer to us Americans). While no-one is forcing you to buy these tables, they take up the majority of Tables offered by the shop and seem to be a lesser quality than most other tables. This could just be my personal preference, but the Venom table is my least touched table out of all the tables I own. I hear the Football(Soccer) tables are weird also. Lack of Windowed mode. This is really a game that needs windowed mode, but lacks it----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you have any interest in Pinball or are a Pinball enthusiast pick this game up, you wont be disappointed.

												Pinball taken to 11Theres really not alot to say about the game play of Pinball FX2.  Its pinball. but its one of the best virtual pinball games i've ever played.  It has a sleek presentation, and the game play and physics feel really good.  and since its not a reality the table aren't bound by physical limitations so you can have things like people flying around the table or explosions that add to the presntation and polish.  I also like how even with these larger than life elements it still feels like pinball. no stupid gimicks. just a ball and flippers.  Now i'm talking about the over all experince here.  Some tables in the game are better than others and that will vary depending on what kind of pinball elements you like and how appealing a particlar tables theme is to you.  but reguardless there are a large variety of table you can purcahse and each one is will have the same level of quality, polish and presentation. If you need your pinball fix this is a good option			"

												Responsive controls, nicely designed innovative tables. Not the true arcade pinball experience, but takes advantage of the platform to provide worthwhile gimmicks. Some audios are overused and get irritating. The 1 included table with the download is enough to decide whether or not you want to spend a little more and get extra tables.			"

												I love this game, but the controller support is weak. Outside of that, I have had no issues with any of the tables so far. the only issue I had with it was when I first installed it and got an antivirus warning, but it turned out not to be anything to worry about. Ever since, always solid playing, no crashes. The only thing I would like is to have a better way of being able to play against other players and create our own tournaments. Overall, I would recommend this to pinball enthusiasts as well as the casual gamer who only wants to play for 15-20 minutes.			"

												I've mostly played this game on PS3 where it's called Zen Pinball, but it's pretty much the same here, and I've played it a lot.  The tables are almost without exception of excellent design.  The physics are great, there's a lot of view modes, the high score tables are great, new tables come out regularly, graphics and sound is awesome. I just can't say enough positive things about this game.  I'd never really played pinball before playing this, apart from putting in som quarters for a short game in rl pinball machines when I was a kid.  I didn't expect to get this addicted to it or that it would be so much fun.  Even though you'll suck at first most likely, if you just try to improve your own score and understand the tables you'll improve a lot pretty fast and then addiction kicks in.  If you can compete with a friend or more it's even more fun. You may not expect it or know it yet, but chances are you'll love it!			"

However if you are looking for a simulator of real tables that existed, you probably want to check out ""Pinball Arcade"" in the first place. For me however, the developers of Pinball FX2 created a modern original, if you like Pinball you gotta check it out! :)			"

												Not strictly a simulation like the old Pro Pinball series as the game includes animations and features limited to the gaming world; however, the game is richer for it. The physics are excellent, visuals and sounds spot on. Extremely entertaining and addicitive and you soon find yourself having one more go just to try and beat your best score.On a personal note, wish I hadn't bothered with the Walking Dead table. It is just too frustrating to be any fun at all and unlike other tables, you seem to have little or no control over the ball disappearing down one of the sides some times without any user input at all.Overall all though, thoroughly recommended.

												This is what Pinball is suposed to look like in a virtual enviroment!While other Pinball Games focus on bringing exsisting tables on your device. Pinball FX2 takes advantage of the virtual enviroment and provides very dynamic tables with mechanics that are impossible in the real world. Latest example the Portal Table, that brings the famous Portal gameplay to Pinball.2.99€ per Table is a reasonable prize for the Tables, since you can play as long as you want and the effort of making those very dynamic tables is quite high. So 2.99€ is a very fair prize. Also, some Tables and Packages go on Sale from time to time, so you can save a buck or two if you're patient.All in all, Pinball FX2 is currently the most original Pinball Game out there, with unique tables that are not stuck in the past.

												Rich colors, well designed, ball and flipper physics are very respectable.  Free ball for those times when the ball drains 10 seconds after you launch it.  The only way the games could be perfect is if they had actual actor voices from the Marvel machines.   For the price, I am buying as many of the tables as I can.  I like being able to compare my scores against frineds and global high scores.  I give full recommendation for Pinball FX2 and all the tables that might interest you, I have over a dozen.			"

												It is Pinball taken to its next logical evolutionary step. I can not find enough words to heap on the praise this game and its many tables deserve and believe me, I tried hard. I have a Thesaurus open in front of me and it just isn't helping. The tables are bright, engaging and tremendously fun. The sound effects and themes chosen are fantastic and it combines all the amazing fun and real terror of real pinball. Losing your ball is as disappointing as it is in real life! Can't beat that! The Star Wars Tables are great, and the new Portal Pinball table looks well worth acquiring. If only they would do a Jurassic Park table, just like the Data East one from 1993. One can dream! Get your favorite tables, put your quarters away and play till real life gets in the way!			"

Pinball FX 2 is not a realistic pinball experience, but it's equally addictive and has a charm of its own.Pros:- The FREE table is fantastic and gives a great indication of what PinballFX has to offer.- The price of each table is very reasonable, especially when compared to other pinball games.- Really great mixture of original and acquired IP tables.- Great visuals, nice graphic styling. - Deeply designed tables, even more so than many real tables. - Cabinet support (if you're fancy enough!)- Table guides that actually take you around the table, allowing you to form a stratergy. - Leaderboards. - Very stable build. Cons- Ball feels a bit light/weightless, not like real tables.-  The UI is a bit of an eyesore.- The audio is a bit too 'clean' for a pinball table, bit of a strange gripe but hey. - Some audio can be repetitive and annoying sometimes (South Park is one of the worst for this)***NOTICE TO ZEN***Although tables based on existing intellectual properties are great, you should not neglect to continue to create originals! Some of the most enjoyable tables are your own (Paranormal, Sorcerer's Lair, Epic Quest). Tables with IP's sell much better I'm sure, but It would be awesome if we got another original once in a while!Thanks for making a great game!			"

REGARDING THE EULA: I looked further into it. It's been changed again.The ZEN Services may include third party dynamic behavioral in-game advertising technology which enables tailored advertising to be temporarily uploaded into the ZEN Services on your device and replaced while you are online. For further information please read the Privacy Policy.Now you may be thinking that the game will be full of ads. Nope, that's not the case. I'd say it's rather limited, actually. It's mostly because of all the promotional pinball tables that you can buy (e.g. Star Wars tables, Marvel tables). No ads popping into your face. There's really nothing to worry about.Whether it is still collecting information like your location/IP addrees, hell if I know. Most of this only applies to you IF you open a ZEN account. Now I'm not sure whether the game automatically creates a ZEN account for you using your Steam account information, which it can access of course (like almost every game).Now about the game:I've been longing for a good Pinball game since Pinball Fantasy on the Amiga. This game is pretty much what I wanted. Even the ball physics work almost the same way as in Pinball Fantasy.There was 1 huge problem I had with this game, which was input lag. I found a fix for it on the community formus.As for the cameras, the 3rd and the last camera setting works for (since I'm used to Pinball Fantasy), the rest are indeed pretty bad though. Most of them are set pretty low which gives a very skewed view on the table.As for the tables themselves, looks like the original tables are the best although also a bit cheesy (but hey, if classic pinball tables are your thing, then you'll love them). The Star Wars tables and most of the promotional ones, although they look good, most of them are pretty boring. I absolutely recommend the Portal table though. It's on of the most creative tables out there.The pricing seems reasonable to me (I mean, they could've asked for like 30 dollars and include 4-5 tables as usual with pinball games). Most of them also come in packs, so you can save a bit + there's always steam sales.			"

												While I prefer Pinball Arcade and playing classic real tables I really do appreciate the creativity and variety Pinball FX 2 brings to the table as well. In particular some of the Marvel tables are fascinatingly creative and without real world tables to need to adhere to strictly some of the modes are inventive and can obviously only exist in a digital space. Not all tables are winners but overall if you enjoy pinball this is an excellent offering.			"

												There sure are a lot of hours spent in this title on my profile... a lot for a pinball game! That's because it's a really good one!Being a stereoscopic 3D gamer I originally found this game's equivalent on the 3DS eShop and actively looked for a PC equivalent of it and here I am! Since stereo 3D works great using Tridef Ignition, I was able to have essentially a giant version of what I liked already on the 3DS.The creativity of the tables coupled with the good design and finally topped off with stereoscopic 3D can lead you to forget that you're not playing a real pinball table!Stereo 3D gameplay video:http://www.interleave-vr.com/youtube-proper-player.php?v=UGYCR_gFXHQ "

												A great pinball game. I currently have about 60 hours on about a dozen tables. There are very few completely dud tables. The few duds are mostly the ones from the first Pinball FX.

There's no tables from Pinball FX 1 that I can see, and none of the tables I've played in 2 top the red car racing one that came with PBFX1. That said, as a game, its flawless pinball action, everyone should own this game.			"

												Usually, if a game prominently features balls, my review is going to contain a lot of puerile humor.  I cannot promise you I will make it through this review without discussing smacking balls, handling balls, cradling balls, being swarmed by balls, having your balls sucked down the hole....  You get the idea.  I am apparently still ten years old and there's just no helping that sort of thing when a game is fundamentally about how well it treats your balls.  I want to try and start this review on a sober note, though.  I am deadly serious about pinball.  I love pinball.  And, let's be honest, you do too or you wouldn't be reading a review about simulated pinball.  In the realm of games pinball is like a sharpened stick compared to the large hard-on colliders that are video games today.  But I still remember playing this one wicked old machine about a million years ago in my friend's aunt's basement.  We played that♥♥♥♥♥♥all night long, stomping the old high score into the dirt.  It was an old cowboy themed table, with no story or complex goals to achieve.  It was just a silver ball, a couple paddles, some targets, bumpers, and a ramp.  Your only goal was to keep the ball in the air, letting it cause as much chaos as possible while the score rolled up.  That ball was so ♥♥♥♥in' heroic.  And I don't mean like kids with cancer or a flower growing up through a crack in the sidewalk.  This was like the guy from ""They Live!"" on a completely hopeless mission that he's got to do anyway because he's a badass.That got rambly.  But you know what?  I don't care!  I measure every pinball experience I have against that cowboy table and the other pinball games I've played.  Come on, you do it too with your own tables.  Pinball's a nostalgia thing.  That's just how it is.  So to review Pinball FX2, I've got ask myself: how does this compare to the cowboy table?  How 'bout all the other real and simulated tables I've played?The answer, like the game's protagonist, is gray and all over the place.  What Pinball FX2 does well, it does really well.  What it does badly is just inexcusable.  (And I played most of the non-free tables outside of my Steam account so my play time is higher)What does it do well?  Well, there are visually interesting tables, with goals that pantomime simple stories and give you huge bonuses if you manage to meet certain conditions.  They're very much like the pinball machines I remember from arcades in the 90s.  I very much appreciate that the aesthetic of the boards is kept artificial and mechanical like a real table, but they aren't bound to that rule.  There are some imaginative, organic models and they use lighting and particle effects as you'd expect from a modern game.  It doesn't ruin the pinball experience, but justifies a pinball video game because you can do impossible things you could only dream of doing with your balls in real life!  And such variety!  Break out a new table, load your balls in the shaft, and enjoy shooting them all over such beloved characters as Spider-Man, Princess Leia, and King Arthur. The music is fairly engaging and, for the most part, the sound effects are satisfyingly weighty.  The game makes a good effort putting the camera how you want it with several different perspectives, from zoomed in on the ball, to hovering above the entire table.  It's not perfect, though, because it can't be.  Let's face it, boys, in real life when there are some perfectly formed spheres in front of you, all your focus is on them even though you're keeping the periphs on everything else that's going on.  But while it's all flattened out on your monitor that's just not possible.  Still, they did the best they could.  And, as playing pinball is like making love, they give you options to adjust the angle of the table and thus the speed of the ball.  Though, as in making love, doing so will disqualify you from the leaderboards.So what does it do so badly?  Well, a few things.  The physics feel a bit off.  Woah!  That is seriously bad!  That is the one thing you need to be correct for a pinball game.  Yeah, but they're not  too  off.  I'll freely admit it might even be my imagination, but I swear the ball doesn't always behave consistently when I trap and shoot it from the same part of the flipper.  The gravity feels about right, but once in awhile you'd definitely hear me screaming ""BS!"" at the screen.  Granted, I might do that with a real pinball machine and I might just suck from not having played enough pinball.  However, despite having controller support for nice modern pads like the 360 controller that has those nice analog shoulder buttons, you can only smack the paddle at full strength.  Now that might be great if you have children acting up, but pinball requires a gentler touch: floating your ball from one flipper to the other, releasing your balls as if gently kissed by an angel.  That's pinball, baby!  And while that might seem really petty to you guys, remember I'm putting Pinball FX2 against the cowboy machine and that is a serious failure.  At least other computer pinball I've played has been aware of placing different force upon the ball depending on what area of the paddle it's leaving, and Pinball FX2 doesn't roll that way.  When you hit your balls that hard all the time it just doesn't feel good, man. Alright, so that's bad.  Damning I would say.  But a couple of you might just shrug and say ""what do you really expect from computer pinball?"" or even, ""You're only noticing those faults because Pinball FX2 is actually sort of close to real pinball unlike other computer games!""  Fair enough.  But let Pinball FX2, who is about to die, salute you, because I am about to signal the end of its days in this arena.  It succeeds somewhat by having a variety of tables, but that variety is superficial.  Every table is ultimately a 90s table with complicated goals, LED readouts, and animatronic trickery (animated trickery here).  Nowhere to be found is the simple cowboy table, where just keeping the ball in the air and maybe trying to get a whole group of targets down is all you need.  There's a purity in that experience, where a silver ball crashing around uncontrolled is still a win condition, from smashing the spinner out of the gate to careening off the last ill-fated bumper and down the drain.  Those tables aren't here, nor is anything in that minimal, old timey vain.  It's all the same glut of particles and complex models.  And remember, a Pinball game can only be about nostalgia, so leaving that out is real bad.I'm sure hard work goes into designing these tables, but I can't help but see them as just a reskin of the same free table.  I remember when I got ""Take a Break! Pinball"" on my Windows 3.0 computer.  It was awful, but for the couple of bucks I spent, I got half a dozen tables with distinct character.   When I was in middle school, I got a free pinball CD with three  tables from a cereal box that had good graphics for the age and played satifyingly if not like the real thing.  (It was probably not a cereal box.   It would be dumb to have a CD in a cereal box.)  Point is: the business model for this game is just deplorable.  They'd ultimately charge you one hundred sixty US dollars for pinball reskins.  That makes me mad.  Now, I know, you're saying ""just buy the ones you really want and leave the rest, dingus!""  Yeah, well, sorry.  I get a lot of games on Steam and I occaisionally get full triple A releases courtesy of my buddy Abe Lincoln.  That's five smackeroos for everybody keeping score.  For something that's so niche, so living on nostalgia, even for a perfect version (which this isn't), that's not okay.  For $10 I expect a full release (zing) for that sort of thing, not three skins.  Bottom line: if you can overcome that sizable problem or just play the free table, then Pinball FX2 might be as close as it gets to real pinball.   Otherwise, can't recommend.			"

												Pinball FX2 has some fun moments, but the developer is misguided and with the latest update, has shanked it's players and has really lost focus on the direction the game is going.Anyone who plays this game seriously has saved games, because you can't possibly finish a good run in one sitting, they go for 5+ hours and a lot longer in some cases. Zen decided to ninja an update that destroyed all saves across all tables and didn't warn the community ahead of time, even though it was known it would destroy saves. The condescending pop-up message confirms this. Top it off with the random crashes means you don't have a lot to look forward to other than frustration and wasting your time.The direction of all the new tables is this: Disney / Marvel. Zombies.    Don't expect much else. It's clear that the team has given up trying to be original, and like, say, Hollywood, just rehashes others' ideas, believing it will get a bigger response based on nostalgia and moronic fanboy response. Speaking of fanboys... The community has some good people but don't expect much give and take. Don't expect to be critical of anything without a bevy of uninvited losers with pacman avatars to go all fanboy attack on your comments / screenshots / whatever.This is ultimately the fallout of the fun in the game, in the long term. The people get annoying and if you don't tow the company's line, you will be bashed. Not by everyone, but you can't get away from the truly douchey people. Quality is hit or miss on the newer tables;  i.e. the Star Wars line are poorly exectued with a couple of exceptions and I expect this general trend to continue, as they seem to be going for style over substance.Do not buy. Pinball Arcade is a decent alternative for now.  "

												The four tables I purchased are derivative and have either an odd number of flippers, or asymmetric upper flippers, that are only useful for very specific and difficult shots (e.g. ball lock on Biolab). The tables also all suffer from strange bumps from the slingshots and sometimes the tip of the flippers that fire the ball right down the centre out-ramp (drain) before any reaction can be made; they try to address this problem with a ball save feature, but it happens too often and quickly becomes demoralizing. Also, the scoring feels ""off"" or disproportionate and takes forever to get a score above 10 million on any of the tables. The only success I've had is with the free table and I had to play for almost an hour to get 230 million and it became more of a chore than fun. Once I got that high score I ""retired"" the table and haven't played it since. The graphics are amazing, stunning even, but flashy graphics does not a good game make. I found Pinball Arcade to be have generally better physics and game-play. I won't be spending any more money on this game.			"

												This is, hands down, the best pinball experience you can have without an actual pinball machine. The tables are fantastic with tons of scoring options and the challenges and missions are lots of fun. This game is great for casual fans looking for a quick pinball fix and hardcore fans trying to move their way up the leaderboard.I can see where die-hard pinball fanatics wouldn't be into pinball FX2. The game's biggest downfall IMO is the physics aren't actual, real life, perfectly emulated, like one would find on a real pinball table. They aren't perfect, but they are really really close and the best you can find on a digitized pinball platform.As fun as this game is, it becomes so much better when you have a friend who is competing with you taking away the high scores on a table challenging you to improve your game in order to take them back.

												The Pinball Arcade has real-world simulations of tables. This has the most realistic physics engine ever, with fancy tables as well. I don't have much to say about this table, but what I love about this game the most is the physics engine. It has the most realistic physics and sounds I've ever heard in a pinball game. The pricing is above reasonable, but it's also tables that don't exist in the real world, which is what I'm more interested in with a pinball game. That physics engine keeps me coming back though, and I know it's strange to have that as a selling point, so I'll say this instead: What if Zen Studios and Farsight Studios got together and combined FX2's physics engine with TPA's pinball simulations of all those classic Gottlieb, Bally, Williams and Stern tables?

												This is the most horrible table I have ever had the misfortune to play. Looks good, but dont be fooled. The game play is horrible, with the ball getting smashed around the table NOT HITTING ANYTHING for exeedingly long periods at a time. No matter what you do, no matter how hard you co ordinate your shot, it goes FREAKING NO WHERE. Getting into these loops fo frustration just makes me wanna smash the table. No fun, No enjoyment what so ever.  Apart from the free table, the rest cost you an arm and a leg. Total♥♥♥♥♥♥ keep scrollin.			"

												Fantastic fun! Just bumped up the number of tables I own by buying the latest Humble Bundle. I have 90% of the tables now and love all of them!Oh and yes, I've read all the negative reviews about deleting high scores and the EULA and all that jazz - like, what's your beef guys? I hear your concerns but to me, it's no biggie and think the whole EULA thing smacks of a tennsy weensy little bit of paranoia.The game is great. Runs absolutely smoothly on my setup, and if you want to complain about spending hundreds of hours racking up a high score, only for that high score to be removed, then I suggest you rack up a hundred hours doing something a little more worthwhile with your life.

												Very fun pinball game.+ Graphics are amazing and the table designs is pretty cool.+ Good sound effects, voice acting.+ Many different unique and fun, game themed tabales available via dlc.+ Portal Table is available very soon :D, and as Valve and Portal fanboy this is must buy for me.Edit: Portal Table is out and it was easiest purchase of my life, orginal voice sounds from Portal, fun and unique table, amazing missions, this is must buy table and it is very cheap. - Menu is too cluttered, no filter to find free to play table, or some filters in general to categorise tables.- Game doesn't recognize Logitech controller, I had to install x360 emulator in order to play with my controller.Overall very good game and I'm sure I will spend lot time playing it, you should definitely try it.

												It's not that I don't like the game, but I couldn't play it.Why? this is not a free game. It's barely a demo, only one table to play and it's not the best pinball I've played.I'm really against this so called ""free to play"" games, anything you want to do you'll have to pay, otherwise the only game you play here is the install simulator.I really don't like to not recommend this game, but the greedy system (with excesive prices for each table) it's the whole problem here, and it's all over.

This is a very good for stress relief and has ignited my love of pinball. The free table, Sorcerer's Lair, is excellent and you could sink hours into that alone (which I did). I bought a bunch of tables during the Winter Sale and this has become my favorite piece of entertainment. I really like using the Steam controller and mapping the flippers to the big touch pads. It's much easier on my hands than the triggers and feels more natural.I have, so far...All of the Season 1 & 2 Marvel tablesPortalBalls of Glory (Family Guy, American Dad, Bob's Burgers, and Archer)South Park (Super-Sweet Pinball, Butters’ Very Own Pinball Game) All Original and Core pack tablesWith the sale, I ended up spending around $26 for 44 tables.I've focused mostly on the Marvel ones so far, and have experienced no technical issues with any of them. Some people had issues with the Spider-Man table getting the ball stuck and Deadpool crashing, but I have not experienced this (I've played the Spider-Man table quite a bit but Deadpool sparingly, so as always, YMMV).So far my favorites are:Moon Knight (good flow, great for combos… my total favorite so far)Spider-Man (I may be biased, I love Spider-Man)Infinity Gauntlet (this one is just madness)Butters’ Very Own Pinball Game (very charming) Captain America (well done theme, clear missions)The licensed tables are done very well with exception to the Marvel tables based on movies. The voice acting is horrendous and at times even distracting. I'm assuming there were legal complications with using the real actor’s voice clips, but I really think they could have done a better job. This isn't an indictment of the tables themselves, just the presentation. The others like South Park (and the rest of the cartoons) have clips from the show and are handled much better (even if they are overused a little, especially the South Park Super-Sweet Pinball).I'll start reviewing the packs individually but I wanted to give a little overview for anyone considering jumping on board. I'd recommend buying a few tables that you really want then waiting for a sale. If you get into it, you'll easily find them worth the cash, but I would never have bought as many tables as I did without the sale. I haven’t played anything pinball in years and I’m far, far, from a good player, but this is really an excellent way to wind down after a hard day and kick those stressful thoughts away.NOTE: Before posting I noticed the negative reviews due to the EULA. I’m going to look into this a bit and possibly even change my recommendation. But for now, I’m focusing on the fun stuff.			"

												PINBALL Hmmm....I started and have loved playing pinball since before arcades and video games existed. A quarter bought you 5 balls and 2 of them, bought you 3 games. Pool Halls are where you found a few machines to slap the ears and knee the coin box of your favorite machine. Yes I am that old. That being said...I have been extremely unimpressed with video recreations of pinball until now. Pinball FX2 hits the the target @ the bullseye. Zen has captured the heart of pinball in this version. The physics are spot on. The ball reacts to the flippers near perfectly. Trick shots, and saves can happen just like in real life. The ball can drain straight down the center or to the side just like the real thing. The tables....I own 12 tables as I wtite this review. I pick my tables based on playing the demo version that the game allows. I have played real life tables since the days they where more mechanical then electronic. I can tell enough, from the demo's all of the tables are heavly tested, not just for skill level but play style as well. I have found several tables that meet my taste. If you enjoy pinball you will find something in your flavor as well. PRO's:No quarters lost at the arcade.Physics are spot on. Ball behaves very much like real life pinball.Flippers are responsive, and won't wear out with time.Full controller support (Highly Recommend)Tables are exciting and themed. Tables are well tested for playability.Game is highly polished.Adjustable screen orientation. (portrait mode)Possible to demo tables before buying. CON's:No glass pops or free game pops.Some tables may be a little busy or flashy.No old school tables. with more targets, slots, pockets, or bumpers.Some of the camera follows can be abrubt and distracting. Demo's shorter then I want. (but aceptable)Some tables not available outside of packs.Start screen displays all availabe DLC.My only peeve, is the my last con. I don't want to be told my collection is incomplete, if I don't want that table. There should be a tab to display available content. I only want to see my own collection on the title screen. Ding 1 point for this infraction only.9/10 "

												Pinball FX2 is the sequel of Pinball FX for the XBox 360, thus you can play this too with the XBox 360-controller. Pinball FX2 is a great example of very cool pinball-simulators. Although the itself is free, you have to buy pinball tables first, because that's only way to actually play the game. But don't worry, those pesky microtransactions are wourth your money. The tables go around 3 bucks, and a collection of tables goes for 7 bucks (a few tables) to 11 bucks (around 5 tables). I recommend buying the Portal-, Football/Soccer-, Marvel-, and cartoon-tables (South Park, Family Guy, et cetra). Great design, good graphics (even for my crappy laptop, without lag), nice table layout. One con is, again, the fact that you have to BUY tables. 7,5/10			"

While these are not even based on real tables Pinball FX 2 brings back a lot of good memories.The physics are pretty good.  There is a lot to do on each table so they keep you entertained.  They are a pretty good price, even better when they go on sale for 75% off.  The animations and voice acting is nice.  All the tables are pretty different from each other which helps keeps things interesting.I enjoy when my friends have a table I have and we can see who has the highest score.The only thing I think I could ask for is more tables!  :)			"

I expected this game to be a free to play pinball game with the exception of a few tables you need to pay for, but the limitations on playing without paying are dreadful! Sure, your allowed to fully play all the unpayed for tables, but only for like 3 minutes before the scoring system gets deactivated! And if thats not bad enough, out of the 50+ tables there are, you only get ONE table that is completely unlocked and fully playable without limitation when you start the game! Like come on! Only ONE!!?? And you can only unlock more tables by paying $9.99 for each set of 4 tables >:( I think thats a little too greedy!			"

												I don't usually play pinball games. In fact the only ones I did play were 20 years ago on my Amiga (Pinball Fantasies, Pinball Dreams and Pinball Wizard). However, recently I bought a couple of Pinball FX2 tables in a humble bundle. I have played 5 tables so far. Here are my impressions. The good is:- It's free! You can try one table and then decide if you want more.- There are a lot of different tables available in wide range of styles.The bad is:- Paying for each table feels like a collectible game.- The difference between the tables is mostly cosmetic. This is probably an inherent problem of pinball itself.- The sound effects, especially the ones containing movie quotes and such, get old very quickly.- However, the most important problem for me is that FX2 does not feel like a real pinball table. The ball is seemingly weightless as it makes no sound when it touches a wall and it sometimes changes direction in an unrealistic way.- Also, there is a noticeable delay between pressing the button and the flippers moving, which is the worst problem a game like this can have. How can you mess up controls that basically consist of two button?All in all I would not recommend the game. Feel free to try it, but be critical and remember that the other tables are not that different from the free one.			"

												Not a bad game but you only get 1 table, no way to earn other tables other than to buy them for £1.99 each.. So don't be fooled this game is not free it's about £30. I don't recommend getting it for free unless you want to play on one table and it add's nothing new to the table :p Just a standard pinball simulator.			"

												This is a game where you simulate a dinosaur playing a pinball game.  You can't actually see that you are a dinosaur, but when you hit the flipper, there is a half-second delay before the flipper flips, simulating the time it takes for the electrical impulse to travel your behemoth carriage.  I've tried to find an option in the settings to play as a human, but no luck.  My graphics card (AMD Radeon) software ALSO doesn't seem to have the ""play as human"" option that the developers allege it does, so I guess I am stuck as a dinosaur.  Needless to say, I will never pay anything for any of these tables, because they are impossible to play.			"

												Pinball FX2 pairs classic pinball gameplay with themes from Star Wars, Marvel and more.Each table can be played for a limited period of time, so you are forced to buy tables to enjoy the whole gameplay.The look of the tables is good. The different pinball tables have variations and many of them have some little animations and action scenes. Super hero characters like the Marvel tables look like their comic book counter parts. This can be good in some instances and bad in others. The voice acting is generally good.The keyboard controls work well. The pinball action is adaptable in case you do not like the default set up. If you are a fan of Pinball games and you have some spare time, you can give Pinball FX2 a chance, but without payment, there will not be fun for long.Sounds 7/10Graphics 7/10Gameplay 8/10Atmosphere 7/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												This is quite a nice pinball-style game with many different tables available for purchase either separately or as part of a pack (both ways as DLC which merely unlocks the table already present in your installation of the game.  Each time a table is added to Pinball FX2, the size of the downloaded content increases by the size of the added table. This is because all of the tables are fully present so you can test them with certain restrictions (like time penalties, bonus penalties, etc.))Many of the tables are ""enhanced"" with features and elements that would be impractical or impossible on a physical pinball table, making them seem like more an evolution of pinball into ""Pinball with added CGI"" than what you'd find in a pinball emulator, which attempts to recreate exactly the pinball experience of imaginary or real-life pinball machines.  Some are based upon established concepts, like comics, superheroes, Star Wars, TV series, or other video games. Others are original concepts.Fortunately, you can download this game and play either Sorcerer's Lair, one of the early Pinball FX2 tables, absolutely free and unlimited in its accessibility, or you can try the other games it offers for a limited time per session (although it's been long enough since I last played Pinball FX2 that restrictions for unlicensed content might have changed).All tables, from what I've noticed, allow you, as the owner of the table, to access options presumably available to owners of actual arcade pinball machines who want to tweak their tables to bring in the most tokens or attract the highest number of players, allowing you to test the table's lights, in sections and individually, adjust difficulty, listen to sounds, change the simulated angle of the table, the weight of the balls, number of plays per credit, score listings, set it for free play, and many, many other things, as well as view the number of games played, balls played, time per ball, number of times the different kickbacks on the table have been activated in play and while what ball or feature was active, how many credits inserted, extra balls awarded, and basically get a very detailed statistical report of what has occurred with the virtual pinball table in your imaginary arcade since it was installed or since the last time you reset the table's statistics.Adjusting the options to something other than default will often disqualify your scores for inclusion on the leaderboards or for reception of some/all achievements for as long as the relevant option(s) are set to non-default setting(s).The Pinball FX2 description says the included, unlocked Sorcerer's Lair table is without restrictions with ""no timed free play session, no ads, no gimmicks.""Playing solo as I do, I have often noticed the many multiplayer benefits Pinball FX2 offers (because playing solo means I either don't appear in the listings or I'm the only player in the listings). You can play against your real-life in-person friends on the same machine in hotseat mode (like a real table), your Steam friends, or, apparently, friends you know on social networking sites, trying to best their high scores, times, achievements, etc., or merely pit yourself against the rest of the worldwide community (if you have no gamer friends who play this game or own the same tables you enjoy).(end of review 1.0)NOTE:From what I'm reading in the other reviews about the newest End User License Agreement, Pinball FX2 desires to access your social profiles for access to your linked friends and associates and IP address and device specs and location and likes and anything else that can be used to target ""tailored"" ads at you for advertising while you're playing the (hopefully UNowned) tables. Because I wouldn't link this game to any social networking sites I access, I don't see this as much of a problem. However, I have not yet read this ""new 05-2015 EULA"" so I can't comment more regarding whether I object to this ""snooping"" more than in principle. Is principle alone enough to give up a game which provides quite a bit of fun? Maybe, if it's as intrusive as some reviewers are claiming it is. Maybe not. I'll have to read the new EULA before I decide whether to change my initial review.			"

												One of my favorite games, Pinball FX2 is a hidden gem on the Steam store. I got some tables through a humble bundle and finally got around to trying it after playing some pinball at work. The game is absolutely great and each table has had a lot of time put into it. Its a super fun experience and I hope they keep making many more tables in the future.Note: I spoke with the company regarding the EULA (since there are so many reviews pointing out some of the language in it). It sounds like it was something inherited from their publisher and they're working to get the text removed.			"

												I can't say that I've played this much - only the recently introduced 'free' table - owing to the fact that for some reason (my Nvidia optimus gaming laptop w/GTX675M, or the programming itself) the flipper response is very laggy. Hell, Space Cadet on XP worked better for me than Pinball FX2. And since I couldn't find any options to adjust framerates or resolution to optimize the experience, I have uninstalled this game and will not be coming back until maybe such time as I work with discrete only graphics or we all evolve to on-die graphics.I'm aware that this isn't much of a basis for a recommendation, but if I can't play the game, I can't recommend it, even if I really wanted to love this (as I did really like Full Tilt Pinball 1 and 2 back in the day).Short summary: if you have Optimus (or maybe even AMD switchable graphics), this one could be a lemon for you.

												This game while promising a classic pinball experience has far to many bugs ""either bugs or my computer has a seizure every time the game boots up"". For one of the simplest examples the left shift smacker only works half of the time and when it does actually realise you pressed the button it is somehow lagged and will likely miss the ball. Other than that ""now at this point I may be getting nitpicky but if you actually take the time to read this far hopefully you won't mind"" there is enough going on at the board while playing at a time to warrent a seizure warning "" think I may have actually saw one on a later thought"". Seriously, to keep up with whats going on and get anything decent of a score you would have to have for a lack of better terms super human eyes. Other that that on my playthrough I realised that considering this I had no time to read the paragraphs of writing on the board I was just trying to make sure I kept up with the ball its all luck untill you've played your heart out enough countless hours to know how each event actually works. In short my many many attempts at Sorcerers Lair were as you can all now guess very frustrating having a left clicker that only works if pressed just right and lag time must be taken into consideration also trying to read what the board said was useless because by the time I've read one sentence Ive already lost the ball. And yes I know that you can take time to read over the board before shooting the ball for all those of you out there that will likely argue this for ages but lets be honest here, this is pinball, pinball. Are you really going to sitdown and spend the anywhere between 25 and 50 hours to get a grasp for one board and how it works. To summarize that idea it's not fun when you have to put more effort into your pinball knowledge than that of even the most extensive video game lore such as Skryim, nobody wants to spend the time it took them ""or at least I normally dont"" to learn the lore of a fallout game or elder scrolls raging at a pinball game. In the end though if you like challenging game and I mean like pull your hair out get up and scream at the computer for not seemingly loading the game fast enough for you to hit that perfect ball just right, this is your game, get it, play it, rage it, then become annoyed like I did and write a rant about it in you'r spare time.

Picked this up when it was on sale as it was cheap, but found out after the fact that it's missing the touchscreen integration that the Windows Store version of the same app has.  This is the fourth or fifth time I've been bit by Xen Studios's inability to do things cross platform (or even same platform) well.  Doesn't work with touchscreens, won't work on my Surface Pro in any playable fashion, and I've already bought all of this content on both my PS3 and iPhone/iPad that won't transfer between.  If you haven't ever owned this game at all before, it's worth picking up.  If you already own it on another platform or own tables somewhere else, stay far away.  If you played the demo through Windows Store and liked it, buy through Windows Store, do NOT buy through Steam, they are NOT the same game.			"

												I love a good pinball game.Unfortunately this is nothing like a good pinball game.  There is one 'free' table which changes occasionally (every month or so) and there are 21 other tables to play which lock you out after 60 seconds or 500,000 points.  When the trial is over, you are prompted to buy the board or get kicked out.Micro transactions are the pits.The paddle controls are wooden and the responsiveness of the tables leaves a lot to be desired (Just don't tilt.)  Honestly, if you are looking for a quick game of pinball, then this 1.5GB monstrosity, which is marked as ‘free’, isn’t it.The only positive elements to mention are the single ""free"" board, which is not terrible.  Purchasing the 'add-on' boards would get expensive quickly.  This is too bad really because the trial boards look interesting but 60 seconds isn't enough time to even get a feel for them and is really just frustrating.I can't recommend this game, sorry.			"

												This is a great game if you play pinball for fun and you do not take it seriously Many of the tables are over done and have animations that block your view of the ball. It's fustrating at times when the graphics are so strong that is bogs down the flipper speed and caues a miss or poorly timed shot.  I would recommend Spider-man and Fantasitc Four tables... But that is it. The rest are horrible. Imagine a table where the ball moves from a drop and bounces out on the other side of the board without any indicator to where it is going... Well, thats a common theame with this ""zen"" company.			"

Controls do not work well with an XBox360 controller - it feels like they made a half-hearted effort at adapting them and there is no ability to customize the controller mapping. No freebie tables with this one, either, so you either learn how the game works quickly or you buy a table and figure it out that way.			"

												One of the best Pinabll games on steam I'd say. Feels good to play and the tables are great. The sheer amount of options of tables is big plus. There's probably a themed table for just about everyone to enjoy.If your monitor can rotate, even better, I highly recommed this game if you enjoy pinball.			"

												Can't recommend this one unless you are desperate for more pinball (I was). It's not pinball for pinball fans, it's pinball for fans of other things who want a ""themed pinball"" experience that is forgiving, simplistic, outrageous/action packed, full of unrealistic special effects, and not comparable to real pinball in any way except in appearance and scoring. Inaccurate but predictable ball physics and poorly designed levels mean you can spend 30 minutes racking up a high score doing the exact same things over, and over, and over, and over, only to find out not only is it not a high score, but there are dozens of pinball losers out there that have played the table for LITERALLY DAYS, 24+ HOURS, to get a score so ridiculous you wonder what the point of the game might be? It isn't fun for very long, it's VERY repetitive (you get bored frequently long before you run out of balls), there's no real target to shoot for scorewise, and there are maybe 5 good tables out of the 40 or whatever that are available. Oh, and the tables: weird, weird stuff. More than half the tables are superhero themed, Marvel and such, I don't know for sure I'm a pinball fan not a comic book fan. Also a lot of Euro Football Club (FC) themed tables were just added recently. I don't know, I'm not a football fan, I'm a pinball fan. There's a Plants vs Zombies table, but I'm not a PvZ fan... I'm a pinball fan. Seeing a trend?UPDATE 10/9/2014: This week Pinball FX2 got a 3.2gb patch that added Stereo Sound. Yup, stereo sound for 3.2gb, with still no update for multi monitors, physics, pincab setups, or a huge list of other things the community has demanded for years. Deleted. For good this time.UPDATE 6/1/2015: HAHAHAHAHAH @ this new EULA. Signing away all your rights to privacy, agreeing to 3rd party targeted advertising, giving Zen unlimited freedom to do anything they want with every piece of information you supply to them while using this game or your pinball account, and even forcing you to agree to 3rd party advertising privacy policies JUST TO PLAY THE GAME? What could possibly go wrong! I haven't touched this title in ages but at least it still provides comedy from time to time. Good thing I like black humor, eh? :D			"

												The only good pinball game worldwide. Great to play, but most tables are very similar. You can purchase new tables... I think they are too expensive most of the time, but if you are a fan of a certain series (e.g. Deadpool, Avengers, Star Wars etc, then it's really fun to own tables from that series/movie.So it's definately worth the money!

												First of all, do not be fooled, this is NOT a free game and it sure is not cheap. It costs over $40 to buy complete, as it is offered one table at a time. The better tables cost as much as a complete 3-years old game on sale whereas the not so good tables are cheaper. And now for the bad news.Problem No.1: the perspective is all wrong and there is no way to fix it. The back half of the table (including the back flippers in most cases) are hidden from view. You hear sounds, you see some movement yet you have no idea what's going on. There are ways to give a forced 3D view to a simulated pinball table; unfortunately the developers missed the ball in all of them ;).Problem No.2: the physics are screwed up. A pinball game is by definition a game of split-second decisions and unpredictability (yet consistent) gravitomagnetic reactions. So, I cannot imagine how anyone can claim of having fun with a pinball game that is inconsistent in its physics.Problem No.3: the graphics are forcibly low and the resolution is not modifiable. A barely playable game that is not even a eye-candy? I am sorry but I cannot recommend this to anyone. Microsoft’s Space Cadet (not to mention Austin Powers Pinball) were far better pinball games. In all honesty, I have had more fun with pinball games on my smartphone. And I have a... Windows phone!			"

												I play this game a hell of a lot, at least by my standards, and have some 150 hours+ played... so you'd think with me playing this game so frequently, i must like it a lot, right? WRONG!This game is pretty much gaming heroin, it's got me well and truly hooked, and that is the only reason i continue playing. And i mean the ONLY reason, because despite having all the DLC tables, i vehemently detest every second i'm playing this thing. This game subjects you to unbearable frustration unlike any other. For every go you enjoy because you do well, there are around 50 goes where it makes you look and feel like you've never started the game before, you do so badly. Yes there is skill involved, but also huge amounts of luck. The number of times a potential new best score is terminated because the ball gets shot straight into an out-lane or straight between the central flippers without you having the chance to do a single thing is ridiculous. In my 150+ hours i have NEVER, not once, had a go where at least one ball wasn't totally wasted.If you do something crazy, like... oh i dunno... actually not play this game for 1 day, then that is long enough to ensure you become so rusty you play like a total first-timer. Or if you do something truly masochistic, like play this game every day, it will still go in cycles so you once again go back to playing like a total first-timer. Except, of course, now you have your own personal high scores that show to you how well you should be at this game, as you struggle to barely reach 5% of that high score in your next 50+ attempts.This game is NOT fun, it is NOT enjoyable, but you WILL constantly play it because it hooks you almost immediately. The base game with first table is free and you can try all other available tables for a short time before buying them as DLC's. But spare yourself endless frustration and don't try it! I hate this game with a passion and wish i had never found it on here!And before people comment saying i only hate this game because i'm crap at it, with only 2 exceptions every one of my high scores on all current tables (so on 41 of the 43 tables at the time of writing) are within the top 10%, so my intense loathing of this game is nothing to do with me being crap at it.

												I've always loved pinball. As a child, I'd always gravitate to them and feed as many quarters in their gullet as my parents would provide. I loved the sounds, the feel of the flippers, the glittering LED screens and flashing lights. The time was over too quickly. So when I saw the free-to-play Pinball FX2 hit Steam, I downloaded it immediately. It's easy to understand the notion of FX2: a digital platform for tables that are too fantastical for the real world. It's a great idea. But it doesn't quite deliver. The tables are imaginative, bright and colorful, and sometimes unique. Something is missing, though. Something that's hard to explain. I think it all boils down to three main problems: sound, physics, and table design.Part of the splendor of pinball is the pings, pongs, bings, clanks, and bangs of the steel bearing flying around the arena. In large part, those tiny sounds are simply not present. You hit a target, and you hear nothing. Some flippers don't flip. The ball pangs off of a bumper, and the sound is stunted and dull. Even the ball itself sounds like a hollow piece of hardwood. It's not right. It's not the pinball I know. The sound is bad, but the physics add another layer of non-realism to the escapade. The ball tends to accelerate too quickly. When it hits a lower bumper, it barely makes it to the adjacent. It's as if the ball itself is tired. If you hit a ramp without enough speed, there's no hangtime. It almost immediately reverses direction and comes back at you with full force. It feels completely wrong.The tables generally look spactacular at first glance. Characters are animated, the lights are in the right places, and there are decorative nuances that look great. It's mostly window dressing. Once the ball is launched, you immediately notice problems. Most tables lack a proper skillshot, or the ball simply shoots across the table into a boring location only to be flipped back up into a myriad of lazy ramps. And boy do the designers love ramps. Several tables are almost completely composed of them. Ramps are a core part of pinball, but there needs to be balance. You need targets, flippers, spinners, bumpers, and above all: goals.All of the tables have goals. They are just hard - or frustrating - to find. They need to be more obvious. It's no fun to throw the ball around for 10 minutes without hearing a single mission from the horribly acted announcers. When you manage to find one, they don't pay off. There's no feel of advancement.I had high hopes. Probably too high. Pinball FX2 didn't deliver.There is a game, though, for my fellow pinball fans: Pinball Arcade (also on Steam). You get one table free and are able to try any of the rest until you hit a reasonable score cap. Each table is painstakingly digitalized from a real, beloved machine. And it shows. The care taken into recreation is obvious at every turn. The physics are -perfect-. The tables, in general, are a complete blast to play. The snippets of history attached before you play a table makes you fully understand the attention the developers put into the game of pinball. They love it in real life and wanted to express it digitally. They fully succeeded. The tables are pricy, but entirely worth the money.Play Pinball Arcade. Don't play FX2.			"

												This is probably the most blatant use of ""free-to-play"" I've ever seen. You can only play one table. That's it. Just one. At least Pinball Arcade also threw in a free table you could play for a month. But this one gives you no sort of freebie. And the one table you CAN play is rather bleh IMO.I played the table a couple times and it got boring quickly. The voices are obnoxious and the music was kinda bland. Sure there were extra ""mini tables"" but I got ejected back to the main table before I could even figure out what I was supposed to do! Give me a redo for the love of God!The fact that all of the tables cost over $100 just makes me want to bang my head on a wall. I could use that money to buy all the games on my Wishlist and still have money left over!All I want out of Steam is a non-demo free game that doesn't contain microtransactions to unlock other features. I'm very low on funds and I'm trying to use it wisely, but is a Steam game that doesn't ask for money every five seconds too hard to make? If you want a decent Steam pinball game, go with Pinball Arcade. Not this Marvel-whoring, money-grabbing game.			"

												Light on Pinball, heavy on FX.If you spend time around real pinball games (or emulators like Pinball Arcade), you'll soon realize that this game doesn't capture the true pinball experience at all. Tilting seems like an afterthought, and the progression through the tables using flippers seems unnatural; as if it would be better served with a game controller in your hands.In short, if you're a pinball fan, keep looking.

What's free is a single table - there are currently 42 more, but you'll have to pay to unlock them, and in my opinion, they're too expensive, at least if you want a few more that a couple singles. And the free table isn't particularily good either, so spending money on something that may or may not be better, isn't tempting.			"

												Probably the worst pinball game I have ever played. Firt off there is an unnaturally long delay between pushing your buttons and seeing something happen on the table. It's something like 0.2 to 0.3 seconds which in any multiplayer FPS would be an extreme lag. The ball is also quite erratic. It can speed up to maybe triple speed for no reason (until it properly hits something, then it resets back to normal). It may also slow down quite a lot without any proper reason and then again reset back to normal after a proper hit. There's something horribly wrong with the physics engine. Sometimes the ball may just also lose all momentum by having a slight touch to some element. I've played horribly many various pinballs during my about 30 year gaming career but never seen a pinball with this many Oddities.Also many tables have too much visual clutter that makes it much more difficult to spot either the balls or targets to shoot at but that is nothing new in the genre.

												They ALMOST get it right, with one game breaking problem: The simulator doesn't respond realistically as far as ball spin is concerned. It's too sensitive to it, making the ball behave in unexpected and unpredictable ways, resulting in more of a game of chance than a game of skill (which is what pinball is supposed to be).			"

												Way too difficult and time-consuming to be worth playing.I have about 20 tables that I've picked up through sales and such over time. Sure, the game involves batting a ball around. Sure, you get points. But this is about as much pinball as Sonic Spinball was. Every single table has a ridiculously drawn out set of goals you have to meet to get anywhere near the final mode. How is anyone supposed to clear Fear Itself, Inifinity Gauntlet, or Star Wars Ep. 4 within any kind of reasonable time? Look at classic pins like Addams Family, Twilight Zone, Monster Bash, Tales of the Arabain Nights, or Theatre of Magic. Someone who knows what they're doing can get through all of the modes and into the wizard mode with about 15 minutes of playing. When I go to YouTube, every single table's wizard mode takes at least 50 minutes to over an hour of (what I assume to be) truly excellent playing. Star Wars Ep. 5? Gotta get through six separate stages of three checkpoints each. Fear Itself? Hope you like clearing the... seven(?) worthies. Don't mess up that last shot, or you have to start the whole mode over. Infinity Gauntlet? THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE ALIVE TODAY THAN HAVE EVER DIED. DID YOU KNOW THAT? ADAM WARLOCK WILL MAKE SURE YOU DON'T FORGET. I tried changing the difficulty of the tables, but I don't see that it does anything. Some ball saver time limits might be increased, but the modes aren't any easier to complete. You'd think that somewhere around ""very easy"", they'd do something like allow you to pick up where you left off during a given mode. Timeshock, Big Race USA and Fantastic Journey by Pro Pinball are great examples of challenging games with reasonable goals and measureable progress through them. I want to like these tables. I really do. They're all good-looking and some of them are pretty clever. But holy balls, they take forever to feel like you've accomplished anything. Some people might say ""Learn to play, noob. These tables are meant to be hard."" I counter that there's a sport called Takraw which is like volleyball with nothing but bicycle kicks. It's a ridiculuosly hard sport to play. Does that make it the best sport in the world? Is Checkers better than Chess? Is American Football better than Soccer? More difficult doesn't make something better.			"

												1 table is free. Its a generic haunted house table which I actually found enjoyable. However this 1 free table is actually at the end of the list of tables. That means you have to scan your eyes across everything you're missing out before you see it, the one table without a keyhole over it. Remember this, you get 1 free table, now open the DLC list on the store page. $136.73, that's actually how much this game costs. And the thing is, I might have given this game a good review if there were 5, maybe even 10 free tables, but to give 1 free table? Not only is it a slap in the face but for 1 table you might as well download windows pinball, the physics are better and its an overall better table than the free one.			"

												It's a game where you have different mostly static levels, you control boost pads that give a polished metal sphere power to advance upward. Gravity will pull this sphere down again and you have to keep hitting it with the triangular boost pads at the right angle to get a high score. All the while preventing the sphere from slipping through your boost pads, which will result in you losing a life.Sadly this game doesn't have windowed or borderless windowed support, causing graphical artifacts on my multi-GPU rig. I have to give it a down vote for this, but I will change this as soon as the borderless windowed patch is released. "

												PFX2 is excellent.  There are companies making full sized pinball tables (look up Watson's in Cincinnati) which you stand at and play like the real machines.  This will be my 2016 project.  And Zen/Microsoft knows it!  They just added 'cabinet support' to allow multiple screens for the playfield, backglass, and LCDs to make the stand up game.  I've played PFX2 on my computer for a couple of years now, and I have had the luck of running into a stand up pinball machine converted to play these tables - and it is incredible.  Picture driving a Nascar game and then sitting in one and taking a few laps.....but forget all that if you have no chance at building a table or buying one.  It is still, hands down, the best pinball experience you will have on your PC.  I personally am a pinball junkie and have Pinball Arcade, Future Pinball, and VpinMAME on my machine.  Each one has things I like about them.  VpinMAME and Pinball Arcade will scratch every old-school itch you could have (for us who grew up in arcades), but FP has more updated graphics and opened up new, creative table design.All this said, PFX2 has THE best looks of all of them, way more game feel - like you are playing a multi-tiered video game while you're playing pinball, the 2010+ vs. the 1970s/80s feel, and is priced like they just want to share a bite of their pizza instead of trying to get me to buy the whole thing.The EULA is NOTHING.  It is no different than any other software I've installed, or anyone has, and any reviewer mentioning it has lost their mind or is working for a competitor.  The fact taht I am typing this in STEAM on Windows 7 means I've at very least signed two EULAs.  (and many more)  No one is soliciting me or has any more of my info than anyone using Windows, or a debit card, or living in the 20th century.The other 'issue' is that Zen identified an exploit which allowed PC users to use an auto program to hit a key and guarantee a lost ball save (from the center drain).  They fixed it and reset the wizard scores since several people found and used the hack to act as if they were pinball gods.  Do not let that be a second's thought in deciding to purchase the game!  An athelete who tests positive for steroids will try to go down kicking and fighting instead of coming clean.  It hurts their pride...  That is ALL that the reset complaints are about.  (it's hard to believe that it was mentioned since it zeroed in on the 'roiders'')I wrote all of this because I understand hard work - and have lived with weak whiners who didn't get their simple way trying to discredit my efforts because it went against their path of least resistance.PFX2 is free to get into!  That rocks alone.  You can stop right there if you choose - with no problem at all.  If you like it, like I do , you can choose any other table to buy and play.They made this a no-brainer, and a couple of pirates and hackers get to post against the game here (because this is the USA and we cater to cry-babies).  The game is more than solid and worth the free price.  Man, have fun with it...  How a few people are painting it as some conspiracy is as stupid as you get.			"

												I dont get this game, I play from a couch on a big 50 inch tv, and it doesnt play very well, zoomed out and its too far away, zoomed in and you cant tell where the ball is going.  Am I supposed to turn my tv on the side because the left and right which are half the screen arent even used for actual gameplay.The ball physics are terrible, I've never seen a pinball fly around like crazy like it does here.  Its so fast it could break the speed of sound, its not pinball as much as its pinball on steroids and the guy hitting the flippers has roid rage, every hit of the flipper sends the fall flying as fast as possible.  This pinball game is an oddity of science if they actually moved that way, if the ball was moving that fast and speeding up, its insane, since its free its something to be seen.  The camera moves so fast if you choose any other angle I found than top down or far away that there is no chance of hitting the ball if its zoomed in.Most of the tables my ball will often just fall down the middle, all that stuff on the table is like angled to shoot the ball right down the middle.  Some of the tables it feels like only one side of the table is relevant, with ramps while the other side seems useless, why have it there at all?  The ball is lost so much its gets tiresome having to keep relaunching the ball, adding an auto ball launcher option woulda been nice, but it isnt there and never will be so its just annoying.Rating:  2/10  Value:  $0.99 per table			"

I think the different tables are overpriced, but that's just me.  Would only buy a new table on sale.  But back to the controls.  Without more responsive controls, what could have been an outstanding game, is knocked out of contention.  I have a top notch system, and tried turning down all graphics options, only to still have the same latency on the controls.  For me, because of the slow responding controls, I find this to be unplayable.  Would not recommend this game as it stands right now.			"

												Playing on the ARSENAL pinball.Its is super league but has no playable single player competition, I think you have to finish a match to progress but thats very hard not done it yet.You can play in super league mode only with friends and that's not always possible. The game has some nice features but the ball is down on your flipper way to much and the feature two ball muti-ball stops you scoring sometimes. The scoring, well its very hard for you and easy for them, this is the most hated part of the game and is the main reason why this table doesn't work.One of the features (dugout) is close to the flippers and returns the ball out at speed direct onto your flipper, you have no chance in seeing what award you have earned.Have played for 4 hours now and I am frustrated with it but for £2.00 not that bad, it could have been so much better. A attempt by Americans to understand football/soccer, like Arsenal its sometimes boring.The other themed boards seem be better, gameplay, sound and graphics can be very good, choose wisely.			"

This is one of the best, if not THE BEST pinball games I have ever played in my 25 years of gaming. It's evident that a lot of thought/work was put into the aesthetics/design of each table on offer and you'll want to play them all, as they all have unique quirks/mini-games. Fantastic graphics, ball physics and fun/engrossing table mini-games ensure you will keep coming back to this one again and again. "

The tables are decently priced, you only have to play one 5 times or so to get arcade value out of it, every play past that is a bonus (even better if you catch a sale).My only problem with it is it that sometimes the lights flashing is a bit too much and makes it impossible to tell where the ball is.Also, the Rome table is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												The best binball game on PC hands down! Yes, it is that good.It runs great, it looks great, it is fun. It is addictive. A great game to play with friends locally. This is clearly made by people who loves pinball games. I have always dreamed about having my own pinball game, and I love to play the real ones when possible. But this is almost as good as the real deal, and it also adds some things that a real pinball machine would not be able to do. But all with taste and reason. It really sounds and feels like a real pinball machine.You get one table for free, so you could say that the game is free. This free table is totally ok in fact, and then you can demo all the other tables as well (as many times as you want), which is fun even though you can't play that long. Look out for deals for the other tables though if you are interested and have little cash, they come frequently. Besides, they are not that much for the full price, and they are really good and quite deep. It takes a while to really learn and master each table. But this game is also perfect for just a quick casual game when you have 5 minutes. But watch out, or that 5 minutes will become 30 minutes before you know it. It is quite addictive.The game works great with the keyboard, but I noticed it works even better with the controller, because of an added analog feel, and some feedback.You should not have any problem running this on most PCs but it still looks really nice. This is an honest well made game, and for what you get the price is totally just. If you like pinball you won't regret buying a few of the tables, guaranteed.			"

												The PC pinball game that rules them all, FX2 delivers a satisfaction that can only be surpassed by a full physical pinball table (and a lot of bells and whistles that a real table can't deliver). While the free table is fine, it's the other full-featured tables that make this a gem of a game. Notable standouts are the Epic Quest and Paranormal tables, as well as the Avengers and Star Wards table bundles. Highly recommended if you have any kind of interest in pinball.			"

Some are better than others which is the case with about everything and a lot of the missions are very fun to play and try to activate.  Fun to play on my custom arcade cabinet with friends.  Look for onlinegamer1's review which is me if you want a more in-depth review.  Games were so fun that I made a second steam account and re-bought all the tables to use on a dedicated hyperpin machine I will be building soon.Highly recommended for the sheer fun of it.  If you a diehard purist than look elsewhere.  Best money I have spend on games in years.  Gets more play than my ps4, xbox one and wii u.			"

												Owning all the tables on nearly every available platform is a testiment in itself to how good this game is.  Ignore complaints of being charged with tables after beingg baited by a ""free"" game... is this not the trend now...?  In fact, Zen has followed this model for years, and this should be expected as such.  Certainly you will get a table for free, but they provide quality demos of each table for individuals to make their own decisions and pay for the ones the choose.  Beyond that, the tables are loosely inspired by real world tables, and carry some elements of love from their reality based counterparts, though they may not be recognizable to a younger generation (those who grew up in the absence of real tables).  The physics are getting better, but this is more of a fantasy simulation pinball.  If you are expecting anything more, than look to Pinball Arcade, a worthy mention replicating real tables.  Zen has managed to produce Pinball tables that have great rule sets, awesome challenges, and offer hours of fun, depth, skill development, and will rank you on leaderboards.  Seriously, Zen tables run about $3.00 a table.  In my experience, that is $3.00 of happiness.  Not all tables are winners, that's why they offer demos, but there's bound to be a table that everyone who claims to be a pinball fan can enjoy.  Why are you still reading...?   Give Zen a whirl, and try a table or two.  At the end of the day, you will have likely spent more money on your lunch, coffee, or some App on a phone you may hardly use.  Obviously I am a fan; however, I am a fan because the tables are worth the time.  Few games have the ability to earn my time, and like all good things... Zen will keep you coming back if you let it.			"

												So I've logged quite a few hours in this so far, especially if you account for the hours I've spent playing the Android equivalent, Zen Pinball HD. If you're looking for a solid pinball game on PC, I'd recommend starting here - the variety of tables for the prices is pretty darn reasonable, considering each play on a physical table would be $.25 - $.75, and even then there's no guarantee your playtime will be worth that much. And I'm usually not too big on paid DLC in games, but this is one of the few cases where there's actually a good reason for it, and it legitimately extends the game's value when purchased.TL;DR: Solid PC pinball if you don't want to mess around with configuring simulators like Visual Pinball.

												Good quality pinball game, one of the best out there for pinball gamers. There are many different pinball tables to try or buy, some sold in groups if you get it through Steam. The only down side in my opinion is the achievements, they are not that easy to accomplish. Since it is not easy to acquire all of the achievements of a pinball table, when or if you do achieve it then Steam should unlock a new pinball table for free. (one that you do not already have) until you have all the pinball tables. Otherwise why have achievements on pinball game at all.			"

Pure, fun, addictive pinball, just as it was in the arcade, with certain elements of the game impossible on a real life pinball machine (like melting a ball in a cauldron for a locked ball).Here's the good -Lots of different tables, all with a unique feel and story.Physics are quite realistic.Graphics are mostly good, save for some (small, unobtrusive) ugly textures.You can save at any point by just hitting escape and quitting the game, and restart at that exact point, even mid ball!Here's the bad - I don't really see anything that stands out as bad with this game.I highly recommend this game to anyone that has even a passing interest in pinball, or wants something casual that has a competitive element to it. Do yourself a favor and buy this game.			"

												Best Pinball game outhere. The problem is that it has some quirks regarding installation or input lag (for many people including me). You can overcome those by looking in the forums but not everybody can do that, plus you SHOULDNT have to do that. If you are able to look around for solutions to that problems, the game is very enjoyable with lots of tables to choose from (provided that you buy them of course)			"

As it's pinball and then some!Trying to play open the tables is or can be tricky but well worth the effort! Graphics look nice, on themed tables most are spot on.Although some of the movements from the characters interfere with the ball. But wait for a sale, no way i would be this positive at full price.

												i am not addicted to this game, but there are some well designed tables i'd happily lose quarters to in an arcade if that arcade also serves alcohol. however, some tables are so overly busy that you'll accidentally lose balls with frustrating frequency while other tables seem designed so as to remove the accident. even then, most tables have an interesting mini-game gimmick which sets it apart from the others.

												Surely you remember Space Cadet, right? That silly little pinball game that came pre-installed with Windows XP? Oh how you could spend hours knocking that little steel ball around, becoming ever more obsessed with beating your own high score.Consider yourself in luck; Pinball FX2 really brings pinball into the age of modern gaming! The visual effects are superb, the physics are expertly designed, and all the lights, sounds, bells, and whistles you would expect from a real pinball machine; and all of it beautifully modeled and rendered in 3D, unlike our dearly missed 2D pinball table of years gone by.Add to that a continuously growing library of tables to choose from; there's the Sorcerer's Lair table that has you wondering a haunted mansion as two kids work together to defeat the evil sorcerer that dwells within as you fight your way through skeletons, spiders, and ghouls; perhaps you'll even meet a friendly ghost to help show you the way; this table is detailed and life-like enough to make you think you're really at the arcade. There are also impossible ""fantasy"" tables, like Star Wars: Starfighter Assault; your table floats above a planet as you fight for either the Galactic Empire or the Rebel Alliance; one minute you're launching your ball at the bumpers, the turbolasers on top of them blasting away at X-Wings flying above the table, the next minute you find your Star Destroyer in a heated broadside with a Rebel Star Cruiser, launching your ball into the ramps to launch fighters at the enemy; switching over to fight for the Rebels, you'll even find yourself at the controls of your X-Wing, defending your capital ships by using the flipper buttons to steer your fighter and the launch button to shoot down TIE Fighters; keep up the good work, and you may even find yourself escorting the Millenium Falcon as you attack the second Death Star above Endor. There's plenty to choose from with several more Star Wars themed tables, lots of Marvel tables featuring characters like Wolverine, Iron Man, Ghost Rider, The Avengers, and the Fantastic Four just to name a few, and even a generous selection of completely original themed tables; but no matter what you decide to play, every table presents a unique set of challenges and play quite differently from one another; and all of them are just as fun and addictive as you'd hope they'd be.What Zen Studios have done here is not just make a pinball game, they've hand-built a pinball machine in the virtual space; if you find the factory settings a bit too challenging, you can go into the Operator's Menu where you can adjust the field pitch so the ball rolls down slower, and change all kinds of difficulty settings. While you're there, you may even want to do a light and sound test to kinda get a ""behind the scenes"" look at the inner workings of every table.See a table you're interested in, but not quite sure you want to commit? You're free to take every table out for a trial play, to see if you like the table before adding it to your collection.Pinball FX2 may seem like little more than a nostalgia trip for those of us that grew up playing that silly little 2D pinball game on our Windows computers, and to an extent it is; but it's more than that, Pinball FX2 is really what we wanted that old Windows pinball game to be all along.

												While some of the tables aren't as fun or well balanced as others, overall I think this game is top-knotch!  It has great mechanics, super awesome animations and especially with the Star Wars packs it's really got some need choices and different stuff I haven't seen in other pinball games.  I love pinball.

												Download this for free and get the full Sorcerer's Lair board for free. The board's theme is a little cheesy, but it'll give you an idea of what to expect from Pinball FX2. Each board is fairly unique. I picked up the Star Wars: Balance of the Force Pack at 75%, and the 3 boards you get are very well designed and quite different from each other. The Starfighter Assault board really stands out, each mission has great visuals showing starfighter battles fighting over your board and the battles are dictated by you hitting the correct lit lanes and holes. Each board also has great mini-pinball boards and minigames. If you have any love for pinball, this is definitely worth picking up and buying a board pack or two.			"

												An enjoyable diversion.  Not as difficult as actual pinbal tables (or the tables in pinball arcade), but they were designed to be fun and thematic rather than to eat quarters.  On the positive side there is one completely free table and you can also play any table as much as you want for free (but it wont keep track of high scores or achievements).  On the negative side, since part of the game is free to play, that means if you use steam family sharing, the game will have none of the tables you purchased on the main account, so you have to buy tables for each account you want to use it with.  I use a second account for steam family sharing on my laptop as a convenience, but for this game, its an annoynce, but the game itself is good.  In particular I recoment the core pack as I enjoy the rome and secrets of the deep tables.			"

												Pinball FX2 is the best pinball game I've ever played. There is another competitor, but their games are to the T perfect replications of the originals. If that's what you want its great, and don't get me wrong, there is hours upon hours of fun to be had there. But Pinball FX2 takes that same fun and adds on it, with more diverse tables and infinitely better graphic styling it makes the overall fun factor of the game higher as a result. Pinball FX2 is just a blast from the past, arcade style. And isn't that what we all grew up on anyway? :D			"

												Excellent Pinball games.I never got into Pinball games, however seeing this on humble bundle couldn't ressist and I'm really happy I didn't!First of all the game looks and controlls really well and the ball physics seem to be spot on. Ball is heavy and whenever manages to translate those hits in a really satisfactional way.Tables they are great, themed really well and all play really differently while more or less keeping the same core of the game. furthermore they are different enough to justify the 3$~ tag on each one. This all being said I still feel that the game is lacking in Leaderboard(it exists but seems to be really underdeveloped) or something to spice games up. There is however a tournament mode, but in my week time with the game it was never online.Either way I would really recommend give it a go, they have 1 table free which quite decent and you can demo all of the other tables after you get bored with that one and find out which one is worth that low price of 3$~!

												Man, when I originally played the Windows Pinball game back in the 2000's, I never thought I'd find another decent free Pinball game. When I started FX2, I was greeted by the single table that sat before me. (Ok, so there are transactions to get your tables, so what? You'd blow more quarters at real Bally tables than you would buying these tables. Besides, I bought mine through Zen Studios' Humble Weekly sale.) I started the table up, and I instantly felt the nostalgia. The score board in the corner made me feel like I was actually playing at a real table. The graphics were insanely impressive; again, appearing almost as a real table. I put it aside though, because playing the same table did get boring.Though, when I started playing the new tables after the Weekly Sale, I fell in love. Avengers table, with the movie characters as balls? Yes. This. I loved this. Each set table had it's own ups and downs, (and to be honest, I haven't even finished playing all these tables yet) but I'm anxious to get more without shelling out coin. I'd really like to see Zen put out a free table, say for a week. This way, players would get a sense of what tables they'd like to buy. "

												If you have even the smallest love for the lights, sounds, and action of pinball games then this is the virtual pinball to get. Sure, the DLC is a little expensive ($10), and you don't get a base game as of my writing this, but it usually works out to be $2.50 a table for most packs (3-4 tables for $10, less if you buy on sale). You can tweak the tables yourself and the best part is not having to replace the globes and expensive parts of a real pinball machine or have it gather dust  and rust in your garage. Here's hoping Steam sees the tables XBLA has!Fantastic pinball sim; 9/10.1.1GB download.			"

												My first try to review a game. Sorry if my English isn't all that.GrafixDo what they have to do. They are what you can expect of this kinda games. No framedrops, some nice fx (like the trails the balls have), although they can get a little bit overwhelming. Thor's cape hiding the playing field, some Avenger balls that give some funky effect you have to get used to, but overall a 9/10. SoundEvery table has it's own soundset. This gives you a lot of variation in your audible experience. Sometimes the tables keep repeating themselves. Mister Banner, we know they killed your wife & unborn child, enough already! But this comes with this kind of game. 8/10. I missed the voices of the original actors in the Star Wars or Marvel tables.GameplayIt's pinball. Does everything what you want of a pinballgame. Personally I like my tables very life like. So turning a table upside down or the crazy animations (characters flying or throwing stuff all over the table) weren't really necesarry. But it adds a nice over the top feel that some of us will appreciate. You also can keep playing this game. Either to improve your own personnal score, local or on the leader boards, or to see if you are a better player then one of your friends. 9/10OverallYou like pinball? You'll like this game. Unsure? Play the demotables. You'll see that you want to keep playing just to see what the tables have to offer. Multiballs, over the top animations, really great arcadegameplay. Live from DoobyValley I'll give this a solid 8.5/10.			"

I thought it would be a mild amusement for a few minutes, and then I started losing hours...There is a free table you can play without paying for anything, Sorceror's Lair. It's very well designed and one of the better ones in the game, in my opinion, and you should be able to base your opinion on whether or not the game is for you on that alone.If you choose to spend money at that point you can unlock the other tables either one-by-one or through packs of 4. I've had the most fun with the Core pack and the Mars table. "

												This is an excellent pinball game. Each of the tables has a very unique feel and style. Each one has it's own theme with different play mechanics. The audio for the game is beautiful, hearing the pinball rolling on the table just feels so satisfying. Pinball FX2 also has some decent online features as well, you can compare your score with the world, and your friends. The game will let you know which of your friends has the highest score on a table so you can try to beat it. Since the base table for the game is free I'd really recommend at least trying out the game. Just remember that some of the purchasable tables such as Epic Quest, are much more entertaining than just the default one.Although the game may only come with one table, and the other ones may be slightly expensive, I'd recommend picking them off whenever any of them are on sale.

I started playing with the free table (sorcerers lair) and found that I still loved pinball, this game is what you would expect and want from a pinball game only with the added twist of things like ghost popping up and having to shoot them for extra points, which I think makes the game alot mroe fun. So far I can't find any negatives about this game.It is the best pinball game I have played and would highly recommend it to any pinball fan, to th people who don't like pinball I would still recommend they give this ago seen as its free.

In fact, it's very much like an arcad, in that some of the tables tend to launch the ball out of ramps and holes right into the drain.That said, It's still worth getting, if only for the free table.  If you want more variety, I suggest getting one of the marvel table packs to start with.			"

												Pinball FX2 looks great, plays mostly great, and sounds great.  Most of the tables are very well designed and lots of fun to play.  ""Epic Quest"" is by far my favorite.I have just a few minor gripes:- the menus / UI are kind of clumsy and cluttered- a few tables are very poorly designed and not much fun- they forgot one major feature: online multiplayer!  Seriously...Overall, I like it a lot.  There is one really annoying bug though, that will cause the game to lag and stutter until you change your Nvidia/AMD control panel settings to ""Max prerendered frames = 1"".  It's lame that the game doesn't do this by itself, but I'm guessing they used some cheap 3D middleware that doesn't let them tweak that properly.And really, no online multiplayer ?  It does show your friends' high scores but they could have at least let us play against each other in real-time (while heckling over the voice mic, of course).			"

So you don't have to spend 50$, you also can enjoy this for the price of one pack... This can also satisfy your thirst for pinball...  Just had one crash during reading of table description... but you don't have to read the description to play, you'll find out how the combos work without reading it... so enjoy the game...			"

Look for onlinegamer1's review which is me if you want a more in-depth review.  Games were so fun that I made a second steam account and re-bought all the tables to use on a dedicated hyperpin machine I will be building soon.Highly recommended for the sheer fun of it.

The graphics and sound are seriously good and all in all, this is an excellent gaming purchase.

												Pinball FX2 is da blast! Try the free tables and see for yourself! It's quite easy to learn but tough enough to master to keep you hooked for a while. The tables are beautifully crafted and the sound fx are really nice. Some voice samples are a bit off and can get a bit annoying on some tables when you hear them multiple times. On another note you can't control the power of you paddle hits - it's always a full stroke. For me it's no issue - the game is great as it is! Hunting highscores while competing with your friends is a lot of fun :)			"

												Very fun if you like pinball at all, and you can have fun without paying a cent. There's a lot of variation in table complexity and gameplay quality, even within the DLC packs themselves. I'd like to pay one price and get every table ever. You could go with free platforms like Virtual Pinball, Pinmame, Future Pinball. They have numerous tables, both emulated from real tables and new designs. But they're not on Steam and can be finicky.If the tables lack perfect physics, they make up for it with interesting features not commonly found in physical tables. In some cases they would be impossible on a real table, but they still retain the character and flavor of real pinball. The character animations, mini-games, and side-tables give you a lot to look at and do while you master a table. I can't always get a perfect camera angle it seems, so head tracking/oculus rift would help bridge the gap between this and real machines.			"

												Got a bunch of tables with the Humble bundle and went back and got the other Tables as well, i was increadibly impressed by the detail and replayability of each of the tables each one can provided hours of enjoyment with achievements and objectives in each on, plus if you like leaderboards (even if only with just your friends) it is great will tell you in game when and if you beat a friend and how close you are to it!

												I got this game on sale and sunk a lot of money into the various awesome tables (my personal favorites being the Plants Vs. Zombies , Ghost Rider, and Nicolai Tesla tables. The game very accurately recreates the fun and addictiveness of actual pinball and you can even shake the table! Most of the fun comes from having and buying various tables but most of them are cheap and you even get a free table when you start. If you want a fun game to pass time with where you can simply shut your brain down for a bit then I would definitely download this, plus you can't beat a free game so check it out!			"

You only buy the tables you like, which are usually 10 bucks for a set of 4 or 6 tables.Compatible with xbox controllers.			"

												I'm a huge enthusiast of pinball games. This game has cool features but so far the playability sucks. The flippers takes an eternity to trigger after I already hit the button 2 seconds ago. I have played some more rounds and the flippers lag is the worst I have ever seen in any virtual pinball in all my life. HORRIBLE!!!OK. After looking at the forums I found this http://steamcommunity.com/app/226980/discussions/0/666827315349070543/This fix the input lag, but it is bad that Microsoft doesn't fix this and you have to do it by tweaking your video card setting for this game.

In fact, it's very much like an arcad, in that some of the tables tend to launch the ball out of ramps and holes right into the drain.That said, It's still worth getting, if only for the free table.  If you want more variety, I suggest getting one of the marvel table packs to start with.			"

												The best pinball simulator out there, interesting tables, each with differents mechanics, from classic zen pinball tables to more commercial tables with themes of marvel superheroes, but all with complex and interesting designs.The only flaw i saw for this game is that you have to buy the tables, and those are no cheap, if you wanna buy all the tables it will cost you more than buy a diferent game, but if you are into pinball simulators is it worth the money.P.D. The steam version of this game has the sorcerer´s lair table for free, so if you are not sure is it worthy give it a try.Pros: It will cost considerably less than buy a real pinball tableCons: It will cost you considerably more than buy any other games (if you want a considerably large collection of tables)			"

												This is a pretty good pinball game. There is one free table and a load of others you have to pay for. You can play a very brief demo of each of the paid for tables. But this does not give you much time to get into the game. This game brought back happy memories of the space cadet pinball on Windows XP. And much like that game if you just try to keep the ball in play there is little excitement but once you realise there are missions it opens up a whole new level of enjoyment. The graphics are very nice and there is a hidden extra table activated by certain missions. It takes a long while to get the hang of what to do and I image it would take a hell of a long time to master it. The free table is probably good for a few hours entertainment but it didn't persuade me to part with any money to play the paid for tables.			"

												Excellent original pinball tables that play like real tables while still taking a few liberties that could only be done in the virtual world. Excellent pinball physics; you can almost ""feel"" the weight of the ball. The sounds and music are superb as well and they make great use of assets on the licensed theme tables (such as the Star Wars tables). The game includes one free table and it is not simply a throwaway, it is a lot of fun to play. You also get a short amount of demo playtime on many of the other purchasable tables so there is no risk in trying this one out whether you love pinball or you're trying it for the first time.			"

												A great re-creation of pinball physics and 'gimmicks' (multiball, video modes, Magna Save, even TILTing), while raising the bar in a way that a real pinball cannot (moving characters, disappearing balls, one table even plays upside-down as part of a multiball mode!).  The collection is currently split three ways - a Star Wars theme, a Marvel Comics theme, and a more 'traditional' collection that evokes fond memories of real 'pins while being unique in their own way.The first table - Sorcerer's Lair - is completely free, so go ahead and give it a shot (it's my second favorite table, after Paranormal).

												If you like Pinball you love Pinball FX2. The tables look a bit expensive but they are worth the money. In almost every table you have different modes like multiball, hurry ups and much more. each table has different tasks you can complete to gain more points or multiplicators.  All tables are made with the love and details of real Pinball machines.In the Star Wars EP4 (one of the complexest Pinball machines I saw) you have to complete 6 ""movie scenes"" in which you shoot the ball at different bumpers or hit a flying T-Fighter and such things. if you complete all 6 scenes you can unleash a super mode which also is available in other tables.for the beginning i recommand the core and classic pack. also the paranormal table I really like because it's a slow Pinball machine and its not to complicated to start. also it has a few ""paranormal"" things like the upside down flipper.I guess it's one of the best Pinball games in it's history			"

												Owning all the tables on nearly every available platform is a testiment in itself to how good this game is.  Ignore complaints of being charged with tables after beingg baited by a ""free"" game... is this not the trend now...?  In fact, Zen has followed this model for years, and this should be expected as such.  Certainly you will get a table for free, but they provide quality demos of each table for individuals to make their own decisions and pay for the ones the choose.  Beyond that, the tables are loosely inspired by real world tables, and carry some elements of love from their reality based counterparts, though they may not be recognizable to a younger generation (those who grew up in the absence of real tables).  The physics are getting better, but this is more of a fantasy simulation pinball.  If you are expecting anything more, than look to Pinball Arcade, a worthy mention replicating real tables.  Zen has managed to produce Pinball tables that have great rule sets, awesome challenges, and offer hours of fun, depth, skill development, and will rank you on leaderboards.  Seriously, Zen tables run about $3.00 a table.  In my experience, that is $3.00 of happiness.  Not all tables are winners, that's why they offer demos, but there's bound to be a table that everyone who claims to be a pinball fan can enjoy.  Why are you still reading...?   Give Zen a whirl, and try a table or two.  At the end of the day, you will have likely spent more money on your lunch, coffee, or some App on a phone you may hardly use.  Obviously I am a fan; however, I am a fan because the tables are worth the time.  Few games have the ability to earn my time, and like all good things... Zen will keep you coming back if you let it.			"

												This is a great pinball game.  The tables are very interesting and they do things that a real pinball table could never do.  But that is one downside to this game, the pinball tables are all designed from the ground up to work on a computer and not in reality.  The tables can get a little overly complicated, making them hard to understand at first.  But once you play around with them for a while, you can figure them out pretty easily.  The free tables are quite good and a lot of fun to play.  It's definitely worth giving this game a try.			"

												Very good pinbill with a ton of variety in tables. They are priced reasonably as well.  Lots of differents objectives and special modes on all the tables with good physics, visuals and music. At the very least you owe it to yourself to try the free table because it is a very fun table and at this point is my favorite. My only con would be that for some reason the free table has some FPS issues during certain sequences which isn't a quite bad enough to be a big deal for me but I could see it causing issues for others. I really doubt this game would work well on the recommended requirements. Still worth a go though.			"

												It's kind of fun to play pinball where the designers remember that they are actually making a video game. The core pinball mechanics are all in place but there are extras that get added in that would be physically impossible with a real pinball machine. Zen Studios has done a good job at finding the balance between video game and pinball with this game.I'm still coming to terms with the various tables there are to play. It's not always clear what shots you should be working on or what progression follows a previous one. As a result, some of the tables end up feeling pretty stale in short time. I'm not going to comment on specific tables too much until I've had a chance to really get into them and determine if there's something I'm missing.Overall, this is a decent game to play that is sufficiently different from other pinball simulators to make it work spending some time getting to know.

												Highly recommended if you're a pinball fan. I have played some of those tables before on Nintendo 3DS, but the level of detail was too low, and the game made poor use of the dual screen. Being able to play on a properly sized monitor and seeing the tables' elements in full HD detail puts the game in another level.Pros:- Graphics: Awesome level of detail.- Physics: Convincing. Very well implemented.- Achievement System: Adds replay value to the game, if you're tired of just going for the highest score over and over. It challenges you to aim for specific objectives.- Leaderboard: Check your rank against people from all around the world, and your friends too (if you can convince them to play this game, of course).Cons:- Features: Most of the tables' designs try to simulate a real-world pinball table. There are no such things as dynamic terrain changes or multiple layers, as seen in classics like Rollerball, Pinball Quest and Epic Quest's Enigma table. So, for the casual player, replay value may seem limited, since the layout of a table will never change significantly during the game.- DLC: Tables are available separately or as part of a package, as in-app purchases. I was lucky to get this game with tons of tables in a Humble Bundle sale. But if you're not, you might end up spending some money trying to get more variety out of this game. Whether it is worth it or not, it depends on you.			"

												Pinball FX2 is the best pinball game I've ever played. There is another competitor, but their games are to the T perfect replications of the originals. If that's what you want its great, and don't get me wrong, there is hours upon hours of fun to be had there. But Pinball FX2 takes that same fun and adds on it, with more diverse tables and infinitely better graphic styling it makes the overall fun factor of the game higher as a result. Pinball FX2 is just a blast from the past, arcade style. And isn't that what we all grew up on anyway? :D			"

This is one of the best, if not THE BEST pinball games I have ever played in my 25 years of gaming. It's evident that a lot of thought/work was put into the aesthetics/design of each table on offer and you'll want to play them all, as they all have unique quirks/mini-games. Fantastic graphics, ball physics and fun/engrossing table mini-games ensure you will keep coming back to this one again and again. "

												Having purchased this game through one of the steam sales I thought it would give me a few minutes play, but has now become my first choice casual game.  Having liked pinball games in the past I decided that this looked visually stunning compared to previous games of the same type. Having played a couple of hours already I have to say im impressed with both how each table plays and how well its thought out.  Some tables play better than others however, but I enjoy most of the layouts (Star Wars boba fett, Excalibur). Overall The extra effort that has been put in visual design has made the basic pinball game more interesting but it needs both fast hands and a fast computer.8/10			"

The single ones are 2.99 and the 4 packs are 9.99. Each table is unique and has its own twists and mini games. Every single one I've payed so far I have enjoyed.			"

												The game is really fun, if you want to play pinball then try it for free and see how you like it. I haven't played a pinball game in over 10 years, pinball fantasies was the last one, this game made me remember how enjoyable they can be :]The one complaint I have about the game so far is that many of the tables have a superhero or movie theme, I would prefer to see more tables with other themes. Having said that, I've played several of the superhero/movie themed tables and many of them are good. There are several tables with other themes but I would like more.I like the business model, getting one table for free and being able to try every other table before buying it. It's rare today to find a game where the developers aren't trying to milk you in every way possible with DLC and various degrees of pay-to-win. Big props to Zen Studios for the fair business model.

												Solid pinball game. In many respects I like it more than the pinball arcade. While pinball FX does not design around classic pinball machines that are models made by williams, gottleib, stern or what have you. It still a great game, beyond that missing element (which might be a let down for people who have a history of playing with physical machines). While that domain is pinball arcade's forte the thing pinball arcade lacks is the solid nature of the pinball physics that is in the game pinball FX.Table designs are either original or around comic, movie franchises. While I feel its a bit overkill to have so many of these tables flood and saturate the variety tables to choose from, each table can be sampled before purchase so that you know how they work. Its good to know that they did not shirk on creativity regardless of the samey franchise they pull from. (I for one prefer the original tables, but some marvel tables have proben to be really fun to play with).You can sit and play pinball and keep the ball alive for a long time and not feel that any drains are a result of bad physics. While classic machines that you find in real life arcades can sometimes be designed around token taking, quarter munching filandry, pinball FX designs it's tables for more longterm play because it does not have to compete with those scenarios.Another fun aspect that can only be obtained through virtual pinball tables are mechanics and designs that go beyond the realms of realistic restraint. You can have models on the table react to your gameplay, you can have magically floating rails, you can put a miniature cannon in the table, you can have pinballs of ice or fire. Just things that are beyond real world design constraints, and because zen studioes realizes this we get tables and mechanics that we would not see anywhere else. I recommend this game for any pinball enthusiast and anyone interested in playing a comfortable pinball game. The guys over at Zen studios did a great job for their efforts.			"

												This game has good physics and graphics, you definitely get the old school pinball feeling whenyour playing on some of the tables, and yet at the same time they seamlessly integrate modern graphics to do things you could not do on a real pinball table like have the ball levitate, or a lightsabre fire up on the star wars table. Since there are many different tables you can purchase, the game can be as fun (or as unfun) as your favorite (or least favorite) table. I highly reccomend the following tables Infinity Gauntlet, Empire Strikes Back, Paranormal, Epic Quest,and my personal favorite is Fear Itself (which also comes with infinity gauntlet in the pack) I have seen many pinballs try to put effects and other things in the game, but usually when pc pinball games have done this in the past, it really takes you out the game and you feel like you are no longer playing pinball, Pinball FX2 has done a great job at giving you a genuine pinball feel but not cutting us short with the modern technology we have, Highly reccomended if you enjoy pinball!It also has great 3d support if you have a good 3d card, to bring even more realism!

												Check in the forums for the way to make the game playable. If you don't set the cached frames to 1 on either AMD or nVidia chipsets, the delays (up to 30 frames) make the game almost entirely unplayable. With the single cached frame, though, it becomes a very enjoyable pinball game.			"

												The PC pinball game that rules them all, FX2 delivers a satisfaction that can only be surpassed by a full physical pinball table (and a lot of bells and whistles that a real table can't deliver). While the free table is fine, it's the other full-featured tables that make this a gem of a game. Notable standouts are the Epic Quest and Paranormal tables, as well as the Avengers and Star Wards table bundles. Highly recommended if you have any kind of interest in pinball.			"

												It's the best virtual pinball game I've played in recent memory. However, the visuals could better and the controls are difficult on the PC. You can play it with a keyboard and mouse but I suggest the use of a gamepad to ease the difficulty and keep the ball in play. The tables are way too expensive. Clearly the developer shelled out some major cash for licensing but you could pay $70 or more to get all the tables and that's way too much money for a pinball game. Not to mention the ""pay for"" tables are really not that good. One of the best tables the developer made is the free Sorcer's Lair table. Even with all the tables I paid for, I still prefer this free offering over all the other tables I bought. I also prefer the mobile version of this game over the PC. The mobile version looks better and has way better controls. Yes, I know that's a bold statement but give both versions a try and you'll see what I mean. If you are looking for a great virtual pinball experience, this one is hard to beat.			"

												Well, it's a pinball game so it's not like there's a whole lot to say on the matter...I will say this though:Pinball FX2 (and its *many* add-ons) is easily the best pinball video game that I've ever played. It translates real-life pinball machines to the video-game medium flawlessly. In addition, many of the pinball machines have fantastical components/mechanisms that just wouldn't be feasible or even possible in a real-life mechanical rig. It's all perfectly executed and *very very* cool. If you like pinball video games at all, this title is where you'll ultimately end up. The sheer number of ""machines""/add-ons to choose from is staggering. This title will keep you pin-balling damn near forever.			"

So you don't have to spend 50$, you also can enjoy this for the price of one pack... This can also satisfy your thirst for pinball...  Just had one crash during reading of table description... but you don't have to read the description to play, you'll find out how the combos work without reading it... so enjoy the game...			"

												Pinball FX2 is currently the best pinball game experience available on Steam. It's also only one of two pinball games on Steam, period, but it's still a very good game and fully worthy of your time and attention. The base game engine is free to download and comes with a single table (also for free) and with that you can play indefinitely and get a good taste for the flavor of pinball offered. Here's the important things to note:#1) Without exception these are pinball tables that could not exist in the real world. There are elements grounded in the traditional model (metal guide rails and physical bumpers arrayed about a table with defined physical limits) but then there are elements which take advantage of the ""Well why not?"" aspect of this virtual experience like fully animated characters, laser beams shooting at the ball, bonus games that happen outside of the base table, and even special events where the laws of physics are messed with. There's a lot of imaginative freedom to explore because of this divergence from ""pure"" traditional pinball. This can be a plus or a minus depending on what your expectations are going into the game.#2) I'd say that on average most of the games available are much more accessable than a real pinball machine would be.  These games aren't out to eat your quarters every three minutes, and it's quite often that I could play a single game for ten minutes at a time, which makes for a really fun experience.  You really don't have to be a pinball wizard to keep the game going for a lengthy time frame but as you get better at learning the layouts and the controls you'll find yourself better able to shoot for special bonuses.#3) There's a LOT of music and voice acting throughout these games, and it's actually EXTREMELY well done.  I was prepared to grimace and accept the voicework but in most cases I found myself actually listening and finding it to be a valuable addition to the experience. The Star Wars titles are particularly noteworthy here since they didn't use the original actors or use sound clips from the movies, instead having new actors recreate famous lines which they accomplished with precision.  #4) It's possible to muck around with the settings for each game to tailor it to different specifications or just to see what different things do. These settings can make the game easier or harder (increasing the angle of the table, changing how long a particular bonus is activated, etc.) and can also be simple cosmetic things like changing the color of the dot-matrix display.  #5) If you have the ability to do so you can also change the orientation of the game to take advantage of a vertical display. This is extremely nice since these tables are inherently taller than they are wide so vertical displays are perfect.  My desktop monitor has trouble moving into this position but my netbook is easily rotated into position which was a great thing.  I was also impressed that my netbook was easily able to play the game without any performance issues.  My only complaint is an overuse of Marvel comics licenses for the tables... I've got a couple and they're nice and all, but these titles try to impart some level of storytelling into the pinball experience and that ground wears thin pretty quickly.  In the end this is a wonderful, wonderful pinball experience and is a perfect way to spend 10 to 30 minutes at a time. There's a joyful pavlovian reaction to hitting buttons and watching a ball rolling along hitting dinging bells and moving through trap doors and slides and I'd encourage anyone to give it a try. Since the base game comes with one table for free you owe it to yourself to try it out, and for a couple bucks here and there you can add to your virtual pinball hall to bring in more fun.			"

												This game is, simply put, fun. The fact that it is a free game that you have to buy different tables for is, admittedly, annoying but that is circumvented by the fact that it gives you one of, in my personal opinion, the best tables to start off with. The fact that it starts as free to play is very nice seeing as this allows people who either don't play pinball, or haven't in the past, to have a go and see if they like it. The fact that it feels as though the ball has some weight to it and it doesn't exist in a vacuum is a welcome addition. In addition to this the leader board between friend can create a bit of friendly competition, though the Superscore and Pinball Wizard score do kind of say ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to that as they incorporate scores from other tables that friends may not personally own, though with the recent Humble Bundle sale that has allowed a few more people to get said scores up, at least if they give enough of a flying toss.

Sure, the DLC is a little expensive ($10), and you don't get a base game as of my writing this, but it usually works out to be $2.50 a table for most packs (3-4 tables for $10, less if you buy on sale). You can tweak the tables yourself and the best part is not having to replace the globes and expensive parts of a real pinball machine or have it gather dust  and rust in your garage.

												The game is really fun, if you want to play pinball then try it for free and see how you like it. I haven't played a pinball game in over 10 years, pinball fantasies was the last one, this game made me remember how enjoyable they can be :]The one complaint I have about the game so far is that many of the tables have a superhero or movie theme, I would prefer to see more tables with other themes. Having said that, I've played several of the superhero/movie themed tables and many of them are good. There are several tables with other themes but I would like more.I like the business model, getting one table for free and being able to try every other table before buying it. It's rare today to find a game where the developers aren't trying to milk you in every way possible with DLC and various degrees of pay-to-win. Big props to Zen Studios for the fair business model.

												It's kind of fun to play pinball where the designers remember that they are actually making a video game. The core pinball mechanics are all in place but there are extras that get added in that would be physically impossible with a real pinball machine. Zen Studios has done a good job at finding the balance between video game and pinball with this game.I'm still coming to terms with the various tables there are to play. It's not always clear what shots you should be working on or what progression follows a previous one. As a result, some of the tables end up feeling pretty stale in short time. I'm not going to comment on specific tables too much until I've had a chance to really get into them and determine if there's something I'm missing.Overall, this is a decent game to play that is sufficiently different from other pinball simulators to make it work spending some time getting to know.

												Love it! Challenging, engaging, not your typical pinball machines. And they're very accomodating with their variety of tables, even the free one is amazing.I only have one gripe, and it really has nothing to do with the game itself. No matter how many tables you have locked, it will still count those locked table achievements in your grand total of achievements. This essentially means you would have to buy all the DLC (if that sort of thing bothers you). So if you're into 100% completion, this might take a while.			"

												This is a great pinball game.  The tables are very interesting and they do things that a real pinball table could never do.  But that is one downside to this game, the pinball tables are all designed from the ground up to work on a computer and not in reality.  The tables can get a little overly complicated, making them hard to understand at first.  But once you play around with them for a while, you can figure them out pretty easily.  The free tables are quite good and a lot of fun to play.  It's definitely worth giving this game a try.			"

This game has a huge amount of replayability whether it be for getting a higher score or just refining your skills and accuracy. I highly reccomend this game.			"

												Pinball FX2 is currently the best pinball game experience available on Steam. It's also only one of two pinball games on Steam, period, but it's still a very good game and fully worthy of your time and attention. The base game engine is free to download and comes with a single table (also for free) and with that you can play indefinitely and get a good taste for the flavor of pinball offered. Here's the important things to note:#1) Without exception these are pinball tables that could not exist in the real world. There are elements grounded in the traditional model (metal guide rails and physical bumpers arrayed about a table with defined physical limits) but then there are elements which take advantage of the ""Well why not?"" aspect of this virtual experience like fully animated characters, laser beams shooting at the ball, bonus games that happen outside of the base table, and even special events where the laws of physics are messed with. There's a lot of imaginative freedom to explore because of this divergence from ""pure"" traditional pinball. This can be a plus or a minus depending on what your expectations are going into the game.#2) I'd say that on average most of the games available are much more accessable than a real pinball machine would be.  These games aren't out to eat your quarters every three minutes, and it's quite often that I could play a single game for ten minutes at a time, which makes for a really fun experience.  You really don't have to be a pinball wizard to keep the game going for a lengthy time frame but as you get better at learning the layouts and the controls you'll find yourself better able to shoot for special bonuses.#3) There's a LOT of music and voice acting throughout these games, and it's actually EXTREMELY well done.  I was prepared to grimace and accept the voicework but in most cases I found myself actually listening and finding it to be a valuable addition to the experience. The Star Wars titles are particularly noteworthy here since they didn't use the original actors or use sound clips from the movies, instead having new actors recreate famous lines which they accomplished with precision.  #4) It's possible to muck around with the settings for each game to tailor it to different specifications or just to see what different things do. These settings can make the game easier or harder (increasing the angle of the table, changing how long a particular bonus is activated, etc.) and can also be simple cosmetic things like changing the color of the dot-matrix display.  #5) If you have the ability to do so you can also change the orientation of the game to take advantage of a vertical display. This is extremely nice since these tables are inherently taller than they are wide so vertical displays are perfect.  My desktop monitor has trouble moving into this position but my netbook is easily rotated into position which was a great thing.  I was also impressed that my netbook was easily able to play the game without any performance issues.  My only complaint is an overuse of Marvel comics licenses for the tables... I've got a couple and they're nice and all, but these titles try to impart some level of storytelling into the pinball experience and that ground wears thin pretty quickly.  In the end this is a wonderful, wonderful pinball experience and is a perfect way to spend 10 to 30 minutes at a time. There's a joyful pavlovian reaction to hitting buttons and watching a ball rolling along hitting dinging bells and moving through trap doors and slides and I'd encourage anyone to give it a try. Since the base game comes with one table for free you owe it to yourself to try it out, and for a couple bucks here and there you can add to your virtual pinball hall to bring in more fun.			"

												This game is, simply put, fun. The fact that it is a free game that you have to buy different tables for is, admittedly, annoying but that is circumvented by the fact that it gives you one of, in my personal opinion, the best tables to start off with. The fact that it starts as free to play is very nice seeing as this allows people who either don't play pinball, or haven't in the past, to have a go and see if they like it. The fact that it feels as though the ball has some weight to it and it doesn't exist in a vacuum is a welcome addition. In addition to this the leader board between friend can create a bit of friendly competition, though the Superscore and Pinball Wizard score do kind of say ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to that as they incorporate scores from other tables that friends may not personally own, though with the recent Humble Bundle sale that has allowed a few more people to get said scores up, at least if they give enough of a flying toss.

												A great re-creation of pinball physics and 'gimmicks' (multiball, video modes, Magna Save, even TILTing), while raising the bar in a way that a real pinball cannot (moving characters, disappearing balls, one table even plays upside-down as part of a multiball mode!).  The collection is currently split three ways - a Star Wars theme, a Marvel Comics theme, and a more 'traditional' collection that evokes fond memories of real 'pins while being unique in their own way.The first table - Sorcerer's Lair - is completely free, so go ahead and give it a shot (it's my second favorite table, after Paranormal).

I picked this up in a humble bundle pack and got 21 ""tables"" for 6 bucks. Was that worth it? Hell yes.  As someone who is old enough to have played actual pinball machines, the physics seem right.  The add-on packs seem to go for $9.99 for 3-4 more tables. Are they worth it? Well, depends on how much you like pinball.  They do give you a free preview though so at least you can check them out before committing. There isn't really enough games in the pinball genre, so I don't have much to compare it to and give it an actual rating.   I would defintely pick this up on sale, and if you have to have a ""pinball"" game, then give it a whirl.			"

												I love playing pinball on the pc.  It's not as easy to find the real deal anymore, given that many machines have been put out to pasture, or have become a collector's hobby.  Pinball FX isn't true to the old machines like Pinball Arcade is, but it's great for a couch co-op game, and most of the tables give you a great time trying to do special shots and so on.			"

												Personal pick for, ""JUST 5 MORE MINUTES,"" Award Nominee.Even the free table and playing demo mode is fun,  spending a few dollars to unlock tables, especially bundles, is well worth it if you like pinball games.  None of these tables are real, but I have to admit that I like the physics used, and the real world imagining of magical tables with addictive replay appeal.There are some pretty fun tables available and I've rounded up good deals for them, on occasional sales.

												Highly recommended if you're a pinball fan. I have played some of those tables before on Nintendo 3DS, but the level of detail was too low, and the game made poor use of the dual screen. Being able to play on a properly sized monitor and seeing the tables' elements in full HD detail puts the game in another level.Pros:- Graphics: Awesome level of detail.- Physics: Convincing. Very well implemented.- Achievement System: Adds replay value to the game, if you're tired of just going for the highest score over and over. It challenges you to aim for specific objectives.- Leaderboard: Check your rank against people from all around the world, and your friends too (if you can convince them to play this game, of course).Cons:- Features: Most of the tables' designs try to simulate a real-world pinball table. There are no such things as dynamic terrain changes or multiple layers, as seen in classics like Rollerball, Pinball Quest and Epic Quest's Enigma table. So, for the casual player, replay value may seem limited, since the layout of a table will never change significantly during the game.- DLC: Tables are available separately or as part of a package, as in-app purchases. I was lucky to get this game with tons of tables in a Humble Bundle sale. But if you're not, you might end up spending some money trying to get more variety out of this game. Whether it is worth it or not, it depends on you.			"

												Surely you remember Space Cadet, right? That silly little pinball game that came pre-installed with Windows XP? Oh how you could spend hours knocking that little steel ball around, becoming ever more obsessed with beating your own high score.Consider yourself in luck; Pinball FX2 really brings pinball into the age of modern gaming! The visual effects are superb, the physics are expertly designed, and all the lights, sounds, bells, and whistles you would expect from a real pinball machine; and all of it beautifully modeled and rendered in 3D, unlike our dearly missed 2D pinball table of years gone by.Add to that a continuously growing library of tables to choose from; there's the Sorcerer's Lair table that has you wondering a haunted mansion as two kids work together to defeat the evil sorcerer that dwells within as you fight your way through skeletons, spiders, and ghouls; perhaps you'll even meet a friendly ghost to help show you the way; this table is detailed and life-like enough to make you think you're really at the arcade. There are also impossible ""fantasy"" tables, like Star Wars: Starfighter Assault; your table floats above a planet as you fight for either the Galactic Empire or the Rebel Alliance; one minute you're launching your ball at the bumpers, the turbolasers on top of them blasting away at X-Wings flying above the table, the next minute you find your Star Destroyer in a heated broadside with a Rebel Star Cruiser, launching your ball into the ramps to launch fighters at the enemy; switching over to fight for the Rebels, you'll even find yourself at the controls of your X-Wing, defending your capital ships by using the flipper buttons to steer your fighter and the launch button to shoot down TIE Fighters; keep up the good work, and you may even find yourself escorting the Millenium Falcon as you attack the second Death Star above Endor. There's plenty to choose from with several more Star Wars themed tables, lots of Marvel tables featuring characters like Wolverine, Iron Man, Ghost Rider, The Avengers, and the Fantastic Four just to name a few, and even a generous selection of completely original themed tables; but no matter what you decide to play, every table presents a unique set of challenges and play quite differently from one another; and all of them are just as fun and addictive as you'd hope they'd be.What Zen Studios have done here is not just make a pinball game, they've hand-built a pinball machine in the virtual space; if you find the factory settings a bit too challenging, you can go into the Operator's Menu where you can adjust the field pitch so the ball rolls down slower, and change all kinds of difficulty settings. While you're there, you may even want to do a light and sound test to kinda get a ""behind the scenes"" look at the inner workings of every table.See a table you're interested in, but not quite sure you want to commit? You're free to take every table out for a trial play, to see if you like the table before adding it to your collection.Pinball FX2 may seem like little more than a nostalgia trip for those of us that grew up playing that silly little 2D pinball game on our Windows computers, and to an extent it is; but it's more than that, Pinball FX2 is really what we wanted that old Windows pinball game to be all along.

So far I can't find any negatives about this game.It is the best pinball game I have played and would highly recommend it to any pinball fan, to th people who don't like pinball I would still recommend they give this ago seen as its free.

In fact, it's very much like an arcad, in that some of the tables tend to launch the ball out of ramps and holes right into the drain.That said, It's still worth getting, if only for the free table.  If you want more variety, I suggest getting one of the marvel table packs to start with.			"

												Pinball FX2 is da blast! Try the free tables and see for yourself! It's quite easy to learn but tough enough to master to keep you hooked for a while. The tables are beautifully crafted and the sound fx are really nice. Some voice samples are a bit off and can get a bit annoying on some tables when you hear them multiple times. On another note you can't control the power of you paddle hits - it's always a full stroke. For me it's no issue - the game is great as it is! Hunting highscores while competing with your friends is a lot of fun :)			"

Not sure whether I would ever be able to see everything this single table has to offer. And there are around 25 such tables which will keep even experts of pinball engaged for a long time.

												The best pinball simulator out there, interesting tables, each with differents mechanics, from classic zen pinball tables to more commercial tables with themes of marvel superheroes, but all with complex and interesting designs.The only flaw i saw for this game is that you have to buy the tables, and those are no cheap, if you wanna buy all the tables it will cost you more than buy a diferent game, but if you are into pinball simulators is it worth the money.P.D. The steam version of this game has the sorcerer´s lair table for free, so if you are not sure is it worthy give it a try.Pros: It will cost considerably less than buy a real pinball tableCons: It will cost you considerably more than buy any other games (if you want a considerably large collection of tables)			"

Since I'm a fan of pinball games, I figured I'd give it a shot and I was quite happy with it. The physics are damn accurate, with responsive flippers and three different ways to 'nudge' the table. The tables are all 'modern' style pinball tables, with lots of ramps, lanes, and all sorts of busy animation and mini-games included. Some might find the sheer amount of motion a bit off-putting, but I got used to it quickly. Can't recommend the game highly enough if you're a silver ball enthusiast, but watch out - you might find yourself buying every table and making this 'free' game cost quite a lot.			"

												What can I say about Pinball FX 2 that hasn't already been said? Well, here's the breakdown:This is pinball. Pure, fun, addictive pinball, just as it was in the arcade, with certain elements of the game impossible on a real life pinball machine (like melting a ball in a cauldron for a locked ball).Here's the good -Lots of different tables, all with a unique feel and story.Physics are quite realistic.Graphics are mostly good, save for some (small, unobtrusive) ugly textures.You can save at any point by just hitting escape and quitting the game, and restart at that exact point, even mid ball!Here's the bad - I don't really see anything that stands out as bad with this game.I highly recommend this game to anyone that has even a passing interest in pinball, or wants something casual that has a competitive element to it. Do yourself a favor and buy this game.			"

												EDIT: The EULA may have been changed, but still be warned just in case.EDIT 2: Bang backs are still possible, albeit at a reduced rate. Diagonal nudges are pointless, but there are other ways of tackling this, provided the required circumstances. Still up to you; I'm leaning towards a ""MIXED"" than a negative. I really enjoy this game, to be honest, but Zen's execution and message of that update is still bad.ORIGINAL: Nerfed diagonal nudging to a point where bang backs are (almost, but never actually got one) impossible. Every pinball player in Steam should know that we are now inferior compared to the console and mobile versions. The terminology used by the higher-ups, as well as even attempting to get a high score, made me temporarily quit (at least while this debacle was still fresh).Ultimately it's up to you at this point.http://steamcommunity.com/app/226980/discussions/0/490121928355358516/#c492379159709727925 "

												An excellent pinball game with lots of original tables; a bit pricey though.Really great that there's cabinet support for people insane enough to build a digital pinball machine for maximum authenticity.			"

												Best virtual pinball I've played yet. Just feels more like something I'd see in an actual arcade, at least until the ball magically disappears. The table selection is fairly nice, though a few stand out above the others. Hey, the first table's free, so give it a shot. 4/5			"

												Of all the virtual pinball games I've tried, Pinball FX is the best. The flippers ""feel"" right and the physics capture all the nuance of pinball as I remember it from my youth.Additionally, they have added animated elements that would never work with a physical pinball table but beautifully integrate into the games and improve on an already fun experience.

												Pinball.  Marvel themed tables.  Star Wars Tables. New tables come out all the time.  Great Pinball physics. What more could you want out of a pinball game? It's everything Windows space pinball could've been.			"
