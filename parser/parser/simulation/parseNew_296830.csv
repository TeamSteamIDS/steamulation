 Poison all the doughnuts! I'm not sure about this one. I get what it’s trying to accomplish, and it should succeed. But there are enough bugs and glitches that it falls flat. Basically, you want to kill innocent people in creative ways. Good! Great! But 9/10 I fall back on poisoning doughnuts with ""pills"" and just tossing them at dudes. Basically, no NPC ever does what you want them to do, or goes were you want them to go, leaving amazingly fun traps completely useless. I had this one, I had put a sharpened stick in a pressurized valve so if I threw the switch, the pressure would push the stick out at fatal velocity. To lure an unsuspecting janitor near said trap, I threw a few cans of baked beans into two laundry machines, confident the noise would attract him. It did! And he clipped into the door and was just stuck. Reloaded and tried again. Clipped into the door again. Frustrated, I threw poisoned doughnuts at him. Get used to that. Between flammable liquid, cigarettes, exploding whatits, water jugs, endless electrical wires, sharpened sticks, collapsing ceiling fans and just good old thwacking someone in the head with a wooden beam, my most used death dealing trap as the literal son of Satan...was poisoning Crispy Crèmes and leaving them out like Elmer ♥♥♥♥ing Fud hunting a fat man. Also for a Hospital with tons of nurses, doctors and security guards, they really do move randomly! I kept trying to figure out their movement patterns, plan my murders. Nothing to it. As far as I can tell, any NPC(not locked in a room) has free range to move anywhere on the map, at any time. Making sneaking and murdering, the two core concepts of the game, rather random and difficult.I spend most of my time looking for pills to poison people, and its getting old fast. Devs, I’d recommend tightening up the AI and maybe streamlining some of the ways to kill people. Too many tight corners you can’t throw things past, and too many small rooms where its impossible to throw cans at ceiling fans without being noticed and the unsuspecting victim standing up and the fan missing.EDIT: Okay, I'm offically calling this game done. Found a beach ball randomly in a hosptial. When I highlighted it, this is what I got: ""Bengt the ball is the name given by Pewdiepie to the red and white ball found in Game Lucius 1""So, buy at your own risk...			"

												Oh blimey, what happened here? It's as if someone took Postal, took all the weapons out, mixed it with Goat simulator, baked a rather crudely made cake out of it and then merely added Lucius as the glazing! But in all seriousness, this is quite terrible. Yes, the first game was quite limited, but it was a solid game with a fairly dense athmosphere and kills that had some weight and meaning to them. In Lucius 2, meanwhile, you're pointlessly killing braindead NPCs who just happen to be around. Mostly with poisoned doughnuts, because the game mechanics are far too wonky and buggy to actually try and plot some kind of ingenious way of dispatching somebody.Poisoned doughnuts, you ask? Why yes, haven't i mentioned the braindead AI? Why WOULDN'T you eat an entire box of doughnuts that you randomly found on the floor? And while we're at it, why WOULD you react to that little boy over there, bursting into demonic flames as he levels up? Clearly, this game is supposed to take place in some bizarro-dimension.Oh, it also doesn't help that when you do achieve such an unsatisfying, anticlimactic kill, the game demonstrates just how crudely it's made with a display of wonky, silly ragdoll physics. Whoo.Have i mentioned that on top of all of that bad design, the game is also one of the buggiest messes i've seen? Yeah, NPCs phasing through doors, objects becoming non-interactable at random, the whole shabang. There's quite a few early access games out there that are more finished than this one. At least at the time of writing, which is 2 days after release.But hey, now that i've mentioned all the bad things, here's a list of all the good things i have to say about it:You'll notice that the list above appears to be rather devoid of text. I'm sure you can figure out just why that is.			"

												A rather disappointing sequel.The original was all about story and atmosphere. While every chapter had a gruesome murder at the end, that was only after you had a chance to learn more about the manor, its inhabitants and their secrets.If the first game was an adventure game, Lucius II is a murder sandbox. So while you have more freedom about using your powers to kill in many different ways, all feel very empty and meaningless.Like in many horror movie sequels, it's easy to just increase the body count, but the atmosphere of the original was lost in the process.

												l love watching people on twitch play this game, so I bought it for myself.  I knew it had a terrible story, major performance issues, and lousy controls, but murder never looked so gosh darn fun.  Now I really dislike it.  It had so much potential until I actually tried to play it.  It's not hard to just play the game through, but I want to play WITH the game.  I wondered why streamers always killed people the same mundane ways.  Now I know it's because it's near impossible to do anything that the game didn't lay out for you to do step by step.  I don't want to poison donuts and kill people off one at a time, I want to set whole hospital floors on fire.  I tried.  Everyone just stopped their reduntant patrol circles and waited for the flames to die out.  No panic or anything.  Set up a neck level trip wire, and suddenly putting water on the floor doesn't make anyone slip.  wtf.  I knew this game seemed stupid with its cheesy cut scenes, scenarios, and references, now I know it actually is stupid because you're in a semi-open world environment with the goal to kill as many people as possible and the real challenge is trying to have fun while doing so.

												Unstable. Many, many bugs. Save states are amateur level in that they'll save the status of some objects and objectives and not others.Sometimes you can load from a save, other times you cannot. It's the luck of the draw whether or not a save will be loadable at all. No idea how they managed this trainwreck after a passable game the first time around, but this seems like it was made by complete newbie developers.As for the non-technical aspects, the gameplay is passable enough when it isn't breaking, the writing is horrible, there are typos and grammar mistakes in the menus. I'm surprised this was made by the same team responsible for the original Lucious, a game I enjoyed and that ran and performed just fine.Maybe it will be fixed, but there's no way in hell you should be buying something this horrendously broken before it's confirmed it's playable.Really disappointed, but given the glut of unfinished, broken games lately, not surprised at all.Skip it.

												This game took me a little over 8.5 hours to beat the main story. Though i didn't level up and max out all the skill trees this was a good game.  I feel however that the game is still ""broken"" and need futher patchs to fix the many bugs. Also i was hoping for a longer story, though I feel by the way the game ended that there will ether be a 3rd game or DLC. Overall i would give the game a 6 out of 10.			"

												Lucius II is a GREAT game. The plot makes sense, there's a decent amount of content and replayability, it's a beautifully atmospheric game and it stands alone in its style. All in all, I'd give this game an 8/10. What Lucius II tries to achieve, it achieves fairly effectively. There's a few bugs and problems, but considering the enormity of the game, it's to be expected, and none of the bugs are particularly ground-breaking.Personally I'd price it at around $15, so grab it at a discount if you can. However, the developers seem really committed to updating and patching Lucius II, and the game definitely has a unique style to it (that I for one love). If you'd like to see a Lucius III, I definitely would say that you won't be too disappointed paying full price for the game, and you'll help contribute to a sequel :)I've broken down my review into positives, slight negatives and big negatives as follows. I'd weigh up each of the following before deciding if you'd like to buy the game or not:POSITIVES:- Much more content to explore than the original game! The hospital ward plus the town of Ludlow total roughly three times the size of the mansion in the original!- A controllable and customisable level-up system - choose how to progress your skills!- SO much customisation and interactability with the environment. You can combine some items with other items to create complex traps for potential victims, as well as use some items with objects in the environment for the victims to interact with.- A plethora of ways to kill victims. The original game was incredibly limited, but in Lucius II you'll never be short of potential ways to hunt your victims down!- Due to the number of ways to kill victims, replayability is definitely an option!- Full and working controller support! No more mapping keys to buttons!- Achievements that were much more thought out than in the original: certain hours of gameplay and travelling specific distances are a thing of the past!- Collectibles that you can hunt down!SLIGHT NEGATIVES:- A nitpick, but there are both spelling and grammar errors in both the subtitles and the in-game descriptions (while playing in English). The audio sometimes is slightly different to the subtitles.- I encountered a few objects or items that simply said '[TEXT DESCRIPTION]', so I'm guessing the developers forgot to code in some of the text. This doesn't affect functionality in any way.- For whatever reason, when I started up, the default subtitle size was set to 0.0 instead of 1.0, so I couldn't even read the subtitles at first. I don't know if this is hard-coded into the game, or specific to me, but for a professional game this shouldn't be a problem.- The first level is next to impossible to kill everyone in for the 'Problem Child' achievement due to an extremely limited number of potential ways to kill the mental patients.- There's a few glitches. Occasionally you'll come across a door that doesn't open, but you simply pass through. Occasionally electricity or a cord will take on a mind and physics of its own, though this doesn't affect gameplay at all, just the visuals.BIG NEGATIVES:- KEYS. I love the concept of gathering keys to unlock areas, but there's a serious problem with them. Occasionally, they'll disappear once you reload a save without collecting them. If you save over your original save, there's no way to get them back, and you are sometimes left unable to complete a level. Considering this game relies a lot of save-and-load, you're bound to run into this at least once.- While the total area you can explore is indeed more than in Lucius, the areas are *entirely* level-specific. In the original, it was always the same mansion, perhaps with slightly more areas available each level. In Lucius II, each level is independent.- Serious kill-mechanic oversights. There's so many brilliant ways to kill victims, but I found myself not even hunting them out, as every level after the first is far too EASY. This is mostly due to Mind Control regenerating power on a successful kill, and an over-powered item. I've summarised these in spoilers for you, in case you don't want to read about the 'easy kills':Once you unlock mind control, you can basically get every single person in the first chapter to simply walk down an elevator shaft. The developers limited the number of times you can do this (which was a great idea), but they forgot about fire. Kill someone with fire, then mind-control another victim and have them walk over the first victim's burning corpse. The second victim will die, and also catch on fire. This fire lasts around a minute, and resets the timer if you kill another victim. I managed to pile up over 30 victims from the result of one initial flame!The nailgun is over-powered. One shot is an instant kill, and it comes with 5 shots per pack of nails. There's even a second pack of nails right by the gun when you first find it, giving you 10 shots. If that's not enough, at the start of chapter 2 there's another 15 nails for you to collect, giving a total of 25 possible kills from the nailgun alone. "

												That's what I call a disappointment!After a first episode, mediocre in execution but faithful at heart to the sub-genre of psycho kids movies, Lucius II could've been a great improvement to a really cool concept and a nice niche game. The linearity of the first episode? Gone! You have freedom to use your environment, and to compose with your habilities to create the kills you want. The lack of indication and sometimes really hard to figure puzzles? Gone too! Everything is written, sometimes three times (you know, just in case you were wondering if that door was a door...well it is!), you have plenty of informations and a map that moves in real time to help you out. The colision and AI bugs? Ghhu...oh wait. That's where it starts to stink.Because let's face it, Lucius II is a really poorly executed concept, a buggy mess, and a non-polished game that would deserve the ""early access"" tag at best.First of all, there is absolutly no AI. The characters react without any logical sense. You just killed someone with a gas explosion in a room? Don't worry about being detected, the person in the next room won't even hear what the hell just happened. You want to lure someone with the noise of an object? Good luck with that. The NPCs won't hear a thing half the time, and the rest of the time, will just stand there in awe, with a question mark on there head. They will continue there activities with a deceased body in the same room, covered with acid, or even with electrical wires coming down from the roof. Simply put, they don't give ****.And it's not like if it was the only ""oversight"". Nope, the controls are aweful. It not in the way Lucius moves, but in every aspect of the interaction with the game. Lucius can't grab anything with his hands: he has to use telekynetic powers to grab anything. It doesn't drain your energy, BUT if you go anywhere near a christian cross, the object falls on the ground and the little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ can't pick it up, because he can't use telekynetic power in range of a cross. Oh sure, you can grab another object and throw it to the cross to flip it, but that's anoying. Now the biggest problem with that stupid idea of not being able to just grab something is this: if you have any object out of your magical pocket (you know, the one that contains 250 lbs worth of objects), you are suspicious: meaning you can't walk around with anything in your hand and you constantly have to holster in and out anything you want to use. Worst! Let's say you want to push a trolley with gas tank on it, to set it on fire and blow someone up, well since Lucius is allergic to everything, you can't push the thing if someone is around, because...you're pushing it with your mind and that's pretty suspicious. Bottom line, you can't touch anything, and that's pretty stupid.And at this point, you maybe thinking ""well if the AI sucks, how is that a problem?"" Well it's problem because IT BREAKS THE IMMERSION THE CHALLENGE THE MECHANICS THE GAMEPLAY THE ENTIRE FREAKING POINT OF THE GAME. Why would you play a game that consist in killing people in plain sight, without being seen, that has no AI what so ever, and that stops you from using the fun part of the levels? It's tedious, stupid, broken as hell (in the last two chapters, most NPCs died without me even being in the same room) and un-polished like an alpha from a Bethesda game. Sometimes object go through walls, preventing you from grabbing them; when it's a key, well you can load the level entirely. The ragdoll is out of controll, like Dark Souls on crack; when someone dies, anything can happen with the body. The worst thing about it is, that's the least of your problems when you play the game.As much as I liked the first one (with its flaws), and as much as I wanted a sequel, to get the Hitman X Omen that the first one made me wish for, I just feel like I've been abused by the developers. If you read me: I know you don't have that much money. I know you meant well, but that's not how you treat the players. If you don't have money for a good looking 3D game (yeah I didn't even mentioned the fact that it looks dated and that the background are atrocious) of that scale and that ambitious, you don't do it. You have to be cleverer and make better choices in term of technology and game-design. Why chose a hospital, a really crowded place, when you know, you absolutly know, that the AI is incapable of even reacting to the sound of an explosion? Why do you chose a wide open town, with corn fields that can't hide anything, if you are not capable of doing a good matte-painting? And seriously, what the hell is with all this indications everywhere? The concept is really cool, and GOD I wish there was someone to actually pull this off (like IO Interactive...the one from Blood Money, not Absolution) and make it a good game, while keeping the corniness of the plot, characters, and background that, in my opinion, add to the charm of the game...but yeah, that's not it. At all. And no patch can fix most of the problems.Don't buy. PS: the soundtrack is really nice though...but the audio mix sucks :'(			"

												A vast improvement on the concept of the original. Now creativity is not just allowed, it's encouraged. You can plan, plot, and decide how to both use your skills, and your upgrades. Would I reccomend this? Highly. If you wished the original let you be more creative, this is what you wanted.			"

												Game might be broken to the point it makes you believe your PC is possessed but I can't stop playing it. And I'm having a blast! The sequel is built far more open than in the first game. Gives you the freedom to roam around and encourages you to be creative and plan deaths for absolutely everyone, in the most brutal ways ever! That's defintely a huge improvement. The story and gameplay start slow and lame in the begining, find keys, unlock door, find more keys, unlock more doors. But as I progressed more, it started to make sense. The devil has two sons and they compete to sit on the Dark throne. Also Satan is gay, couldn't ask for a better story! But I was able to ignore its flaws eventually and now I like it a lot.			"

 My experience with the game! The story in this game is truely awesome and I like that you have loads of ways to kill your enemies.But some changes I dont like at all, for example you can't hold an item in your hand instead it levitates ( which annoys me ^^).The game is also full of bugs that really ruins your gameplay.If they just had put more hours on fixing the bugs this would be a masterpiece, based on Lucius 1 the gameplay is more enjoying in Lucius 2. Ups + Awesome story+ Be creative and kill them your way Downs - You cant hold an item regular- Bugs, bugs everywhereThx to all bugs i can't recommend this game :'(			"

												I played the game through yesterday and feel pretty angry and disappointed about it. A truly evil, original and quite interesting story without a proper finale, what a shame! The AI is stupid as hell and their moves are totally calculable, I would have expected some distinction amongst the NPCs but they are totally identical (why the hell do they all pick up and eat poisoned food from the floor?!), the game contains quite a few bugs and graphical glitches, and the latest patch arrived 6 months after the initial release date... I don't think it's very useful as most people already finished the game by now.Seriously, just a little more work put into this game (eg. improving AI and gameplay experience and creating a proper finale) and it could have been a nominee for the Game Of The Year award.It was fun to play it but Lucius II is definitely not what most people would expect for 20 Euros. :(			"

												Lucius 2 begins at the end of Lucius 1. The detective saves you from the burning house, you end up in a hospital, here you attack a nun, get thrown into isolation and kill your doctors. here starts the actual gameplay, where you have to escape the hospital. Pros: +Lots of ways to kill people, you are no longer restrained to kill a person the same way. this might seem like only 1 + point, but this has great impact on your game experience and will make you wanna play more than 1 playthrough as you can take a different path now.+more maps, and bigger. there are like 10 maps, and each has lots of people in it (especially the maps in the hospital and in the town)+ More abilities, tree perk. you no longer only have 1 or 2 abilities you can use like in lucius. we were only able to create fire in the last few moments of the game, so you could max kill 3 people with the most awesome abilty.. however, in lucius 2 because of the tree perks you can decide what abilities you want first, (there are 3 tree perks, each has a few more powers in it as you level it up, you can have 2 full tree's when you complete the game)+Graphics are slightly better, but this doesnt matter that much for most people.now lets talk cons.-Lucius 2 has a bad story, this is something everyone can agree on. the beginning makes sense and is alright. but as you move forward, and complete the town map, you get the feeling they just send you to random blunt maps which seem the same and kinda boring looking-its hard to understand at first. before the game begins you get this little tutorial which gives you lots of information in a few minutes, which you quickly forget as some powers you wont immediately use. in lucius 1 the powers were evenly spread and when you got a new power / ability it was clearly explained how to use it and when, this however was not the case in lucius 2. (i had to look up a guide for the first map, so i understood how i could do everything and where to look for hints etc.)-the people in this game are absolutely ridiculous. you can kill someone in front of a nurse and she wont even come of her chair. you can break/modify items and people staring at you wont stop you. the only way to make them move is to actually walk in a restricted area, and even then is their line of sight really bad so you dont ever have the feeling of being truly ♥♥♥♥ed. also when you do get busted you can just use a lifeline and go on again, youll lose a bit of health but its easily gained by visiting a toilet (which are everywhere in this game)Okay, lets get real here for a second: Lucius 2 does not exceed the expectations after playing Lucius 1 for alot of people, the story is worse, AI is terrible, the people react bad, but that doesnt mean that this is such a bad game. Lucius 2 is a fun game to cycle around with your tricycle as you kill people with anything that you can touch. (or mind control) it might not be the most realistic or serious game but thats okay. Cause its fun.Id rate this game a 7/10 for enjoyment. as its really original with its playstyle. you wont often play something thats like this. i do recommend buying this on sale though. since the worth of the game really depends on what you find important in a game.

												Why the F*@*@ is there a pewdiepie easter egg in the first level?Bengt the ball? Really? -_-EDITED: Ive changed my review from a thumbs up to thumbs down. This game is riddled with bugs, and the open world advertisement is a lie. You do NOT have free reign to an open world. You are given a mediocre ""town"" called Ludlow which consists of one block of literally 8 storefronts you can sneak around in. They are so close together you almost wonder how killing anyone is ""stealth"" because they discover the bodies quite easily if you don't burn them simply because of how small the area is. I also don't understand how there's an entire corn field burning as well as a giant cross on fire RIGHT next to the area all of the townsfolk are in. The fire is huge and big enough to lace the town in smoke, WHY is nobody reacting to that? The people seem eerily calm and accepting of their doom. Shouldn't they have SOME AI that works in the game's favor? Or are they just mindless drone NPC's poorly following a pre set path? Because you can literally map the steps of every npc if you watch them for a few seconds.For the first 20 minutes of the game you are confined to a hospital. So....its an open hospital...because I promise you the hospital has more to see than Ludlow itself.The game is BUGGY. Need I say it again? NPC's get stuck in doorways and walls, sometimes they don't even react to a kill. No...no....no...Shame on you Lucius...I was expecting so much more considering how good the first one was...			"

More non-linear than the first part. You can kill your victims in many ways, using both the environment and items that you collect instead of one and only possible way. Game is split into levels, each with its own map, objectives and hidden stuff. Gameplay is quite buggy, but I didn't encounter any game-breaking glitches, only hilarious ones usually related to physics (which is quite impressive by the way, especially for a Unity powered game) so it's easily forgiven. The optimization is nice, despite high system requirements mentioned on the store page - with i7 4790K and GTX 970 I was able to achieve smooth 110-120 fps gameplay in full HD and with everything on max (+ additional SMAA and SweetFX effects). Played around six hours (mostly offline though) and had a lot of fun, so I recommend it to anyone who can live with the bugs and some cheesy moments.			"

												i encounterd bug after bug after bug.. music looping over eacother, possessed people were met with an invisible wall when i tried to make them walk into traps and people spotted me doing stuff trough the walls.. and i just want to make it clear that i did in fact go into options to turn off the music, but it did nothing.. the narroater's voice got so low that i only heard mumbling and couldn't make out anything he said. thank god for subtitle tho..we all love the first game, Lucius. and thats why i was eager to play this game, i bought it at once without hessitation when i saw it on steam. and began playing it as soon it was done downloading. first to notice is that the controlls are similar to that of a survival game on early access, as if it was under experiment. the feel you got when you kill'd someone in the prev game was awesome, you felt like you just did something bad and got away with it, no loose ends. but in this game.. the people are soulless already, and the fact that the dead bodies are just like footballs and getting easly pushd around simply by you walking to them does not help on the feel. the story is clunky at best, its predictable once you know the direction the story is heading and didnt really hold my intrest for long. i was more into finding diffrent ways to kill people, but you get a slight limitation towards what you can use. there are alot of ways to kill people, don't get me wrong, but the way to use them.. the game forces you to use creativity every single time, which is'nt good.. i want to get creative with my kills when im inspired to do so.. if i just want a guy dead, i should be allowed to do it simple.the npc's can easly go trough closed doors and other objects around, they simply ignore the law of physics to keep they'r scedual as scripted..there is alot of way to stump on this game, but i wouldnt really recomend anyone to try the game to fiugre out what that is. look up a let's player on youtube and watch before you make up your mind.3/10 - not finishd! i've had to reastart the game multiple times, and im still in the first chapter! i'd rather have a game just like the first game, than another game like this.just a little side note, if you don't seem to get any achivement, exit the game. the achivement will spam you'r corner. they don't show up ingame			"

												Really dissapointed. I loved the first game so I was naturally excited to play it's succsessor. However this game feels so unfinished... The ragdoll, spaced out, incompetant AI, at times - sure it was funny. But half of the time it was a mess, bodies getting stuck to your feet, pulling some money out of your inventory to use a sandwich machine and people start freaking out. 'OH NO. A CHILD BUYING A SANDWICH, MUST BUST HIM' - MISSION OVER, INSTANT RAGDOLL. (Sure I was only buying the sandwich to poison victims, BUT HOW WOULD THEY HAVE KNOWN THAT?!)  It should be great seeing as this time you're given the freedom to kill how you please, however as many of the other reviews state you just resort to the old poison doughnut trick. Also I've been unable to complete the last mission as the shotgun has become un-clickable. So there's that. Really sad. 4/10 would not bang.			"

												I played Lucius, I loved everything about the game. I took it for what it was, a game. I didnt go in expecting anything less than that. I got a great playing experience and a new challenge on every level. Its seriously very well put together no matter how much more they could have put in, it was perfect. Stealthy and Deadly. Lucius 2 So far (Level 4) is a little bit more dependant on what you learned from Lucius. Same great killings but done your own way. Its great and i love this series. Definitely worth a try if youre not a religious nutcase. Great Dark Humor.			"

												""Lucius 2"" or maybe its better to call this Game ""Lucius 2 Pre Alpha Edition"", more buggs then an Early Access Game.I don´t recommand this Game for now, its already been Patched but didnt fixed much. Still buggy as hell, animation is broken, kills are lame, story? where is the story? oh yeah, escape from the hospital, kill peoples to get a key and open the doors, do this untile the game finish and you are free? maybe yes. After Chapter 2 you can robe shops, but gameplay is the same, kill peoples to get a key. KI is dumber then bread and when they get you, you can use E to escape and also you have enought time to kill him. This game is not bad, it makes a bit fun but only a bit, if you loved Lucius 1 then waite for a sale or for a few Patches. If you didn`t liked Lucius 1 then don`t buy this, its much worser then Lucius 1. I realy liked the first Game, played it 4 times and Kill sequences was realy nice but you will not finde it in this game, I`m also not realy sure if they did it to sell it in germany or why the hell they ruined this game so much?I would like to give this Game a Positive Feedback but sadly there is no way at the moment to do that. 4,5/10 PointsPros:Epic Trailer for a buggy and lame gameMusicyou can combine items to killContras:Too much buggsBad AnimationsGlitchesCrashesNo athmosphereNo Kill sequenzes like Lucius 1 hadLame StoryNo real Video only Picture Videos with bad drawingsVoice too silentGraphic looks worser then Lucius 1			"

												What in the heck happened to this game? I didn't have to play long to see the many problems it has.I enjoyed the first game and while it had limitations, at least npcs felt more real to me than those in this game. The NPCs at first were jumping/glitching all over the place when I first started playing and for a second I thought I was lagging or something. Turns out it was the game itself to my surprise.Some of the stuff, while a little creative, has me questioning why people would pick up donuts off the floor and eat them? Unknowningly to them, the donuts were poisoned and  it was followed by a horrible choking animation and slight ragdoll flail to the floor. Needless to say, what happened?Not only that, sometimes I try to over think it and try to make a smart trap and turns out it doesn't work, or at least I thought. I then gave up on it and went half across the map to do something else, but then suddenly my screen goes into slow-mo and I got XP. Turns out, without me seeing or knowing, the guy for whatever reason decided to stop going on its 'fixed' path and went into my trap randomly.Should I be concerned? Not so sure now.Besides the NPCs, their glitches, faults, and outrageous rag-doll mechanics (inlcuding Lucius's as well when you're 'busted), the controls are something I want to touch on as well.The using function is such a pain... Often times I mess up what I am doing and nearly get caught because I may have the wrong item equiped since if you pick up something, it switches to that.The inventory is pretty spacious and all, but just trying to click on an item is a pain because often I click it and it makes me take it out almost immediately. I like the whole floating the item thing, but since it is not normal every NPC freaks out because I accidently have too many items and the inventory doesn't pause the game, so it's a rush to drop an item and quickly put away the one you are having float above your head, as if that is normal. Now I have to hide and switch items that I have equipped for the other so that if I were to be standing there like an idiot, no one will see something floating randomly next to me.What happened to just holding stuff? Too cool for me!Also... Is there a toggle for the sneak? It hurts my pinky to use the Left Crtl, holding it down while trying to figure out what I need, the inventory, power or item usage, and watch the patrols... Blargh.Was this game rushed? Has no one even tested/try this game? Who the heck gave this signaI to release? I am very disappointed, but at least it gave me quite a few laughs when bodies randomly ragdoll everywhere... The first game at least was a lot better than this.Not worth it though for full price. Maybe get it when it is worth $5 and you might get a small laugh out of it.			"

												Lucius II is a terrible sequel to a great game. The first Lucius was more about the story and the atmosphere while it's sequel  is less good in almost every single way possible: Gameplay is less fun, exploration is more tedious, ""quests"" are boring and sometimes too easy/too hard, stealth is annoying/broken, the story is stupid(Seriously? The inspector really trusts Lucius THAT MUCH????) and even the Lucius model is less good than in the first game. It's also super buggy and it's hard to execute complicated plans because it probably won't work (due to the bad AI) and you end up resorting to poisoning them more often than not.If you've enjoyed Lucius, don't play this, as it might tarnish your enjoyment for the series. For the record, the first Lucius game is easily in my top 10 best gaming experiences in the past 5 years.			"

												To quickly sum it up, its not worth the buy.MANY WAYS TO KILLSure there are many ways to kill people, but you will have a hard time luring them into these places and will end up relying on simple ways to kill people like poisioning coffee or food or drag a defib aroudn with you shocking everyone.HEALTH SYSTEMFor some odd reason you get health out of toilet bowls... like seriously devs being that more than 3/4 of the game takes place in a ♥♥♥♥ing hospital you didn't think of finding medical kits lying around or something better than a ♥♥♥♥ing toilet!!!!!! Jeez guys.CUTSCENE FRAMESEven on a superb rig you can go from steady 60 frames to almost 11 as every cutscene locks the frames between 10 and 18 (I tested multiple times with a frame counter)*SPOILER ALERT* (No need to worry ) - END OF THE GAMEI actually enjoyed the game up until the very end even with all these very weird things and bugs/glitches, corruption of saves, etc. and then you have to shoot a fire hydrant to knock  the shotgun out of some dead nurses hand that is just frozen in time and then load salt shells into it to kill your brother. It is now one of the worst endings to a game in my book.TRICYCLESeemed very pointless except for the first mission in Ludlow.			"

												I enjoyed the Hell out of this game. The first is solid and a fun little game of its own right, this however expands on the formula and holds your hand less. The learning curve is a bit steep but the potential for entertaining or particularly ingenious kills is very high. I highly recommend both this and Lucius as well as the inevitable Lucius III. This is shaping up to be one of the most solid sandbox series in a few years, it reminds me of the best parts of Dead Rising and Hitman.			"

												I honestly was looking forward to playing this and despite all the negative reviews I went in on a positive and after an hour I could see just why this game has so many negative reviews.I really did try to give it a chance and I really wanted to like it but I just don't like it.It's not bad, just disappointing it has potential to be great but it isn't and I wish I had the patience to play for longer but it just got boring incredibly fast.  Pros  Nice graphics Runs smoother then Lucius 1 did (for me any way) The map is a lot better then the first game Cons  Doesn't feel like a Lucius game Mana bar is stupid and runs out constantly Too many items that don't work the way you'd expect them to e.g  flamable liquid on the floor + lighter doesn't work No tutorial how to use items (poisoned doughnuts and coffee for everyone!)

												Where to start!This game lived up to my hopes for a sequel to the first game.The concept is simple, you are the son of Satan and you must destroy everyone and everything in your path to become the best son.You go from area to area completing specific tasks in order to move farther along in your quest.The only issue I really had with the game is how convoluted it can be, for example, the bible in Ludlow took me awhile to get as I hadn't focused on my fire abilities and had to run around doing meaningless stuff just to acquire keys.Lucius being the silent protagonist is loveable, he's just too cute and innoce... um evil. He does his job and fits the role well.Lucius II let's you explore and I personally love that, it causes you to struggle a little bit, it never hands you a direct solution just hints that guide you along your journey.7.5/10			"

												No. Just... no.This game is buggy. No no, BEYOND buggy. I have a small feeling that this game was rushed to be released on Friday the 13th; if this is true, you guys have released one of the most broken games I have ever bought.I love the game itself, murder is quite fun. I hate, however, the game mechanics that break all the damn time. Icon's missing, AI completely disappearing and rendering certain levels to be restarted, etc., etc. Don't buy this. You cannot beat it. I am near the end of the game and you need a shotgun. What shotgun? The one the lady is holding? Ha. no. Oh, and how creative; you have to kill Isaac (Lucius's competition for the throne) with ""salt shells"". What? Where they on crack when they thought that up? Ugh. Also, the optimazition is♥♥♥♥♥♥poor. I can run most games on the highest settings, like KSP and Just Cause 2. With this, however, the framerate is about as unstable as the AI in the mental hospital level. Don't cremate more than 5 bodies. It will either freeze or crash the game. I love the idea, I love the gameplay, but there isn't really a game yet. Please update this, Shiver.			"

												Little kid goes into someone's office? GRAB HIM!Little kid walks around with a loaded nailgun hovering three inches above the palm of his hands? Nobody bats an eye.---Is it a perfect game? No. Nothing is. Even the little companies drop the soap sometimes. God bless 'em they're trying though. They might not have made the most perfect game, I've run into a few bugs and hangups, I won't lie, but the gameplay and unintentional sillyness make up for it.There's so, so many ways to kill everyone in your path (especially if you get to the end and start new game+.) Poison Donuts, poison sandwiches, a loaded wallet in the middle of a pool of electrified water, and more. Come to think of it, if they're so dumb they'll eat a random sandwich off the floor, regardless of how many bottles of viagra or whatever you put into it, you're probably HELPING the human race instead of damning it.If you don't want to rely on human stupidity, you can just cut the♥♥♥♥♥♥and get your tiny hands dirty. Grab a nailgun and start racking up headshots, mind control someone and have them murder people with an axe, whip up a homemade time bomb and set it right beside them on the can (they don't even bat an eye, seriously) have them slip and fall to their certain deaths in an elevator shaft, use a pressure valve and an unspecified marital aid and more. You're only limited by your own imagination!I'd go on about more of the sillyness, but I don't want to spoil everything. Trust me, it's an enjoyable kind of stupid.Buy this game and make Daddy proud!			"

												Nothing like the first. Poor game direction, horrible voice acting, unthoughtful controls, typos galore, but there is something that really makes this the worst game i've ever played.The humour in this game is absolutely disgusting. From implying that one of the lead characters is sucking the devil's d!ck in the first hour of the game, from unnecessary gay sex in the hospital, to being able to kill a naked man by projecting a d!ldo in his a55. No, but the immature, disrespectful developers takes it further. They have 2 achievements related to Michael Jackson.  The second making me so disgusted. The first, touch four children and unlock the achievement, 'MJ'. The 2nd, get ran over by a van that Michael Jackson happens to be driving...with 4 NAKED KIDS as passengers. Yes, I was able to clip into the van and see more bullsh!t.This game wasn't made with love, but with a thought for money. Do not get this game. Stick to the first one. It is insulting, it is disgusting and the developers should be ashamed for the vulgar and careless decisions they decided to put into a game that ruined any possiblity of a sequel.			"

												It's an ok game. Many review saying it's bad. It's not bad. It's not polished when it comes to programming and gameplay, with many exagerated physics but overall pretty fun game. Main focus being the murdering of people, it gives you plenty of options to go about doing so, so you can get creative there, although, if there's no pre-scripted murder for a specific NPC, you might find repeating deaths and it can feel like a chore (if you're out to murder everone!) In comparison, the first game, didn't give you any choice in murdering at all; all deaths where pre-scripted, so a big diference between games there. Story is ok. At least it has a story, in comparison to the first game, which didn't - which was fine, but also, big difference there. Open-worldness feeling in Lucius 2 is a plus, can feel overwhelming at the begining but it gets more intuitive. Fun little game. Fun to figure out specific murders, or new ways of doing them. Overall, enjoyable. I got the game for 33 cents, but i'd get it for max $15.			"

												I enjoyed it a lot more than the first game, it's much more fun. You start in a hospital, then you go to a town, then to a farm, so it's not just one scenario like in the first game. And you now have the freedom to kill everyone in any way that you'd like (and there are a lot of different ways), so there's plenty of room to get creative, although that also means the deaths are less meaningful than in the first game. You also get to choose which powers you want to unlock first, which is nice, but can be tricky: you might need a specific power later on and you unlocked a not-so-needed one first, so you're out of points to unlock the one you need, having to replay the game from the chapter where you got the power to choose differently this time. I just didn't like the story much, it's not as good as the first one's.			"

Still, I find this game incredibly entertaining and I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the first game or anyone who enjoys playing games that are a little different.

I think the biggest problem for me was the skill tree and how limited the items are in each level. I rarely used my powers because I could usually get by with using items and more often than not, I was out of mana anyway. Mana is extremely finite and a lot of the items need to be carried over into the next level in order to use certain traps. Over all it's an ok game. It's fun for the most part but really frustrating after a while. Can't really recommend it unfortunately.			"

												This game is worth it just for the fact that you can murder people with a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥No, really, if I had to be honest I'd say the game is worth it if you enjoyed the first one in terms of story and gameplay : it follows the same path of murdering people to reach your objectives. The gameplay is sometimes glitchy and the ennemies are as intelligent as potatoes but I have to say it is in a way what makes the game fun and enjoyable. Compared to the first one, you can go on killing sprees (achievements hunters will need to do that anyway) in multiple inventive ways, changing the kinda boring ''kill this person, then this person, then this person'' rhythm the first game had to one that makes you want to actually think about what you are doing, and enjoy it. As a fan of the first game as well as the movie, I would recommend the game for the hours of fun it can provide if you know what to expect gameplay-wise.  "

												The first Lucius was definitely better. AI on this game kinda sucks. You do lots of weird♥♥♥♥♥♥near people but it seems like they don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about your plans about killing every single one of them. Optimization is poor and there are lots of unnecessary texts on screen. First game was more minimalistic on that point, which I have really liked. But this game is full of mad bugs and unsatisfying storyline. It seems there will be another Lucius game, I hope it won't be a failure like Lucius II and it will be a nice game like the first Lucius.			"

												Evem though I really loved Lucius, its sequel does not live up to the first one. The story is very uninteresting, the gameplay is boring and confusing. And the kills are very basic and anticlimactic. If you liked the first one, don't come running to this one expecting a lot.			"

												I've learned reviews aren't always accurate.Reviews here made it sound like this is just a mindless sandbox where you're put in a town and just kill everyone, and that the only way to really kill people is with poisoned doughnuts. I've discovered this is inaccurate.It's the same game as Lucius 1 with a bit more freedom, which has its pros and cons. The first game gave you the whole mansion to explore, and on each level you had to kill a certain person a certain way. Now you're put in certain areas, still have certain objectives or have to kill certain people, but are free to kill everyone else in the area too and in any way you wish.There are numerous creative ways to kill people, with some set up for you to figure out the chain of events that could lead to a glorious/hilarious multi-kill. Poisoned doughnuts are just the last resort if you can't see or think of any other good way. I haven't encountered another game yet that lets you kill someone via forced anal entry with a certain sex toy shot from a pressure valve.The people are stupid, but that's part of the appeal. The game is intentional-unintentional ludicrous dark comedy. It's supposed be fun, and it would be a bad game and unfitting if you had to hardcore stealth through the whole thing like Splinter Cell or Metal Gear. Who stealths riding a tricycle and blowing someone's head clean off with a flying gas canister, I mean really?It can be a bit rough around the edges, a bit buggy every now and then, they need to work on that for the possible sequel. But I found myself spending ages in the first few levels just discovering all the crazy ways to murder people, and the game ended before it really got repetitive. No regrets.			"

												So ... I had mixed feeling on Lucius I.  To the degree that I didn't feel like I could review it; I didn't have a clear yes/no answer and I honestly didn't think I could rate it.  Monotonous gameplay, and the last murder is so obnoxious to deal with that I gave up and watched the ending on You Tube.  But did I have fun?  Yeah.  Did I like it?  Yeah.Anyway ... Lucius II is nothing like Lucius I.  The only similarity is you're a kid with demonic powers and I guess it continues the story with a very thin premise that I won't go into because it spoils Lucius I.The throwing mechanic made me want to throw my laptop.  Seriously, when it took me like 15 tries to throw a can of food onto a button in the tutorial, I knew I was in for it.  They made it very clear that this mechanic was going to be used everywhere, and they also established that I would hate it.  I did get a little better at it through the game, but its frustrating and clunky.All the controls are frustrating and clunky.  Lucius I was pretty streamlined.  Lucius II could have used the exact same control interface -- perhaps with a minor modification for the throwing mechanic -- but it's more complex with no descernable reason to it.Playing the first level, it was reasonably fun ... now all the sudden it's about body count rather than finesse.  Whatever -- there's a lot of creative ways to kill folks and it's not quite as on-rails as Lucius I.  I liked that.The second level, though?  Ugh.  I got a cart stuck to me and I couldn't let go of it no matter what I did.  All the hospital staff were panicing and upset, but ... it didn't seem to matter.  Nobody stopped me or did anything other than run and cower, even when one witnessed me murder someone.  I didn't get it.  Eventually I just got bored and sick of being stuck to a cart, and I quit and uninstalled.  Just nothing really worth the effort here.Just a lame shadow of a good idea. :P  Sorry guys ... if Lucius III ever comes out, well, I'd be tempted to buy it.  But only on sale.  I'd recommend skipping this one, and maybe going to buy Lucius I when it's on sale. "

												How can a sequel be this much worse than its predecessor? The game starts with a horrible and poorly made tutorial, then instead of some neat video sequences like the first game had, I had to suffer through some drawings with sound effects (the lazy mans video sequence, I suppose) and a not well thought-out plot being explained to me. When I try to kill my first victim I have already realized that I have made a bad purchase as the game bugs itself and the victim start getting movement spasms instead of walking to its intended locations (what's up with the AI?!). I struggle in this area for a while, getting quite angry with the ONE looping sound effect from a madman in the background. He has one sound effect, and it literally plays about every twelth second!!!! I can't use poison on the victim as the pills I had disappeared into the wall after I tried throwing them at an interactable ceiling hatch. Thankfully there are other, less buggy (but still buggy) ways to kill this victim, but at this point I just wish I could get my money back and never see this game again. I'm very sad to give this game a bad review as I really loved playing Lucius 1. I don't know what went wrong with this one, but I feel tricked. Obviously I should have watched a playthrough or a review on YouTube before wasting my money...Lucius 1 was an incredible game, but I think they had a lower budget on its sequel, because the gameplay, sound effects and pretty much everything is a whole lot worse than it ever was. Or is this still in beta and I just didn't read the fine print?EDIT:I have to add to my review, because I was naive enough to give the game a second chance. Unfortunately that only served to remind me of how horrible this game actually is. I honestly believe the developers spent about one month to make some beta (or worse) version of the game, then just gave up, but released it anyway. It's riddled with bugs and glitches, and even though I loved Lucius 1, playing this sequel makes me suspect that maybe a completely different person made it. Or maybe a monkey did the programming. That would explain a lot... Honestly: NEVER buy this game. If you read this, go on YouTube and see just how terrible the gameplay is. Everything from the camera angle to the AWFUL gravity engine (or lack of one) and the buggy characters and completely depressing AI, annoyingly looping sounds without variation and a completely different gameplay from the original should be enough reasons to avoid this game like the plague. I really wanted to like this game. I really did... But nope. This is the worst game I've played in years and it makes me angry to see it on my desktop.Developers: Shame on you. You could have done so much better!			"

												I got this game for a couple of Canadian bucks. Was pretty fun, kinda Easy. I see many reviews  of people complaining that there aren't creative ways to get the kills; I'd have to disagree. It could be that they suck at it. You have to set traps then lure people to where you want them. NPCs don't have predefined patrol routes as long as they arnt freaked out. There are traps already set up sometimes ya. but you're not going to have enough pills and dougnuts for everyone and if you want to get kill combos and get a high score then you have to be creative sometimes; take a couple of jugs of flammable liquid lay a trail under everyone's feet in the lobby; turn on defibrillator; 4x kill combo =] It's a game not a movie if you want to get everyone then you have to conserve some of your killing tools for the right time. On the issue of buggy controls and bugs: I had no issue getting though the game first try didn't need to restart and honestly only seen a few minor bugs-The dude on the 'recieveing' end in the bathroom wouldn't die even though i flooded the whole thing and electrified it. -Aiming the launching gas cannisters is tricky -If the end boss knocks ya down when he's low health you're pretty much screwed.-It is a bit annoying to have to combine the ammo with the shotgun in the inventory -The NPC bodies are feather weights and flail 5 feet away when an 8 yr kid steps past them.In the end that was 8 hours of entertainment for $2.17 and had i spent 20 bucks on it i'd still be pleased I had not played a game like this before; it is unique.Did I mention it's the price of a friggen coffee right now; Get it.

												Lucius II has done for the original what Saint's Row 2 did for Grand Theft Auto 4. don't go into this expecting a slow, moody tie into a popular film, it in fact, plays more like Hitman, but your goal is to actully kill everyone, rather than sneak about and silently assasinate one or 2 targets. If you're in the mood for some silly, nonesense killing fun time, give this game a try.			"

From people sitting in walls and items falling through the floors to carts that keep humping my leg no matter what I do (even dying couldn't stop the cart humping.)If I could give the game a 50/50 I woud, it wasn't bad at all but it needs some polish to match the first game.

												Sequel to Lucius, the game where you control son of the Devil and try to kill people. In this one story continues right after the first game. Detective takes you away from the mansion, you are placed into the hospital for medical treatment and psychological evaluation. But things get out of hand when medical staff start to poke you with nasty medicine.You pretty much go ham on the whole hospital staff and patients if you wish of course, you don't have to kill everyone, but who am I kidding. You still have your generic story objectives yet how you execute people is up to you. A lot of different items you can use and combine together for hilarious effects. Liquids have different properties, some ignite if you add flame, others conduct electricity or are great way to trip someone if you pour it near some dangerous hazards.Few of the ways to send someone packing: Smash some electricity panel and expose the wires, pour some water from the canister and throw sandwich in it to lure some enemy for a shocking death. Drop some pills in coffee machine and brew coffee, then wait for unsuspecting nurse to taste the hot cup of sweet poison. Break open the elevator controls, open the elevator doors, then empty some oil or washing gel near the shaft, add some lure and voila a slippery drop to their death. You can also simply throw a bottle with flammable liquid under someone and then ignite with one of your powers for a quick fiery death. Throw acidic bottle in someone's face or break a valve on steam pipe, strap a sex toy on it (no kidding) and let it go for unsuspecting shower accident.Combinations are endless, there's a lot more ways to add more souls to your collection just explore the level and don't rush with the killings. It's a short, fun game with not as interesting story as the first game, but much more unleashed in terms of gameplay.There's no vsync option in game, and if there is it's not working, so what I did is I limited the framerate through the RivaTuner Server, which is part of MSI Afterburner. Sure it's not needed if you want 300 fps in the game but GPU is starting to melt with such high fps on my end.Anyways, have fun and enjoy.			"

												The main reason why I'm recommending the game is not because I adored the first, but because it has quite a lot of promise despite it's flaws. The plot of the story is just as basic as the first, but tries to over complicate itself with themes and character development that is lackluster and could have been slowed down for a more meaningful experience. Some moments, like when you first physically meet with Lucifer and when you meet up with your demon brother Isaac, leaves much to be desired. The story is rushed and feels as if, despite the gameplay and world being much more thought out, the story was put on the backburner and not given as much attention as it deserved. The story had very redeeming qualities that if it was given more time and effort, it would have been a lot more exciting. I really loved the idea of Lucifers sons fighting to be the favourite and doing so through a biblical demonic event. It moves past the personal struggles with his biological family and makes his demonic one more dynamic and almost human. For the gameplay, I felt that the fast paced and almost rushed qualities of the story rubbed off on it. The skills you obtain and the different ways that you can execute your targets were plentiful. You didn't have individual targets like the first game though, but whole floors full of people with you having a choice whether to only kill those you need to kill, or to kill them all to get more power. This is great, but the first games targets felt a lot more personal and gave you a chance to have an attachment to the character if you so wished to. If there would be a better balance between each aspect of the game and slowed it down, I think it would be much more successful of a game. Also, in regards to the endings hint towards a Lucius 3, it was a good ending at best and would have benefited with a little more flare. Perhaps using that tutorial map more so Lucifer could have more of a spotlight like he had in the first game would have done the trick. In my opinion I'd give the game a solid 6/10.			"

												READ THE FULL REVIEW FIRST BEFORE DOWN VOTING Lucius 2 is the sequel to the indie horror game released in 2012 where you play as the son of the devil Lucius. But will you want to play this game or go back to the first one ? In Lucius 2 we play as Lucius. This game takes place after the events of the first game. After the destruction that Lucius caused he got sent to a Mental Hospital to be tested but after a mistake some of the workers make Lucius is able to escape and wreak havoc. Lucius finds out that he has a brother and he needs to beat him to win over his father. So how is this game ? The game is a really good game but theres a ton of stuff wrong with this game. First of all this game is entirely diffrent then the first game. Unlike the first game where you didnt have control on who to kill or how to kill them you are now given free control on who to kill and any way you want to. You have all the objectives availble at the start of the level and you can get them in any order you like. The game's story is very interesting and in my oppinion is way better than the first game and its way more fun than the first game cause the killing system works way better in 2 than in 1 but this is where the problems start to pour down. The game is riddled with bugs and sometimes it can be game breaking. People clip through walls, Items phase through walls, the map sometimes doenst show doors and it can be complicated and without spoilers. The final level is complete BS and to figure out what you need to do could be really annoying. Overall Lucius 2 is a good game and without a doubt i would reccomend getting at some point or just wait for a patch because this game is way better than the first. I bought the game yesterday and had trouble finishing a level because of the bugs. When i closed the game i found that there was a patch that fixed the problem. If you were a fan of the first game defiently thing about getting this game. I give Lucius 2 a 7/10			"

												I enjoyed the first game for what it was. This seems to be trying to take the whole thing into a more sandboxey way which might have been really fun if the game actually worked as it should. The UI is terrible and the performance is awful but that is the least of this games problems. There are bugs everywhere. Characters going through walls, getting stuck in doorways and etc etc. I lost all interest in the game when the guy who had the key i needed got stuck inside a toilet and somehow managed to block the door. It feels unfinished and i can't recommend it.The actual content in the game could have been fun. The story is chessy but it could have been enjoyable. I am not convinced of the new sandbox style gameplay. The AI behaves oddly and there have not been many interesting ways to manipulate the environment so far. Perhaps there will be more interesting ones later on but so far it has mostly been poisoned food, water/electricity and some fire stuff.			"

												This game is frustrating and buggy as ♥♥♥♥, the possession mechanics just do NOT work (why the ♥♥♥♥ can someone not unlock the door they have a key for?), it's way too short (literally half of the game takes place in the same nearly identical floors of a hospital), there's really no reason to replay it. There's also no guns in this game for some reason despite it taking place in the rural US, except for a nailgunt, and a sawn-off shotgun you use for one frustrating unfun boss battle at the end. Even the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ National Guardsmen at the end don't have guns, which makes no ♥♥♥♥ing sense. I get that the game isn't supposed to be a shooter but I hate when a game defies logic so hard to justify you not being able to just shoot everyone. Also Lucius can't pick up a fireaxe because it's ""too heavy"" despite him lifting things with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ TELEKINESIS.I have no idea why this game has a New Game+ mode, all you can do is carry over a couple of the items from the final battle which are uterrly useless in pretty much every other situation.Literally the only positive thing in this game is that Cr!tikal voiced a character, but he's in a building that's on fire so you hardly get to hear him.Would not recommend :/			"

												To improve upon the original Lucius wouldn't have been a daunting nor difficult task, there were plenty of design mistakes that plagued the debut effort. Apart from being less linear and providing more variety and tools for dispatching victims, Lucius II is everything a sequel shouldn't be. Filled to the brim with bugs and glitches that constantly drag down gameplay, the AI is beyond a joke and incredibly easy to exploit, the only challenge comes from the infuriating, broken mechanics. The arid story takes you through a range of mundane and characterless locations, it also features the most nonthreatening devil in video game history.Slaughtering the developers with a nail gun was quite cathartic, and very telling, this feels like a product of self-loathing.3/10			"

												I enjoyed the first game for what it was. This seems to be trying to take the whole thing into a more sandboxey way which might have been really fun if the game actually worked as it should. The UI is terrible and the performance is awful but that is the least of this games problems. There are bugs everywhere. Characters going through walls, getting stuck in doorways and etc etc. I lost all interest in the game when the guy who had the key i needed got stuck inside a toilet and somehow managed to block the door. It feels unfinished and i can't recommend it.The actual content in the game could have been fun. The story is chessy but it could have been enjoyable. I am not convinced of the new sandbox style gameplay. The AI behaves oddly and there have not been many interesting ways to manipulate the environment so far. Perhaps there will be more interesting ones later on but so far it has mostly been poisoned food, water/electricity and some fire stuff.			"

												Boring. The first 1 hour or so was quite fun, but then you realise the game is really dull, boring and buggy. If you actually value your spare time, you should find something else to spend it on. It's fun to kill in different ways the first time, but it will get old soon. You constantly have to find things to kill people with because Lucius is a useless ""Devils Son"" who cannot find a knife or use his telekinetic powers better. The AI is ridiculously bad. Not recommended.			"

												In all honesty I want to like this game, I really do.But this game has a LOT of issues; 1. My computer was brand new and saw Lucius II was available and purchased it, when I was going through the tutorial I noticed that I was having serious framerate drops. Thinking that ""it's probably because this map has a lot of detail textures for the fire and the rocks."" But issues still presisted even after the turorial level.2. The A.I.would glitch out on more than one ocasion. I could kill a doctor in a room across the map, within no one's line of sight, and still get caught by a doctor, nurse, or patient from across the map. 3. I'm not to sure about this one in particular, but in the level where you have to suffocate Lucius' dad, you have to acquire the file before you can get to him, which happens to be in a room occupied by tree doctors and one that walks in every so often; one option to kill them is with the sprinkler system and applying acid to the water line. Once I had applied the acid, it would then say to activate the sprinkler system...is there a switch somewhere or do you need a lighter? It's too vague really, and if you happen  to need a lighter, none spawn on the map, but you can get one from the previous levels...at the penalty of sacraficing your save.4. When opening a save file, some of the NPC's would glitch and react to me as if I had killed someone within their line of sight.A word to the wise, if you're thinking about buying this game DO NOT DO IT. You are wasting your money, your time, and your patience with this haphazard of a game. If the dev's don't fix the bugs that plague this game, this game will leave a bad mark on their credibility as a game developer.			"

												*SPOILERS* LUCIUS 2 is an awesome game its not like the first one because it has a different style . the  problem which we can all agree on is that it is way too short . the other one is that the story made no sense at all I mean where did the brother come from whats his story why is lucifer only helping him even though lucius got his powers back and of course the ending was also disappointing . now the reason why people should get this game is because not everything is scripted like it was in the first game  also because now you can unleash your creativity on killing people which was just amazing .killing people in lucius is always awesome and hilarious at the same time i mean the oven from the first game come on that was awesome . next is the powers that you get i thought there could be a little more power that you can get but hey  they are good ones that you can have and they fit well with the game . what i found the best about the game is the way you can control people and make them kill other people that was an awesome touch they did. i recommend this game not because of  the story which was sadly the worst part of the game (not even the bugs) the reason i recommend the game is because the way they supported creativity in the game and that was the best part . this game was alot of fun to play			"

												This is a very fun, very unique game that improves on the original in all aspects. I got about 12 hours of pure enjoyment from it. Once I started playing, I couldn't stop until the whole gruesome thing was finished.Unlike its predessor, there are multiple ways to kill each NPC. Many of these death setpieces are quite stunning. The game managed to impress me again and again with its  cartoonish violence and jovial, malevolent sense of humor. It rewards you for getting double and triple kills, and you'll find yourself looking for the most interesting and elaborate ways to kill the NPCs and move the plot along.The game has is a mixture of adventure, stealth and action elements. The original was purely an adventure title. While it's true none of these aspects are executed masterfully, the unique nature of this game and its extremely entertaining premise more than makes up for the limitations of the engine.Yes, it's still quite buggy but none of these bugs are gamebreaking. This game was made with a lot of love and it shows. It's well worth playing, bugs and all. Highly recommended.			"

												Poor control management (if you have any controller other than a gamepad installed, it can break the game menus completely) kills any playability for this game.It's buggy to the point where it's too distracting.   The game premise is different enough to make it seem compelling, but the implementation kills it.  The game could have been saved if the developers put in a bit more effort to polish the game and make it work properly with KB+M, disregarding game controllers instead of assuming people want to play an FPS with a HOTAS just because one is plugged in.

												Ever felt like being the child of the Lucifer himself? Wanted to become the harbringer of the world's destruction? Play with a beachball until you physically cannot bear to do it anymore? Perform drive-bys on your tricycle while going through the high street? Of course you have, and now you can! Lucius 2 can be easily described to those who know of the Hitman series, where you have a level-based sandbox and filled with tons of innocent mortals waiting joyfully to be murdered! ...Just not to same extent though, the game itself due to the nature of it is quite short while the story isn't as detailed nor impactful as it could of been since you're the son of Satan with a lust of blood. But hey! You're mostly looking for ways to quell your thirst and urges of a sadistic spree of murder in which it does it well, but it can feel quite linear in ways of mass-genicide sometimes.If you're looking for a sandbox-y game to purely mess around in and not really care much about a strong story, this will quell your desires.

												Before i bought this game i was reading about the major bugs for example that the game wont start or no sound at all.I still bought it because i loved the first Lucius so i wanted to give Lucius 2 a try.I have the same problems with a non starting game like many others. I tried every possible way i found in the web to fix that issue. I know 2 Games which are this bugged the first one was ""Among the Sleep"" and the second one was ""SAW"". Both were really good games but with no effort to fix their bugs. One of this games ""SAW"" got even taken off the steam store. We have the same problematic by Lucius 2. Often those games have a problem with the OS or the GPU.I think Lucius 2 has a problem with the OS. It says a minimum OS of XP and recommends Windows 7. If you use 8/10 it might not work. A lot of people with those Versions of Windows have that issues.I tried Windows 8 and Windows 10 and it didnt work (i know theyr not good for gaming but its my laptop) Will have to try in the Future if it works on my Desktop with Windows 7. My guess is that it will work with Windows 7. But if you only have 1 Comp with a Windows 8 or 10 on it u should stay away from this game because it most likely happens that it wont work. If i get it to work i change my review to positive if i like the game but still warning people to buy it.Update: So i installed it on another comp with windows 7 and it just works without any problems or bugs for now. It really catches me to play it. Gameplay,story,sound,graphic is all really good and i like it even more than the first lucius.i dont know if the non start bug has to do with the version of windows or rather with the gpu i wasnt able to fix it on myother conp.only thing i can say is: if the game starts for you then its a really good one and i dont regret my purchase at all. The game devs are working on fixing that bugs. Its worth to get it..but a bit risky for now if u only have 1 computer.			"

												The first Lucius was decent, and over all was a pretty good little game.Lucius 2 is just bad... I really don't know how to explain it. It's like they rushed to develop it or something. It's filled with bugs, weird mechanics, and just a bad design.They tried to go for a more sandbox like gameplay where you can choose how to kill your victim, but it's just not done right. The kill scenes are bad, and not like they were in the first one. The only decent thing about this game is the story, which isn't even really grade A, but it's passable. I'd wait for this to go on sale ($5 or less). It's just not a finished or well developed game. Which is a shame because I really liked the first one, and wanted to support the dev team, but I just can't anymore with this kind of product.			"

												Thank you Baby Satan!!!!I woke up this monring to find one of my Fav games has come out with a sequel to the murderous rampage of a little boy and his ""Obi-Wan Kenobi"" Satan. This one is a little different from the first in a sense its not as linear when it comes to the people you kill This is a MURDER SANDBOX, you are placed on the 5th floor of a mental hospital, where you must find your way out. other then that your free to kill who ever you want, how ever you please with tons of enviromental risks, objects, and skills (3 Skill tree's you can lvl up).The graphics, along with the game play and game engine have had a nice upgrade from the first version, which is nice too see. (you dont see that much with games any more for some reason?) The sound track does lack to the point of turning the music off.*Edit I have got to the third lvl and it is a little buggy the game does need some updates too Smooth it out a litle.8/10!			"

												I honestly enjoy it more than the original Lucius. Sure the voice acting isn't as good, sure there are bugs, but the good stuff is just so good.While the cutscenes in the first game are satisfying, getting to plan your own murders is a ton of fun. It also gives the game more replay value than its predecessor, since in that one it kind of loses its touch once you know how to beat every stage. I also adore the new skill tree system and the abilities to choose from. Especially since it doesn't force you to specialize yourself; as long as you kill enough people in every stage, you can probably max out the skill tree. And still, it sure is fun to play through the game with different play styles. Wanna start off as a mind controlling puppetmaster? Do that! Wanna become a master of telekinesis and toss people around? Do that! Wanna watch stuff burn? Do that!Even though the game still steers your actions through the objectives, it still allows great freedom. Personally I'd love to see some kind of sandbox mode where you can choose between different locations to wreak havoc upon. The graphics have improved as well, so now I can finally look at Lucius's face without wanting to return to staring at the back of his head. The climax was also more impressive this time. It didn't just make you feel like an epic badass, it made you feel like an epic badass fighting a stronger epic badass. And that was fun.Which leads me to one of my few complaints (spoiler alert): I'm not a fan of Isaac. Mostly because of his voice. A character like him who appears to be obsessed with the prophecy and talks the way he does should have a psychotic kid voice to go with that. But instead he was given a really ordinary low-pitched evil voice. Same with the devil. What was wrong with his old voice? I really liked that one.But overall it's a really fun game, expecially if you like to get creative and watch people die. Don't expect to get ""Lucius, but even more"" because you won't. This game is very different from the previous one, and to me in a good way.I really, really hope they make a third game. And if that isn't enough to finish the storyline, a fourth. And a fifth. And a sixth. And as many as the developers deem neccessary. If they keep this up, I promise I will continue playing them.			"

												If you enjoyed the first game like me, don't expect this one to be anything like it.The gameplay is completely different, and although it could have been a nice change, it seems like it's only in alpha stage and is pretty horrible to play in comparison to the first game. All of the characters have no logic to them. Don't worry if you get caught killing someone or if someone finds a dead body, there are virtually no consequences as they will carry on acting as if nothing happened. You can't even use your hands anymore, everything is done via levitating objects. If there is a cross in the room, you can't just go and turn it over. No, you have to stand far away from it and throw an object at it with your telekynesis. Remember all those awesome elements that made you love the first game? You're not really going to find those here (no more challenging puzzles). The storyline isn't implemented into the game very well either. There are multiple bugs in the game too, but none of them are really game breaking.Overall, this game looks like it's in alpha stage, not even beta. It's pretty aweful to play compared to the first game and could have been an amazing sequel. I might still try and complete the game for the story's sake, but I don't know if I can cope with the bugs and the gameplay.Seeing as it only costs a few bucks now I would say just buy it and see for yourself if you like it, but I honestly wouldn't pay any more than that.

												Would love to give it a chance, but this game has aggressively tried to ruin my experience at every turn. I can handle a lot of what makes the game traditionally ""bad"", but:- There is no scaling. Large resolutions = miniscule text.- Refuses to save graphical settings. I have to set them every single time I start the game.- Achievements flat-out don't unlock.- Can't handle multiple control sources at once, such as mouse and joystick.- Managed to botch my save within the first 10 minutes.I want to play the game and trust that it will remember what I've done.

												This game actually changed my life. It really helped me find who I really am on the inside. I often found myself relating to the main character and wanting to be just like him. Lucius is the only character that has spoken to me before. He really knows how to handle a situation in a cool, calm, and collectedd manner. I've tried my hardest to follow in his footsteps but without the help of Lucifer; I'm afraid I cannot pull it off. There have been several attempts but all have failed. My only problem with this game is that I am not Lucius and I cannot do this to the people in my life. It's actually unfair but I can get it all out through this video game and previous game. Life changing experience that everone should go through.			"

												From reading the reviews of others- it is plain to see that Lucius II is one of those games you either love or hate. I personally really enjoyed the game- and contrasting other people's views, I found it much better than the original game in terms of gameplay. The storyline was quite different, and although I completed the game after 8.5 hours it still felt... Kinda short? Maybe on account of half of that being roaming around in a hospital. My main bonus points in this game goes to the freedom you have that you just didn't get in the first game. You can kill people in so many different ways, when and where you want to. I didn't have to reference a walkthrough for this game whereas the first one I was practically glued to guides. I will also point out that I bought this game in the Christmas sale, so instead of paying £19 for both games I got them for maybe £3 ish together? I would rate this game alone to be worth maybe £7-8, so bear that in mind before buying and hang on for a sale of some sort :)			"

												Well I am 9 hours into the game and I think its very unique.  Some of the controls are a bit frustrating, like when you are dragging carts and trying to aim them with tanks on them at people.  other than the control issues, its a pretty fun game.  it started out kinda slow but has progressed and increased in difficulty.  the cutscenes are studdering significantly and are annoying, but i can get easily past that.  I recommend trying this game as it is different and fun, but i would get it on sale.			"

												If you enjoyed the first game like me, don't expect this one to be anything like it.The gameplay is completely different, and although it could have been a nice change, it seems like it's only in alpha stage and is pretty horrible to play in comparison to the first game. All of the characters have no logic to them. Don't worry if you get caught killing someone or if someone finds a dead body, there are virtually no consequences as they will carry on acting as if nothing happened. You can't even use your hands anymore, everything is done via levitating objects. If there is a cross in the room, you can't just go and turn it over. No, you have to stand far away from it and throw an object at it with your telekynesis. Remember all those awesome elements that made you love the first game? You're not really going to find those here (no more challenging puzzles). The storyline isn't implemented into the game very well either. There are multiple bugs in the game too, but none of them are really game breaking.Overall, this game looks like it's in alpha stage, not even beta. It's pretty aweful to play compared to the first game and could have been an amazing sequel. I might still try and complete the game for the story's sake, but I don't know if I can cope with the bugs and the gameplay.Seeing as it only costs a few bucks now I would say just buy it and see for yourself if you like it, but I honestly wouldn't pay any more than that.

No way to invert the look, making me crazy as is, but not able to make various interactiosn correctly?Can't fill the water bucket, following the instructions it just does nothing.

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is an Action third person  game.Interface/Menu/SettingsIt has 3 Profile slots.There are subtitles.There is a slidebar and a number for each graphical settings.You can play this game on Fullscreen or windowed mode.There are many Resolution Sizes.There is a Slidebar for Music/Sound/Video and Voice. However there is no number behind, just a slidebar.You can play with the xbox controller or keyboard.You are able to change your controls.There are some different languages.About the game.You are the Devil's son once again! This time it's with a bit more Free roaming. You start in a clinic and from there you will have to kill enemies again! This time you are also able to get experience and level up. You no longer have a kill list that you MUST follow. You kill what you want to kill. You are able to use powers for the cost of ""mana"". You are able to replenish ""mana/Health"" at some locations. If You make a kill, you will get some of the mana restored. You are able to kill ppl whenever you want, but on the same time it feels very limited. The game itself is fun but sometimes a bit buggy. Especially in some animations. Interesting good intro!Level System and somewhat RPG.Music is alright!Collectables :(Poor Animations.Free Roaming.Manually Saving.A Build in Tutorial.Minimap in the right bottom corner.Game feels limited the way you need to kill them.Contains creepy things.Stiff animations sometimes.Other things.Destroyed a Tv with a beachball.. Yea.. right...Some of the ""Deaths"" are really weird.-------------------I Give this game a 7/10			"

Which affirms my belief that violent video games can actually reduce aggression when used properly.Psychological concepts aside, the second game is rather different from the first. I like that the second game gives us the freedom to decide how each character dies. It gives a sense of control and freedom. But it appears that every death is just... NPCs dying. In the first game, it actually felt like we really killed someone because there's consequences and suspicions and the need to hide evidence. Whereas in the second game...

												The game is not bad, though I expected a lot more from it. While you can kill people in a lot of different ways, it does get tedious, repetitive and very boring very quickly.The controls are clunky, especially during crouching it is awkward to move where you want to go. While the map is open you can walk but can't turn which seems like an oversight and the devs either didn't intend for you to be able to walk while the map is open and it's a bug or they did and it doesn't work and it's a bug.Having said all that, I personally like the voice acting and the cut-scenes and enjoyed the story-line so far and will try to play this one through as time goes on just to see the story through as the gameplay is not that amazing by itself.I also enjoy the skill tree and setting people on fire or mind controlling people is just to funny, making them walk into traps and kill themselves.If you are looking for an intense action adventure game then this is not it, trying to complete the story killing the relevant people just to move on with the story is frustratingly boring at times.All in all not bad and still recommendable as you can just have fun, ignoring story progress, taking your time to come up with convoluted traps that kill people in humorous ways. The way you can kill people is where the game really shines.Though, as a casual player of this title/series, for the price I paid I definitely feel I got the shorter end of the stick and you might want to wait for a bundle or sale discount.

												Even the Antichrist himself would disregard any relation to this game...This game sucks! Why?Once you start the game first thing you'll do is going thru a tutorial level set in hell; literally in Hell;yes it has lava; and flames and everything; but it's not only the setting; the level actually is the worst tutorial level ever conceived: instructions are unclear; you don't know if you are holding an item or not; the buttons you're asked to push won't work and also the actions mapped into them are totally Non-intuitive.Once you get past this hell; you start the actual game; and the same problems that plagged tutorial level are here; but now you can actually fail the mission.The main character walks like he's flying; and I'm sure is not because he's the son of the devil; I'm sure it's a glitch; The game has support for game pads and if you press ""A"" the character will walk to the left with no reason.This is one of the most incomplete games I've played; I didn't ask refund because the story is good an I'd like to the see how it ends but I'm sure it will be a nightmare to play.

												This game is super fun, seriously. It's pretty much a Murder Simulator and it is stup[idly funny watching the NPCs get electrocuted or blown up with gas tanks etc.However there are a few issues, namely the controls and how people interact with doors.Controls - Horrendous at times, stupidly hard to focus on the correct item you wish to use and if you want to precisely move an object around forget about it.Doors - They all shut when you load a level. Which normally is fine, just reopen them. However, if somebody dies in a doorway and the game loads, the door is now shut on the dead body which causes the body to completely stop the door from opening ever again. This is quite infuriating especially if the door that cant open is the way you need to go.Overall though this game is really fun novelty but wait for it to go on sale before getting it is all.			"

												The controls are weird as hell, but you get used to them after a while. You can't drag or carry things without raising suspicion because somehow the devil's son is too physically weak to hold♥♥♥♥♥♥with his actual hands, which makes the game much harder than it has to be. The first Lucius was really good, but now they've screwed up the plot, added a crappy sub-plot, and managed to create more glitches than in skyrim (but not as entertaining).

												Left me disappointed, I was expecting more from this.You do get more freedom and choose the way you kill people unlike the first one where you couldn't chose how but the first one had more creativity on the kills unlike this one where you can basicaly kill a whole room of people by making a fire then using mind control and walking into the fire. It all depends on how you decide to play this game but I can assure you after a while it will definitely get repetitive. A lot of people were complaining about bugs but I haven't got a game breaking bug at all unless you count the ending which is very disappointing. Not a bad game but not great either.If you really wanna buy this game and you were a fan of the first one, I'd recommend waiting when its 5$ on a steam sale  so if you're disappointed then it doesn't sting as much.Oh and by the way, was the scene with the 2 guys in the hospital really necessary?

It makes me laugh every time i make someone walk into a hazzard or down an elevator shaft.-From what ive come across it can be a bit like a puzzle game where you have to get certain pieces in the right place and it can make you think.Cons:-Sometimes things can..break. Which means you have to reload your last save in order to get an item that you need to progress. This is just a minor annoyance and has only happened to me once.-Im not terribly invested in the story. Its more fun just killing the AI then knowing why you are doing what you are.-There isnt really any benifit to being sneaky.neutral:-The physics can get a bit weird with ragdoll when you are caught or kill someone, but once again i think this just makes me laugh more than it makes me upset that its not realism.-Toilets give mana or power. Dont exactly understand that one, but its semi humorous.-Sometimes you dont have the obvious tools to get a kill you need on someone to get a set of keys, which can lead to a bit of searching untill you find it in some obscure place after 10 min.Overall I would reccomend this game. The price point is a bit high for it currently at $20, but if you can get it on sale I would say get it because It can give you some good laughs and who doesnt want to be the son of satan for a little while?7.8/10 "

												I really loved the 1st game. I can't start a new game with a new profile. after the recent patch on this game I cannot get past the first door. It keeps crashing. Over and over.  I got up to chapter 4 and I still cannot do anything after it loads.Of what I played was fun, but now this is really irritating.  If they get everything fixed and not break things in the process it might be a good game.  For now I don't recommend it.			"

												Left me disappointed, I was expecting more from this.You do get more freedom and choose the way you kill people unlike the first one where you couldn't chose how but the first one had more creativity on the kills unlike this one where you can basicaly kill a whole room of people by making a fire then using mind control and walking into the fire. It all depends on how you decide to play this game but I can assure you after a while it will definitely get repetitive. A lot of people were complaining about bugs but I haven't got a game breaking bug at all unless you count the ending which is very disappointing. Not a bad game but not great either.If you really wanna buy this game and you were a fan of the first one, I'd recommend waiting when its 5$ on a steam sale  so if you're disappointed then it doesn't sting as much.Oh and by the way, was the scene with the 2 guys in the hospital really necessary? O.o			"

												Can I recommend it? I am not sure about that. Lucius 2 definatly has some major bugs. I first thought of it as more promissing. Most killing methods just repeat themselves. And you find yourself with using Control and Fire(manareg) as one of the top skills. Later telekenesis is helpfull (pressing a button from a distance a single time)The Ragdoll system sucks. You pull your dead victim in a room, and then you kick it out again, which quite sucks. Sandbox experience? Not really. Under sandbox I understand quite more. And once you don't have enough pills or electrical cords and your experience is to low to make your victim jump itself down the elevator shaft you find yourself soon stuck.The ending is quite lame. Could have been done better and leaves you with the impression that the game was literally too short to play.It sure rather reminds as an early access then a finished game. Part 1 - Linear but still fun. Part 2 - free to kill in each level is quite fun, but the ragdoll and the quite dry storyline ruins everything. And somehow the half-brother of Lucius reminds me of an actor. Not sure whom. I don't recomend it now. Please wait for the finished version.			"

												I was expecting so much more of this game. Dont get me wrong it isnt a bad game its just that i find it repeats itself over and over and over again. You start off having to find your way out of your hospital room and find your normal clothes in order to do this you need to kill some people. Stage 2 you then need to find a nun whom you attacked for some magical reason earlier on in the game and to do this you need to .....you guessed it , kill some people ( with pretty much the same techniques as the last time) ..i could ramble on saying each part piece by piece but you get the idea. The game has a very limited ammount of options as regards how you kill people and can earn points to level up and once you do all of these this game just becomes pure boredom.......................oh and as for the scene of some guy sucking the devils D i c k .....yea....that was just unnecessary and honestly pretty disturbing....

												514 reviews when I made my review, and it was already 'mixed', which means there's just as many negative as positive. That tells you something. Some of these things cannot be changed with patches. If I was the developers, I would scrap this junk and start over. The basics. CLUNKY GAMEPLAY. Terrible movement and no thriller element what so ever. You're in a mental hospital to kill people, and it feels like I am an old lady at the market, looking for an exit. The AI see you behind walls, or doors before they're opened, but they do not spot you glaring at them through a glass window. The controls are terrible. Cannot quickly run past something, grab it and keep going; need to focus on the item and pick it up and put it in your inventory ...sigh. All AI run in the same motion, all the time. The mental patient running down the hall, back and forth, the mental patient standing near the magazine counter, the two men chatting at the table, the janitor... they all do the same motion, every time, no element of surprise, no puzzle, just boring kill them and wait for them to repeat their same actions. TERRIBLE STORY. This story literally made me laugh in a pathetic way. When I watch the beginning cutscene, I thought to myself then and there, ""this is going to be a refund."" The writer obviously has a very vague understanding of religious culture and absolutely no knowledge of Satan. A child with a crayon and a booger, could create better material. Weak story, uneventful, no draw-in what so ever, no thrill, just cheesy boring dialog. The developer clearly got made fun of in Sunday school; Jesus hurt his feelings. So he cried, and made a promise to one day release a terrible game that no one would play, even at a 75% discount, because he is in himself, a failure. If you paid full price. You got hosed. If you paid $4.99, you got hosed. I wouldn't even buy this, just go download it someplace, it will be in your recycling bin wthin an hour.			"

												While the original lucius was dark and puzzling, this game took all of that and♥♥♥♥♥♥down it's throat. theres ""multiple"" ways to kill each person, and you have ""many"" dark powers to kill withm but none of it is satisfying. In the first game, each kill had a fair amount of puzzle to it, and this game fails to even come close to the fun of the orignal. The interesting path is hidden, while the best way to murder may be as easy as ""pull around this cart for a while until someone shows up."" Not to mention the countless bugs i encountered in ONE HOUR of gameplay.			"

												     I went into this game without doing research on how it worked so i thought ""well this will be fun because of all the ways you can kill people!"" but it turns out the variety is alot more complex for a Fps player like me so i just ended up spending all of my upgrade points on the mind-control skill because mind-control is such a cool concept! I later found out that you could mind control someone to go down the elavator shaft in order to kill them. That was basicly the most convient way of killing them without getting suspected. so that's what i did for the next two floors and it just got way to repetitive for my liking.			"

												It's well worth playing, especially while its at this low price. I've enjoyed the setting and the freedom of exploring the various and inventive approaches offered to kill the people in your way. It's very different than the first game and I say it makes a great sequel!I highly reccomend this game and I feel many have been too critical of it. I like how the objectives are consistently clear and how even if you screw up an obvious method for killing a target (usually a staff member with a key) its easy enough to look around and divise a creative way of doing it.  In this regard the game is a bit easier and more fast paced than the first one, I feel it has just the perfect amount of difficulty to it, and the real challenge lies in racking up a nice score. 10/10 give it a go!

												Okay, I'll be blunt: I can't actually give the game a proper review. It crashes after I finish the tutorial, and nothing I've tried could fix it. I will say that the tutorial is a major step backwards from the original though. There's no immersion, and the whole thing feels RPG-goofy-gimmicky instead of like a horror game. I loved the original and thought they integrated its tutorials into the game marvelously, so this didn't build up any high hopes. I don't like to judge a book by its cover, but since that's the only thing that actually works I guess I just leave it at that for now. I'll probably try re-reviewing it again later, when upgrade to a new rig someday.			"

												Not as bad as people have been saying. I was one of those people who moaned at the Devs for how linear and restrictive the first Lucius was...also how god awful the final fight originally was. The Devs listened and they have tried to make a game that reminds me of Hitman Blood Money..but you're the son the Devil in pretty much a satanic sandbox!Yes it's buggy but not unplayable, you can play through the whole game and not have any issues or you can have a tonne. I had one issue regarding the save cache giving me a black screen, but I deleted my custom saves and restarted the level and there wasn't an issue. Checkpoints are frequent after each objective, so it's not that frustrating.I would say the engine needs a tweak as it can be quite demanding on a low end computer, I think purely due to optimisation issues. Saying all that, whether or not its a self aware game or written with the creativity of a shoebox, It is hilarious to play through and can be very entertaining.I picked it up for 15 quid and I would say the pricing is about right. Give it a shot. "

												In comparison to the first game, Lucius II definitely has a lot of improvements! The controls are better, the story is more intensive, and the best part of this game is that there are literally hundreds of ways you can kill the people around you.Just like the first game, you take control of the young Lucius, who is out to get his father's favor. This game is basically just a giant killing spree, and you are literally only limited by your imagination. If you think I'm joking, just wait until you discover the ""Butt Hurt"" achievement!!I really would recommend this game, as it has a lot of replayability and is just really a lot of fun!			"

If there were more levels and perhaps bigger environments it would get a 7/10.Pros:Optional skills to invest inPlay how you want to playKill who you want (Big leap from first game)A couple of reoccuring characters from the previous game to maintain story flowVery obvious references to other horror movies/ games.

												Lucius 2, sequel to Lucius. In this game, you control Lucius, the son of the Devil. Your objective is to go around and kill people, for the glory of Satan of course. You're meant to use your environment as a tool to kill nurses, patients and other people. When you kill someone, you need to hide the bodies. Otherwise people will find them and grow suspicious and panicky. Now, as a game, the concept is very creative and fun. Who does not want to go around and use the supernatural to kill your foes? However the game seems to fall a bit on the matter of actual functionality. The game is riddled with bugs and glitches. For example, people in the game can sometimes glitch into the walls if you drag their bodies, the game can crash when you finish a level, and different sounds can go off without any particular reason. I had the music sound, which plays when you kill someone, play on a loop randomly, even if I was just standing still. Occasionally the narration would replay without a reason. Now, would I recommend the game? Yes. Even with the bugs, the game is actually rather fun and enjoyable. The puzzles are rather creative and when you figure them out, you actually feel pretty good about yourself. However, if you really cannot stand bugs and glitches in games, you may want to wait until the devs release a bugfixing patch. Lucius 2 really could use one.			"

												Let me just say I recommend this game only at a reduced price, if that ever happens. That may change based on whether or not the developers actually fix the infinite amount of bugs the game has.It's basically a buggy, magical Hitman: Blood Money. You're put into a sandbox area and given tasks, but are allowed to do as you please for the most part. Some people you HAVE to kill, but others are just a bonus. This game is buggy beyond reason. If you combine your items together, save, and then reload, those items will be glitched and unusable most of the time. If you kill someone, save, then reload, there's a chance that they will spawn in alive and then magically die after a few seconds. I had a glitch where a guy who was suppose to be in a coma walked around for a few seconds before resuming his normal function. The AI sometimes gets stuck on silly objects, or will survive an acid attack despite being half-way corroded. Sometimes you'll get in trouble for being in an un-restricted area. AIs sometimes forget their patterns and refuse to behave normally. I've had issues where music would loop over other music, even during cutscenes, forcing you to quit the game.There are probably a lot more glitches and bugs that I haven't mentioned. I'm guessing the huge ammount of bugs was due to the devs wanting to release it on Friday the 13th, and thus had to rush.Despite these awful and frustrating issues, the game is still pretty fun. If you've played Hitman: Blood Money enough times that you could probably kill someone in real life, you'll like this game. I've played around 10 hours and am close to beating the game. I will say that atleast 3 or 4 of those hours was backtracking because a series of bugs ruined a mission, but still.Hopefully the devlopers will patch out a good majority of the bugs. If and when that happens, I fully reccomend this game at $20 for the amount of content you're getting, but as of now, I wouldn't pay more than $10-15.			"

												Have you ever wanted to play the son of the devil? Do you have this desire to find creative ways to kill all that stand in your way from achieving your goals of showing the devil how much you love him? Well if you said yes this is the game for you.Lucius II: The Prophecy, developed by Shiver Games, takes a page right out of the movie The Omen, and puts you in the shoes of Lucius an unassuming boy who has a very dark past and intent. You will find yourself navigating through a hospital, as well as a local town. Somehow you have lost your devilish powers, and you are going to be hell bent on getting them back. There's only one issue, you are going to have to first escape the hospital. Once you do that there's a little twist and perhaps some competition waiting for you.Graphically this game looks great, it uses the Unity engine, and you can definitely tell that it uses it well. I was a bit concerned about the random male nudity that was sprinkled through the game, especially a specific locked bathroom door scene, but other than that the game looked great.I just wish I could say the same about the game mechanics. There's definitely the option to customize your evil powers so that you can play to your strengths, but there are definitely some skills that once I got them I never used them, or I could never figure out how to use them. Basically the first fire skill till the end of the game I couldn't figure out how to use. There's also the fact that when you pick up items you automatically levitate them in your hand, my problem is I really wish that items/weapons that you use that could use an actual touch were held. It just looked strange to use the nail gun, or the water container as it is suspended in air.Speaking of suspending in air the whole throw mechanic was just strange, would it have been too much to ask to just have a straight shot with gravity taking effect after some distance instead of the constant rainbow throw that the game gave you. It was just a little awkward to aim for something straight in front of you or right above you, if you were standing close.The music in the game definitely gave you that anti-christ game feeling. I'm not saying screaming demons, or anything, but it definitely fit with The Omen type of feel. I did find it interesting that the voice overs in game tended to fade in and out which made me thankful there was subtitles so that I could actually pick up on what was being said.This game definitely showed that there are many many ways to kill, and I have to say that the MOST difficult part of the entire game was the beginning, I spend hours trying to figure out how to kill people in the hospital because I accidentally screwed up a chance to kill someone. Hell I ended up possessing people's minds and had them continuously walk into the open elevator shaft because I couldn't get anything else to work. I do wish I was able to play the first one so that I could get the whole story, but then again this is probably a game with three parts as this game will give you a cliffhanger at the end. I can say that you can jump right into the game from this chapter, thanks to the openning credits. In the end this game is frustrating, feels clunky, and there are certain things that aren't 100% clear on what you are supposed to do that will leave you scratching your head and maybe ultimately reaching out to the gaming community to figure out a solution. So with that being said this game gets a 7.1 out of 10.			"

												Okay. There's a few things I really want to say about this game (and developers) that (depending on the person) may be good or bad.When I first purchased the game, this game was practically unplayable. It crashed 49/50 times and there seemed to be no fix in sight. Nothing I tried worked and I found myself becoming increasingly impatient and ever-so-close to wanting to demand for some sort of compensation. However, that mindset quickly changed with the patience and amazing communication of the devs that helped me finally fix this issue. So I'm definitely giving Devs 5/5Game play, it's pretty simple; simple physics with the way objects are thrown and the force of the throw can determine whether something potentially lethal (chemicals) will break and kill your unsuspecting victim or just chill on the floor (or whatever place it lands on). The story is simple. Maybe a bit too simple since the main objective of this game seems to be killing everyone in as many ways as you can think of possible. I'm giving that a 3/5 for game play since it /does/ get a bit repetitive after awhile. Also, my first time playing through this game, even though I use the lifeline, somehow, I still end up getting a game over instead of memorywiping the person that busts Lucius.The objectives are pretty repetitive; collect keys, unlock doors and break things to complete your objective (and kill specific people). The story of the game can pretty much be summarized in a few words: Escape the hospital, kill your competition for Father/Satan's affection and the right to kinda be like Satan's favorite son that gets to sit by him while the world burns. Story: 2/5So I guess I give this game a 3/51. This game was pretty freaken broken when it first came out. BUT the devs are all working very hard to fix the issues one by one.2. The Devs are all super nice people. They kept me updated with possible fixes until the issue of game crashing was fixed.3. I love the fact that I get to be the antichrist and murder people. (Basically, I love the Omen and the concept of the two Lucius games) I know the first game was definitely parallel to the Omen in story but Lucius II had an original storyline in continuation of the first game.And regardless of the flaws of this game, I'm looking forward to a Lucius III.

												Spoilers ahoy.Okay, this is something that's bothered me with a lot of the down votes. They marketed it as a sandbox, there was never any doubt of what it was going to be. That's how it was always marketted, I didn't even really expect there to be a story to it, from what people were saying before it was released.Aside from that, there is actually a decent story, if you're paying attention. Having played this game more times than what would probably be considered healthy since it's release, I've had time to really pay attention to the story. Instead of the long cut scenes from the first movie, you have people talking about incidents that happened. You have newspaper clippings. You have things that are actually subtle, that you have to pick up on. It's not an overly cinematic game.Now, the game itself is buggy, more so than Lucius was, yes, but there's no game breaking bugs, really. Something might come up every now and again where you'll have to go back to the beginning of a level and play it over again, but other than that, I, personally, have not encountered any game breakers. I've never crashed playing this game or anything like that.And yes, the way the AI acts when you kill something is goofy. It's amusing to me. I enjoy it. But that's me.In short, yes, it's a buggy indie game. I didn't go into the game thinking there wasn't going to be bugs, because honestly, the first Lucius also had bugs, and there were some actual game breaking bugs in the first one.And there are a lot of references in the game that had me amused. Ludlow, for one. The younglings for another. Just small things they slipped into the game.			"

												Let me just say I recommend this game only at a reduced price, if that ever happens. That may change based on whether or not the developers actually fix the infinite amount of bugs the game has.It's basically a buggy, magical Hitman: Blood Money. You're put into a sandbox area and given tasks, but are allowed to do as you please for the most part. Some people you HAVE to kill, but others are just a bonus. This game is buggy beyond reason. If you combine your items together, save, and then reload, those items will be glitched and unusable most of the time. If you kill someone, save, then reload, there's a chance that they will spawn in alive and then magically die after a few seconds. I had a glitch where a guy who was suppose to be in a coma walked around for a few seconds before resuming his normal function. The AI sometimes gets stuck on silly objects, or will survive an acid attack despite being half-way corroded. Sometimes you'll get in trouble for being in an un-restricted area. AIs sometimes forget their patterns and refuse to behave normally. I've had issues where music would loop over other music, even during cutscenes, forcing you to quit the game.There are probably a lot more glitches and bugs that I haven't mentioned. I'm guessing the huge ammount of bugs was due to the devs wanting to release it on Friday the 13th, and thus had to rush.Despite these awful and frustrating issues, the game is still pretty fun. If you've played Hitman: Blood Money enough times that you could probably kill someone in real life, you'll like this game. I've played around 10 hours and am close to beating the game. I will say that atleast 3 or 4 of those hours was backtracking because a series of bugs ruined a mission, but still.Hopefully the devlopers will patch out a good majority of the bugs. If and when that happens, I fully reccomend this game at $20 for the amount of content you're getting, but as of now, I wouldn't pay more than $10-15.			"

Lucius 2 turned out to be exactly what I had hoped the first would be like... mindlessly slaughtering people in any way you could. It has an interesting story as well as many easter eggs that I couldn't help but love. It was a great continuation of the first game and I expect great things from the next installment.			"

												The games good....ish.I mean, I recommend this game. The transition from the first game holds up well and the fact you are given more freedom to carry out your plans to follow the steps to become the next anti-christ.However, the game is short. I mean, really short. It took me around 5 hours to complete which equals to around 2-3 sessions. If there were more levels and perhaps bigger environments it would get a 7/10.Pros:Optional skills to invest inPlay how you want to playKill who you want (Big leap from first game)A couple of reoccuring characters from the previous game to maintain story flowVery obvious references to other horror movies/ games.

												Lucius 2, sequel to Lucius. In this game, you control Lucius, the son of the Devil. Your objective is to go around and kill people, for the glory of Satan of course. You're meant to use your environment as a tool to kill nurses, patients and other people. When you kill someone, you need to hide the bodies. Otherwise people will find them and grow suspicious and panicky. Now, as a game, the concept is very creative and fun. Who does not want to go around and use the supernatural to kill your foes? However the game seems to fall a bit on the matter of actual functionality. The game is riddled with bugs and glitches. For example, people in the game can sometimes glitch into the walls if you drag their bodies, the game can crash when you finish a level, and different sounds can go off without any particular reason. I had the music sound, which plays when you kill someone, play on a loop randomly, even if I was just standing still. Occasionally the narration would replay without a reason. Now, would I recommend the game? Yes. Even with the bugs, the game is actually rather fun and enjoyable. The puzzles are rather creative and when you figure them out, you actually feel pretty good about yourself. However, if you really cannot stand bugs and glitches in games, you may want to wait until the devs release a bugfixing patch. Lucius 2 really could use one.			"

												Have you ever wanted to play the son of the devil? Do you have this desire to find creative ways to kill all that stand in your way from achieving your goals of showing the devil how much you love him? Well if you said yes this is the game for you.Lucius II: The Prophecy, developed by Shiver Games, takes a page right out of the movie The Omen, and puts you in the shoes of Lucius an unassuming boy who has a very dark past and intent. You will find yourself navigating through a hospital, as well as a local town. Somehow you have lost your devilish powers, and you are going to be hell bent on getting them back. There's only one issue, you are going to have to first escape the hospital. Once you do that there's a little twist and perhaps some competition waiting for you.Graphically this game looks great, it uses the Unity engine, and you can definitely tell that it uses it well. I was a bit concerned about the random male nudity that was sprinkled through the game, especially a specific locked bathroom door scene, but other than that the game looked great.I just wish I could say the same about the game mechanics. There's definitely the option to customize your evil powers so that you can play to your strengths, but there are definitely some skills that once I got them I never used them, or I could never figure out how to use them. Basically the first fire skill till the end of the game I couldn't figure out how to use. There's also the fact that when you pick up items you automatically levitate them in your hand, my problem is I really wish that items/weapons that you use that could use an actual touch were held. It just looked strange to use the nail gun, or the water container as it is suspended in air.Speaking of suspending in air the whole throw mechanic was just strange, would it have been too much to ask to just have a straight shot with gravity taking effect after some distance instead of the constant rainbow throw that the game gave you. It was just a little awkward to aim for something straight in front of you or right above you, if you were standing close.The music in the game definitely gave you that anti-christ game feeling. I'm not saying screaming demons, or anything, but it definitely fit with The Omen type of feel. I did find it interesting that the voice overs in game tended to fade in and out which made me thankful there was subtitles so that I could actually pick up on what was being said.This game definitely showed that there are many many ways to kill, and I have to say that the MOST difficult part of the entire game was the beginning, I spend hours trying to figure out how to kill people in the hospital because I accidentally screwed up a chance to kill someone. Hell I ended up possessing people's minds and had them continuously walk into the open elevator shaft because I couldn't get anything else to work. I do wish I was able to play the first one so that I could get the whole story, but then again this is probably a game with three parts as this game will give you a cliffhanger at the end. I can say that you can jump right into the game from this chapter, thanks to the openning credits. In the end this game is frustrating, feels clunky, and there are certain things that aren't 100% clear on what you are supposed to do that will leave you scratching your head and maybe ultimately reaching out to the gaming community to figure out a solution. So with that being said this game gets a 7.1 out of 10.			"

												Okay. There's a few things I really want to say about this game (and developers) that (depending on the person) may be good or bad.When I first purchased the game, this game was practically unplayable. It crashed 49/50 times and there seemed to be no fix in sight.

												This game was amazing! Don't listen to all of the negative reviews by idiots who gave the game a down-vote because their computer's graphics card and/or processer power is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ via; ""The framerate was bad"" and ""I wish I could run it"" is no reason to give the game a bad review. Get a better computer, play the game, THEN rate it or just deal with what you have like I did. I played the game on medium quality (low quality during the last level to run more smoothly because the fire/electricity/rain graphics going on were 2good4me) and it was still outstanding. My computer isn't a gaming computer so the framerate wasn't the greatest but it's not the game's fault. It was a stunning game beyond belief nonetheless.Aside from my opinion on people down-voting the game because their computer was subpar/didn't meet the requirements.... now for the ACTUAL REVIEW.Just like the last game, the game had its bugs. It was definitely an improvement though! The first game had lots of bugs but was still a good game and this one had MUCH less and was even better!The gore was SO MUCH BETTER in this game. The organs and arteries spilled in the beginning was an ASTOUNDING touch and I absolutely loved the start of the game where you walk around the ward in a straight jacket covered in blood. It made the whole setting all the more exciting and interesting! It was a sad day when you had to go find and put your suit back on. :( Back in black, baby!The story was even more interesting than the first game's. Instead of following a storyline of murdering people in the house in specific ways and in certain orders, you were able to freely roam because it's a sandbox game, and you do whatever as you please, when you please, how you please. Although some tasks of murdering people in certain ways were tedious, near the end of the game I would just mind control people (who were either in the way of what I needed to do or had something on them that I needed) and simply make them walk into a fire I started or was already there lol. I know, how uncreative of me. What I'm getting at here is that some ways of murdering were tougher than others, but I'd rather spend an extra 3-5 minutes figuring out how to kill someone in a creative way rather than just poisoning their coffee or donuts or something. Now THAT's boring. (Plus there isn't enough medication to go around in each level lol.)I'm not going to spoil anything, which is why this is going to be a short paragraph; this game's ending was so much more satisfying than the first one's. Just sayin'.Over all, both games were FANTASTIC. I like this one more than the first, but that doesn't mean the first one was bad. Basically, if you like a somewhat easy game - following a specific storyline with specific methods (which was fun playing out, don't get me wrong!) you will probably find the first game more appealing.  If you enjoy challenges and levels that you'll have to actually try on once or twice to achieve so the game isn't just a breeze, I'd definitely say Lucius 2 is your best choice. Both games were absolutely two games that I will favor for a very long time. Can't wait for Lucius 3! <3Btw thanks to my buddy Josh for gifting me this sick♥♥♥♥♥game. :^)			"

												Not as bad as people have been saying. I was one of those people who moaned at the Devs for how linear and restrictive the first Lucius was...also how god awful the final fight originally was. The Devs listened and they have tried to make a game that reminds me of Hitman Blood Money..but you're the son the Devil in pretty much a satanic sandbox!Yes it's buggy but not unplayable, you can play through the whole game and not have any issues or you can have a tonne. I had one issue regarding the save cache giving me a black screen, but I deleted my custom saves and restarted the level and there wasn't an issue. Checkpoints are frequent after each objective, so it's not that frustrating.I would say the engine needs a tweak as it can be quite demanding on a low end computer, I think purely due to optimisation issues. Saying all that, whether or not its a self aware game or written with the creativity of a shoebox, It is hilarious to play through and can be very entertaining.I picked it up for 15 quid and I would say the pricing is about right. Give it a shot. "

												Check your expectations at the door and know what you are buying.  It's a low budget indie horror game.  You know it's going to be goofy, jenky and buggy.   It's one thing to get all obnoxious with gamer activism for unfinished AAA titles, but man, chill out on the small teams making goofy games.   The quality was EXACTLY what I would expect from a game of this caliber.Things to note for the angry gamer:You will find plenty of bugs, but not many that really break the game.  I only had one instance where a person who had the keys I needed, got knocked down and never got back up or died.Animations, Models, Ragdoll Physics... Just general graphics are meh.You can get away with damn near anything.  People really just kind of look right past you or you can just run away real fast.The last boss was absolutely impossible to figure out.I had no idea the credits were rolling and I had beat the game.My play through saw 2 whole video game wieners. That said, this game is what you make of it.  I just don't get why people will buy a low budget horror game and yell about development. If you are a fan of B-Horror movies, this is a pretty fun game to play but you might want to pop it on your wish list and snag it during a big sale.  Here is one of the 2 wieners I encountered in my playthrough:

												I really wanted to like Lucius II -- I love the idea of setting devious traps for the unwary, and the unique story certainly has a lot of potential. However, there are so many game-breaking bugs, poorly designed interfaces, performance issues, and control scheme nightmares that I cannot recommend this game to anyone.For example, there is a sequence where Lucius must use a shotgun. Simple, right? No. The process goes like this:1. Collect the shotgun and shells by aiming the reticule at them, pressing E, and then pressing G (yes, really).2. Go to the inventory screen and drag the shells onto the shotgun. The game does not pause while you're in this window, despite the fact that you can't see any of the action, so it's very likely you'll get mercilessly ravaged while you attempt to do this.3. Double-click the shotgun to equip it. Urghh, it didn't work. Double-click again. Double-cli- Oh, there it goes.4. Fire twice before having to repeat the clumsy process all over again.Additionally, it's possible to get into states where a level becomes uncompletable -- for example, on many of the hospital floors, there are keys you need to pick up in order to progress. These keys can disappear or become lodged somewhere out of sight, and the level has to be restarted.There's a fair amount of slowdown in this game, which is odd considering the fact that the graphics aren't anything to write home about. The final battle is particularly bad about this -- particle effects grind the game to a halt. Expect freezes, too.There's a great number of smaller issues that the developers surely must have noticed -- for example, the inventory screen often claims containers are 100% full when they're actually empty, volume levels fluctuate at random from scene to scene, and when Lucius drops objects, they hover in midair instead of falling to the ground.Add to that the fact that no one proofread any of the text, and you can clearly see that this is another half-baked Unity game released on Steam far too early. I hope that Lucius II becomes playable someday, but for now, it's impossible to justify spending $20 for the dubious pleasure of playing this frustrating game. Overall, it's a great concept, but it feels like it's still in alpha.			"

												I'm reviewing this from a point of view where i'm a fan of Lucius and the edgy style of gameplay it offers. Lucius 2 does improve on that, removing the linear storyline and forced situations into a much more free roam and player decision based game. If you enjoyed Lucius i feel you will enjoy Lucius 2 for all the same reasons! HOWEVER!!!!As others have mentioned this game is pretty buggy! Too buggy to have been released i feel. I hope and pray and feel it will be patched and sorted. I've not come across any bugs that make the game unplayable yet but there are moments of frustration and times where i felt i was missing out on being able to do stuff because the game bugged out.Buy this game if you loved the graphic, in your face, bloodiness of Lucius. You will not be disappointed. Watch out for many many awesome film references!			"

												First let me start by saying I actually liked Lucius 1. Yes, it was limited, but the kills were all unique, and you actually *GASP* had to do some detective work (read: stalking) to find the nessecary tools to kill your next victim. Lucius 2 tries to be much more sandboxy and only partially makes it. The AI is pretty brain-dead, the levels a wee bit cramped and out of place. You can sneak by pressing control, but you wont need it once, as even if you do get caught you have at least 2 mind erases available. Combine all that with health from toilets, random gay sex in the bathrooms, and a saints row 'esque purple♥♥♥♥♥♥♥killer and you can easily form the opinion these guys arent taking the game seriously, and neither should you. But, that ruins immersion in a game like this. IF I want LOL RANDUMB things in games, then I'll go play a game that is tongue and cheek. There is a nice variety of ""special"" kills but there could have been so many more. After a few levels another new way pops up, and then its back to Poison sandwich, defib, elevator, fireaxe blah blah etc.  Finally the uprade system is pretty bad. You have 3 skill trees to choose from; mind control, telekenesis, and pyro. Each individual ""talent"" takes 3 points to.. well I'm not sure but I think it makes them last.. longer? The game isnt nearly long enough to get every single talent unlocked, but that doesn't matter, as more than half of them are pretty useless. I'm a BIG fan of fire in games, and when even I don't care enough to even put a single point in the entire pyro skill tree... that says a lot.While I never had a problem with setting up traps and killing innocents, I see many others do. I would say this is a case of people not being patient enough or too slow (mentally) to not play a game where M1 = Kill. Yes there are a ton of bugs but none gamebreaking. I had ZERO save game problems, either loading or with corruption. I think many on here that do are full of it, and just want to join the bandwagon because they can't possibly form their own opinions on things, or being a troll in reviews is cool to.. them? Oh there are alwasy the people trying to run even a game like this on ancient hardware then trey to blame the developers because their 15 year old rigs crash every 10 seconds!It's not the greatest game ever, but it's fun and is priced well for the content and length. Just like it's predecessor. I look forward eagerly to Lucius 3: The Sandwich Fandango "

												I had high hopes for this even with the issues the first one had I loved playing it but this just seems like yet another case of the developer rushing the product for profit. I get that a developer has dead-lines but when that effects the quality of the release it tarnishes the game and experience the player gets. Too often developers rush a product and just expect players to put up with patching. I would rather the developer have decent testers and that they take the time behind closed doors to make a finished product that isn't full of bugs.			"

												I just... no. Not something I found enjoyment in playing.I purchased this game soley because  Cr1TiKaL voiced one of the characters  in the game. But after playing with the intent of personally interacting with the character, I just gave up; the game was just that unenjoyable.At first, I thought the game concept was kind of interesting and creative. As I was playing the game it, at first, seemed to have a nice atmosphere and setting. But everything went downhill after the cutscene with the demon and the investigator. All seriousness was sucked out of my experience when that demon's mouth moved in such a cartoonic fashion. And things did not get better once the actual gameplay started.The tutorial was a bit lazy. Takes you to hell so you can learn how to play. Why couldn't it take place in the actual world? And learn as you complete the first mission? That's something that's pretty much standard these days. Anyway, after getting out of hell and starting the real game, things become pretty tedious feeling. It's already been mentioned in other reviews but there doesn't seem much of a point to some of the creative ways to kill people except for fun. So why do that when you can just poison all the doughnuts?The one positive thing I found in the game was a reference to Kitty Forman from That 70's Show.As for the story, I feel it's a bit poorly written. It feels like the story was an after thought or the story came after the they already had the idea for where they want Lucius to go, like it was just tagged on.Lastly, I could not get past the terribly handled ""easter egg""/tribute to PewDiePie. I'm not a fan of the guy, and I don't have a problem with him, but the way the whole beachball thing was handled is just painful, like being beaten over the head with a sack of frozen oranges. Expect with oranges you aren't out $20 and you can still uses them for something. I'm sure maybe it made some PewDiePie fans giggle a little, but for the rest of us it made an already disappointing experience even worse. The only thing I can imagine that would have made it any worse would be if the ball talked and was voiced by PewDiePie himself. Or by Fred.In conclusion, this game was just a let down and I advise those who are curious about this game take a moment and reconsider purchasing this game.			"

However as a parody it fails because even black humour requires a funny part and two naked men having sex in the bathroom is not something funny, it's just an outright vulgar attempt to attract at least some attention to the pretty mediocre game, which is, besides torturing you with poor writing and boring gameplay, also as buggy as hell.

												This game has a great premise and lots to do, but the interface and controls in which you have to fight with to get things done isn't worth the effort.  Jerky camera (no matter how low you set mouse speed).  ""Helpful"" text everywhere like you're some robot analyzing everything that useful and how you can use it.  Interacting with dragable objects and teh rag doll physics of dead bodies is AWFUL.  Ther eis no fine manipulation, you have no precise control.I killed a guy cuz I needed his keys.  Fried him when he went to use a sink.  The keys fell out of reach behing the door.  The body was blocking the door so I couldn't close it to get the keys.  Tried dragging the body out of the way but it was stuck under the door.  Hence no way at all I could get the keys because of this stupid ""physics"" system...more like a physics anomaly.This game could be fun, different ways to kill people unlike the first game, more people to kill, open sandbox type areas, interesting powers.  But poor controls, poor interface, and horrible ""physics"" make this more of a chore than a game. Also, no manual saves.  Does have controller support though.Skip at all cost unless you just HAVE to fimish the series or can be very patient with wonky controls.			"

												I'll keep this simple: This is a game that was made specifically for Pewdiepie. Not being Pewdiepie, I can't say I enjoyed it enough to recommend it.It's way overpriced at 20 bucks considering how many quirks it has. If they had spent more time ironing out its kinks, it could have been a bit more playable. Enemies clip through doors, see you through walls, and just general shenanigans. Not that the game is even hard -- it's not; for the most part it's ridiculously easy.			"

Product received for free
												Lucius 2 inherited zero charm of the original game. Most of the ""unique traps"" are utterly stupid and not even in a fun, Home Alone kind of way. I mean it's clear that the developers turned away from the first game's dark roots and decided to focus more on the slapstick humor which could have used a ot more Macaulay Culkining/ Tom & Jerrying.And let's not talk about the clear tabloid bait side of the game. Sure if you buy Lucius 2 where you literally play as the bloody Antichrist you're going to expect some controversy, but by god child-murder is a whole new level of low. What were you thinking?And if this wasn't enough for you here is a short list of things of what went wrong: countless glitches poor optimisation awfully weak story filled with plotholes terrible graphics straight out of the PS2 era even worse controlls the focus on silly easter eggs (instead of creating a decent plot)I wanted to list the lack of controller support too, however it seems that this has been fixed since I've played this the last time. But cloud support is still not a thing 2015...(Disclaimer: I've received a copy of the game for free for reviewing the game back when it launched last year.)			"

												I buyed this game for 1.50 Euros. So i don't have anything to feel sorry about. I played the first game of the series and found it pretty cool. But this game is not worth the steam price. So you shoud buy it from another source if you have some extra cash witch you want to spend this is the game to spend on. I really like it but not worth 19 euros. The steam price shoud be around 10.			"

There is constant clipping of AI into walls, floors and the like.

YouTube™ Video: Storytime with swix - LUCIUS II The Wienerworld 

			Views: 26		

			With this video, I provide you with the 5% of the game that are bearable. Check out my other videos - https://goo.gl/aV3qWP The devs sure love♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ there are so many of them that it makes me sick,...		

In Lucius II:- I used stealth at my own risk because it is useless.- I used toilets to heal myself.WTF???- I saw a guy♥♥♥♥♥♥in a plant.- I saw a gay couple in action.- I saw an npc sit on an invinsible chair.- I broke a fire hydrant with a 10$ bill and killed an npc.- I made an npc slide into a wooden pike.- I broke a ventilator with a wallet and it chopped the npcs head off.- Spilled oil on the floor where the npcs were standing and dropped my lighter.To my suprise i had fun even if the game is terrible. PS: I changed my rating to not recommend because of the games' current price tag. In its current state the game is not worth 20$. I would only reccomend buying the game if the price was slashed in half even in its current state because it was fun. The creative ways of killing npcs grows on you even in the absence of a good atmosphere and decent sotryline. Waiting to see if they fix brainless AI, overlapping music, doors not closing properly and some graphical bugs. Things I really liked about the game were the theme music, the explosions and limb injuries are pretty nice with the slow-mo action . Also I found the game quite funny with some guys sitting on invisible chairs, guy standing after he was electrocuted, some scenes and the npc animation when they slip. Kudos for that!			"

												After being in the Psych Ward for six months, the doctors decide shock treatment is the best for young Lucius and that’s where things go wrong. Sadly, you don’t get to see what happens next but judging by the blood on the walls and the dead body sitting next to you with the deliberator in his chest one can only imagine…Unlike the first game where each person has a specific way they need to be sent to Hell, the sequel gives you the chance to explore the possibilities with a wide variety of deaths ranging from poisons, explosions, mind control murders, and flying oxygen tanks that are almost impossible to aim. My favorite kills so far have to be combining water on the floor with the deliberator, and using the nail gain which is pretty much a one-shot kill for each nail you have at your disposal. The hardest kill method is the oxygen tanks I’ve mentioned, because there’s no easy way to aim the sucks on the cart they use and the item keeps moving after you’ve stopped moving the cart. I could kill with a Dixie cup and some string easier than the tanks.So far I’ve found an exploit; each of the deliberators can only be used once but saving and loading back to such saved file will reload the deliberator for use again, as well as tone down some of the way people look at you when it comes to suspicion – by the way you might be missing an item or two or need to do an objective again but that’s a small price to pay if it means you can essentially use a kill method near-indefinitely.There’s a lot of things I like about this game but many of them are also things I liked about the first as well – such as the exploration, the music, and the immersion. Playing as the son of Satan is great and since he has no lines of any kind he doesn’t bore anyone with quotes cheesy one-liners. There’s a quote from Highlander in this one – imagine how much I laughed.But there’s still some things that I didn’t like that returned as well. The music does seem to lag out from time to time and the voice narration is super quiet. Although the objectives are really clear, the kill methods seem to have some preferred victims, making it hard to kill that person with the keys if you’ve already used up your poisoned doughnuts.The only two characters returning from the first game are the detective – the narrator but replaced with a different voice actor from the first – and Lucius’ human father but his role in the sequel can be summed up and being a vegetable on a hospital bed next to a life support machine than can be shut off at any time. That’s about it.In short, I like Lucius 2 and will stand by the game in all its glory and faults just like I did its predecessor. I’m a little ways into chapter two and it doesn’t seem to have a very long game by the looks of it. According to Steam, there’s only about four more missions before the game is complete, but replay value is pretty high – there’s boggle heads to collect, kills to try out, skills to obtain, and cars to get hit by, so I can see myself playing this one for a while.Now if you’ll excuse me I just reduced the population of Ludlow to zero and must explore to see if I missed something. To those playing this game, happy hunting!(Fun fact: The town of Ludlow seems to have gotten in adult gizmos that are available at the General Store.)			"

												It was hard for me to decide weather or not to recommend this game. I ADORED the first Lucius, so I was so excited for this, but it seems so rushed. Sure, the main aspect of this game is killing people in imaginitive ways - and yes, I have to say that sometimes that is fun. Only sometimes. As you progress you end up just doing the simplest thing. Poisoning, throwing acid...it all gets a little tedious. Not to mention the freakin GLITCHINESS of this game! My ""E""  button ""Lifeline"" KILLS ME if I use it (not much of a second chance, more of a suicide). Lucius ragdolls whenever caught, and in all honest it's laughable. The atmosphere is ruined when you suddenly get picked up by your arm and you ragdoll around and glitch through the wall and floor. Sometimes the deaths don't even register - on  more than one occasion I poisoned some coffee, the person drank it then simply continued to wander around as normal. The music cuts out sometimes, and the throwing system and aim is far to quick to even react to, meaning you stand there wiggling your mouse to get it to aim in the right way. Also, Lucius seems to hate holding things, meaning if you pick up even  an innocent item such as a sandwich you get caught and boom, game over (yes, I should be able to use my Lifeline, but oh, that kills me!). Yes, I liked the sneaking and the killing and even the art style, modeling and the music, but the rest is so buggy that it takes away the greatness from this game. So disappointed :(			"

												I'm not sure exactly why everyone is hating on this game. Personally I enjoyed every minute of it and will continue playing long after I have finished. There are only a few games in my entire Steam library that I have actually sat down and played from beginning to end; and fewer still that I actually go back to. With most games I usually get bored after awhile and start playing something else, but Lucius II kept me thorougly entertained during my entire playthrough. Yes it is a short game, but each level is a sandbox that provides unlimited diversion. Yes, there are bugs, but I have not encountered any that were gamebreaking. I only crashed once in the many hours I've played, and the other bugs I encountered were mostly minor, such as a missing icon or broken camera angle when climbing up to a rooftop.I have only a few gripes, and nothing too serious to keep anyone from enjoying this game. The first is a lack of kill animations. Whenever you sucessfully kill an NPC they will usually turn into a ragdoll and fall on the floor. The kills are still interesting and unique and should delight most players, but the lack of detailed death animations kinda makes that elaborate setup you worked so hard on seem disappointing. Another problem is the AI in general. It still needs a lot of work. Sometimes an NPC will get stuck in a position or have trouble reacting to the bait you left on the floor, or sometimes they will just sit in mid air. They also do not react when an explosion just rocked the next room. This brings me to my final complaint which is the overall unpolished feel to the game. As players have suggested, it feels rushed. You'll notice a decline in quality as soon as you watch the cutscenes, which are nothing more than paper dolls with a character narrating. I don't know if they were going for an aesthetic appeal with this or just cutting costs. When compared to the cinematic cutscenes of the first game it really feels like they opted for the less expensive route.Personally I'm not bothered by the cheap changes or the small bugs and beta AI, but now I cannot decide which game I prefer. I love the first game, and that one actually feels like a finished product, but the lack of variety really turns me off. After you finish that game there's really no reason to go back to it unless you are achievement hunting. Lucius II, however, lets you plan your murders, set up traps, and kill in any order. On the other hand, in Lucius I the kill scenes were so gruesomely gratifying. It's really hard to decide which game is better, but I think that once the devs finally iron out all the problems in Lucius II I'm sure most fans will be happy with it. There's an amazing sequel to Lucius here, you just have to dig through all the mess to find it.(Oh yeah, and the final boss is a direct replica of Malachai from Children of the Corn. Too awesome!) "

												Let me begin by saying that the performance is terrible, changing settings from low to the highest does absolutely nothing to the framerate, I was stuck at a nice cinematic 26fps for most of the game. Now the game, unlike Lucius 1, is more of a open world game, you can choose from a selection of ways to kill someone but after a while they all get dull, no matter what you do, it feels like the same thing over and over again, especially after 5 floors of a hospital.I did play through it, but I can't recommend it, because those were the longest 5 hours of my life, I expected bad, but this was just a complete mess with a bunch of wieners on top.Here's a video I made that might save you some time:

												----------------------------------------------------------------------- Review Lucius 2  Lucius 2 is a fantastic game which shows the same engrossing structures like in the previous game (Lucius). It has a interesting story-line, super interaction points and a reassuring calmness. It also reminds me a little bit of Alan Wake which was one of the best games I have ever played.  Story:	 10/10 (like in Lucius 1 the story-line is fascinating and makes the game addictive)  Graphics:	 7/10 (very old graphics but they are nevertheless a good fit for this game) ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 8,5/10 (I recommend this game , especially for people who love calm horror-adventure games)	 More Information about the game (click here) [en.wikipedia.org]-----------------------------------------------------------------------			"

												This is truly one of the most marvelous games I have ever played. The storyline is riveting from the beginning all the way to the final conflict.  You feel mesmerised by Lucius as he conducts his reign of death, There were so many ingenius tools and means by which Lucius conducted his business.You absolutely never got bored for even a second. The game is two chapters and they are both lengthy.You move from Hospitals to Research Facilities to exploring the dark town of Ludlow with many other distinct and original areas in between. The graphics were superb. It is extremely rare in this day and age to find a game that pushes the limits as this one does. At times outlandish and sometimes hilarious this game goes to the brink of well mannered society and bumps it up a notch. I like that. I like it a lot. People need to be challenged at times and this game certainly does that. Just the sheer number of different buildings and areas to explore was extraordinary! The creativity created for the death scenes was obviously well thought out. There were literally hundreds of different items that could be utilised to achieve the task at hand. I'm not sure anyone could really say enough about the storyline. It was absolutely a masterpiece from beginning to end. It blended together magnificently. I felt the character. I felt his mission. I understood the root core of his being. In conclusion,I would like to say to the developers; I certainly hope there will be a Lucius III. Also,leave Lucius as the young boy he was in your next addition. This one unique aspect seems to trademark this young fellow. We don't want to see him grow up. Also,consider giving him a voice to speak. I believe this would add tremendously to the next addition.			"

												I don't buy many games at regular price but once I found out that Lucius II was out I had to get it. The 1st one was amazing just for the concept of murder they offered. But the second one now offers so much more in that field and more. I know the game has alot of bugs and whatnot but I honestly couldn't stop playing/streaming this last night. I couldn't stop laughing at some of the ideas I came up with to dispatch the innocent aswell as those common bugs kicked in to provide hilarious rag doll effects.I know this game has just been released and will get the attention it needs from the DEVS but all in all Lucius II will warm your heart with cold murder.Vaughn Whiskey			"

												-- UPDATED --So I've spent a bit more time playing this (killing people), and, like it has beens stated by many already, if you like Lucius, you'll like Lucius II.NOTE: This is very important, as both negative and positive reviews have been stating thus far, the bodies REALLY need a patch, as they really are authentic ragdolls.Other than that, the graphics are nice, some of the ""different"" kills have a cinematic, the regular ones don't, the story itself is quite interesting, and the narrative is really intersting, too.I'd say the gameplay has changed considerably from the previous game, it feels like a sort of a sandbox now, just as people asked. You get to explore a lot more, and you actually don't have to kill EVERYONE (but, come on...).The soundtrack is good, although I'd dare to say the previous one was better'ish'.I don't usually rate games numerically, but you've to start somewhere.Gameplay:  8/10 (as soon as that ragdoll gets patched up, it will go up to 10/10)Soundtrack:  8/10Graphics:  9/10Enjoyment:  666/666 (10/10)Overall: 8/10  (fix the ragdoll and that goes to a 9/10 for new players to the series, and 10/10 to Satan worshippers)** old review **Ok, I'll keep this short for now, as I'm busy playing (killing people), and I want to go back to playing (you know, kill more people).If you've played the first, you'll love this one, because you, well, kill people.It's a lot more freestyle, when compared to the first one, as you can kill whoever the hell you well please (meaning kill them all).The cinematics are quite nice (and if you check my screenshots, there's one very interesting, where you can see McGuffin ""kneeling"" down before Satan.So far, I'll say that my only ""real complaint"" is the ragdoll mechanic, after you kill someone they're literally just a ragdoll, and at the slightest touch, move everywhere. Other than that, you kill people, and you kill more people.666/666			"

												Game feels a little unfinished. I guess it's kind of fun, but nowhere near as good as the first one. The UI is very bland and a big step back from the first game. The graphics have improved but the level design is kind of lame. If you didn't like Lucius, you definitely will not like Lucius II.			"

The ""cinematics"" seem cheap and as if placeholders. Sound is terribly mixed, with voices being overshadowed by other noises and music. Graphic bugs and my minor issues with the physics of the game, make this a work in progress. The first game was rough around the edge, but still polished.

												If you want a super pristine perfectly bugless game that takes care of everything for you, do not buy this game. HOWEVER, this game is a marvelous little whimsical oddity. The gameplay is very freeform, which makes it rather sloppy at times, but the potential for ""F___ YES!"" moments are everywhere. I still love the first one for it's super specific set-ups and micro-detail precision, but this one is much more straight up fun. PS, did you know the devil was a Catholic? The More You Know...			"

												Great game, fun to play and its possible to replay the game without getting bored of it. However the stealth part of the game isnt as punishing as it should be, its pretty much impossible to get restrained for being in places you're not meant to because you can just run away. Nor do people call for help when they spot dead bodies etc. Would be much better if they would call police or security who come to investigate.			"

												I don't know where people get the idea that this has less bugs than the first Lucius (doubtful they have played much of the game atall), I would still reccommend it, it quite a fun murder simulator.			"

												I don't understand why so many people hate this game. I watched some let's play videos of this game and knew exactly what I was getting into. Yes the game has a few glitches (I had a floating man on the last level) and yes the story was a little lack luster but I felt that came from the narrators voice. So dull sounding and monotone.The gameplay however I felt was fun! It was a kill fest compared to the 1st game but this is Lucius 2, the boys powers are evolving so it would only make sense his mischievous murders would increase in number. Why waste his effort killing one person at a time? Many more ways to kill people and it actually makes you think. Combine certain items to create a bomb or a lethal weapon, not really a checklist of what you have to do to specifically kill an NPC. The choice is up to you.TLDR:All in all I enjoyed the game. Gameplay was fun and exploring the areas was different. Story was a little dull due to voice acting. There are some really weird glitches. Seriously, I once had an NPC burn to death and his burned body began to stand up and walk around in a circle where he died... messed up.			"

												Disclaimer: This review has been deemed homophobic by some so please only read if you're willing to accept the fact that while it may be a tad offensive i have no problem with people exploring/enjoying their own sexuality! We're all people and we all have the right to live our lives how we want to. I have much love for ALL people!This game was partially broken on release but thankfully they've fixed it now :)So here's my NEW review!PROS:- Play as the ♥♥♥♥ing anti-christ!! EPIC!- Kill people in creative and horrific ways! AWESOME!- See 2 gay guys having sex in a hospital bathroom....Why isn't this a con?.. Because I threw a jug of slippery fluid on them (:O) and watched as one man fell down and the other one just kept humping the air until I threw a vial of acid into the room killing them both. GOOD TIMES!EDIT: This was NOT an enjoyable moment simply because I have any problem with homosexuality. It would have been just as fun if it'd been a man and a woman banging in the bathroom. But I must say that walking in on two guys was an epic curveball that made it that much funnier. Especially when the one guy just kept humping air. OMFG funny moment! And on top of that I applaud the developers for being open minded.- Rather than following a cookie cutter script like in Lucius 1, this game allows you to kill basically any person in the game in basically any way you can think of. So you can completely clear a level and kill everyone or you can just kill those who are targets. COOL!- People have actual♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and balls! Complete with physics! :O- Umm did I mention the killing??...CONS:- Meh graphics.- Meh Levels. (not as good as the first game IMO)- The story ♥♥♥♥ING SUCKS! At least in the first game they made a bit of an effort to make it feel like you really were playing the villain in a horror movie. And the cop investigating you was pretty decent too! Except I think he must've had a learning disability of sorts... But in Lucius II that cop sucks satan's♥♥♥♥♥♥(literally) in like the first 2 minutes of the poorly made cutscene and just joins Lucius' side on a ♥♥♥♥ing whim thus leaving you with no real opposition. Stupid idea on the dev's part in my opinion. PLUS the entire game feels like a ♥♥♥♥ing satire of itself! It's like the developers didn't even take it seriously so they figured ♥♥♥♥ it we'll just make it into a comedy. The first game was somewhat satirical as well but it also had some great horror elements. In a way this game just feels like a poorly executed joke with a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of blood and gore. - Buggy and awkward as hell at times!- Sometimes it's way too hard to kill people creatively so you'll fall back on the ol tried and true methods such as; Un-necessary defibrilation and poisoned donuts. - The first game felt a bit more solid and well made, this one feels like they subbed the contract out to some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ nameless korean sweatshop game-making company.SUMMARY:There is a lot about this game that sucks but honestly it's just not enough to make me not want to play it or reccommend it. Lucius 1 & 2 are truly unique and thus have a bit of a monopoly on the ""antichrist simulator"" market at the moment seeing as there really arent any other games like it. I'd really like to see the devs make a Lucius 3, but maybe actually take it a bit more seriously this time guys? It's not like it'd really be so morally reprehensible to make a game like this that doesn't play out like a ♥♥♥♥ing comedy. Sometimes It feels like developers are scared to make games like this that are serious and brutal because they'll be classified as monsters or some♥♥♥♥♥♥.. But in a world where people let their 10 year old children play GTA and Valve allows games like ""Hatred"" to sell on the steam store I'm pretty sure people can handle a ♥♥♥♥ing serious horror villain-protagonist type of game... All in all I'd reccomend Lucius 2 if you're a sick ♥♥♥♥ and it's on sale for at least 50% off.			"

												Just finished Lucius 2DEFINATLEY RECOMMENDING THIS GAME TO EVERYONE who doesnt mind: blood, gore, Satanic references, crude humor. a good laugh and Great memories!TRUE STORY:Be a childWalk into water purifying lab/business.Kill security guard with a hook.Blow another man up with a tiregrab keysGoto toilet to recover ManaWalk through male toilet door See naked man with His rod outI become Shocked from this being a kid in the game.So i decide to goto next room and ""shock"" him back, after I took control of him and paraded him around a bitMade him go back to toilet, where i electrocuted him.Proceeded killing people and irradiating the towns water with Nuclear Waste.Then casually walked out of area.Overall:10/10 scenes9/11 pixelated Rods and S#x jokes15/10 maths and logic10/10 would play again666/555 on satanic linkings.666% sure that i would recommend this gameGood stress reliever, apart from the final boss level, had to google it to under stand how to even start attacking him, as the previous method didnt work.but easy gameplay, fun at 98% of the time.Interesting story lines and such.want to see a final series Sequel.#Lucius3:TheRapture?good title? or nah? i think it would fit the series story well.But all jokes aside, this game i bought online for $2 AUD or around $1.32-ish USDBut having played this game i would have purchased it for the full amount. Loved this game.It is in my top 5 PC games listAnd i tend to avoid Third-Person Games due to lack of feeling of Immersion.But this game was F@#*ING AWESOMECant wait for the next installment, if it is planned.But T'was and always shall be LEGENDARY!TO DEV'sOn a personal note it was a little short, but also the right length, if im making sense here.I wanna see a third and final chapter for this series, And A suggestion for the name is, Lucius III/3: The RaptureBut generally was an awesome and fantastic game! cant wait to 100% it with achievements.Loved the References, and the gameplay!Keep up the good work!I wrap this review up with how i started it:DEFINATLEY RECOMMENDING THIS GAME TO EVERYONE who doesnt mind: blood, gore, Satanic references, crude humor. a good laugh and Great memories!Do i recommend this game?
