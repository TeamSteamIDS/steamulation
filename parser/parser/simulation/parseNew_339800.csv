												It's, uh. How do I put this.I showed this to my friends because I thought it was a train wreck of a game, yeah? Turns out one of them had enough disposable income and enough deep seated hatred of me to actually buy it out of the blue for me.My screams of anguish echoing through the house, I installed it while he cackled maniacally in my ear. Then, through Steam's wonderful beta features, I streamed it and he watched me play.I won't lie: It's a funny game. Throw all the logic you've got stored in your brain case out, and it's good for that at least. The puzzles ramp up strangely well, though really, I'm ♥♥♥♥ing awful at games like that and am not a good metric for the difficulty of them in the slightest. There's racism, specifically from your bubblegum fairy friend, and all the girls are less human beings and more charicatures of what certain human cliques are supposed to be, but that's alright: It makes it even funnier, as long as you don't take it seriously. By the time another friend started watching me play, I was invested, and the three of us laughed our asses off constantly (partially due to our own commentary, partially due to the game).It's not BAD. But then again, I'm the kind of person who sits on Newgrounds playing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ flash games all day, so I'm not exactly smart. I will say, however, that it's not some kind of spectacular rainbow coated super game: It's funny. The puzzles are challenging, for lobotomized dickmonkeys like me, and what more do you want? I mean, it's got blatant objectification of women, but we've already established that if you're going to play this you need to turn off the logical and reasonable parts of your brain and basically just go with it.If you're the kind of person who's open minded and doesn't get offended easily and you desperately need something to do because, like me, your standard hobbies are slowly becoming less and less fulfilling as you descend into the maw of inevitable insanity, go for it.If you're literally anybody else, then take any recommendations with a grain of salt: It's certainly not something everybody will find as amusing as I did.

												As a heterosexual girl, I wholeheartedly recommend this.It's a game that shouldn't be good. A game where you ask girls how big their honkers are, get them drunk, then try to Candy Crush your way to their climax? Really? Yep, really. And it works great.I started out my adventure deciding I would try to get it on with both of the blondes. My plan works great, until I ask them both their family names and realize they are mother and daughter. I don't know whether to cry or to get turned on. In my confusion I decide to just keep going. Unlocking the secret characters was great fun.This game is incredibly sarcastic, and has a lot of great references. Let me paraphrase one of them to you: ""Guys keep asking me to put a shoe on my head, I don't get it."" The girls in this game are objectified and stereotyped on a large scale, but it's done in a satirical way. What's up, Anita Sarkeesian?			"

												As a straight female, HuniePop was a very educational game. Having only ever dated men, I was very eager to learn more about the experience of dating women and, on this front, found the game very enlightening! I learned a great many things about dating women, such as: All women become cranky when hungry and will not speak to you until you buy them food.After 4 dates, women will send you unsolicited explicit photos even when you never respond to their texts.Authenticity is your enemy. You should only express opinions you think the woman in question also holds.Women enjoy racially-appropriate gifts, regardless of context or previously expressed interest. Also: giving an Indian woman a Native American dress qualifies as ""racially-appropriate.""After completing HuniePop I feel like I now have greater insight into dating and sexual politics. I have learned valuable lessons I can apply to my own relationships to become a better romantic partner. Thanks, HuniePop!			"

												This game is really fun! But the steam version is censored... You can only see the girls' breasts,and not their ♥♥♥♥♥♥s. You could buy the original, uncensored version, but I'll just give you a link on how to uncensor it yourself. It's super quick and easy. I did it in about 10 minutes. Here is the link!

												What I've learned from this game:- Dating and having sex does not become any easier with experience. In fact, it becomes much more difficult.- Chicks dig pretenders. Do NOT try to be yourself. Trust me, it's not gonna work.- It's completely OK to ask questions about weight and bra size. Girls expect you to do so.- There is little to no reason to ever have anything to do with someone you've already banged. Move on.HuniePop is pretty much your regular light dating sim. You ask girls generic questions, they in return quiz you to find out if you've paid any attention at all and in the end, if done correctly, you've humped every girl in town. For some reason though it feels more fun than dating sims usually. I'm still trying to determine if it actually is more fun or am I just being fooled to think so.If you've played any dating sim before, especially any western-made, you've seen most of this game already. First you're introduced with your mission to get down with every girl you meet. Sometimes it's because you're trying to win a bet, sometimes you're doing it just for the hell of it, sometimes you're getting revenge, and so on, and so on. This time the reason is a magic fairy who comes to your aid because you're a pathetic mess and need to get some poon-tang ASAP. Then you run rampant around the town meeting girls and memorizing trivia you learn from them. Wooing the girls can be made easier by handing them various obtainable gifts.What's different in this game is dating. Instead of putting anything you've learned in actual use, you're playing a round of Bejeweled... Candy Crush... You know, that puzzle game where there's a board full of bricks of different colors and you're supposed to swap bricks to create lines of three or more of same color. You need to get certain amount of points and you have 20 turns to do so. If you succeed, date is successful and your prey likes you a little bit more. However, every time you win a date game, next date becomes more difficult with higher target score. You can improve your in-game skills to get point multipliers, but at some point you're likely to find yourself in a situation where every move has to be magnificent. There's no time limit though, and sooner or later you're gonna understand why.Once you've managed to bend your target under your will, it's time to move to your bedroom. Again you're facing your nemesis, the bling-bling puzzle game, but this time it's slightly different. You have unlimited moves, but your score keeps running down to zero. In order to reach your target you need to score faster than your points decrease. During this your conquest stands next to you in her underwear moaning. It's rather peculiar portrayal of intercourse, I must say. It makes you feel like you're rolling all over the place like a tornado, trying to twist and tweak everything you can, as fast as you can. If you can conjure a hysteric state of mind at will, it will be extremely helpful.The game is put together very well. Graphics are pretty, background music can run hours without becoming annoying and voice acting is a lot better than you would expect, although sometimes it's difficult to believe that every girl has their own voice actress. Girls have extremely different, yet quite stereotypical personalities. Dialogue varies from hilarious to awkward to annoying, so a lot, but thanks to voice acting you don't want to skip any of it (unless you really hate the girl in question).There are some minor nuisances. Once you've done the deed with a girl, there isn't any reason to interact with her again. There are some minor details like costumes and hairstyles you can always try to unlock but nothing that affects gameplay and nothing that matters at all in any way if you're not gonna see that girl anymore, and again, why would you? Item inventory has less space than there are items to obtain. For some reason this becomes quite annoying, especially because there is absolutely no reason to limit the size of inventory. Also, there are Steam cards but no achievements. Personally I would've picked achievements over trading cards, but that's just me.I still don't know for sure whether HuniePop really is fun or just masked as fun. I'm playing it hours at a time, but I'm not exactly sure why. It doesn't really bring anything new to the table. It doesn't offer anything I haven't yet seen. If you're familiar with dating sims this one is going to feel familiar right off the bat. I recommend this game, but ONLY if you like the genre or want to find out what dating sims are. Even though it's very generic, it's still very well made and an excellent example of a dating sim. If you've tried dating sims before and haven't liked them, this one is not gonna change that opinion.			"

												When I bought this game, I was not expecting much from it, in fact, I thought it would be nice if I can get around an hour or something. But damn, was I wrong. To be honest, I was really surprised by the fact that the game was actually well made. I'm assuming the game was made by an American developer, and yet, they really seem to understand waifu, moe and hentai factors that exist in the current hentai anime trend. Is that a good thing? For someone like me, yes ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)It is basically Bejeweled with dating sim, and my goodness the game is just well made in every possible way.Since It is basically Bejeweled, if you know how to play that, then you should be able to play. But there are things that you must remember, such as which jewels give you what kind of effects. And honestly, it took me some time to master that, but you should be able to find out eventually as you keep playing. The game gets pretty challenging as it goes, so you will need to get good items and such to make the game easier. And honestly, I would've just given up on the game if it were not for the whole real good dating stuff you can do in the game. You actually can buy girls gifts to please them and also you can get more love from your girls by giving them the right answers to their questions. And by this, it felt as though I actually was dating them, I somehow ended up memorizing those girls' birthdays, last names, etc (Sad, I know -_- but you will be, too ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) )Also, I noticed you actually can get...panties, PANTSU of each girl when you sleep with them. My goodness, can this game get anymore hentai than this? I honestly thought it was such a neat idea, taking away their pantsu. What do those pantsu do? Well, you can use them to unlock something, but in most cases, they are basically meant to be the medals of honor ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) I always take a look at those pantsu to make me feel proud of myslef ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)vAnd I thought it was pretty nice to see that the game has 3 secret girls that you can unlock. I mean seriously? 3 more waifus? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)bAll I can say is, this game needs a sequel. We want the sequel....no, ""I"" want the sequel. The only complaint I have would be that, the girls you see in the game and the girls you see on artworks are somewhat kind of different looking. So I really wish this could be fixed in the next game.Rating: I have disappointed my parents out of 10. 日本語レビュー簡単に言えばBejeweledです。しかし、女の子たちとのデートシミュレーションがメインなゲームであり、彼女たちがする質問にちゃんと答えたりとかプレゼントを上げたりとかしなきゃ先に進めないし、絶対購入者のほとんどはそれが目当てでしょうに。( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)ゲーム自体はパズルの面で少しずつ難しくなるため、アイテムやステータスを上げる必要があります。きっと途中でやめたくなるかもしれません。「難しすぎる・・・」となってもうここで終わりにしようかとも思ってしまうかもです。しかし、このゲームでは彼女のハートをゲッツし、彼女たちと甘い夜を過ごした後に彼女たちのパンティー（！！！）をゲッツすることができるのです。こんな変態ゲーが今まであったでしょうか？パンティーのとこを見ても「彼女が君と一緒に寝たときに履いてたパンティー」とかマジで完全もうエロ過ぎてあれだよな？何このゲームめっちゃ何かよく分かってるな、おい、マジかよ？何かもう、女の子のパンティーをコレクションできるってどんだけエロいんだよ、開発者、俺もう１２枚集めたからシェンロン呼んで良い？良いよね？（崩壊）・・・・とにかく、このゲームはそういうヘンタイストたちの心を揺さぶるものがあるのです。問題点と言ったらまぁ、これは日本語が無いと思うので英語ができなきゃちょっとこれを完全に楽しむのは難しいかもです。ちなみに、このゲームには隠しキャラが３人います。そしてその中の一人がネコの女の子で、英語でご主人様になってとか言ってきます（興奮）もう何このゲーム？めっちゃよく分かってんな？おい、こんな子とデートするんだぜ？？おまけにこんな子のパンティーをゲッツできるんだぜ？？しょうもねーゲームだな、おい、どんだけけしからんゲームなんだおいはやく２出して下さい。結果：　十点満点中、「もうとっくにご存知なんだろう？俺は二ポーンのヘンタイワールドから来たヘンタイスト・・・穏やかなニートでありながら激しいエロスによって目覚めた伝説の超戦士・・・・スーパーヘンタイストだーーーーー！！！！！！」・・・・って俺なんちゅうレビュー書いてんねん			"
