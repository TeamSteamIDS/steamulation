												Luftrausers isn't a dogfighting game. Yes, you're in a plane and you're shooting down planes (and boats and blimps), but what it really is frenetic aerial bullet hell chaos. But what makes Luftrausers so good, besides the action and stylized graphics, are the controls. Your plane is insanely maneuverable, able to turn on a dime, reach top speed in a moment. That level of control makes a difference. It's one thing to weave between some bullets and return fire. It's another to swoop into a dive, deftly plummet through a hail storm of bullets, take out a projectile-spewing battleship, and pull up so close that the water's surface is flared up by your thrusters.It's one thing to shoot down some planes. It's another to maneuver your enemies into a tight cluster, cut your thrusters, and shoot the planes pursuing you while your momentum carries you in the other direction. (And it helps that just activating your thrusters is so satisfying, thanks to the awesome fwhoosh sound effect)It's fast, it's hard as hell, it's addictive. The music is great. The visuals are simple, yet suit the game perfectly, displaying all the information you need to know without cluttering the onscreen spectacle. Each new part you unlock feels different, a new tool to master, Luftrausers isn't the most complex game, but it's certainly one of the most addictive and satisfying I've played in a while. I'd say it's up there with One Finger Death Punch, in terms of a simple experience that's laser focused on delivering finely tuned fun gameplay. It's the kind of game where I'm instantly restarting upon defeat, to improve my skills, complete missions, unlock new parts.			"

												A fallacious argument regarding arcade games is that they're designed solely to take your money. If anything, arcade games make you value your money. Think about it, your life is represented by a mere quarter. With practice that quarter could take you anywhere you want to go. For most of us nowadays, the only exposure to arcade games is through the occasional port or MAME. We've lost sight of how much a quarter is worth. What a lot of arcade-style games get wrong is that they have too much content. They have a lot of fluff like epic intros, backstories, dozens of stages, freakin' level-ups. I don't play an arcade game for all that filth, I want a good challenge, I want the action to start seconds after I begin. Luftrausers understands what makes an arcade game work, and it's fantastic.So uh...there's a war or something, you're a pilot, and oh who cares? You're either very skilled or exceptionally lucky to survive five minutes of this hell. The goal is to fly around, shoot down enemy fighters, destroy their boats, wreck their aces, sink their battleships, obliterate their subs, and probably wipe out their airships. One element of a good arcade game is that you can grasp its mechanics and controls in seconds. The enemy numbers are overwhelming but dodging and returning fire is seamless and impeccably designed. Your goals are simply to improve hi-score, complete various missions, and unlock parts. Whoa back up, unlock parts? What is this? It's actually a very clever system. The parts in this game aren't just +1 to armor or +3 to fire-power. They change up the player's entire style and strategy. There are a multitude of weapon, body, and engine combinations. Finding the one that suits you is all part of the fun. For example, having a propellor equipped allows the player's ship to not take damage underwater. When the heat becomes a little too much, it's possible to duck into the sea for a quick breather. Couple this with the laser cannon and enemies can be destroyed while firing from underwater. Every combination leads to various changes in how every game is played, and with each attempt lasting minutes at the most, there's a lot of ideas to play around with.What makes this such a smartly-designed game is that it does a lot with very little. There are maybe 7 or 8 enemy-types in the entire game, but they're used just right to make every game feel fresh. Changing the parts of your ship or focusing on different objectives can also make every attempt feel different from the last. I've gotten more than a couple hours out of this tiny game precisely because it knows what works and runs with it.Definitely pick up Luftrausers if you haven't already. If you're the bundle-purchasing type it has to be in your library already. If not...well...oops? Grab it during the next sale, or buy it right now. Just play this game next chance you get, it's definitely worth it.			"

												LUFTRAUSERS is a bullet hell airplane based game, being released on PC, PS3 and Vita in early 2014. Game play is quite simple, you are in control of a airplane and you have to take on hundreds and hundreds of other enemy fighters coming at you from all angles. This game allows your plane to fly in all 360 degrees. Your main weapon will shoot from the front of your plane, you also have to take into consideration things like gravity, stalling and drifting whilst dodging all of the oncoming enemies.  Initially the controls seem very hard to get a grasp of, but once you work out how the plane flies and how you are supposed to control it, it becomes almost second nature. I would say it took me at least an hour to get to grips with the controls. Graphically, the game has a very minimalist look to it. Whilst there is little detail gone into the planes and their silhouettes, you still feel like you are actually there in the skies shooting the planes down yourself.  They could of quite easily made this look like a many of the other flight games on Steam, I think its the graphics and art style that most people will remember this game for. There isn't really any story or plot to follow in LUFTRAUSERS. I also didn't really want one too; it's perfectly fine for a game not to have a plot I think. After all, your character can nose dive your plane into an enemy battleship, reap the rewards from it and move onto the next character without batting an eyelid. The game also has a kind of rogue-like feel to it, after each level, you are able to customize your plane with different weapons and armor, and you keep all of the updates even after you die, along with any levels and points you have earned. Eventually you'll get more powerful and be able to simply overpower some stages purely because your plane will be kitted up so much. LUFTRAUSERS is a very hard game. I have died countless times, you just need to get used to it - there is no way around it. But if you preserver through, you'll soon be able to break through that wall you have been pounding your head on for an hour and beat the challenges that are set at the start of each level.  In order for me to reach the ""end"", it took me just over five hours. For me it felt just about right as I think it would really start to get tedious if I had to keep playing. This is probably a game you will want to dip into now and then, and not do a full stint of it like me, to get maximum fun out of it, just play it for twenty minutes at a time. The game is also highly recommended you use a game pad too; I tried with keyboard and it was just horrendous to control. To sum up, LUFTRAUSERS is a nicely put together indie title with some interesting elements; bullet-hell fans will absolutely adore it, and this is really a good game to play if you have five or ten minutes to spare as no level will ever last longer than that. The price tag of £6,99 makes it an absolute bargain for anyone. If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												LUFTRAUSERS is a fun arcade shooter based on a flash game called LUFTRAUSER, and the aim of the game is to survive as a fighter pilot as long as you can while racking up points and achievements in the process. As you gain experience you'll level up and unlock new parts for your ship - such as lasers, thrusters and massive hulls - which change your playstyle.GO LUFTRAUSERS!

												Luftrausers is incredibly addictive.The short, randomized gameplay sessions mean that you keep thinking ""one more game!"" until you've spent hours playing. The way the health system is done means that you can always make a full recovery by cooling your fighter off for a few seconds, making the gameplay change rapidly from shooting enemies to fleeing for your life - which keeps things very exciting. The variety of fighters you can build also dramatically changes your play style, and keeps things interesting much longer.As awesome as it is, there's still not a lot of content. So I wouldn't recommend it for full price, unless you're really into shmups.			"

												I know I haven't played a lot of the game, but its simple enough for me to write a review on it.LUFTRAUSERS is a bullet hell arcade game where you play as a ship and you fly around using momentum and different types of weapons to take advantage of your enemies. Speaking of enemies, there are several different kinds to combat against. I want to keep this fairly short, so heres the pros and consPros:-Nice Aesthetic-Very good and Adrenaline pumping soundtrack-Solid and repsonsive controls-Variety of ship and weapon types-Solid enemy variety-Blowing stuff up feels goodCons:-Minimalistic options menu-Black bars on my 1920x1080 monitorEDIT: At first I wrote that the game had no options menu and you couldn't exit. I was completely wrong, I just never went into the menu. Its still very lacking and the black bars do exist. Anyway, LUFTRAUSERS is a great arcade style game that will keep you on your toes Buy At Full Price  "

 The good guys always win, right?	 Wrong. In Luftrausers, you play as the pilot of an experimental self-healing fighter plane during the second world war, the catch is, you're on the german's side. This piece makes you feel like a total badass as you tear up the sky with your hundreds of different plane combinations, each as unique as the next, and witness your foes drop like flies. But the game's no match for your eagle-like superiority, you say? You can try out the SFMT mode for a true test of ones aeronautical mettle. Luftrausers' addictive, one more try kind of gameplay spells a good handful of genuinely fun hours of playtime. For it's cheap pricetag in a sale, this game will definately have you coming back for more fast-paced action with its quirky interface, adrenaline-fueling soundtrack and glorious pixel graphics.""Luftrausers"" is a made-up word. Sounds German. But it's not.""			"

												This game starts very fun with polished controls and a great visual style. I enjoyed it for the first hour, maybe two, but in the end the sudden drop off in entertainment made me to not recommend this game. It wasn't without other issues as well... The game lacks a good progression/unlockable balance. There is overall goals and levels. But. Also each item (weapon/armor/boost) you unlock comes with it's own unlockable goals. This is honestly the only reason you would bother using most options beyond a one time try to ""see what they are"". Basically the system forces you to use items you don't prefer if you want to stay on track in your progression. But if like most people you find a weapon/armor/boost combo you prefer and ignore your other unlocks? Well, you run the risk of grinding your overall level progression up... Which changes the spawn rates of enemies. And that's where the balance is quickly lost when you start missing specific item goals. There's one ""right"" way to progress but even if you did it and methodically unlocked each upgrade's goals as you got them without wasted plays? I still doubt it would stay balanced! And let me be clear, this is not a complaint about difficulty...I like a challenge and this game gives it when you get a lot of enemies on screen at once. But the spawning balance just ruins a reasonable chance at a goal and turns it into a lottery. Luck isn't a challenge, it is just luck. Skill goes out the window. And you do get to the point where you tap out. The goals you have left indeed become purely luck based or based on enemy spawns that rarely if ever cooperate. The game goes from a steady two hours of fun challenges of unlocks and goals to a test of  your willpower to grind and grind with items you don't like until you literally get lucky and win the lottery. Which I guess points out one last flaw. Without the goals this game loses all of it's appeal. All of it. With runs so short it isn't rewarding in any way to just play for ""fun"" without a goal. An average run is well under a minute. This makes playing it like an arcade game just going for a high score both pointless and ultra repetitive. I definitely had some fun playing it. It was a challenge at times and the gameplay felt tight. It was a pleasure to look at stylistically too. But then the fun ended. Abruptly. Completely. Beyond being a throw in game in a bundle I wouldn't recommend it. The price is way out of balance with what you actually get; A way out of balance short game.			"

												Luftrausers is a small, arcade-style game that packs a punch... if that's the sort of thing you're into.The thing with Luftrausers is, not everyone's going to like it. I don't want to convince you that it's good, I want to tell you about it and let you make that decision. There is no story mode. There are no levels. It's one area, you fly around, you shoot as many things as you can, you die, repeat.First off, let's talk about that. It's a game about flying around in an advanced German fighter plane machine thing and shooting up the enemies. Various airborne and seaborne war vehicles will try to shoot you down. And, sooner or later, they will succeed.Probably sooner.Your controls are a surprising part of what makes the game fun. You have your propulsion, which will move you forward. You also have right and left, which will turn you. Gravity is a thing here, it's not your typical bullet hell. But gravity is what allows you to perform cool aerial maneuvers. Fly directly up, stall your craft, then fall down past your enemies and blast upward at them. Laying back into the propulsion at the last minute to fly off to the side and dodge a battleship's bullets, of course.Now, there are two things which add replayability, here. First, is the diversity in equipment. You begin the game with a basic machine gun, basic aircraft body, and basic propulsion system. As you go, you unlock four more of each, all of which completely change how your craft performs and operates. One type of propulsion lets you go underwater without taking damage. One weapon is a continuous laser beam which hinders your turn speed when in use. One body is a nuke which destroys almost anything around when you die. Which, actually, that last one's a ton more useful than it sounds.Which brings me to the other thing. Missions. Each piece of equipment has a series of missions attached to it. Complete one, unlock the next. These are things like destroying so many of something, or blowing something up with a full combo going. Some are a little more outside the box, but there you go. Once you complete all of the normal missions, one final mission unlocks, which must be completed in SFMT mode, which is, for lack of a better label, hard mode. This unlocks the first time you destroy a blimp. And good luck with that. You're going to need it. And you're going to need it even more when you actually start SFMT mode.Completing missions nets you skulls, and as you unlock enough or level up, you unlock new equipment. Once all of the equipment is unlocked, you unlock palettes. The basic palette is a sort of retro-beige affair. My favorite was the first one I unlocked, titled ""Videodreaming"", which is sort of indigo and pink, and honestly looks really cool. Most of the others I unlocked were eyesores, so there's a thing to be aware of.That's honestly about all there is to it. You swoop and loop and blow stuff up and complete challenges and unlock things. I wouldn't expect to get TONS of time out of Luftrausers. But a few hours would be natural. If that all sounds appealing, then check it out.			"

												LUFTRAUSERS is a challenging arcade shooter that makes you fight to beat your high score. There's no deep story or hero with a traumatic past here. Just you gunning down countless waves of scum who deny you the right to the skies. Here's a video giving you my first impressions of the game. Although given how short it is, you may be able to consider it a review.


YouTube™ Video: LUFTRAUSERS: First Impressions 

			Views: 3,905		

			Watch Noble of Lost Pause give his first impressions of LUFTRAUSERS. Is this the game for you? Possibly!		

For those of you who want a short and dirty summary, I'll break it down for you with pros and cons.+ Challenging gameplay. There isn't a point where you'll ever be bored with how easy something is.+ Great replayability. No game will ever play the same, especially when you throw in all the different plane parts into the mix.+ Lots of different playstyles. You can fly everything from a plane that spearheads through destroyers to a meaty clunker that fires a laser and poops bullets. + Smooth, responsive gameplay. Nothing feels clunky and everything responds when you do it.+ Every shade of yellow you can find is here. Bask in its yellow glory! (Though you can change the scheme when you level up, but why?)- Extremely short. After playing 3 hours, I've practically done everything in the game.- Some of the weapons just aren't as good as others in my opinion. The homing missiles seem to have a lot of trouble hitting their target, even massive destroyers that barely move. Limiting you to 4 at a time makes it even more frustrating when they don't hit what they're supposed to. The cannon is similar, as it only allows one shot at a time, and if you miss, you have a lot of downtime between shots. And in a game as fast-paced as this, missing happens often.- Sometimes enemies just don't spawn and come after you. It makes it hard to bump up combos and get more points, allowing the more interesting enemies trying to gun you down.- Sometimes the game can be cheap and send 3 destroyers at you at a time with a few ace pilots to boot. At that point, you're just not gonna live with the amount of things on screen.All in all, I recommend you pick this game up when you want an excellent time waster. Even when it goes up to 10 dollars, it'll still be worth it. But if you don't like the fact that it is so short, feel free to wait until it goes on sale. You won't be disappointed either way.			"

												It's a fun game, tight controls and fantastic music. And so much of it too!The thing is, it's really short. Like, really really short. I unlocked all plane pieces (save for 3) within 45 minutes. The 3 pieces I didn't unlock I assume you gain from destroying a Blimp, a rare and difficult enemy. Upon further research, it appears that Blimps appear randomly after a fairly easy prerequisite is reached. Some players report finding it within their first hour, some after 5. It seems like some kind of artificial lengthening to me.If this game is %50 or more, go for I guess. Full price is a bit much right now.			"

												I strongly recommend trying the original flash game before buying: http://www.vlambeer.com/?p=496This sequel essentially extrapolates the original's gameplay into various goals while existing in a singular world.Ship components are unlocked after completing these goals. The patterns of enemies remain roughly the same, with the exception of boss-esque appearances.The core gameplay is phenomenal, but the lack of variety comes as huge a disappointment. What about a mission-based system, or campaign? Different missions with combinations of the enemies. One level could be entirely naval-based, another strictly dogfighting ... the list goes on.To conclude, if you enjoy the original flash demo, go for it, but don't expect much more than the challenges and ship mods.

												What I did in Luftrausers:- Flew really high into the sky from a pack of fighter planes, turned around, and then blew them all up with my ♥♥♥♥ing laser- Used the melee body to run directly into a giant fighter plane to blow his♥♥♥♥♥apart- Skipped across the sea like a jet-propelled skipping stone to run into ships on the sea, ramming into them with said melee body to destroy their sucker asses- Dove into the sea like a dolphin, surfaced back into the air in front of a ship, blasted it with my machine gun until it died, then dived back into the ocean. DON'T ♥♥♥♥ WITH DOLPHINS.- Intentionally dived in front of the enemy fire of a battleship to blow my plane up, setting off the nuke I had on board to blow up that battleship and his stupid battleship friends. Stupid battleships.Also you should really get this game, it is loads of fun. It's probably short in terms of actual progression if you're Skip Rogers but it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tons of half-strategic half-manic fun if you just play to shoot everything.			"

												Looks a bit like Sopwith, controls a bit like Asteroids with gravity.  It feels good to fly and shoot in this, and in general the feedback for your actions and status is good.  The choice to make this game look like military profile diagrams fighting in a newsreel makes it easy to see what's going on, but they've managed to put nice details in like the turbulence of your plane kicking up spray off the ocean.  All the parts you can customise your plane with are distinct and force different play styles.It's a solid foundation for a good game, but the scoring and enemy spawning system is screwed up and destroys any appeal to seeking high scores.  Luck will determine if you can carry a full score multiplier (and it's a big multiplier) because sometimes small planes and boats don't spawn often enough.  Sometimes four or five big, deadly planes will spawn at once and spell doom for all but a few specific plane part combos.  The game derives its longevity instead through hiding the different plane parts behind missions, many of which only ask you be persistent than skillfull (accumulate X points over however many tries it takes).  You're going to notice the game's problems well before you get the last part.			"

												Look at the video for Luftrausers, where you can have a bunch of fighters chasing your plane, cut the engines in mid air, spin around, strafe them, and zoom off in the opposite direction. Yes, Luftrausers does let you be a crazy plane badass. Sadly, that's about the only good point.The whole thing feels like an Iphone game, but brings almost enough excitement that it could qualify as a real game. Runs are short. You'll die within 5 minutes, easily. The score system is arbitrary and meaningless for the very same reason I cannot recommend the game.Beyond the fighters, every other enemy simply takes too much damage to kill. By the game you have made the five or so passes needed to kill a battleship, three more have spawned, and they will ALL be training their sights on you while you try to kill the others. And you have boats, planes, subs, and jets to deal with while you're trying to ice these. The score system relies on a chaining mechanic and every single tough enemy takes more damage to kill than it takes your chain to drop, so you can only hope to play for score by hoping the RNG throws you a bunch of suicidal popcorn fighters and jets. The big bad blimp boss of the game is a total pushover unless you have to fight it while two dozen battleships also try to nail you from below but he may as well take twice as much sustained fire as you have put out since the game started to get him to show up and fight. The enemy variety is just tedious and sucks the fun out of the game beyond that initial rush where you duplicate the preview video's cool tricks.Like an Iphone game, you can do three objectives each time to unlock parts to customize your plane and they're really the actual goal of the game as they block all the unlocks and provide you the only sort of direction you get beyond getting shot at. The plane parts are roughly 25% cool, 75% stupid, and share the same loose, uninspiring design as the basic game. Some change core mechanics in fundamental ways but they are not enough to save the game.$10 for a tight arcade experience would be a no brainer but Luftrausers just does not have that spark that makes an arcade game fun. You won't come back to it months later to revisit the fond memories. It burns out too quick and does not leave much beyond the flash... Which is a shame as a lot of love and care went into the glitz and the flash and the style of it but a little more should have went into tightening the gameplay.			"

												I honestly wanted to like this game, I did. And it WAS fun, for about 30 minutes - that's pretty much exactly how long you will need to see all LUFTRAUSERS has to offer. If you decide to play on, it will be because you want to grind out the achievements and not beacause there is a lot of fun to be had. A typical round of LUFTRAUSERS will last up to two minutes and it will not differ from the last round at all. The spawn patterns of your opponents seem utterly random (which makes chasing highscores rather tedious) and the drag we all feel, when we play games that just do not seem to progress in any way, will quickly set in.If you want to support the developer, buy NUCLEAR THRONE which is fantastic.

												If you're like me, you might be always wondering if there's something hidden within this game. I always thought this game looks really simple, too simple, from the previews. But it got such good reviews. Is there something else hidden within?Answer: There is not. It's exactly how it is in the previews. It's a gravity-based shmup, with multiplier-based scoring, stylistic and simplistic artstyle with one sephia shade within one stage without any story at all.But ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it is fun. The shooting is really satisfying, unlocking new parts feels really make a difference, and the contextual bgm really kick♥♥♥♥♥This game is really the crowning achievement of ""Let's play this for five minutes... whelp it's 1 hour already.""But there really isn't many content in this game, so that's that. After you unlock all parts and do all missions (challenges), you only try to beat high score. Strangely, I think this game would be more fulfilling to those who are not that good in this kind of shmup game, because they'll have longer time unlocking everything. But of course shmup veteran would get a kick from trying to beat high scores.Basically, recommended, but buy this discounted if you're concerned with the small amount of content.			"

												This is a bit of a cautious recommendation. I will say that the game is pretty fun on its own, with an interesting theme going on. It's basically a bullet-hell game (with, I'd argue, some rogue-like elements). Point of the game is to las as long as you can over dangerous waters, fighting bots, planes and Zeppelins. I will say that the gameplay is really solid and interesting; you'll be flying all over the place while shooting, and can even cut off your engines to pull off maneuvers to get the edge on your enemies. It's a good arcade experience that you should have some fun with, and that's added with the unlocks that you get from completing challenges. The unlocks include new bodies of the plane, as well as weapons, wings, and engines. These pieces have their own stats, but also have a few interesting quirks, an example being an engine that shoots bullets. With the customization, it's a good bit of fun.So why is it cautious, you ask? Well, what cuts this game off from being great is its price at ten dollars which, in my opinion, is very overpriced. While the action is hectic, you'll be fighting in the same area and with the same enemies over and over and over again. On top of that, while the unlocks are great fun, there are too few to unlock (I got all of them at the 1.5 mark). It really isn't that hard to get all of the items in this game. Once you unlock all of your parts and essentially the hard mode, the only thing to strive for afterwards is completing challenges (which kind of loses its luster once everything is unlocked). Don't get me wrong, it's a fun game, but I'd highly recommend you buy it one it's on sale. Got my copy on Chronogg for a dollar fifty, which I think is a much more fair price. All in all, a fun game, but doesn't offer enough for its asking price.			"

												 Well first off let me say that the experience of playing Luftrausers cannot be described nor felt via screenshots.. Videos might give you some idea.   I used to play the prototype flash game for hours and that was without any upgrades or any of the new stuff.  The minimal graphics are amazingly detailed, from debres and shrapnel flying from your plane and enemies, to smoke and bullets and even water dripping off after you splash down. The controls are very solid, and relay the power and abilities of the chosen engine well.  High tech engines feel snappy and powerful and the odd-job (bullet) engines feel sluggish and less responsive.  Once you learn to steer well, the game really opens up and is amazingly entertaining.    Well that is until a jet screams onto your screen and smashes you into tiny pixels. I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys shooters, bullet hell, action rogue-lites. And since a friend of a friend saw on some forum that this is a free flash game, let me set the record straight.  It began life as a ULTRA simple version of the current game a long time ago. And while the prototype is still available, the full version adds missions, and level / upgrade system and many more enemies and is totally worth the few bucks.  Although the prototype will give you a basic feel of how the game plays (keyboard and mouse only I believe) the full version offers controller support. And I mean, who doesn't want to support some of the most awesome indie devs around? 9/10 Anyday.			"

												This is a brilliant little arcade style game. Incidentaly I picked this up in a Humble Bundle, but already before I start this review I'd say that it is definitly worth full price!Luftrausers is an oldschool arcade style game, with focus on racking up as many points as possible, while sustaining a multiplier. To do this you gun down hundreds of planes, ships, and various modifications and bosstypes of these.The game does however feature some progression, in that you will be offered various jobs to complete, and by doing that you will progressively unlock parts to your plane, which comes with more jobs to do. There is also colourschemes to unlock,  since the artstyle is uses a simple 4-5 colour pallette.The unlockable parts gives a whole lot of vararity, and there's a bunch of different playstyles, depending on how you combine your plane. Personally I'm a big fan of the laser+melee body+booster engine combo.Gameplay continues to be fun, and even after you have completed all jobs and unlocked all parts, there is more to do, a hardcore mode will unlock, which is really hardcore. You will basically die within seconds, and this mode comes with additional jobs to do.Luftrausers is ultmatively a bunch of fun, with flying mechanics that feel really awesome, and gamplay that keeps on giving. It does however run in some wierd aspect ratio (most likely 4:3) and there is no way to make it wide screen as far as I have seen, but this doesn't really detract from the game in any way.I would definitly reccomend this game if you are into arcade style games with scores and multipliers. Or if you just want to waste some time shooting thing out of a brown sky.Go get it!			"

												This is a review for the Linux version, running Ubuntu 14.10. Runs perfectly on linux, only minor issue is lack of an exit button. I was hesitant to pick this game up, due to the artstyle that seemed lazy in the screenshots and the general simplicity of bullet hell games. I was expecting this to be a cheap ""So retro"" game. However, when it went on sale and I noticed it was published by Devolver Digital (who have yet to back a stray horse) I decided to give it a go. I'm glad I did and I would recommend this game at full price.This game reminds me of old arcade classic Aerial Dogfight, except with everything turned to the max. You begin with only the most basic machine gun and engine, then when you die you've discovered that you have a new engine that lets you move twice as fast at the cost of turning speed, a few more deaths later you're erupting out of the ocean and obliterating everything with a laser strapped to a chassis which is a nuclear bomb.The game offers a lot of upgrade potential, it's surprisingly balanced. There's no combination which felt leagues better than the rest, Although your basic machinegun, chassis and engine feel outdated by the end, nothing you have earned will feel pointless.The constant flow of gameplay challenges associated with each weapon encourages you to diversify your tactics. This prevents the fact that the game only offers one level and one mode from becoming tedious. One downside of these challenges is that the curve on them is a little bit off. The final challenges are magnitudes more difficuklt than the ones that came before it, and something such as defeating a submarine at MAX combo feels far more luck based than it does skill based.The only real downside I could say against this game is that once you've completed all the challenges, there's not much to do but try for the high-score. That's not even a problem either with a relatively short round time and tight polished gameplay. I can see myself coming back to this many times in the future.			"

												It's a bullet-hell, Asteroids-like game where the objective is to blow up as much as possible, as fast as possible, and while scoring as much as possible. There are customizable ship parts, which allow for dozens of combinations to dramatically change the playstyle of the gamem, which helps greatly with the replay value. One game you can be a tanky destroyer that launches devistating cannon shots and the next you can be a supersonic melee ship that doesn't need to fire a single shot. Go for it if you like high score games, but beware it's tough as nails when you first start. It doesn't explain much and it has a terrible menu and interface. Getting to a menu to quit is a lot tougher than it should be when you first get into it and the game starts out with a 'tutorial' before you're presented with an option to change settings.			"

												LUFTRAUSERS is a very enjoyable simple game that's astonishingly addictive. You are catapulted into the air and gain momentum. You then need to control your momentum and at the same time kill enemies and try to survive. If you die it's game over, but depending on your plane you can take a number of hits, some plane types more, some less. When you stop shooting you regain health.During the course of the game you unlock new parts for your air plane, each offering a different special ability. You can collect different weapons, different types of fuselage and different engines. You can modify your plane by combining one weapon with one type of fuselage and one engine. This leads to various different plane types, some fast, some slow, some able to swim, some more agile, some more damage resistant.By killing enemies you gain points. Killing enemies in a sequence increases your multiplier. Higher multipliers mean more points.For each type of air plane the game asks for a number of challenges to complete, like sinking a battle ship, or a blimp, or killing a submarine with maximum multiplier, etc.It's fun to complete the challenges and it's fun to experiment with the different plane types. I was very sceptic about LUFTRAUSERS, but now that I've played it I fully recommend it. Despite its simplicity this game is a lot of fun.			"

												8/10Overview: Shoot Em UpThe Good:+ Simple, clean art style that fits the style of the game+ There is only one ship that you can customize between 3 body parts- Weapons, body and engine. There are 5-6 parts in each category depending on how many you unlock, giving you well over 100 different combinations. Each body part is unique and provides its own sets of strengths and weaknesses depending on your play style. + Every body part you choose has 5 bonus objectives for you to complete giving you something to play for other than a high score. For example certain objectives may include 'kill 5 planes in one play session', 'destroy a battleship', 'kill a ship at max combo etc'. + The game has the ""one more time' feeling. The game can be very addicting as you try to get new high scores or complete objectives+Two difficulty modes to test your skills, normal and hard+Solid SoundtrackThe Average:The UI leaves something to be desired, it could have been a lot easier to navigate menu screens. Given the context of the game there really is no reason to have a UI that isn't simple and easy to navigate. The game can be very short if you don't care about achievements or high score, getting some of the bonus objectives can be time consuming and not worth the hassle. Conclusion:I am not the biggest fan of Shoot 'em ups but this game is the perfect pick up and play arcade game to kill some time. Its highly addicting and trying out all the different ship parts to find the right combination that fits your play style is part of the fun.  "

												Luftrausers is fast-paced bullet-hell dogfighter game; you are a plane and you shoot down other planes, missiles, ships and blimps down. Your objective is to survive as long as possible, taking down as many opponents as you can. Game is hard, death can occur within seconds of starting and your score is ranked online.Moving left or right will change the direction your plane will face, pushing up activates the boosters, and trigger fires your weapon. There is no limit to ammo. Controls are tight, dodging bullets and shooting the enemy has you switching your boosters on and off. You take damage by being shot at by the enemy, flying into enemy planes or ships, and staying too long in the clouds or water. All damage can be repaired by not firing for a few seconds.  You start off with a fast balanced plane, accomplishing objectives tied to your loadout (you can alter the engine, guns and body) and levelling up will unlock new choices. The new body, engine and gun types can be mixed and matched for different combinations, each giving a different play style; turn your ship into a battering ram, attach heat-seeking missiles, drop bombs on enemies below or sink into the sea without taking damage. There are many combinations to try and they do a great job in stopping the game from going stale.  Default colour scheme is light brown, dark red and white; different colour filters can be unlocked (though none of them are to my taste). Music is very good and the sound effects have a nice 'oompf' feel to it. If there is anything I would like to change is that a few more load out options would be welcomed and the cutscenes would be a bit longer. TL;DR: hard but fun bullet-hell game. One map, but made highly replayable by combining different parts of the plane.			"

												Another addictive game!!!The saying ' A second to learn, a lifetime to master ' is a very apt way of putting this game.You control a plane and the objective is to kill as many jets, planes, battleships, submarines etc as you can, rack up the points aided by reaching a max combo. The controls is what makes this game brilliant, it will certainly test your perception, timing and skill to avoid the barrage of gunfire whilst maintaining your kills to max out your combo for a serious score.The controls are similar to that old skool game gravity, where you control a small space ship and you have to land it on the landing pad.....right left and down will spin your plane whilst up is your thrusters to fly. Very tricky to master but allows for endless fun in trying to become the best!Steam achievements supported, also you have in game targets to reach for example, kill 20 jets in one game or reach a score of 5000, when you reach the criteria you can unlock different guns, plane bodies and abilities for your plane that gives you over 100+ different combinations of plane to fly with. Whats better is that every single different combination of aircraft has its own challenges to achieve!!If your an old skool gamer at heart, this is a no brainer and a must have!!!!! Tons of replayability and content to keep you busy.....question is, are you good enough to be the best Luftrauser?			"

												Luftrausers is one of those great games that you start playing and then suddenly realise it's 3am and you should probably be in bed. Deceptively simple but brilliantly hard and never feels like it's punishing you for a simple mistake.			"

Product received for free
												Luftrausers is a game where you fly around in a plane that can do crazy maneuvers and shoot enemies until you die. Pretty simple, pretty hectic gameplay, pretty insane, and on that note, insanely fun to play.The gameplay is controled with 4 buttons; left, right, boost and fire. These buttons can be configured to your liking in the options menu, and you can even play with a gamepad. The goal of the game is to eliminate as many enemies as you can before you get shot down. Fortunately, you don't die in one hit; instead, the game makes a shaded circle around your plane indicating your health. The closer said circle is to your plane, the lower your health. You can recover health by simply not firing, but this means you'd potentially lose any scoring combos you had going, encouraging high-risk, high-reward gameplay while not penalizing you for playing it safe. The missions (i.e. subquests that unlock parts for your Luftrauser) start out simple, but quickly get tedious, annoying and often luck-based; as such, I would not recommend this game for hardcore completionists. However, it's fairly easy to unlock all ship parts relatively quickly (except for the final ultimate Luftrauser obtained from 100% mission completion), allowing for flexible gameplay that can suit your playing style. In conclusion, Luftrausers is a fast-paced aerial shootout that only loses its fun value if you focus more on completing the missions for achievements rather than obliterating every enemy you see.

												It's an diverting arcade-style dogfighting game, quite reminiscent of an old school game from the Amiga days called Air 2 Air. However, it is extremely short - each game typically lasts only about 2 minutes and after about half an hour, you'll have unlocked every component and seen every enemy the game has to offer. It's fun while it lasts, but there's nothing particular deep or complex about it. Grab it while it's on sale but I wouldn't pay full price for it.			"

Its a bare-bones version, but it lets you get a sense for the gameplay, which the full retail release expands upon greatly.			"

												Providing 4 buttons to wade through bullets and blitz enemies, this minimalistic arcade dogfighter controls smoothly and simply. The progression of the game involves completing challenges specific to your plane configuration.Definitely a good sale item -- otherwise, LUFTRAUSERS has low content for the money. This has less to do with minimalistic design and more to do with core gameplay. It depends on how much you enjoy arcade games, though this is a quality one.			"

LUFTRAUSERS is a high quality shooter that draws similarities from Asteroids and rogue-like games, but has enough of it's own mechanics and traits to make it's own game. It's red and sepia Gameboy style color makes it look like no other game, it's loadout based soundtrack can diversify your runs, and ""maybe German Nazi"" protaganists gives the game a unique look, without actually making any direct references to Nazi Germany. LUFTRAUSERS is very challenging, but generally fair and has enough content to merit it's retail price.LUFTRAUSERS is a game that I love, but will probably never be good at, thanks to it's propelled ship gameplay that is similar to Asteroids, where instead of directly moving the ship like a twin-stick shooter, you pivot the ship and then thrust when needed while it is in constant free fall. Your ship can take some damage before death and will even heal itself if not hit. You will maintain your current damage if you shoot, so you may want to stop your firing if you are damaged.  You must manage your movement to avoid the sea and cloude damage zone, as well as damage from enemy vessels and weapons. The sea and clouds can damage you, but not directly kill you and eventually force your ship out back in to the playfield - allowing for tactics such as hiding from bullets or running into water craft, since your ship can take some damage depending on your ship customization. An enemy kill increases a score multiplier that will go away after a few seconds after no kills and will max out at 20x. You have one life, and once you die, your run is over. Ship customization is important - it determines how much damage you take, how fast you move, how you shoot, and other interesting abilities such as having an engine that moves by shooting bullets behind you or a Nuke body that destroys multiple enemies when you die on your run. This also changes the music track of your run, as every possible ship combination has it's own unique and/or remixed chiptune-esque track.The game is run based like a rogue-lite, so expect to die often and try different ship configs for potentially more success. However, each ship configuration has it's own goals such as killing a certain amount of enemies, getting a certain amount of points , or just lasting long enough.  Completing goals will unlock more parts for you to mess around with. LUFTRAUSERS is a really solid game, though it's difficulty and maybe it's control scheme hasn't kept a ton of players - my high friend hours played is over 3hrs, and I'm the guy who plays lots of shoot em ups. It's a successful game for Vlambeer and definitely has that ""Devolver Digital quality"", but I feel only hardcore shmup fans and rogue-like fans will get the most value out of it. "

												Luftrauser is a game of physical expression on a two-dimensional plane.Luftrauser reminds me of three of my all-time favorite games from the spatial-awareness-shooty genre:1. In Triplane Turmoil, momentum is everything - you have a narrow band of space between ground and sky, and your job is to occupy that space without getting shot down.  You have to maintain motion to keep from nosediving into the rocks, but a good pilot can stall into the perfect place to shoot their sibling's plane and pull out of the dive without taking damage.2. Crimsonland is top-down bullet hell done right - the ""bullets"" are zombies, and the only long-term way to dodge them is by killing them.  The only way to kill them effectively is to internalize the dodging mechanics so that one half of your brain handles the feet, weaving around the monsters, with the other half of your brain working on aiming in such a way as to make sure that you can keep dodging a few more precious seconds.3. It took me a few hours to catch it, but Luftrauser also reminds me of Uniball.  Uniball is soccer with spaceships, a weird futuristic air hockey viewed from the top down.  As a younger man I dedicated thousands of hours to playing online, but when bored I would even fire up the ""single-player"" mode without any other players, just to practice dribbling and moving.  Momentum is a huge part of the game, and I would practice shooting and passing while constantly spinning, limiting myself to only a few direction keys to force myself to use momentum with perfect efficiency.Luftrauser is an arcade-intense game that asks you to dodge with one brain, use your other brain to shoot speedy bad guys out of the air (with MAX COMBO), and if you're really leet, gives you a spatial playground to express yourself in with all the spinning, stalling, and lasers that my childhood gamer's heart so deeply desires.And also the soundtrack is super-awesome, the aesthetics are gorgeous, and the upgrades and goals are excellently crafted and all that other stuff.  But really, that's just the devs showing off after creating a beautiful Game.			"

												LUFTRAUSERS contains some of the most clever mechanics design and balancing you're likely to have seen for a while. Though there are only really three mechanics (Rotate, thrust, shoot), the way they fit together is stunning; releasing thrust is crucial for avoiding enemy fire, and you can only repair damage when you aren't firing yourself. The end result is both chaotic and balletic. Add to this a superb metagame, where you unlock new parts by completing micro-challenges, and it's hard to recommend this game enough.			"

												Game is just an arcade shooter that doesn't justify the price. There are multiple plane combinations that you can make, the incentive being that different parts have different missions. However, the ""random"" generator is so broken that the game forces you to fly around endlessly, hoping that just the right thing spawns at just the right time. For example, when trying to complete a ship killing mission, almost no ships are spawned, Or when trying to more than one of a specific enemy, the there are never more than 1 available. Combine this with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ random situations like have a sea full of battleships (making flying impossible) and it just feels like the game is broken.Buy this if you like dodging bullets for hours on end, but I would wait for it to drop to under $2 for it to be worth it			"

												I can't avoid getting excited about this game. It was one of the best surprises I got from a Humble Bundle pack. Just randomly installed the game without knowing anything about it and... what's this? It's... it's...It's AMAZING!The controls feel very, very responsive. The gameplay is challenging but perfectly balanced. The amount of weapon/hull/engine choices are really varied but not THAT many, which in my opinion is perfect for the player to get to know and try each of them.The graphics: PERFECT! Simple and minimalistic yet when the screen is full of enemies shooting at you, it looks more than epic.And a huge, huge thumbs-up for the soundtrack, there's a moment when you're dodging bullets and the music kicks in that makes you forget about how ""outdated"" the game might look and places you right inside the cockpit of that monstrous war-machine you're piloting.PLAY THIS GAME NOW!

												LUFTRAUSERS! Sorry, I’ve been told by publishers Devolver Digital that LUFTRAUSERS must only be shouted when mentioned. That is true, because LUFTRAUSERS is something to shout about.LUFTRAUSERS is an indie arcade shooter by developers Vlambeer and the objective of the game is …to shoot everything! Presented as a 2D side-scrolling “wrap around screen” shoot ‘em up similar to old-old school games like 80′s Defender or 90′s Jetstrike your mission is to take to the skies and dodge, dip, dive, duck, dodge and finally BLAST anything that’s BLASTING at you! Enemies will come at you from all directions and in various forms. Ships, carriers and subs take pot shots from the sea and a menagerie of exotic planes (and a Zeppelin!) in the air that will engage in dog fights with you (or try and suicide themselves). As you progress things become more and more hectic to a dizzying degree as the amount going on at once escalates exponentially over 100 levels.Thankfully as you play the game you complete challenges, level up and gain access to more and more aviation unlocks. In total 125 different combinations of weapons, armour and propulsion systems become available which vary wildly from thicker armour (which naturally gives you more protection, but then decreases your speed), guided missiles (that chase your target but only limited to shooting 4 at a time) or the more wacky “engine that fires bullets when you fly”. This diversity is a unique selling point of the game and getting the knack of each loadout and finding the best configuration to suit you or the scenario is key. For example I’m currently sporting an anti-gravity engine to stay in the air with minimal thrust, a laser which is less powerful than the machine gun but allows for constant damage over time and a light chassis to boost myself out of trouble …which is frequent.Another plus is that the controls are minimal. No beefy manual on aeronautics or diploma for aerospace engineering required here lads! For the PC version of the game the up arrow gives you forward thrust, left and right turn you in a clockwise or counter-clockwise movement and ‘X’ fires your gun. Stop firing, and your plane repairs itself. Double tap thrust to give you a boost to (hopefully) speed you out of trouble. Simple? Well doing this under fire and the pressure of needing at times some pin-point precession of Maverick, it’s tough and times quite unforgiving.Visual wise LUFTRAUSERS is presented (for the most part) in a sepia scheme. Images are simple and suitably retro, fitting to its heritage, while audio is catchy and 16-bit. The audible tone to indicate your planes damage and repair progress is a particularly nice touch as it allows players to not have to rely on a visual cue (such as a 100% bar) that could easily be distracting especially when so much is going on.Overall LUFTRAUSERS is another great example of an indie title that I’m sure will be recognised for its achievements. It’s (Warning: Indie Game Cliché Alert!) easy to learn, fun to play, cheap (which is important in this day and age) and has a good re-playability. Recommended if you’re a fan of the genre or have the change and looking for something to while away your time with when not wanting to drop robots from the sky.			"

												Luftrausers is an action game where you fly an aircraft while completing missions and unlocking new parts. The goal is to get the highest score, by avoiding incoming rockets, planes and bullets. Kill enough enemies in one combo or reach a certain score and you'll unlock new parts for your aircraft. These parts might just help you get an even higher score. The parts are finely tuned and expertly balanced, so for example, increasing your damage might just make your aircraft fly/manoeuvre slower. You have to take things like that into account before taking off. You can adjust your engine, your weapon and your body and there are plenty of parts to unlock and use. Luftrausers is a fun game with some good music that's probably best played in smaller sessions.[Rating: 77/100]			"

												Luftrausers is the delightful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of Top Gun and Asteroids.At it's core it's a game where you fly a customizable plane and shoot down other planes and sink battleships, with the occasional blimp if you're aptly skilled.This next installment in from the indie powerhouse, Vlambeer, offers everything that they specialize in; pure high octane action and a childlike sense of amazement. As you rocket into the clouds with the hordes of enemy aces behind you, the engines on your plane cut as you begin to turn to face your oponents, but this is no accident. You push the throttle to the limit and fire your high powered laser beam cutting swathes through the sky. Fixated on the visceral and aerial carnage that encompasses your field of view, you pull out of your dive slicing the enemies to scrap with your custom bladed hull. All of this took place in a timespan of about 10 seconds, welcome to Luftrausers.The music done by the amazingly talented Jukio Kallio (Kozilek) sets the tone for the aeronautical carnage, every different part for your plane (over 100 different combinations by the way) creates a new soundtrack for you to enter the danger zone to. Luftrausers is really damn good and for $9.99, an absolute steal and must have for any armchair adrenaline junkies.I would write more about the game, but I want to go back to playing it. Do yourselves a favor and pick up Luftrausers Raus/10			"

The gameplay is simple but mastering the controls, sound cues, and getting all the achievements - is quite difficult. I would recommend a controller.

												LUFTRAUSERS is a good little shmup where you play a perenially outmatched dieselpunk fighter pilot in a series of sea battles. Tense gameplay with tight controls, heavy replayability, a gorgeous aesthetic, and awesome music combine to make a great experience overall. I don't usually care for bullet hell, but this game pulls it off with enough style that I made an exception.The only problem is that the game is partially centered around completing 'missions' which usually involve destroying a certain enemy, or a number of certain enemies. It becomes a problem when the randomized enemy spawning doesn't give you enough of them, or doesn't give you enough weaker enemies to combo. It doesn't quite shoot the game down, but it's a slight blemish.It also strikes me that the aesthetic's slight harkening towards the stylings of Nazi Germany, not to mention the theme of Glorious Combat™, might not sit well with everyone. It's nothing major, and the game usually looks starkly beautiful, so make your purchasing decision accordingly.At the very least, in short sessions it's a good timewaster. I especially recommend it to bullet hell fans who play nothing but Touhou and other games with anime girls who possess planet-destroying magical powers. You need some IRON in your diet.			"

												Able to played as an ace German pilot during WWII.Shoot laser weapons and able to fire homing missiles during WWII.When shot down, you drop a massive nuke that kills everything on the map.It is more like you are the boss and the boss itself is more like the player.In the end, it is a really fun game and it is a great time killer.

												Oh Luftrausers, how I love thee. Free flying arcade-style bullet hell game with lots of customizable aircraft parts to keep you trying different combinations until you hit that sweet spot. There's countless combinations that will effect your combat style and even the sound track. 8bit graphics, marching music with thumping bass to keep you inspired while you fight off hordes of baddies with your super-advanced machine. The game scales up in difficulty the better you do and presents many challenges for endless replay value. I've dumped about ten hours into this game, even though there is only one map, and still haven't come close to completing it. I consider this a ""must-have"" for the genre.			"

												It's really one of the few indie games that I think is overrated. The combat loses its luster after 10-15  minutes of playtime even with the varied weapons. Also, the system they have set up is not very intriguing or enticing toward investing more time than about 2-4 hours. You just keep going until the amount of guys on the screen is overwhleming and hope that when you die you've done some stuff you haven't before. That's it. That is literally the game. Overral I'd say 2/5, with the main appeal being the art-house WWI persepctive of a 2-d plane game. I got this for 6-7 $ and I'd say that along with Ultionus: A Poor Single Play DOS Game, it is one of the disappointments of the spring `14 indie releases and I wouldnt buy unless it's < 2$.			"

												LUFTRAUSERS or also know as ""LoveTrousers"" is a Sudo2d sidescroller (everything is actually rendered 3D made to look like 2d pixel art). In this game you fly a plane which I can only be assume to be consdier a Rauser. Durring your time in the game you will encounter many enimies and will be constantly outnumber and outguned. But there is no need to worry, thanks to nutty Sciencetist on your base ship your Rauser not only a litteral terror of the skies but also has the ablity to heal  yourslef when not fireing your main gun.          If you look up gameplay of this game what you see is pretty much all your getting. Flying over an ocen and shooting up your foes but you do have the option to unlock various things that will change up and give you incentive to keep playing.  The 1st thing that might intrest you is that you unlock parts of 3 interchangable catagories. Gun/Body/Engine. Each one of these catagories have a total of about 6 parts (I think) with the 6th of each catagory being an absolute grind of mental and pysical will to optain.    Each part is tied to its own Soundline for the game main soundtrack, which means each design you have will result in a slight variant of the theme which is pretty cool IMOAlso Each set of parts are given its own individual name (Which is around 6x6x6=216 names if you count up all the cobination)  The 2nd thing that might intrest you that the game has many color plannets presets which you unlock via the missions attach to each part (Makes the game look completly diffrent for better or worse).    Before I forget each part is tied to a mission of goal to achieve durring you run which leads to the general idea of more stuff and maybe a next mission if havn't completed a part's misson. The game will hold back on giving you more missions when you hit a roadblock which ussusally involves killing a certain enemy unit. The 3rd thing that might intrest you with this game is that the matches themselves are very quick (around 3-7 mins depending on mode and skill). Which makes it a perfect game to just play a match to put down before you need to go BUT there is an issue with this game being extremly addicting as you get into it. Be sure to watch the clock while you're playing because on more than 1 occasion I played for hours non-stop untill it was 5am in the morning or I began to develope an headacheIf there is an issue with this game, its the screen clutter when♥♥♥♥♥♥really starts blowing up all around you. (The exact time you whound't want to lose sight of where you are in the mess of hell and fire). The game is also at unchangable 30fps which isn't a problem overall while playing but I'm not sure if the visuals would be smoother if it was set to something higher.Overall I think its a good game to grab around the $5 mark. A game meant for people who like difficult skill-base rouge-likes, intresting meachnics and a great soundtrack that changes with the game and how low your Rauser life goes. Although a little bare overall when it comes to actually playing wize, the progression is slow enough with your unlocks and skill to give you a good bit a fun for a decently long while. "

												I got this one in a Humble Bundle, so I'm gonna try to be objective.  TRY.  Here we go...    I get the whole ""retro"" thing, I really do...up to a reasonable point.  I thought both Lone Survivor and Hotline Miami were very smart, resourceful games in their own ways...games which took their pixel-y limitations and arguably turned them into not only positives, but true aesthetic ""decisions"".  But does anybody really want or ""need"" a 2D shoot-'em-up THIS primitive and THIS ugly in this day and age?  I was at least expecting some interesting (read: semi-realistic) physics, but you literally just go up and down and in and out of the water (did real planes ever actually do this?) and perpetually hold down the fire button, 'cause frankly there doesn't seem much point in ever letting go out of it.  In fact I swear - and this may just be deluded childhood memories - but I honestly could swear that ASTEROIDS had more compelling physics than this.  And am I wrong, but do we basically see all there is to see in the first few minutes of gameplay?      I'm honestly just bemused, more than anything.  But a quick glance at the overwhelmingly positive Steam reviews and a Metascore of EIGHTY - count 'em and weep, mother♥♥♥♥in' EIGHTY ya'll - suggests that I just don't know my shooters from my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and should probably just keep my unenlightened, fool mouth shut.  Maybe I just outgrew games this simplistic and primal when I was in my single digits, who knows...so in the interests of being open-minded, I'll just say...if it's a truly, defiantly ""old-school"" 2D shooter you're looking for, like the type you'd feed twenty cent coins into in the early 80s, then you may well find something to love here.  Me, I'm kinda glad video games have evolved past the stone age, even if the likes of Bioshock Infinite have arguably gone a little too far in the OPPOSITE direction.  Each to their own... Verdict: 4.5/10.			"

It seems reminiscent of older games I grew up on like Raptor or 1942 but this is modern and the responsiveness of controls I wish I had in those older games.  The only con I've found so far is that when you're done playing, there's no quit game button so have to alt+tab out to close the game.  That aside, it's an easy game to learn, and easy to get into that one-more-level addictiveness.			"

Not only does the game feel great, but the meta-game of customizing your plane and finding the components that work best with your play style is thoroughly enjoyable. I've been looking forward to this game for a year now, and it was well worth the wait. If you're a fan of arcade-like ""pick up and play"" style games, you really need to play this game.			"

												Luftrausers is surprisingly good. Incredibly good, even. You start it up for the first time and within a minute of playing it you'll be smiling broadly and wishing that every game could be as viscerally enjoyable as this one.The controls have been honed to perfection. Simply flying around with the aircraft (is it called a Luftrauser?) is pleasing to the senses. Throughout the game, you'll unlock new parts that you can use to customize your plane, which come with both benefits and drawbacks. Here's where the true brilliance of the design comes in. Each part of the ship has its own instruments to add to the song that plays during the game, and each part has multiple missions that you can only complete with that part. So each combination of parts - and there's at least a hundred - offers a unique experience. To top it all off, every aircraft you can possibly assemble with these components has its own nickname, such as the Nightmare, the Tuberauser, or my current favorite, the Warturtle.It's cheap, it's intense, and it's extremely challenging. If you like shooters of any kind, consider Luftrausers a solid purchase.			"

Fans of Vlambeer likely already bought it, but for those of you who don't know who those guys are:LUFTRAUSERS is Time Pilot on a drug-fueled bender that gets really, really brutal from the get-go. The ship customization offers some interesting combinations that can suit playstyles that seem overpowered as all hell, but the catch is that there are times that they all feel overpowered as all hell.

												Vlambeer's modern take on arcade games like Asteroids and Time Pilot but with the added challenge of constantly fighting gravity and stalling out your plane. The game is full of bullet hell and the numerous opponents are quite good at shooting you down if you are flying in a predictable flight path. Sessions usually last between 30 second to 5 minutes if you can last that long. The acomplishment of going for bigger and better scores is what keeps me saying ""Just 5 more minutes"". In the early stages of challenge hunting you are rewarded with new parts that you can customize each rauser. And each combination of airplane parts has it's very own nickname. If you can manage to complete all challenges then you are rewarded a very special experimental aircraft. I have yet to accomplish this since it would seem the rogue-like part of very specific enemies appearing has kept me from finishing said challenges. My ownly gripes with the game are boats that double down when you can't tell them apart whilst they shoot double bullets at you. I disliked some glitches where I was not awarded the challenge (e.g. kill a blimp), because the blimp hadn't fully dropped from the above clouds; My biggest gripe being the problem that the enemies you are seeking to kill to win challenges will appear 1 out of 50 during applied challenge, but choose a different challenge and I seem to get them as often as 1 out of 20 for some reason. (specifically ""kill a -CLASSIFIED no. 1- (0/1))I would also add a personal plug that while i only put 20 hours on my steam account, I have this game for my PSVITA and I felt it was the best portable game to have around when you just want to zone out. My best scores are there, but I have yet to break the 40K score mark.   "

												Another fantastic arcade game from Vlambeer, and this time with enough customization to keep people interested even if they don't generally like the arcade-y style. Almost every ship combination can completely change how you play, and the music in the background also changes with what you choose, meaning that you can even personalize what your favorite ship+soundtrack combo is. The controls are absolutely fantastic, and make you look and feel like an expert pilot if you can use them right.I definitely recommend this one.			"

												To this day, this is one of the best games that I have installed on my computer. Everything from the design of the planes down to the design of the game is entirely satisfying. The flying feels tight and responsive, and adjusts itself well to each of the different flight styles it offers. Every choice in plane structure feels like a new and unique way to play. The music just straight up feels nice. It's just damn good to be a rauser.			"

												Most awesome Arcade game I ever played!- hard difficulty- many missions to accomplish- great variety of gameplay due to ship customization- pure skill needed. The key of success lies in manoeuvring your ship and this is due to gravity physics and a bullet hell not that easy.Recommended for everybody who likes hard arcade shoot em ups where you need skill and wits.

												This game is good, and I would recommend it, but: Caveat Emptor.This game isn't for everyone.The game is highly reminiscent of arcade titles, where you die easily and quickly, but is addictive and fun. The price tag is the biggest problem - how much do you value arcade games? I like this game enough I bought it twice (once on Steam, once on PS Vita), but I don't think everyone would. Look up ""Luftrauser"" (no S at the end) and play the original version. Watch some gameplay. If you like it, buy it. Maybe wait for a sale.It's another cool and refreshing Vlambeer game.Edit: This game has, in my opinion, less replay value than Nuclear Throne. Maybe go for that instead. I have over 25 hours in it, and only about 12 collectively (both ports) on this game.			"

												Frenetic, exciting and full of ""oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ did you see what just happened there?"" moments in the heat of combat. I can't stop playing it, which is a sign that Vlambeer is still putting out fantastic games. Fans of Vlambeer likely already bought it, but for those of you who don't know who those guys are:LUFTRAUSERS is Time Pilot on a drug-fueled bender that gets really, really brutal from the get-go. The ship customization offers some interesting combinations that can suit playstyles that seem overpowered as all hell, but the catch is that there are times that they all feel overpowered as all hell. I highly recommend it.			"

Loads of fun!Luftrausers is a really fun fast pace challenge that takes the side-scrolling flight shooters to a different place.  The player is given a tone of different combinations to try out and use to achieve the highest score possible.  With that being said, this game is a pure and simple game.  No story, no voice acting, no nothin'.  Once the game is selected from steam, the player will be in the air shooting other planes down within seconds.Once all or most of the challenges are completed, the game becomes quick and easy entertainment before work -- solid title.

												+Not using your thrusters is just as important as using it. You get significantly more turn control when your engine is stalled, allowing precision aiming and redirecting your movement in ways that defy realistic physics in favor of exciting gameplay.+The health system is interwoven into the weapons system. Pausing your onslaught lets you recover your health pool. The game plays alerts and puts an iris-in on the player when health is at dangerous levels.+Working together, there's an interesting and frantic dynamic of healing, attacking, moving, and steering that I've not seen any other game pull off.+Your planes, the 'Rausers', are customizable with the parts available. Mix and match for 126 different combinations that suit your style. Each of them even has their own name.+Soundtrack is dynamic. Each different Rauser part introduces a different melody, percussion, or bass-line to the song that is constructed for your session.+Camera is pretty solid at keeping itself oriented around what the player wants to be looking at based on where their Rauser is pointed and their current velocity.*Artstyle is minimalist, but minimalist is perfect for this type of game as it keeps visual noise on the down low so it can bombard your eyeballs with waves of bullets and enemy planes.-Scoring and combo system is heavily conflicting with the random enemy spawns. High-scores are incredibly dependent on a particularly rare enemy unit to spawn and then subsequently dispatched with a x20 multiplier.Overall, it's an incredibly well-tuned and fast-paced experience that is immensely satisfying to pick up and play for a few rounds, just don't go in expecting to be plugging hours away doing score attack as the numbers are ultimately meaningless beyond a certain point.

												LuftRausers is basically a really focused arcade game. It doesn't do a lot, but what it does, it does really well. The game plays kind of like Asteroids except there is constant gravity pulling you towards the water. The customizable Rauser is pretty cool. You pick a weapon system such as a machinegun, a continuous laser, spread shot that pushes you back, homing missiles, etc), a body (high health but low agility, you take no ramming damage but have little health, drops bombs but slow health regen, etc) and an engine (heavy thrust but poor turning while thrusting, near anti-gravity, no damage entering the water, etc) and then you just fight nonstop waves of enemies trying to rack up as many points as possible. Each combination has its own nickname and each part has little achievements tied to it too.The gameplay is pretty frantic, as the sky quickly becomes filled with enemies and bullets. Thankfully you can take a decent amount of punishment before dying (unless you're using the melee part) and you regenerate health whenever you're not shooting.The variety you can get while building your Rauser is impressive, a few of the builds I liked was a Rauser equipped with a heavy, slow firing cannon, the melee body, and the water engine. I'd just dive bomb ships and fire the cannon just before I rammed the ship and plunged into the water, even the battleships can't take too many hits from that. Of course, if I timed it wrong I'd fly right into their gunfire and be blown apart (melee body can take 2 maybe 3 hits from full before dying). Another cool Rauser I had success with was the Beam Laser, Bomb Body, and ""Original"" balanced engine. I'd just zip around dodging enemies and bullets and slice ships and planes to ribbons.You don't have to grind too much for the parts either, I think I've basically unlocked almost all the parts (except one special one for each section I think, the padlock symbol looks different than the one for the rest I unlocked) in only about 2 hours of play I'd say. One additional neat thing is that the music changes depending on your parts selection. Its the same basic theme every time, but different parts use different ""instruments"". The music is pretty good too, IMO, though it might become repetitive quickly for some.Only managed to reach (what I assume) is the ""Boss"" A massive war zeppelin once. The game is quite difficult. I could see this being an actual arcade game from 15-20 years ago easily, though given how difficult it is, it better have had extra lives per credit. Either way it would've munched my quarters ♥♥♥♥ing fast. This thing is fun.TL:DR Luftrausers Owns. Awesome Arcade style game, great gameplay, cool music, buy it.			"

												Holy mother of balls, this game. It is absolutely bonkers and I hightly recommend it to all you adrenaline junkies out there looking for a quick but hardcore game.The price is a bit much for something so simple, but I think it's worth it, especially once you unlock the hilariously impractical surprise at the end. The missions have incredible variety and do take some strategy to conquer with regards to which parts you choose and, as if 'normal' mode wasn't hard enough, they've included a secret extra hard mode that you unlock after killing a blimp, which are ridiculously hard to destroy, I might add, though not impossible.The difficulty does get frustrating at times when you're completing objectives or trying to eclipse your highscore, but honestly, the sheer fun of feeling like an ace fighter pilot overshadows it.It is an extremely simple but incredibly fun game with tons of replayability, and of course there's the elation you feel when you get a new high score or complete the challenging objectives.

												Luftrausers is a 2D Arcade-Style Bullet Hell Shooter. You take control of a single fighter jet, holding off thousand of planes, jets, boats, and submarines until you die. It's essentially achieving the highest score you possibly can. This game isn't easy, it's hard, but mastering is where the game shines.This game is simple at it's core, but it's filled to the brim with fast paced, non-stop action, sure to get your adrenaline going. You don't fly this thing normally. You can turn it left, right, and accelerate by holding up. This means you can keep your fighter in the air for a good amount of time if you take advantage of the momentum. For enemies, you have your simple planes and boats, but stronger variants pop up, like battleships that have massive HP and fire a barrage of bullets, or aces in the sky with very accurate aim. You need to keep your wits about you, so dodge and shoot your way to victory. Shooting isn't the only way to kill enemies either, you can also ram into enemies for some massive damage, as the expense of losing health quickly. Your health is regenerative, so the way you recover it is to simply not fire your weapon.However, the best part about this game is the customization. There are literally 125 ways to build your fighter. You can change the weapon, body, and engine, each with their own perks and disadvantages. This makes the game accustomed to have so many different play styles, so you can see which one fits to your choosing. You can have a powerful tank with a cannon and heavy armor, have a super fast engine with a laser beam for quick aiming, or you can have a kamikaze style fighter with massive impact damage and explode spectacularly upon death.With all these parts, also come missions for each individual part. This gives the player the chance to try out new pieces and accomplish a goal while doing so. Think of it as a reward for trying new things, and testing your skils. It extends replay ability as well.After you've messed around in normal mode long enough, there's another mode called SFMT, which is essentially hard mode. Battleships, Aces, and more enemies spawn right at the beginning, and it's as frantic as you can imagine, and you WILL die quickly. If you've mastered normal mode, try your skills at SFMT, and see how long you can survive Hell.Overall, Luftrausers is an incredible arcade style game with blood pumping action that never stops with so much customization in one package. This game is definitely worth full price, and you'll have an awesome time if you enjoy a good challenge.			"

												Fun to play. Difficult to master. Extremely difficult to complete.Luftrausers is a retro-styled arcade shooter that controls well and keeps the upgrades unlocking at a nice pace. These upgrades are a good selection of weapons, flight styles and armour/mods. It's enjoyable trying them all out too see how they work and how they can adapt your play style and each of the 125 combinations has it's own unique aircraft name ... a really nice touch.Your enemies range from enemy aircraft with different weapons (I hate the enemy aces armed with lasers, you will too), ships, submarines and the main objective to completing the game ... the ""Blimp"".As I said before, the game is challenging and very difficult to complete, but it never seems to approach a rage inducing, keyboard smashing, joypad chucking level of difficulty. I think this is because of the game's ""One level only, quick, short games"" design.I liked it immensely. If you're a fan of side scrolling shoot-em-ups, you probably will too.8/10 Marked down from 9/10 for not having any multi-player capabilities. Hopefully they'll address that in a sequel.			"

												Painfully short. I unlocked everything in under 2 hours. The rest of my time playing was spent trying to find and destroy a blimp, which only appeared once in my playthroughs.The music that blares through the speakers every time you die is ridiculously repetitive, almost unbearable. The fact that it's louder than anything else in the game is also rather unpleasant. Much has been said about the in-game music here, but the in-between sessions music ruins the audio.Add to that the lack of any real graphical options. For some reason, my game has a ton of alias in it. Unfortunate.			"

YouTube™ Video: LUFTRAUSERS ✭ As Bland As Its Colour Scheme 

			Views: 231		

			I really soured on this game at first, but funnily enough when I came to make this video I mellowed on it. I still don't believe it's worth the price point, but if you like shoot-'em-ups I guess you...		

For me, LUFTRAUSERS is a game that exemplifies the current 'indie craze' of being lauded for artistic style in place of actual content. In a way it's a sign of change (and in a good way at that) that these types of games are getting main stream recognition, but in another lifetime it feels like LUFTRAUSERS would have just been a flash game, and would have been free.LUFTRAUSERS gimmick is its sepia hued. That’s basically it. Though you can unlock different hues, I never played with them, they looked awful.Yes the world has moved on from flash portals and those kinds of games now have a new home called the App Store. So yes, it’s not outrageous in itself to be charging money for this style of game, but I do have issue with the amount. If I'd paid around £2, like many a game on the App Store, I'd have played it and walked away and felt like I got my money's worth, not saying I would have enjoyed it more, but I wouldn't have felt like I should have expected more. At £6.99 I feel like I should be getting more of a return for my investment.All the incentive to play is; score attack and fulfilling objectives like ‘kill x of y’ or ‘get a score of z’, but that doesn’t really change how you’re going to play the game, you were going to be doing those anyway. The score attack or the objectives (I was never really clear which) unlock equipment for your plane, and while the game may boast more than 125 combinations, there's little incentive from the game itself to mix it up, just your own desire to experiment. Also, the later upgrades suck for the most part, for example the 'homing' missiles need a lot of coaxing to avoid them just nose diving into the sea.And that's fundamentally my problem; the game isn't much fun. You play within a single area, that appears to loop, that's quite tall, though enemy boats at the bottom can shoot you at the top of it, so flying to the top is only a disadvantage to yourself. The controls are simple, (though menu navigation is a chore as the button that accesses a given menu changes depending on current screen) yet somehow it never feels like you have complete control, it's only possible to make fine changes to direction, or complete changes, it feels like there's no mid ground, which makes trying to manoeuvre a pain. There are a number of different enemies, but there’s a gradual build up to the stronger enemies that the game follows, so in a game where you're expected to die a lot, you're going to see the same few over, and over, and over. Also, get used to that background music, you're going to be hearing that same small part of it every time too...The game is certainly functional, and I guess that’s something to praise with the modern indie craze, a game being released in a non 'early access' form, but there's so little content provided and a generic shoot-'em-up experience at best.

												(7.5/10)The arcade action is just about what you could have hoped for, along with some decent strategy and personal skill progress via the various different upgrade combinations.The aesthetic is also incredibly cool and sort of that modernist retro that has been the rage lately.  Both visually and musically the tone is set quite richly and its hard not to enjoy all the subtle little touches like the main theme song as you play changing based on how you configured your fighter.Its not necessarily spilling over with replayability.  The overall game is a bit fun but progress is rather limited in the 'finish one of these several goals' task completion.  Once you have finished all of the base tasks, there is another layer of incredibly ridiculously hard that opens up but its honestly *so* over the top its more worth trying for a few laughs at its utter futility.The one last comment is that honestly I was not a fan of the controls *at all*.  While the basic flight mechanic is quite well executed, the game screams out for really solid gamepad support, and it was just not quite there.  While basic gamepad control is possible, its not very customizable and the configurations that you are presented with simply didn't work that well for me.  I ended up setting the gamepad down and just using the keyboard because in the end it was easier to manage.			"

												LUFTRAUSERS is a delightful mix of classic arcade shooter action and modern sensibilities, Atari style graphics with a high-res flourish and a World War II Nazi-chic aesthetic, all set to a thumping, crunchy, retro-neue military soundtrack. But above all, this game is challenging and fun. While the controls are simple, they take time to master, yet they're intuitive enough to feel natural. Each enemy has its own unique challenges to overcome, and choas reigns after a few minutes of sustained gameplay as the screen fills with planes, jets, ships and bullets, with a few boss enemies to overcome beside. Whats more, the game has near-endless replayability, as accumulating points and passing in-game missions rewards you with parts to customize your Rauser with for different gameplay styles. If you're a fan of shoot-'em-ups, I would highly recommended this game.			"

												BEST CONTROLS EVER This is a fun game that feels great, you can pull of insane moves and dodges, all with a very simple control system that feels just right and you just feel like a badass when you triple flip to kill an ace, shoot down a jet and pull up in time to see your thrusters reflect in the water. And pulling this off is quite easy but still feels satisfying every time, adding to this is the customization of the planes which all offer their unique playstyles and cool soundtracks. For fans of bullet hell cahos and tryhards there is the insane SFMT mode which starts everything at the highest difficulty, it even has an achievment to survive for the first 15 seconds or so and it is brutal. If you are just looking for a little fun or want to play a challenging bullet hell game then this is for you.			"

												With only two achievements left to get and about 3 hours in... I'm conflicted. The game is fun, handles great, and the hard mode is exactly that. The missions range from simple to ""You expect me to do what?!"", but I have a hard time recommending a game that has taken me nearly 3 hours to complete (It'll probably take 5 to finish all the missions). I was hoping for more after the airship. More ridiculous crafts to shoot out of the sky, a wider variety ships to kersplunk, and prehaps something other than the sky and the water. I had hopes that weren't realized, which happens in a lot of games I play, but this one hurt.  Everything about this game makes me want more, but there isn't any more. I've gone and experienced the whole thing in one sitting.So with all that personal hope aside, I do recommend this game if: You're fine with the understanding that there isn't a whole new world out there after you beat the first real challenging thing in the game.You want a game you can pick up for a little at a time and chip away at increasingly harder challenges (missions).You want a solid shooty experience that's refreshing, fast paced, and hilarious.You love flying tiny aircraft with huge guns!

												Fast paced high flying action! Luftrausers is a very addictive but hard game that always makes you say ""just one more time!"" But it is much more than that. It is simple to learn but hard to master. The controls are very simple which makes the game very deceiving thinking that you are in for a cake-walk, but ends up with a hail storm of bullets flying infront of your Rauser! Also on top of everything else you can customize your rauser with different engines,bodys and fireing mechanisms. I highly reconmend Luftrausers for any body who is looking for a fun time waster! Oh and you can stall your engines do a 180 and destroy all the enemies behind you :D			"

												This is an extremely fun shoot 'em up that's as challenging as it is rewarding. There are next to no frills in terms of extra content, but the game is strong enough to stand on its own.The objective is obvious enough, so there's no time wasted on tutorials. You may take a few runs fumbling around trying to  steer your craft and dying annoying deaths, but when you get the hang of it the game feels almost perfect.Luftrausers really nailed it with the scoring system. As you kill enemies your combo increases, allowing you to stack phat multipliers to add to your score. The multiplier only lasts for a couple of seconds though, so there's always a rush to hunt and kill enemies to keep it going. Also, your health recovers by ceasing fire. You'll frequently run into tense situations where you halt your recovery in an attempt to keep your combo alive.The sense of progression is well done, too. As you get a better grip of the controls, you'll find yourself doing wacky maneuvers without even thinking about it. What was once a sloppy death from a couple bullets and crashing into a battleship turns into a delicate weaving throughout the barrage and skirting off the top of the boat. Clumsily trying to position yourself to get a shot at an Ace craft before it pulls off turns into charging at them head on with guns blazing and boosting through before they can even let loose their barrage. It all adds to up a thrilling sensation as you dance through storms of bullets and lay waste to all opposition.So yeah, highly recommended. Happy rausing.			"

												Luftrausers is an incredibly fun game which instantly throws you into the air to sink or swim. It's simple enough to grasp with minimal controls and easy to latch onto goal; if it moves, blow it up. It's a shooter, it's an action game, it's fun, and it'll have you hooked. If this doesn't make you want to be a Rauser pilot, I don't know what will.Don't be fooled by the screenshots, this game is HARD. It appears easy, but it gets difficult fast. But unlike other games where ramped difficulty makes people want to give up after the first few tries, Luftrausers brings you back for more and more, giving you more options, more choices, more ways to kick some butt and blow stuff up. If you like a challenge, this game is definitely for you. You will spend hours with this.What makes this game so delightfully addictive is it's simple elegance. It doesn't need to be decked out and fancy to be a really fun and difficult game. It's satisfying to achieve goals and relaxing if you want to kick back and blow off steam. The action is non-stop, the music is great, and the graphics are an awesome throw back to the days of Space Invaders. You become a part of this incredible world full of bullets and fire, and you will love every second of it. It's worth every cent, and for $9.99, you'd be crazy to pass up a game like this.			"

												Obligatory header to the review: I focus on four primary areas whenever I review a game: gameplay, story, graphics, and sound/audio/general things that go into your earholes. Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively. Gameplay: Vlambeer has always been good at creating really simple yet excellently controlling games, and Luftrausers is certainly no exception. Essentially, you have four buttons: acceleration, boost left and right, and fire. You do have a ""health meter,"" which is represented by a white circle closing in on you before you eventually die, which can be replenished by letting go of the fire button and not getting hit for a little bit. Speaking of death, this game is pretty tough. It certainly has that arcade style quarter munching level of difficulty. However, death is only a minor setback, as it only takes two to three seconds to get back into the action after dying. An average run won't last you much longer than two or three minutes, though. Another aspect of this game is the customizable ship parts. You can get up to six guns, engines, and bodies, each with their own respective weaknesses and strengths. It is these parts, as well as the challenges associated with each and every part, that make Luftrausers much more than the simple arcade shooter I thought it was when I first saw it. There is actually a remarkable amount of depth for such a seemingly simple shooter (yes, that alliteration was intentional). My biggest complaint about the game - and it may seem minor, but it caused God knows how many deaths - is that every time you get hit, there is a frame or two of pausing. It stacks up whenever you're trying to manoeuvre your way through a hail of bullets. This is probably an intentional programming thing, as a ninety-some-megabyte game should not lag an i5-3470. Other than that, I really don't have any big time complaints. Also, SFMT mode made me cry in the corner out of sheer terror. I haven't completed all of the missions yet, and I still haven't unlocked the [Classified] as of the time of writing this, but I've gotten far enough into the game that I feel that I am able to give it fair enough of a review. For only one ""big small"" quibble, I give the gameplay in this game a 9/10.Story: This is one of the times where I don't bother to review the game on story, since there really isn't any. Instead, I'll just skip on to the graphics and not factor in a score for story into the final score.Graphics: One of the great things about applying a minimalist aesthetic is that it allows the artist to apply all sorts of subtle touches, and that's what makes this game great: it's filled to the brim with subtle touches that make it just great. For instance, when you're coming in over the water, how hard you're coming in affects the wake.Another subtle touch is the flames that come off of the aces whenever they are at low health. Overall, the pixel art in this game is just fantastic, and is definitely a good example of how to do considerable things with a minimal color pallete. For graphics, I'll give it a 5/5, 'cuz it just looks great.Music: At its most basic level, there's only two songs in the game (the menu song and the combat song). However, in reality, there's about 126 songs in the game. How I can come up with that number is that there are 125 different ship combinations. Each part adds a different element to the base song. It's not a subtle thing, either; you can tell whenever a part you've put on changes the song, and all of them add pretty cool touches to the song. If you're switching parts every now and then, you most certainly won't get tired of the soundtrack. I know I didn't, and that's why I'm giving it a 5/5 for the incredibly dynamic soundtrack.Overall rating: 9/5/5; 9.5/10. I can see why this game took so long to develop: there's a remarkable amount of polish to this game. Also, if you think $10 is too much, don't. The game really is worth the money (even more so on sale). It's very playable  and has that ""I need to kill ten minutes so here's a game"" appeal.			"

I spent a lot of time offline playing this game (in school, haha) and I loved every second of it. If you don't have this game, buy it. Worth $10 and I highly recomend it.

												Luftrausers is an incredibly fun game which instantly throws you into the air to sink or swim. It's simple enough to grasp with minimal controls and easy to latch onto goal; if it moves, blow it up. It's a shooter, it's an action game, it's fun, and it'll have you hooked. If this doesn't make you want to be a Rauser pilot, I don't know what will.Don't be fooled by the screenshots, this game is HARD. It appears easy, but it gets difficult fast. But unlike other games where ramped difficulty makes people want to give up after the first few tries, Luftrausers brings you back for more and more, giving you more options, more choices, more ways to kick some butt and blow stuff up. If you like a challenge, this game is definitely for you. You will spend hours with this.What makes this game so delightfully addictive is it's simple elegance. It doesn't need to be decked out and fancy to be a really fun and difficult game. It's satisfying to achieve goals and relaxing if you want to kick back and blow off steam. The action is non-stop, the music is great, and the graphics are an awesome throw back to the days of Space Invaders. You become a part of this incredible world full of bullets and fire, and you will love every second of it. It's worth every cent, and for $9.99, you'd be crazy to pass up a game like this.			"

												An excellent game !Pure arcade game. The controls are simple, and you should feel immediately taken by the frantic gameplay. Each play will last between 10s and a few minutes, depending on how good you are at dodging the endless streams of enemies bullets. But of course, you will want more, and in a few seconds you will be up in the air again trying to beat your previous score.You might think that this wouldn't be fun for hours if you're not into ""getting the highscore"" mentality. But Vlambeer (the studio who developped LUFTRAUSERS), manage to take that simple idea of an arcade dogfighting game, and add something more. Your plane has 3 parts (Gun, Body, Engine) which you will soon be able to modify. There are 5 different parts of each type, which allow for lots of variation. More importantly, most parts are ""side-grades"", which mean unlocked parts are not better, but different than the original parts. Each part requires you to adapt your gameplay, and will offer different strengths and weaknesses.To encourage you to try all the parts, each part is linked to several ""missions"", which are challenges you can accomplish with that part. For example ""Killing 5 different enemies types in a single game"", ""Getting 5000 points in a single game"", ""Kill 150 enemies accross all playthrough"", etc... Theses are not mandatory, but will allow you to unlock other parts and a few other hidden stuff. While trying to perform theses challenges, you will get to understand the different parts better, and find that some suits you better than others. I've often dismissed a specific part as weak, until i tried to complete its missions and figured out how to best use it (which part should go with which, and how to adapt my gameplay to the new plane). My 3 best scores have been with 3 different planes. Also it's very telling that in forum threads asking ""what's the best plane for doing X ?"" all theses answers will vary wildly. There is no ""best"" plane. It's all about personal tastes and how you use each plane. So congratulations to Vlambeer for managing to balance all theses parts together.All of that means that, over the simple arcade gameplay, there is that metagame to try to finish all missions. It may or may not please everybody, but i know it keeps me playing way more than a basic ""aim for the highscore"" game would.It's quite easy to unlock all parts, so no player should frustrated that they lack part, but for hardcore players, unlocking everything is gonna be a true challenge. Achievements stats show that less than 1% of players have managed to finish all missions.			"

												LUFTRAUSERS is a fantastic game. The dogfighting is absolutely brilliant, due to the stalling mechanic, and feels amazing. Doing a quintuple flip before turning on your engines and hitting the water makes you feel like a bada--. The combat is also awesome; the health mechanic makes you stop shooting for five freaking seconds if you want to survive, and poses quite the challenge. It seems a tad overwhelming at first, but you get used to it. You can also unlock loads of parts to alter your game play, and the random mode can be fun as heck.All in all, LUFTRAUSERS is a good game. You should get it.			"

												Wish I could reccomend this game, because it COULD have been great. The controls are responsive and the graphics is nice.The sound and music however is just annoying, which sadly matches gameplay well. Enemy airplanes and boats have a godly aim, that every thing off screen always know your exact position and the bulletspam is awful. The controls are not accurate enough to make it a fun ""bullet-dodge"" game, instead the controls make you feel engaged in duels - but it's not much about that, game is mostly about finding a cheese-tactic in order to scratch another mission off your list.Every combination of gun/ship/boost make you feel crippled with drawbacks - you never feel like you are particularly strong or efficient, you just feel like a slug trying to all-in for a mission clear; die, repeat.Drawbacks on all gear should be adjusted - it makes no sense that EVERYTHING has so strong drawbacks that you ALWAYS feel like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ retard. Want spread-fire? Ok cool, but you can barely shoot upward now because the kickback is so strong that you lose all elevation. Want laser? Sure, but now your aim sucks so you can barely make turns. Want to be able to handle collision? Sure, but now you die from 3 bullets instead. Makes the game feel like a frustrating chose unfortunately.			"

Posted: April 17, 2014
												Obligatory header to the review: I focus on four primary areas whenever I review a game: gameplay, story, graphics, and sound/audio/general things that go into your earholes. Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively. Gameplay: Vlambeer has always been good at creating really simple yet excellently controlling games, and Luftrausers is certainly no exception. Essentially, you have four buttons: acceleration, boost left and right, and fire. You do have a ""health meter,"" which is represented by a white circle closing in on you before you eventually die, which can be replenished by letting go of the fire button and not getting hit for a little bit. Speaking of death, this game is pretty tough. It certainly has that arcade style quarter munching level of difficulty. However, death is only a minor setback, as it only takes two to three seconds to get back into the action after dying. An average run won't last you much longer than two or three minutes, though. Another aspect of this game is the customizable ship parts. You can get up to six guns, engines, and bodies, each with their own respective weaknesses and strengths. It is these parts, as well as the challenges associated with each and every part, that make Luftrausers much more than the simple arcade shooter I thought it was when I first saw it. There is actually a remarkable amount of depth for such a seemingly simple shooter (yes, that alliteration was intentional). My biggest complaint about the game - and it may seem minor, but it caused God knows how many deaths - is that every time you get hit, there is a frame or two of pausing. It stacks up whenever you're trying to manoeuvre your way through a hail of bullets. This is probably an intentional programming thing, as a ninety-some-megabyte game should not lag an i5-3470. Other than that, I really don't have any big time complaints. Also, SFMT mode made me cry in the corner out of sheer terror. I haven't completed all of the missions yet, and I still haven't unlocked the [Classified] as of the time of writing this, but I've gotten far enough into the game that I feel that I am able to give it fair enough of a review. For only one ""big small"" quibble, I give the gameplay in this game a 9/10.Story: This is one of the times where I don't bother to review the game on story, since there really isn't any. Instead, I'll just skip on to the graphics and not factor in a score for story into the final score.Graphics: One of the great things about applying a minimalist aesthetic is that it allows the artist to apply all sorts of subtle touches, and that's what makes this game great: it's filled to the brim with subtle touches that make it just great. For instance, when you're coming in over the water, how hard you're coming in affects the wake.Another subtle touch is the flames that come off of the aces whenever they are at low health. Overall, the pixel art in this game is just fantastic, and is definitely a good example of how to do considerable things with a minimal color pallete. For graphics, I'll give it a 5/5, 'cuz it just looks great.Music: At its most basic level, there's only two songs in the game (the menu song and the combat song). However, in reality, there's about 126 songs in the game. How I can come up with that number is that there are 125 different ship combinations. Each part adds a different element to the base song. It's not a subtle thing, either; you can tell whenever a part you've put on changes the song, and all of them add pretty cool touches to the song. If you're switching parts every now and then, you most certainly won't get tired of the soundtrack. I know I didn't, and that's why I'm giving it a 5/5 for the incredibly dynamic soundtrack.Overall rating: 9/5/5; 9.5/10. I can see why this game took so long to develop: there's a remarkable amount of polish to this game. Also, if you think $10 is too much, don't. The game really is worth the money (even more so on sale). It's very playable  and has that ""I need to kill ten minutes so here's a game"" appeal.			"

It's simple enough to grasp with minimal controls and easy to latch onto goal; if it moves, blow it up. It's a shooter, it's an action game, it's fun, and it'll have you hooked. If this doesn't make you want to be a Rauser pilot, I don't know what will.Don't be fooled by the screenshots, this game is HARD. It appears easy, but it gets difficult fast. But unlike other games where ramped difficulty makes people want to give up after the first few tries, Luftrausers brings you back for more and more, giving you more options, more choices, more ways to kick some butt and blow stuff up. If you like a challenge, this game is definitely for you. You will spend hours with this.What makes this game so delightfully addictive is it's simple elegance. It doesn't need to be decked out and fancy to be a really fun and difficult game. It's satisfying to achieve goals and relaxing if you want to kick back and blow off steam. The action is non-stop, the music is great, and the graphics are an awesome throw back to the days of Space Invaders. You become a part of this incredible world full of bullets and fire, and you will love every second of it. It's worth every cent, and for $9.99, you'd be crazy to pass up a game like this.			"

												This must be the most fun I've had since I gave up my Commodore Amiga. This game just shines in its smooth gameplay even with the limited options it has; a true marvel of design. Plenty of unlockables, plenty of achievements, plenty of variation in how you can construct your plane. Easy to learn, hard to master, hard to stop playing too.Oh yeah: the music is just awesome.

												(7.5/10)The arcade action is just about what you could have hoped for, along with some decent strategy and personal skill progress via the various different upgrade combinations.The aesthetic is also incredibly cool and sort of that modernist retro that has been the rage lately.  Both visually and musically the tone is set quite richly and its hard not to enjoy all the subtle little touches like the main theme song as you play changing based on how you configured your fighter.Its not necessarily spilling over with replayability.  The overall game is a bit fun but progress is rather limited in the 'finish one of these several goals' task completion.  Once you have finished all of the base tasks, there is another layer of incredibly ridiculously hard that opens up but its honestly *so* over the top its more worth trying for a few laughs at its utter futility.The one last comment is that honestly I was not a fan of the controls *at all*.  While the basic flight mechanic is quite well executed, the game screams out for really solid gamepad support, and it was just not quite there.  While basic gamepad control is possible, its not very customizable and the configurations that you are presented with simply didn't work that well for me.  I ended up setting the gamepad down and just using the keyboard because in the end it was easier to manage.			"

												Wish I could reccomend this game, because it COULD have been great. The controls are responsive and the graphics is nice.The sound and music however is just annoying, which sadly matches gameplay well. Enemy airplanes and boats have a godly aim, that every thing off screen always know your exact position and the bulletspam is awful. The controls are not accurate enough to make it a fun ""bullet-dodge"" game, instead the controls make you feel engaged in duels - but it's not much about that, game is mostly about finding a cheese-tactic in order to scratch another mission off your list.Every combination of gun/ship/boost make you feel crippled with drawbacks - you never feel like you are particularly strong or efficient, you just feel like a slug trying to all-in for a mission clear; die, repeat.Drawbacks on all gear should be adjusted - it makes no sense that EVERYTHING has so strong drawbacks that you ALWAYS feel like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ retard. Want spread-fire? Ok cool, but you can barely shoot upward now because the kickback is so strong that you lose all elevation. Want laser? Sure, but now your aim sucks so you can barely make turns. Want to be able to handle collision? Sure, but now you die from 3 bullets instead. Makes the game feel like a frustrating chose unfortunately.			"

												LUFTRAUSERS is a fantastic game. The dogfighting is absolutely brilliant, due to the stalling mechanic, and feels amazing. Doing a quintuple flip before turning on your engines and hitting the water makes you feel like a bada--. The combat is also awesome; the health mechanic makes you stop shooting for five freaking seconds if you want to survive, and poses quite the challenge. It seems a tad overwhelming at first, but you get used to it. You can also unlock loads of parts to alter your game play, and the random mode can be fun as heck.All in all, LUFTRAUSERS is a good game. You should get it.			"

Theyre not only great but fitting while you create havoc in enemy airspace with a German super jet UFO thing shooting lasers, rockets or whatever you equip onto your plane.What every category changes:Weapon: DrumsBody: ThemeEngine: BassAs much as I like the game 10$ are a bit much for the content, though. Better wait until it's on sale and you will love it every single time you get to blast the enemy forces to bits without the question ""Was it worth it?""And... yeah...

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine LUFTRAUSERS is a game developed by Vlambeer and published by Devolver Digital and is a very enjoyable simple game that is really addictive! You are catapulted into the air and slowly gain momentum. You then need to control your momentum and at the same time kill enemies and try to surviveDuring the course of the game you will unlock new parts for your air plane, each offering a different special ability. You can also collect different weapons, different types of fuselage and different enginesFor each type of air plane the game asks for a number of challenges to complete, like sinking a battle ship, a blimp, or blowing up a submarine and so onIt's fun to complete these challenges and it's fun to experiment with the different plane types. I was very sceptic about LUFTRAUSERS at first and was reluctant to purchase it, but now that I've played it I fully recommend it. Despite its simplicity this game is a lot of fun to play in short bursts RECOMMENDED :)  "

												The game is fun if you can look past the FPS being locked at 30. Also, there is a sudden drop in FPS when you are under heavy fire. Some players say it's a way of giving you a ""second wind"". If it is in fact correct then it's a very bad implementation as it feels like the entire game froze. The game does have some replaybility owing to various challenges and the presence of two game modes. You can also have 125 different type of aircraft. Conclusion - Enjoyable shoot 'em up but wait for a sale before getting it. PS - It has the weirdest menu system I have ever seen.			"

												Well, after playing this for a while, I can easily sum this up in a couple of bullet points so here we go.What I like:- Stalling in midair and do ridiculous maneuvers to shoot at enemies and avoid enemy fire- customization of plane parts ranging from using different types of guns, bodies, and engines with certain benefits and tradeoffs- mixing plane parts not only change the name of the plane, but also the music while you are playing- enemy variety out on the open sea- high replayability, especially when you randomize plane parts after each session just to see what you getWhat I didn't care about:- the unlockable color palette, mainly because some of them didn't look that great or just literaly hurt my eyes in general so basically I ended up sticking with the default color paletteWhat I dislike:- other than the unlockable color palette, I have no complaints about this gameMy overall impressions in a nutshell, stop reading reviews and buy this game ASAP!!!

You could probably squeeze about 4.5 hours out of it total. But those 4.5 hours will be very fun.  The game is unique and quite enjoyable. If you have the extra $ or see it on sale, pick it up! "

												One of the best bullethell shooters i've played so far (even though there aren't many on my list)You get to hear some great 'retro-style' soundtracks which u change along with the parts of your rauser. Theyre not only great but fitting while you create havoc in enemy airspace with a German super jet UFO thing shooting lasers, rockets or whatever you equip onto your plane.What every category changes:Weapon: DrumsBody: ThemeEngine: BassAs much as I like the game 10$ are a bit much for the content, though. Better wait until it's on sale and you will love it every single time you get to blast the enemy forces to bits without the question ""Was it worth it?""And... yeah... Don't mess with the rauser.Seriously... DON'T MESS WITH THE RAUSER!!!....Warned ya.			"

												The game is fun if you can look past the FPS being locked at 30. Also, there is a sudden drop in FPS when you are under heavy fire. Some players say it's a way of giving you a ""second wind"". If it is in fact correct then it's a very bad implementation as it feels like the entire game froze. The game does have some replaybility owing to various challenges and the presence of two game modes. You can also have 125 different type of aircraft.

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine LUFTRAUSERS is a game developed by Vlambeer and published by Devolver Digital and is a very enjoyable simple game that is really addictive! You are catapulted into the air and slowly gain momentum. You then need to control your momentum and at the same time kill enemies and try to surviveDuring the course of the game you will unlock new parts for your air plane, each offering a different special ability. You can also collect different weapons, different types of fuselage and different enginesFor each type of air plane the game asks for a number of challenges to complete, like sinking a battle ship, a blimp, or blowing up a submarine and so onIt's fun to complete these challenges and it's fun to experiment with the different plane types. I was very sceptic about LUFTRAUSERS at first and was reluctant to purchase it, but now that I've played it I fully recommend it. Despite its simplicity this game is a lot of fun to play in short bursts RECOMMENDED :)  "

												You aren't plunged into a deep storyline with deep story progression. You aren't managing skill trees. There isn't some big economy to buy, sell, and trade with other players.You just go in, take to the skies, and fly until you die.It's simplicity makes it an awesome game to pick up and play anytime youfeel like it, for as long as you want. Games like Undertale are great, but if I haven't played in a while, I'll need to recap everything I did, have, and need.This game does do well on the battle. Not only is there a variety of unlockable weapons that have their advantages an disadvantages, but you will mainly focus on how you move more. Sometimes, it's more viable to crash into your enemies rather than try and aim and shoot at them. It is really fun.I should note here that this game works best with a controller. I haven't played with a keyboard, but I can't imagine it going that well. The joystick controlls work best with the fluid movement of this game.			"

												Seldom have I ever been so impressed with a game as this. It's just simple, fast, and fun. I am actully gifting copies to many of my friends.If you want something that scales to be a challenge and rises with your skill level, this is it. It will inevitably best you, but the fun is seeing how long you can avoid it.I have two actual gripes:The first gripe is that the firing/boosting ""non-stop"" missions don't always appear to count correctly. For example, you continuous fire 20 chain-kills to reach MAX combo but the mission shows that you've only been credited for 3 kills. This really sucks on the one for a 30 chain.The other gripe is that the entire range of ""at MAX combo"" missions rely on more serendipity than actual skill. There will often be gaps in the spawn rate long enough for the combo counter to drop the bonus. Only then does the target spawn, and with nothing around to build back the combo counter.			"

												It's utterly insane and I'm terrible at it - but it's good old fashioned fun. Some caveats you may not pick up on from watching videos - The menus are ♥♥♥♥in awful, especially if you want to configure a controller. Also the color scheme can wear on the eyes after a few minutes for me. Honestly though, if you watch a video of the gameplay and it looks like reckless nutty fun to you - it is probably worth the buy.Oh and obviously don't come here looking for a complex narrative or anything like that, this is a straight to the point old school arcade shooter.

												Another fun and addictive little game made by Vlambeer. Your goal in Luftrausers is to destroy as many planes, ships, submarines, even zeppelines and ofcourse try to dodge incoming bullets and fight gravity! After you've beaten some of the objectives (like destroy 3 battleships..) you may earn different armor, engines and weapons. There are many different combinations and by trying them out you might figure out which is best suited for you.Even though the game's graphics may look a bit 'simple' it does the job perfectly, also there's a great soundtrack and there are online leaderboards for you to test your skills vs other players.Luftrausers is recommended to most arcade fans.

												Luftrausers is an arcade dogfighter game in which you shoot boats, jets, aircrafts and whatnots. A gamesession can variate between 30 seconds to 5 minutes (IF you got any luck surviving this long^^). It´s brutal, unforgiving, plain and simple but a hellish addicting game =)GAMEPLAYSimply put, you have to press 4 different buttons. And avoiding projectiles while flying. Oh and sometimes you needn´t to push a button or else you fly directly into another projectile xD But this depens on how you build up your aircraft. Bulky but slow with high firepower or fast with a melee body ala Kamikaze Joe? There are three different slots where you can choose your loadout: Weapon, Body and Engine. To discribe the gameplay of Luftrausers is a little hard so I put a playlist at the end of this review.GRAPHICSGraphics on the other hand are quite simple to discribe. 8-bit pixels with a stabile framerate of 30 FPS deliver fluid pictures of hate and enjoyment. Through unlockable color patterns the original 3-Color mode can be switched from psychodellic neon to simple black and grey and white. Every mode except the original made me puke and laugh at the same time but this lies in the eye of the beholder. :PSOUNDNow this is what really stands out. Every game has a soundtrack but Luftrausers is a shiny example for how great and important good music is for a game. Every bodypart has its own ""OST"". I´d say industrial meets 8-Bit... I totally love it =)For 9€ it´s hard not to recommend this game but after playing it for 8 hours only highscore hunting is left (maybe achievement hunting, but that´s not for me) I hope there´ll be updates with more equipment parts to play around with or maybe new enemies. For those who beat the normal mode AND defeated an enormous aircraft called ""BLIMP"" you get access to a new mode called ""SFMT"".. Even satan cries in his bedchamber after he played ten minutes in this mode xDhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLd5l53rMB022oUMaN98kNHfuafv6XRGEu "

												Caveat: I got this on sale for 75% off.A friend recommended this to me, or rather, I saw it on their wish list and gave it a look.  I bought it immediately - it's a relatively simple concept, a sort of free-roaming shooter as opposed to V/H scrolling, where you can unlock new parts and combine them before flying out to cause destruction.But the execution here - it's such a tight little package of awesome from start to (I can't say finish exactly) where I am now.  The sepia-tone graphics that actually make sense, the simple yet stylized look, the incredibly fluid way everything moves, and the perfectly fitting soundtrack all come together to make a game that's far more than the sum of its parts.I got this for a friend who streams games just so he could show it off, because I think a precious little gem like this deserves more attention than it likely gets.  Shooters don't have to be visually stunning or flashy (IMO), they just need to play well and be cohesive.  And this, haha, is right on target.			"

												This is just purely an extensive arcade 2D shoot 'em up.The main goal of the game is to survive long as possible and and try to score  maximum possible points.The longer you are in the game, the more enemies coming at you.And try at all times to keep your combo at 20x for a long time to get a crazy high score.That is most the arcade part of the game is you ask me.Beside that you have the option to customize your plane with a few upgrade you unlock along the way.Every parts gives you some new mission to play ... and give you a new goal and will keep you playing.Some mission are very hard to get if you ask me.I find this game super challenge and very addictive to a certain point of the game.Overall I think it's a great game and will give you some playing time.Replay value is good and this can be better if you ask me.I give it a 7/10 score.

												Every once in a while you come across a game that transcends gauging its worth based on style or substance, and is instead just pure, visceral joy to play. Luftrausers joins that small party of games that is just so incredibly fun to simply experience that most traditional negatives it might have really do become inconsequential. I can’t really say anything that a thousand reviews before me haven’t already as it’s been near impossible to look on a game related site and not see people singing this games praises. But that’s certainly not without reason. For the sake of argument let’s say this really is the first review you’ve run across (I pity you, go read someone else’s review, seriously :P); what is Luftrausers?Short Version: A physics driven, bullet-hell, score attack, manic shooter with retro throwbacks but its own style. Go buy it.Long Version: Luftrausers is an aerial combat shooter performed in the old-school style of arcade classics but with its own spin. That spin is basing its movement around climbing and diving physics, propelling high into the air only to release the throttle and let gravity carry you back down. Repeating the process over and over, enabling you to deftly navigate a maze of bullets being fired from dozens of on screen enemies at a time in a way that’s far more fulfilling than a traditional shmup. Orient this around an amusing stylized art-style and a score attack set-up. The goal is to live as long as possible and kill as much as you can in the process. To add depth and longevity you unlock new weapons, armor, and engines that can be combined in dozens of different set-ups to change how you move and fight. Each part also has its own set of missions (such as reaching max combo, killing a certain type of enemy, or a certain number, etc.) that you complete to unlock further parts. Toying around with these various combinations adds some serious depth to an otherwise simple process, and injects a good deal of life into the already highly entertaining physics/gameplay.Does it have some negatives? Nothing major that should detract from the experience for most people. For the sake of fairness I’ll pick apart two things that come to mind, but they really are minor when compared to the games overall quality. First the game could have benefited from a story mode. While clearly not necessary the style and humor the game does have on hand was a very solid framework for launching some kooky little tale off of. In the end the game still has a lot of life to it but a story mode would have extended that even further. The second and a REALLY small tick is that some of the missions to unlock new parts are infuriatingly luck based. Like killing a submarine at max combo when in all the thousands of enemies I’ve killed I’ve seen exactly seven submarines making a few missions like this frustrating. But both complaints are virtual non-factors in the face of just how good everything else is, but perhaps worth mentioning just to give you the full scoop.In short Luftrausers is pretty much the perfect score attack game, and if you like the genre you definitely need it in your library as soon as you can pick it up.

												Recommended: If you at all liked classic arcade side-scrolling shooters of old, LUFTRAUSERS is right up your alley.  It's a well-made side-scroller with high production values and excellent execution.LUFTRAUSERS is a classic side-scrolling arcade shooter made by Vlambeer and published by Devolver Digital.  Vlambeer is a game development house that has a certain knack for having their game ideas ripped off by mobile developers, and there's very much a reason for that: they make simple, arcade retro games very, very well, with an imitable art style and direction.At it's heart, LUFTRAUSERS is a side-scrolling shooter set in a sort of alternate reality at the birth of jet flight, full of all kinds of anachronistic references to old science fiction and a rich graphics style that fully realises and embellishes the genre.  The art style in general is very well-implemented, as is the sound design.  It all fits together very well.  The music design deserves special mention, because the in-game music changes slightly depending upon your choice of hull, weapon, and engine.  So very different choices of plane will result in very different in-game music and it is a way of adding variety to the game that hasn't been much used before.The game mechanics are simple, but work very well.  The divergence from simple normal side-scrolling is the inclusion of a stall mechanic - when you are engaging the engine boost, you simply glide, which allows greater precision in turns at the price of losing altitude and slower forward momentum.  It allows for a high skill ceiling in the maneuvering and some truly amazing stunts.  Coupled with a variety of weapons, hulls, and engines that all act differently, the game not only offers a variety that keeps the game fresh, but also allows a player plenty of latitude to find a combination that fits their play-style.  The controls are responsive, and it plays just fine with a keyboard, though this is another game that definitely feels more authentic with a classic controller.The enemies in the game are varied and become incrementally more difficult as you survive longer.  It starts as simple fighter planes, but progresses to patrol boats, jet fighters, ace pilots, battleships, and more.  On top of that, unlock enough and you can unlock a ""SFMT Mode"" that not only greatly increases the speed at which the enemy progression occurs, but also unlocks new enemies to fight, as well as affords new unlocks for yourself.All in all while the game mechanics themselves are fairly simplistic, there is plenty of variety to keep you engaged and the production values for this kind of game are as high as one might have come to expect from Vlambeer.  if you like side-scrolling shooters, then I think you'll find a lot to love in LUFTRAUSERS.Published: http://highlandarrow.com/index.php/reviews/86-review-luftrausers "

												Luftrausers is a frenetic aerial combat bullet hell 2D retro dogfight shooter or whatever you want to call it.Basically you have a simple 4 button control scheme of turn left/right, boost forward, and shoot. As you play you unlock more ship parts to customize with. Mix and match parts in sets of 3 with guns, hulls, and engines. Each part has a few achievements that you unlock in succession when you use those parts. Also they affect the soundtrack variation in a way I have yet to figure out. Take to the skies and set ablaze all who dare stand in your path using your ultimate aircraft and you divebomb into boats to explode them.			"

												It's easy to understand the mechanics at first, but the brutal difficulty makes it easily understandable that many people may be turned-off within the first couple runs of this bullet-hell. Once you get a better grasp of how to maneuver in the air and unlock a couple plane parts to experiment with though, it becomes super addictive and satisfying as hell to flip and stall in the air like a ballerina, while dishing out your own damage for as long as possible. Highly recommend it to anyone who wants a speedy and intense arcade shooter with a quick turnaround on lives, and especially if you take joy in competing for highscores. If nothing else, it sells pretty cheap during sales, so nab it during such a time so that you don't lose out on much when compared to a fast food burger for the same price.			"

												Arcade gaming. Each life lasts up to 2 minutes on your first go, but you can survive for as long as you are able to.The music is way more interesting than I gave it credit for. The number of unlocks keeps it fresh, if only to hear how each piece of gear changed the music! The gear-specific achievement challenges are suitably challenging and push you to try out new combos. I'm sure there are OPTIMAL loadouts, but I haven't felt like there are any except for specific goals you set out to do.Really entertaining. Short sessions turn into 30+ minutes burnt up. I doubt I'll go back to it that often after I finish, but it's been fun nonetheless.As an aside, it reminds me of a game called Continuum (Subspace), with a variant from SOEgames called Cosmic Rift. Infantry Online is vaguely similar, but anyway, Subspace was a 2D overhead space shooter. A bit of nostalgia to that game, especially with its risk-reward mechanic of your HP meter being both ammo and health.That dynamic of risk-reward created a lot of moments of tension, thinking in split seconds whether or not to fire off a couple shots to cancel the regen to keep the combo alive while juggling your plane through streams of bullets.Also shoutouts to Kozilek for doing the music and putting a ship named after himself in the game, too.

												It's a good time killer that you may play for an hour or two. Flying around and instantly changing directions and blowing up planes and boats is incredibly fun.... At first.The only problem with this game is that it gets old pretty fast. I get the feel that it should be a mobile game or a free flash game. So if you want a fun little shooter that you can play for an hour or so, then by all means go for it. But it you're looking for more, then this isnt the right place to look			"

												Relive the harrowing experience of flying in the Pacific during World War 2 in this incredibly realistic military flight simulator that rival's the genre's best (Microsoft Combat Simulator, X-Wing vs Tie Fighter). Fly in dozens of different real life planes, painstakingly rendered in lush 3D using hundreds of references taken from the Smithsonian's air museum.For added realism, use a wireless keyboard with low batteries. You'll never know when the keyboard stops responding, representing an engine stall that American pilots often faced in the heat of battle due to the low quality of their engine parts.			"

												Fun for the first 30 minutes or so before it all goes downhill, mainly because there's not much left to do and SFMT is very largely luck-based. Fairly disappointing.After the first maybe 15-20 minutes you may encounter your first blimp, kind of a boss which was fantastic the first time but it turns out that's basically the most powerful thing, the only boss ever. A hardcore SFMT mode just adds more stuff and more bullets coming at you, no new interesting enemies.Also no restart button I could find when I accidentally started a game in the wrong mode or wrong ship setup, you have to just kill yourself which is rather difficult to do in the normal game mode for 10-15 seconds while there are very few enemies (particularly with the underwater thruster).""Let's have a 5sec air raid siren start each hardcore game, where average playtime is about 5sec."" That's where I had to mute my audio unfortunately where it was otherwise enjoyable in other parts of the game.Again the first 30 minutes of playing and unlocking (~80% of the game) stuff is great fun, which is maybe why this game got so many great reviews from critics who didn't play further? Personally I don't think it was worth the $5 I paid during a steam sale. "

												BEWARE. This game does not allow you to change the volume settings or any options until after you beat the tutorial stage. This is important enough to be the first line of this review because if you're like me and like to chat with friends over voicechat, you may need your master volume turned up pretty high and adjust games as needed. I almost didn't even play this game because of how loud it was on startup and there was nothing I could do in-game to fix it. Eventually after some googling I took some time away from friends to mute everything so I could pass the tutorial and actual fix the in game volume.Now, after that this is an extremely fun game. The arcade action is quick and fun and there's a ton of different configurations of parts to make your Rauser out of. Well, if a ton is equal to One Hundred and Twenty Five. Still, there's a lot of variety and each part has it's own mission objectives, giving some direction other than just scoring and adding to longevity to the experience. The four color aesthetic works wonderfully and the music plays to the action very well. Besides the red and sepia look there are other color schemes to unlock, most of which I've found are completely terrible, but they are completely optional and don't take away from the core experience which is so fun that the only real complaint I have with it is that I wish there was more!

												This game is lie no other....replayability is extremely high, not only because of the unlockables and challenges but also because of the super tight controls. While the controls may seem unusual at first, you pick up on them right away. The art style is pleasent and goes very well with the overall theme. The color palette used for this game is easy on the eyes and will keep you sucked in for a while. The only minor downside is the usic. The music might seem enjoyble at first but it can get tiresome if you play for too long. Reason why i say that is minor is because the explosion sounds pretty much muffles out the music after you get deep in the levels. Definitly a must buy, but i felt like explaining everything to you guys first.			"

												absolutely amazing, addicting, polished etc.   i barely got this game today and i cannot stop playing it.  its so much funthe sound, the music, the rumbles, the vibrations, everything is done jsut right to where you can feel the damage youre inflicitng upon your enemies.  The customizations are very polished out  leading to you having many personal faovrite ways to play and are balanced out laong with the normal loadout and im already wanting more of them (xp and challenges unlock them)unlike what i see alot of bullet hells do this one reminds me of another great indie game ""bleed"" (also on steam), the enemies attacks are focused on you and its up to you to dodge them rather than just move out of the way little by little.  i love games like this becuase it makes the ai much more interesting and reactibve to what you do.  theres a much bigger challenge in triyng to avoid enemies, bullets, swarm them up and everythign because the ai is on a constant swarm attack as soon as you start the game.  you'll see fighter jets, submarines, ships, even battleships, ace fighters and much more all coming for you as you get points by staying alive and killing.   the controls are very responsive, theres a skill to timing your boost, timing your turns, and even whena dn when to not shoot that goes further than jsut regenerating your health, you turn faster not firing and not boosting, then jsut firing, then boosting, then both.  the flight mechanics are very smooth and im doing exaclty what i want to do when i time it right.

												LUFTRAUSERS is an arcade type shooter in a very minimalist form but with sharp gameplay and addictive design that makes it extremely fun and gives it longevity. It's a game that uses very simplistic elements but makes the most out of them from just having a single ""level"" and track of BGM that are used in a way that adds to the exhilarating gameplay making each gameplay session escalate as you go on and offer further challenge. The longevity is provided by an unlockable-based system that rewards you as you complete different challenges which gives you a reason to alter your playstyle and rethink your approach.Definitely recommended.

												Okay... this game... is awesome! it's amazingly (addictively) fun to pilot a plane like this. the mechanic of your plane being repaired whenever you don't shoot is ingenious, adding a bit of risk vs. reward to every second of play. each new part adds to the experience, and whenever I got frustrated, I found myself switching out a part or two to create a completely different play style, and the pallette swaps are a nice touch. However, there are a few gripes I have with the game. Several enemies can take you out in a snap, sometimes when they're not even on screen. I've had several occasions where I've gotten out of an intense dogfight with only a scrap of health left (with little else on the screen) only for a jet to zoom in and smack into me. Battleships either need less health or shoot less bullets, and an ace can often times take you out before you have any time to react. For several hours, most of my objectives consisted of ""take out a blimp to continue"", but I can't for the life of me tell you the spawn conditions for one (sometimes they appeared 30 seconds in, sometimes three minutes of intense fighting will pass with niether hide nor hair). Blimps don't spawn nearly often enough to develop a strategy, and when I finally did beat one it was by dying with the kamikaze bomb part.Despite it's shortcomings, however, LUFTRAUSERS' ten dollar asking price seems about right as an asking price, and I'd definitely buy it again. I can see myself sinking plenty more hours into this game. "

												Look, this is basically a Flash game, like the kind you'd play for free, packaged as an application.  However, Luftrausers is $10, it features an abysmally-balanced set of weapons and add-ons that are just full of bad ideas and poorly-designed features.  Gameplay-wise, it's vaguely borrowing from Defender, Asteroids and most of all, Wings Of Fury (which if you haven't played, do it NOW or get the FREE clone of it, Wings Of Fury 2, which isn't bad).  It's a physics-based game, kind of, except when it's not.My biggest critique is that you don't make progress; you unlock a bunch of stuff that looks cool, but mainly isn't.Stuff like ""body that's a blade that makes you weaker than default but doesn't insta-kill hard baddies on impact hits so net the heavy armor does more DPS + survivability"".  Basic stuff.  Stuff that should have been addressed, if not at release, but in a patch, after the developers had a chance to get away from their product for a while and then played it, rather than merely testing features.So the game gets hard, basically Nintendo Hard, but you're stuck with the (few) combinations of parts that are actually worth using at all and a bunch of features, like dropping bombs, that feel like they should have been available to every body type, because it was one of the few interesting things.  And then you get to the end and are going to be like, ""well, that was short"".Compared to Wings Of Fury, this is a simplistic game that is pretending to be a lot more than it is.  I did not honestly feel like I got my $10 worth, and I rarely ever feel that.It's like they made this at some Code Day in about 24 hours, then slapped a very basic UI and some hired-gun graphics on it and then called it Done, frankly, with no further follow-through to improve the core balance of the design, a very limited selection of enemy types, and game mechanics that basically just punish you for making progress, without mitigation.  There isn't a story; there's nothing to get emotionally involved in... it's less interesting in those respects than any smallish title I've played recently.The game doesn't even have a difficulty setting, for example, so for a lot of you twitch-challenged people... you'll just hate it, frankly.This is the kind of game where if you actually long for games that were just brutally hard to keep you from noticing how bad they really were in the 1980s, then you're probably moderately happy, but I don't actually like the results much; it's like they borrowed liberally from the past without understanding it very well and then were promoted by All The Right People so that suckers like me would shell out $10.  It's rare that I've encountered a well-mentioned Indie darling with less to really offer for the money, though.Never again, Vlambeer- either build decent games that deliver real value and patch after release to get balance and the core of gameplay halfway decent or fuggitaboutit.

												There isn't a lot to say here. Luftrausers is a pretty straight forward arcade style bullet hell game that is well designed and fun to play. It offers ways to customize your ""rausers"" with different bodies, weapons, and engines. I do like that each combination has its own name, it's not a big deal, but it's a small thing that I rather like. According to the trailer each rauser has its own music and while I did notice a slight, it's not so unique that I instantly noticed.Luftrausers takes up very little space on my hard drive, it isn't taxing on my processor, it's cheap, and you can jump into a game in seconds. It's a game I play when I have a few minutes to kill like BroForce or Papers Please, but I think BroForce has more content. Still, Luftrausers is a lot of fun and I strongly recommend like pretty much the majority of people who play it.			"

												Oh god I've only played 20 minutes of this game and I can tell I'm going to love it. You are a small plane against a crap load of other planes who want to horribly murder you. Basically the game uses a pretty cool mechanic where you can stall in mid air and turn faster. This gives you almost total control of your craft. The customization is also pretty cool. Different weapons, engines, and bodies do different things and make your plane look completely different. Total control of how your plane works and feels makes this game which is already really good with control feel like a joy to play. There are also many many ""One more run"" moments, and many ""How in gods name did I pull that off?"" moments which are pretty enjoyable in my opinion. The soundtrack is also total bliss, making you feel super pumped to do one more round with that new thing you just got. I've only played for 20 minutes and I already think my 2.50 USD was well worth the price of admission.			"

												Someone once said this game has ""styyyyyyyle"". Well, I'm happy to report It has it in spades my friends. Luftrausers is basically Asteroids with gravity and World War I planes, and it really goes for the WWI aesthetic. The game is presented in a red and yellow sepia filter that pairs well with the WWI look of the menus and the various air and watercrafts.   You have goals that will unlock new parts for your plane that not only change the look and capabilities of your own craft, but also give the music a specific spin depending on the part you attach. This actually adds a lot to the game's minimal but stellar sound track.  There is no better feeling than when you become the plane! Once you wrap your mind around the controls, you quickly find yourself weaving in and out of a few battleship's bullet spray while pulling a 180 to boost THROUGH your pursuers. Okay, so maybe its more than Asteroids with gravity and WWI planes, and thats why I love it.Recommend it to a friend,Tino			"

												LUFTRAUSERS is a fast paced indie shoot em up, with a focus on movement and customisation, giving ful 360 degree freedom of movement and a wide open space to move around in, and 125 combinations of weapons, chassis, and thrusters. These affect things like attack type, health, abilities (such as ramming or going underwater). Each part also has several challenges, which are used to unlock new parts and secrets in the game (such as colour palettes). There are a wide range of enemies, ranging from small fighter planes, to massive blimps which rain bullet from the sky (while battleships and submarines do the same from the sea). The action is fast paced and there is little time between death and starting a new run, keeping the flow of the game.LUFTRAUSERS is a fun, addicting shoot em up, which adds a new take on the genre, whilst keeping with a lot of the conventions. The visuals are interesting and unique, and the music does make you feel quite awesome, especially as it changes based on the parts you are currently using. Overall, a great game for when you feel like blowing stuff up in style.			"

												Luftrausers is an arcade-style game that ultimately fails to give a real challenge.  At higher difficulties and later missions, your success becomes dependent on random change to the point of absurdity.  For example, the last random engine mission requires 25,000 points on the highest difficulty.  In practice, this can only be achieved by killing a particular enemy which only spawns a small percent of given attempts, and hoping that battleships or large numbers of aces do not spawn.  There's little the player can do to learn or improve, just try again.Luftrausers also manages to have at least one frustrating bug, despite its simplicity.  The last thing you kill on a given life does not count towards your mission score, either for ""kill X of Y"" type missions or score-based missions.If you want a difficult game where you can slowly learn its patterns and intricacies without feeling like you're getting punished by RNG and bugs, Luftrausers isn't it.

The core mechanics feel great, and you can pull of some moves that'll make you feel like you can fly around this world forever... good luck with that.Glad I picked this one up, great fun.

												I've poured about 24 hours of playtime into Luftrausers and I can finally say that the game is very barebones. Sure, the floaty controls and 2D shooting is satisfying, for a few hours that is. There's only 15 parts to customize your aircraft with, 7 enemies to dogfight with, and 1 gamemode: shoot things to get points until you die. It's an endless wave game with some very frustrating elements to it such as the simple art style which is pretty, but can interfere when there's a bunch of similarly colored things on the screen and compounded by immense screen shaking when things explode and stuttering when you take damage. The ""100 challenging missions"" the game touts is nothing more than a list of basic and boring goals such as ""Kill a Blimp"" or ""Get a score of 8000"" that is effectively a list of achievements that quickly becomes a test of luck down the line with its pseudo-difficulty.The bullet hell nature of the game is also hindered by the fact the camera is heavily focused on your rauser despite all the airspace available, you will often find yourself flying straight into a cloud of bullets that leaves you a very small window of opportunity to dodge whereas other bullet hell games gives you view of the entire field to plan out your maneuvers. All of this and the game asks you for $10, not really expensive, but for that price one could buy other replayable games with truckloads of more content such as Binding of Isaac, Dungeons of Dredmor, FTL, or Risk of Rain. Wait for a sale if you're still thinking about this one.			"

												It's a ""rogue-youdiebecausethegamesaidso-like"" and, very honestly, I have played flash games about planes five years ago which were far better than this weird unassumed Is-but-try-to-not-be reich propaganda that's barely masked by the total unexplained wtf of what your screen will throw-up in your eyes...And for a more detailed analysis :Scenario : No.Graphics are bad : It's another pseudo-retro-style-ish game with pixels for wannabe geeks to say that they're gamers. It's ok in some games, like hotline miami, because it is assumed and well made, but here, it's just uglier and colorless than a gameboy, which would be real retro-gaming for you...Gameplay is horrible : It's frustrating, the planes are insanely hardcore to control, you HAVE to master ""upgrades"" that you'll hate so you can unlock other ""upgrades"" that won't help you at all because half the time you can't even see your own craft because it's outside the screen or behind a cloud, but enemies will shoot at you way before you see them.Soundtrack is bad : Same assballz ear-rippin' loops that barely change as you modify your plane and I won't even talk about the sound effects... Shayt, Ay just dayd...I bought it because I liked another game published by Devolver... But the 75% deal brings the game to what should be its honest price.But hey, if you like rogue-likes because you love games that forces you to die again and again and again and again with absolutly no storyline, no good graphics, no good soundtrack and that you find games that put your brain under your seat addicting... Give it a try, it's still better than callofgta.			"

												Hm... I really tried to like this game, but to me the controls are too ""floaty"" for a bullet hell. The physics just feel weird and you take damage randomly because the gravity sends you flying across the screen. I think LUFTRAUSERS is probably a good game, it's definitely well made. It looks good, it sounds good, it runs well, but it just isn't.. fun. I'm sure some people will like the controls but I personally prefer more tight controls, less ""get thrown off into the distance"" gravity, in a game that relies entirely on being precise. It would be so much more fun and a testament to actual skill by feeling like you're learning enemy patterns and dodging accordingly but instead I just feel like it's random whether a run goes well or not. I never felt like I was learning anything about the enemy patterns and I couldn't even focus on my objective because I was struggling just to feel in control of my plane. I get that it's an arcade-style game but lack of content and ""loose"" controls just make LUFTRAUSERS so hard to enjoy for me. Your mileage may vary and if you're looking for a neat score attack game and don't mind having imprecise controls, you'll probably like this game. Maybe I'm just bad at adjusting to the physics and trying too hard to play it like 95% of twin stick shooters/bullet hells, but controls like this just don't feel right in a game about precision and accuracy. It feels like I'm adjusting more to myself moving than what any of the enemies are doing. The menus are also really too simple for their own good. I wanted to look at controls to see if there was anything I should know because I skimmed past the tutorial. It then made me remap every single control and I tried pressing b to exit because I had no intention of changing controls, just viewing the defaults, and it changed my controls for good. I then had to delete the inputs config file to reset it, still confused as to whether there were deeper mechanics. In conclusion, LUFTRAUSERS is not the twin stick bullethell shooter I wanted it to be but rather a weird, floaty physics shooter. If you can get used to the gravity of your plane, I'm sure you can have a good time with this, but I think some people will just find the control scheme too esoteric or obtuse.			"

												Okay... this game... is awesome! it's amazingly (addictively) fun to pilot a plane like this. the mechanic of your plane being repaired whenever you don't shoot is ingenious, adding a bit of risk vs. reward to every second of play. each new part adds to the experience, and whenever I got frustrated, I found myself switching out a part or two to create a completely different play style, and the pallette swaps are a nice touch. However, there are a few gripes I have with the game. Several enemies can take you out in a snap, sometimes when they're not even on screen. I've had several occasions where I've gotten out of an intense dogfight with only a scrap of health left (with little else on the screen) only for a jet to zoom in and smack into me. Battleships either need less health or shoot less bullets, and an ace can often times take you out before you have any time to react. For several hours, most of my objectives consisted of ""take out a blimp to continue"", but I can't for the life of me tell you the spawn conditions for one (sometimes they appeared 30 seconds in, sometimes three minutes of intense fighting will pass with niether hide nor hair). Blimps don't spawn nearly often enough to develop a strategy, and when I finally did beat one it was by dying with the kamikaze bomb part.Despite it's shortcomings, however, LUFTRAUSERS' ten dollar asking price seems about right as an asking price, and I'd definitely buy it again. I can see myself sinking plenty more hours into this game. "

LUFTRAUSERS is a game about “superweapon dogfighting in a world with World War II-era Thunderbirds”. It takes place somewhere between the Second World War and the Cold War, or in an alternative reality in the ten to fifteen years after the Second World War. We’re talking the age of fear for mind control, floating sky fortresses, orbital rays, weaponised dolphins, cryptography and submerging warplanes. The player is part of an undefined enemy force that was not on ‘our’ side during the six or seven decades in which military intelligence was effectively telling us to prepare for a laser-equipped hoverboat assault. It's pretty awesome.As a Vlambeer game, LUFTRAUSERS has a lot going for it. The game is all about big bullets, lots of screen-shaking explosions, fun mechanics, and ridiculous controls. Like with all Vlambeer games, it features a high skill ceiling and difficulty while maintaining easy accessibility and addictive gameplay. Aesthetically, it has simple but great pixel art and vibrant color palettes. KOZILEK's soundtrack is amazing; it subtly changes as you customize your Rauser with different guns, hulls, and engines. Everything about it just feels amazing.There are a few flaws, however. The user interface is a little clunky; I've had trouble remapping the controls and the menus are a little hard to navigate. Players might get turned off by the simplicity and lack of content as well as the difficult missions. Still, I definitely think it's worth the $10. It's one of the best air-combat/dogfighting games I've ever played.TL; DR: for fans of fun games.			"

												Look, this is basically a Flash game, like the kind you'd play for free, packaged as an application.  However, Luftrausers is $10, it features an abysmally-balanced set of weapons and add-ons that are just full of bad ideas and poorly-designed features.  Gameplay-wise, it's vaguely borrowing from Defender, Asteroids and most of all, Wings Of Fury (which if you haven't played, do it NOW or get the FREE clone of it, Wings Of Fury 2, which isn't bad).  It's a physics-based game, kind of, except when it's not.My biggest critique is that you don't make progress; you unlock a bunch of stuff that looks cool, but mainly isn't.Stuff like ""body that's a blade that makes you weaker than default but doesn't insta-kill hard baddies on impact hits so net the heavy armor does more DPS + survivability"".  Basic stuff.  Stuff that should have been addressed, if not at release, but in a patch, after the developers had a chance to get away from their product for a while and then played it, rather than merely testing features.So the game gets hard, basically Nintendo Hard, but you're stuck with the (few) combinations of parts that are actually worth using at all and a bunch of features, like dropping bombs, that feel like they should have been available to every body type, because it was one of the few interesting things.  And then you get to the end and are going to be like, ""well, that was short"".Compared to Wings Of Fury, this is a simplistic game that is pretending to be a lot more than it is.  I did not honestly feel like I got my $10 worth, and I rarely ever feel that.It's like they made this at some Code Day in about 24 hours, then slapped a very basic UI and some hired-gun graphics on it and then called it Done, frankly, with no further follow-through to improve the core balance of the design, a very limited selection of enemy types, and game mechanics that basically just punish you for making progress, without mitigation.  There isn't a story; there's nothing to get emotionally involved in... it's less interesting in those respects than any smallish title I've played recently.The game doesn't even have a difficulty setting, for example, so for a lot of you twitch-challenged people... you'll just hate it, frankly.This is the kind of game where if you actually long for games that were just brutally hard to keep you from noticing how bad they really were in the 1980s, then you're probably moderately happy, but I don't actually like the results much; it's like they borrowed liberally from the past without understanding it very well and then were promoted by All The Right People so that suckers like me would shell out $10.  It's rare that I've encountered a well-mentioned Indie darling with less to really offer for the money, though.Never again, Vlambeer- either build decent games that deliver real value and patch after release to get balance and the core of gameplay halfway decent or fuggitaboutit.

												Someone once said this game has ""styyyyyyyle"". Well, I'm happy to report It has it in spades my friends. Luftrausers is basically Asteroids with gravity and World War I planes, and it really goes for the WWI aesthetic. The game is presented in a red and yellow sepia filter that pairs well with the WWI look of the menus and the various air and watercrafts.   You have goals that will unlock new parts for your plane that not only change the look and capabilities of your own craft, but also give the music a specific spin depending on the part you attach. This actually adds a lot to the game's minimal but stellar sound track.  There is no better feeling than when you become the plane! Once you wrap your mind around the controls, you quickly find yourself weaving in and out of a few battleship's bullet spray while pulling a 180 to boost THROUGH your pursuers. Okay, so maybe its more than Asteroids with gravity and WWI planes, and thats why I love it.Recommend it to a friend,Tino			"

												Simple mechanics at full speed. Bullet hell indeed.I love having a few games like this alongside more intensive games - they are absolutely great for a quick blast.After an hour or so you'll be in the swing of things and trying different combinations of ship loadouts - some really awesome, unique combinations to experiment with - and every choice has a dramatic effect on the core game. The core mechanics feel great, and you can pull of some moves that'll make you feel like you can fly around this world forever... good luck with that.Glad I picked this one up, great fun.

												Okay... this game... is awesome! it's amazingly (addictively) fun to pilot a plane like this. the mechanic of your plane being repaired whenever you don't shoot is ingenious, adding a bit of risk vs. reward to every second of play. each new part adds to the experience, and whenever I got frustrated, I found myself switching out a part or two to create a completely different play style, and the pallette swaps are a nice touch. However, there are a few gripes I have with the game. Several enemies can take you out in a snap, sometimes when they're not even on screen. I've had several occasions where I've gotten out of an intense dogfight with only a scrap of health left (with little else on the screen) only for a jet to zoom in and smack into me.

For several hours, most of my objectives consisted of ""take out a blimp to continue"", but I can't for the life of me tell you the spawn conditions for one (sometimes they appeared 30 seconds in, sometimes three minutes of intense fighting will pass with niether hide nor hair).

												Hm... I really tried to like this game, but to me the controls are too ""floaty"" for a bullet hell. The physics just feel weird and you take damage randomly because the gravity sends you flying across the screen. I think LUFTRAUSERS is probably a good game, it's definitely well made. It looks good, it sounds good, it runs well, but it just isn't.. fun. I'm sure some people will like the controls but I personally prefer more tight controls, less ""get thrown off into the distance"" gravity, in a game that relies entirely on being precise. It would be so much more fun and a testament to actual skill by feeling like you're learning enemy patterns and dodging accordingly but instead I just feel like it's random whether a run goes well or not. I never felt like I was learning anything about the enemy patterns and I couldn't even focus on my objective because I was struggling just to feel in control of my plane. I get that it's an arcade-style game but lack of content and ""loose"" controls just make LUFTRAUSERS so hard to enjoy for me. Your mileage may vary and if you're looking for a neat score attack game and don't mind having imprecise controls, you'll probably like this game. Maybe I'm just bad at adjusting to the physics and trying too hard to play it like 95% of twin stick shooters/bullet hells, but controls like this just don't feel right in a game about precision and accuracy. It feels like I'm adjusting more to myself moving than what any of the enemies are doing. The menus are also really too simple for their own good. I wanted to look at controls to see if there was anything I should know because I skimmed past the tutorial. It then made me remap every single control and I tried pressing b to exit because I had no intention of changing controls, just viewing the defaults, and it changed my controls for good. I then had to delete the inputs config file to reset it, still confused as to whether there were deeper mechanics. In conclusion, LUFTRAUSERS is not the twin stick bullethell shooter I wanted it to be but rather a weird, floaty physics shooter. If you can get used to the gravity of your plane, I'm sure you can have a good time with this, but I think some people will just find the control scheme too esoteric or obtuse.			"

												Possibly the best barrage/bullet hell game I have ever played. I dont see the hours go by as I experiment with ship combinations, which change not only the gameplay tecniques but overall longevity, as rounds can range from seconds to several minutes.Even with pixel graphics, it's beautifully composed and includes unlockable color mods so you can change the feel of the setting. The onscreen objects are quick and responsive and almost always fit my reaction time, promising a thrill even after consecutive plays.			"

												Peel back the art style and what you have is a fairly average shooter. Enjoyable for about 5 minutes before the enemies shooting at you off screen and the almost invincivle blimps start to grind on you a little. 10 more minutes and you will be moving onto another game.			"

												This is one of those lovely game that tries it's best to not be extremely difficult just for the sake of it, but sadly, is. Between the extremely low health and damage that any Rauser combo produces (in comparison to what you are up against) you still get overwhelmed easily.The game goes from slow to bat♥♥♥♥♥♥crazy in a matter of 30-45 seconds. The combo counter resets far too quickly and is impossible to keep if the game decides to stop spawning the little weak planes. Battleships often spawn on top of eachother and create a hail of bullets that even the high armor body can't eat. The randomization makes it far too luck based.Overall, this game makes a real solid effort and I am sure many people are up to the challenge. This game is for them. I however will take a pass on the ""drag-your♥♥♥♥♥across-razorblades"" difficulty in hopes they tweak and balance the game a bit more. Maybe introduce a planes only or boats only mode, etc.			"

												Amazing game; don't buy it. It really pains me to have to say this, but LUFTRAUSERS, one of my favorite arcade games, is broken. I've tried reinstalling it approximately fourteen times now (because it used to be just that good), but me, along with a massive chunk of gamers on the community hub, just can't get it to open. Even my friends, who I recommended this game to immediately after playing it, can't even get it to work, so I couldn't possibly recommend it to you, lest you become one of the dozens of people online, on forums, or even looking for help on this games page, that can't get it to even work at all. A damn shame too, because this game used to be amazing. One of the best pick up and go games with an unparalleled soundtrack. Now I'm just curious if it's too late to get my money back.			"

												There are bullet hell games, and then there are ""RNG death sims."" This is the latter. Enemies will be shooting at you from so far off your screen you just have to hope and pray that you are zigging and zagging at the right time... And even then it won't matter, because an ace will fly up right behind you as you're trying to dodge the battleship shells and just put 4 in your tailpipe. I constantly found myself at the edge of the viewable playfield, which made it all the easier for a newly spawned enemy to just ram an extra bullet or six into my ship. If the game allowed you to lock the viewscreen center on your ship, the game might be a little more fun.The game is difficult only because you are not given enough data to put up a fair fight. I don't appreciate it when they make the game difficult by severely handicapping the player, though it does explain why the game gives you massively overpowered weapons that you then have to fire blindly off the screen to hope you'll hit something.

												This is a game I want to like but seems inaccessible most of the time. You don't unlock much in the beginning/start of the game and even when you start to unlock more parts, the variation just isn't there. I do like the art style and music as it feels energentic and reflective of the subject of the game.I played with a controller and had most of my issues with the menus and just overall turning of the plane. Everything else worked well enough.The reason I am giving this a negative review because I think this game needs a difficulty that goes along a pace as the game does rather than crazy amounts of bullts and enemies that act unrealistically and unfairly.

												A coffee break shmup with single stick controls, one stick to bank and rotate, a button to thrust and a button to fire. Health regenerates as long as you aren't firing your guns. The game starts off sdlow but quickly ramps up as you increase your score, adding more, and tougher enemies until you go from little gunboats and fighters to fighting massive battleships, zeppelins, and UFOS, dodging enemy fire, lasers, and skimming water and clouds to avoid everything, until you finally explode and do it all over again. The game's scoring challenge comes from continuing to string together massive combo multipliers, constanly urging you to take higher and higher risks to keep the combo going withouty dropping it, lest you have to build it up all over again.The player's ship is heavily customizeable in body, engines, and weapon types, allowing for a large variety of playstyles. As a neat touch, the music alters itself based on the type of ship you put together, putting together a new mashup of instruments and beats. The downsde is the game's pocket size, along with quickyly ramping difficulty, means you're going to be hearing the first one to two minutes of the song an awful lot.Completing achievements and challenges in the game unlocks new parts for your ""Rauser"", and new color paletes to play the game with.It's pure arcade action and it's a lot of fun.

You dogfight with planes which you can get upgrades that work in different ways. The best part in my opinion is the music as it is one of the few games that make me feel stress and excitement when dealing with mass numbers of enemies, plus each plane upgrade changes the music giving you multiple tracks to listen to. The retro style graphics are a good call to use as simplicity makes the best of this game.8.5/10 A simple but well made arcade game that will in the long run have a lasting appeal to any Steam user.

												While it has its moments, it doesn't have enough to provide me entertainment beyond just a few minutes. Its biggest issue is the pure lack of content, or rather the rate at which you unlock new airplane parts. Maybe 20-40 minutes into the game I unlocked every single plane part (except for the top secret last ones), and thus I really had nothing else to play for. While there is that final unlock, it just becomes a technical challenge and a grind due to the lack of unlockables, which makes for painfully unfulfilling gameplay.Overall I would give this game a 4.5 out of 10, because it gets very old very quickly.

												This game is a must have if you want very good controls, the living hell out of bullets in the sky and the Feeling like a boss if you beat an damn airship out of the sky.The game is very hard and you need to find your personal mix out of weapon and Rauser.You can play as a super weak shotgun rauser which cant get hit by planes flying through him.Or you can play as a slow, heavy Rauser with very much health.The weapons are all well done.The Soundtrack of the game is epic, dont need to say any more words.If you like the style of the game, buy it. if not, buy it.I would recommend this game for EVERYONE who wants even just a little challenge in games.Some gameplay (my own video):

												It may just be me, but because this game is so unique but so small, it feels more difficult than it's worth to try and master it's mechanics because right as you do, you've beaten the game and all that effort you put in wasn't worth anything because you can't really apply it anywhere else. It's like studying all year to answer one question about a subject that has nothing to do with anything. It's probably just my excuse for being bad and not wanting to try to get good, but still.			"

												This game is another shining diamond from Devolver Digital, makers of one of my all-time game series Hotline Miami.  (It even features some recycled Hotline Miami musik, so you know that part is wonderful.)A triumph for pixel art in games.Works off the principle that what goes up must come down (YES!--gravity), using this physic to create a whole new twist to twin-stick shooter arcade play.  Also, playing like a suicide-bomber can be to your advantage as you can use your plane to melee enemies as well as to fire missles.  Very challenging gameplay (the achievements will most likely not be hard to cook through, but the game itself provides a beautiful challenge and you can compete for high scores).The art is simplistic, but subdued, easy on the eyes, and beautiful.  The art style is unique and fun, the kind of art you would expect from Devolver.  Beige color-scheme is interesting.  Play-style is customizable (you can alter weapons/parts of the ship).The gravity mechanic doesn't make sense in light of the German war Aero-plane theme, but oh well.  It's a video game  and absurdity is welcome.  The sky and water serve as a function of the game, not just backdrop, so I guess it all works.I came to love this game in a very short time and this is definitely doing to be one of my top picks for a long while.

												LUFTRAUSERS is a delightful little game. The mechanics are remarkably simple, as well as the art style; but the overall package is incredibly fun. The best thing about the game to me is that it doesn't require much of the player. It is easy to jump in and out, but still make progress. The player is presented with attainable goals that are based on the modifications that are available and each modification is actually unique, which adds a great deal of variety to the game.All in all, LUFTRAUSERS is a ridiculously fun game. It is definitely worth a purchase.			"

												This is a frenetic, side-scrolling dog fighting game and it's a lot of fun!  The fact that it's a side-scroller means that simply allowing your plane to fall is a valid movement strategy.  You have unlimited ammo and your health will regenerate but you can only use one at a time.  Your health doesn't regenerate while you're shooting so you really need to balance your approach to attack and defense.			"

												I don't normally get into shmups, but this one is a lot of fun. The asteroids-style control scheme adds to the experience and the simple color palette lends a style that I find interesting.Playing the game you will unlock new parts for your plane and new graphical color palettes that can be changed out. This adds some variety to the gameplay or allows you to somewhat tailor the game to your playstyle.The only negative thing I have to say about the game would be that it seems to be capped at 30 FPS. It definitely doesn't feel like it is running at 60 FPS, which I think would be a much better experience for this type of game. Hopefully this is something that can eventually be addressed by the developer.			"

												Luftrausers is a pure arcade game. One button to stall, one button to fire, and two directions.You have to shoot everything you see and avoid the bullets. There are both aerial and on-water combat.This is incredibly addictive, and the music is so awesome.Stall a lot, then do a 180 degrees, and shoot every planes following you : priceless.			"

												Japanese WW2 Pilot Simulator - 10/10All jokes aside, I have only played for about an hour and can honestly say it is well worth the money. Nice aesthetics, great soundtrack, amazing game mechanics and lots of fun to play. The only cons I can think of are the 4x3 aspect ratio, giving black bars on my 16x9 monitor and the wierd menu. 9/10 so far, definitely worth giving a shot.			"

												Awesome. But the game is very short even with it's high replayability. It's like that awesome dessert you get at French restaurant. It's super expensive, it's tiny, but when you get more you get super tired of it. So yes, Devolver digital is that artsy French patissier where they make super expensive, super tiny, but super satisfying items. (p.s. Which makes EA and UBI soft Chinese buffets as they are keep feeding something that you know it's generic. But since you are in a bandwagon that you have to just devour more and more of it :/)The game is about dogfighting. That's literally it. You can choose different style which aids the replayability of this game. But again, the stall mechanics provides insane movements and actions that you can perform, which makes this game very unique. However, get it when it's on sale for more than 50%. Five bucks or less for 2~3 hours isn't that bad. But for 10 bucks, there are better options. It's overpriced. But when you do get a chance to play it, do play. Because it's like no other games.			"

												As the embodiment of all things evil and War-like, I find this game a pleasure.You play as the pilot of some sort of Indestructo-Plane, able to regenerate lost parts, conjure a myriad of bullets, and dive-bomb into battleships with the force of a nuke.And even though the game gives you a single ship at the start, after a while, you are able to build your own monstrosity; e.g, a laser spewing, super-speedy, flying nuke which explodes upon death.You may not like the colour palet, but you can switch to different ones at a later point. My favourite is DISTINY.The soundtrack of the game is sublime, with the main theme changing with the different plane parts; That's really creative!If I had to say something bad about the game, it'd probably be SFMT Mode. It's insanely hard, but gives no reward other than more challenges. And while the on paper the Missiles are a fun idea, being able to drop homing missiles on your enemies, there almost usless as you can have only 4 at a time, and they do very little damage to anything other than cannon fodder.If you like fluent action, challenge and a wide variety of death-spewing ariel demons, then you'll not want to miss this!9/10 P.S; Love Trousers. I had to at some point...			"

												If you appreciate building up skill in a game to eventually master it, this game very well may hook you.  The gameplay is a bit of luck and a lot of practice, with task and point based goals.  Shoot for a traditional high score using combos and brilliant maneuvers, or aim to kill harder and harder enemies up to the dreaded Blimp.The biggest calls this game has is its short round lengths, its high adrenaline, and that wonderful videogame feeling where you are an unstoppable boss until you mess up.If you like games where you face impossible odds, relying on a lot of practice, skill, and a little bit of luck, Luftrausers deliver well!

Where other games have story, this has customisable freakin planes.You can equip a body that fires missles out of it as you fire, giving the ability to recreate a one-man blitzkrieg where every enemy you see is basically screwed. Buy this game. Now.But in reality, I have really enjoyed this game. Like, I love it. It has it's downs, sure, but that's besides the point. It is fantasic to fly around in a full 360 degree angle and shoot anything that lives. I love it's customisation, it's charm, it's enemies, it's everything. I want you to buy it and see for yourself.

												So, I'm just a few parts combinations away from full completion of this game, and wow. Just... wow.You start off in a pretty simple manner; you have a standard machine gun, normal armour, and an engine. Letting go of up stalls the engine, allowing you to begin drifting back to the water. Entering the clouds or the water causes you damage, to start with anyway. Stop firing, and any damage you took begins to regenerate. And that's the nice, simple start.By the end... Well, you'll be flying around furiously, firing giant fireballs that explode on impact with an enemy, equipped with a submarine propeller so water no longer hurts you, with the fuselage of a nuke that explodes on your death. Oh, and there'll be a siren going off, and not long after it's likely you'll be dead.And eventually, after some seriously difficult challenges... you'll unlock the U-Rauser, and boy, you probably didn't see that coming. But you'll have enjoyed every second.			"

												This is a great ARENA BASED shumup. Know before purchasing that the ""missions"" are challenges like ""score 10k points"" or ""kill 3 submarines in one combo"", they are NOT unique levels like you would find in Raiden or Gradius. This ""one level"" game is meant to be played over and over again; it's very difficult. Runs can be anywhere from 10 seconds to 10 minutes. You unlock parts as you go and after defeating a particularly large enemy, you unlock ""hard mode"". Good luck with that....Lots of unique ship combos with a different version of the Luftrausers original theme depending on what you pick. It's a really wonderful track, check it out on soundcloud if you haven't heard it. The controls are intentionally slippery but very well done. You aim your craft and then either thrust or stall, the challenge is cutting your thrust at the perfect time...weaving between the bullet hell and keeping your combo multipler at MAX. You unlock different color schemes as you progress, they're all pretty wacky.Luftrauser's arena loops like Defender, while the game controls like a bullet hell Asteroids. For $10 I recommend this game to fans of arcade shooters.   "

												This is a frenetic, side-scrolling dog fighting game and it's a lot of fun!  The fact that it's a side-scroller means that simply allowing your plane to fall is a valid movement strategy.  You have unlimited ammo and your health will regenerate but you can only use one at a time.  Your health doesn't regenerate while you're shooting so you really need to balance your approach to attack and defense.			"

												Ok. Really and truly I want to give this game a thumbs up. Gameplay's solid , the combinations are nice and it's generally a very fun experience.But the names of some of the combinations in this thing kills it for me; and other people who'd happen to be in my shoes also. I know they're supposed to show the would-be awesomeness of the plane you're flying, but ""Hellrauser"" and ""Fist of God""? Really? (I almost don't mind the ""Karaterauser"" and ""Batman"", albeit not by much.) Seriously, I don't see a real need to give the combos names proper to God alone/not to be profaned in one way or another. So please, change those names. You can come up with better titles than that.And I know there's a whole lot of you that disagree with me and will say ""just don't use those."" Again, it's not as simple as that. Once it's in the game, it can't be played. Of course the one thing I expect a whole bunch of you guys to say is ""then don't play it then, it's just a game. Get over it"" etc.But I needed to make that clear so that it could be possible for other people somewhere around my case CAN play this thing with a problem without boundaries being crossed and worst case scenarios befalling them. Like I said, I really wanna give this game a great score. I'd be recommending it if not for that.			"

												Great arcade game. Fun flying and shooting mechanics, different combinations of weapons and ship part unlocks. Challenging game. Decent variety of enemies but expect to be getting very familiar with most. Quite hard gameplay but very addicting. Despite very simple controls the learning curve goes up steep for the first hour then flattens a little for a decent time as you get slightly better, completing challenges and unlocking parts (and colour schemes)...and then it explodes up again. Don't even bother with SFMT unless you are ninja at bullet hell. I really love the main game though, only game on my work computer, not that I get a chance to play it. Which is why I have it all my vitas too. Buy. Let go of fire to heal. The game microfreezes to when you get hit as an indicator.			"

												A good game that need some variation. An easy to play difficult to master type of game. There are many ship variations you can play through, but I managed to rest on two versions. While I like the game I feel like it needs a variety of levels or mission-objectives. Taking down the big ship is near impossible. I'm sure you can do it, but I never managed to do it. It gets old quickly. I would only recommend if you can get it under $5.			"

												The most difficult game I have ever played. By far. Because it has the worst controls I have ever seen in a game in my life. No matter what, it is impossible to get used to the controls. I can't fly at all because the controls are so nightmarish. I don't care what anyone says, the controls are the worst in the history of video games. It gives me almost no real control over my plane. All I could do was fight gravity to stay out of the water but I just kept dipping down into the water. I can really only kill planes by unavoidably slamming into them. You have to stop firing to repair your plane but you still can't because the screen is filled every milimeter with bullets and planes that are impossible to avoid because you have no proper control over your plane. How this game got past their quality control team blows my mind. Obviously they have no QA department. Hopefully this gets taken down from the steam store and at least there's Hotline Hiami, which is pretty much the only great game that Devolver has made.0/10 horrible			"

												I love and hate this game at the same time, great gameplay, terrible balance/design, some strong enemies can oneshot you before you even know where they are (enemy ace, laser ace), all kind of unavoidable deaths, the rng is too strong about how and which enemies will spawn. But I can't stop playing it anyway. Will update this review if they update the game which is a lot of fun but very unfair/unbalancedFeatures needed:Proper balancing (who the hell uses missiles)Warnings about in which direction enemies (the strong ones at least) are (like how Paladins warns you about bombs)Altitude meterVision of yourself while underwaterMaybe something to tell you which direction you are aiming, sometimes you don't know where you are going because of all the chaosAn encyclopedia of parts (more information about them) and enemies (like spelunky)Not a must have but would be nice anyway:Write combination name to instantly pick those parts (example: Kamikaze=original+nuke+superboost) (like dota heroes) List of favorited combinationsWorth buying if it's at 75% discount			"

												So I've now logged over 40 hours of play and I feel its time to update my review. I can now recommend this game BUT only for the game play and the controls, which are so solid that when you die you know its your fault. I say ""when"" because this is a bullet hell side scrolling sh'mup and you are going to die. This one is a challenge, again, I'm at 40 hours and I'm still 3 missions away from 100% completion. *sigh* There are still bits to this game that I find upsetting. Normally I would care less, but the game is soooo good that the little things to it are upsetting. ConsBeing color blind, I found that I can only use 4 of the 15 color schemes. The other 11 color schemes, I'm lost. Majority are horrendous anyways. I still find the 4:3 game play a huge disapiontment. I would really love to know the reason Vlambeer decided to go with this format.Still get lost navigating the menu... Yeah after 40 hours of game play. Calibrations! The controls are just too damn sensative in the menu and seem to be inconsistent at times. Controls just stop working.Aiming is still very difficult due to a number of factors. First, for weapons the have low frequence of shots, you have to guess when you are able to shoot again. Example missiles, you can only shoot 4 at a time. Sometimes they go rogue on you preventing you from firing. This is problem for health regen., keeping up your combo, defense, and offence. Second, the lower bit graphics also contribute.ProsEverything else. Final ThoughtTo put it simply, its a great game with the worst design. [Prior Review]+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+There is something I'd like to note before I review. I do play this game regularly in hopes that some of these issues are fixed. This review and rating may be updated.I love this game, which has some of the finest shmup action I've played. Beside the game play and the audio, for me, nothing else works. First off, I don't understand the decision the developer made with color scheme, more modes, more horrendous than the next can be unlocked to making it even more difficult than the last to identify enemies. A characteristic of this game that seems like a truely unnessisary hinderence. I'm really hoping there is a normal color scheme mode to unlock. Additionally, when you first load the game, you get the splash screen in wide screen, then in the game, standard. Black strips? What a tease, I can look past this small issue, only if it wasn't used a method to limit the firing range of the player and not the computer. Also with the graphics, I don't mind they are low res but it makes for difficult aiming without a line of sight or some other targeting method to see where you are shooting, this is critical when using weapons with a low frequency rate of fire. Next, navigating the menu's are a chore and shouldn't have to be. When you have 'go to' screens set to buttons that change on you pending the menu screen you are looking at can get confusing. The menu settings can be changed way too easily and inadvertantly as the controls are too sensative with no way to turn them down or even have dead zones. And how the heck do you exit the game? Well, took me a couple games to firgure out but you have to navigate to one screen to exit the game or even get to the options, that screen being what I thought was the start of the game. There really isn't too much more to this game and these intended unnessisary problems really do break my heart as I'm seeing a great game go bad. but If you are the type of gamer that can look past these problems, I do recommend this, but otherwise as it stands today, I can not. Maximum I'd give this a 6/10. That 6 easily could be a 9 or 10. Will update if game does. -RoX			"

												There are better dogfighting simulators avialble for free, there are better arena shooters for free.  I will provide examples if pressured.If you think the unique mechanics of this game itself make it worth purchasing, then the eb version is free and feels better to play, though it is still not very entertaining.The special part of this version of the game is that completing a number of missions will unlock new ship parts and extras like cutscenes and background color swaps.  The ship parts are all given strengths and weknesses, but they are poorly balanced to be overpowered or useless.  I will provide examples if asked.The missions themselves do not directly relate to being ""good at the game"", and one can quickly earn all ship parts and a randomizer but save for the last three without beating the game once (It took me around four hours).  The music is made up of a universal part and three parts that are assigned to each part of your ship-- in other words the music has a very large chance of being disjointed and offputting, not around long enough to stick in your head, and , worst of all, gimmicky.  If you play with the randoms on so that you have a chance to ue some of the useless parts instead of playing with the superior build.The extra backgrounds are likely to be offputting save for one or two, based off of your color preferences, and even the faded black/white (beige) film aesthetic seems tired and uninspiring.  The main and common grunts are too easy to take care of, and only pose a threat when they are in groups of more than ten, and the large battleships are too powerful.  Once you learn how to fight the battleships, then you are able to survive until the enemy dogfighters arrive--- which are actually fun to fight instead of annoyances like the blades of grass that are the grunts or the trees that are the battleships.Though, to even have fun DOGFIGHTING IN A DOGFIGHTING SIMULATOR, you have to make it through the boring first section,which happens to be very long.  Then, while you are polishing your skills, the boss will show up, leaving no time to enjoy yourself.--To be continued--			"

+ Nice background music that fits very well with the game+ Unique very addictiong mechanics (you can spin and change direction to dodge bullets while gravity is constantly pulling you down, however you must stop shooting for your health to regenerate, so it's a mix of dodging while trying to find time to shoot)+ A variety of different weapons, engines, and body parts that create a different experience each time + Challenges (which you need to complete to unlock more parts) are similar to achievements, and make you play differently each time depending on the challenge. (like kill 5 boats)+ The Airship boss is pretty awesome and takes some time to figure out how to defeat it.- There's no health bar, so it can be hard to tell when you are about to die. Basically a circle appears around your plane when you are close to death.- The Difficulty can feel a bit unfair at times, it's randomly generated so some playthroughs are easier than others.- There's really only 1 level in the game, so I feel like it's lacking content / repetitive- The Screen-Space is quite limited making it hard to see where enemies are			"

												LUFTRAUSERS (yes, it's actually allcaps) is an arcade-esque bullet hell shooter in which you are a RAUSER, aka, a plane 'ace', as it were. As a RAUSER pilot, it is your job to protect the Fatherland with glorious engineering bestowed by... blowing up♥♥♥♥♥♥LUFTRAUSERS has fun, addictive gameplay, and retraux graphics that somehow manage to be more detailed than a lot of other games relying on the same art style. Sparks fly from your plane, smoke billows from damaged enemies, and explosions shake the screen like you've had too much coffee. The overall feel of playing is seriously engaging, as every shot you take and every movement you make feels... just fantastic. For every major accomplishment (such as, say, blowing up your first battleship) you get a short little cutscene celebrating your accomplishment, making you feel genuinely proud of your amazing skill.Upgrades are unlocked fairly frequently, but the real challenge is unlocking the final three mystery parts. Trust me, that♥♥♥♥♥♥is worth it, and don't spoil it for yourself.For those of you who truly find joy in pain, there's also an unlockable SFMT mode, in which the game takes it up to 11... and breaks the scale. Good luck surviving that.In short, LUFTRAUSERS is a seriously engaging, pew-pew explosions, defend our engineering and take down hordes of enemies with this plane, simulator. Worth it at base price, must-buy on sale.			"

												This game is tough and super fun! I enjoyed unlocking all the ship parts and trying to see how far I can get. I don't think it's going to hold your attention forever but long enough to make it worth your time.They nailed the mechanics on this just like they did on rediculous fishing and super crate box. Each piece of the ship changes how it flies and you can find a ship that fits your play style. I had LASERS!I look forward to anything Vlambeer does now.

												LUFTRAUSERS, a game as whole as it's own trailer entails it to be, not much more but perhaps less then one would expect from a 10 dollar game on steam. I have not played the Flash version of this game, but after playing, what is in my opinion, an overpriced flash game. Here are a few reasons why:Controls:It is easy to tell from a mile this game was made for a gamepad, as none of the menu screens have mouse control, and more often than not end up taking you where you did not want to go in the first place. An example would be trying to costimize the Rauser, getting to the Hanger is as easy as pressing right with the arrow keys or D-pad, but instinctively would immidiately start trying to optimize the desired prefrence for the craft. Instead have to confirm what you want to customize the plane, a simple rotation selection screen, then have to press X to set the plane as complete. Key-binding is awful, a set track of trying to understand what you want to bind to makes for a frustrating adventure, where a simple sheet simply saying what key is for what button would have made this game worlds better. On top of ths, it appears I cannot find the file that contains the text file to easily bind what I want to which key.In game flying feels unnatural as well. Accurately aiming the Rauser in one direction is harder than it sounds and is pure frustration when this game could do with precise free aim instead of this ""single stick control"". More often than not I turn in to Kamikaze dolphine that wasn't build for the water. Being shot by things off screen does not help either....Graphics:Sepia pixlated style. Again, something that the trailer covers, but, this makes certain  projectiles, such as the lazer, disappear behind clouds, and the beam is the exact same collor, shade and tone of certain things with the background. The amount of things on screen feels alittle empy. As I said, being shot off screen is a real pain, with no indicator of where the enemy is after the shots have travelled far off and more accurately that the hopeless Rauser that sprays blindly in to the distance hoping to get a kill, percpetively wishing that you had the same sight range as your enemy AI, BUT MOST CERTAINLY DON'T. This is what makes me feels extremely cheated when playing this game.Sound:Music? Exellent. A bit overpowering at max volume (ingame settings) but good. That is, one track slightly moddified with your craft's load out. Other game sounds? intentionally styleized with the look, but nothing outstanding. Could easily be replaced with someone making ""pew pew"" and weird lazer noiced with their mouth and it'd be the same._____For something that started simple, it sure as hell stayed that way to be pushed out with a price tag on it. There are many games that follow similar pixle art style and are easily better than this. This is a game that could have had LOADS of more content for what we pay for, but sadly not worth the 10 dollar tag this game asks for.Could easily be better.			"

												To go by the basis that I rate games now, (Throw out to Yogscast Nilesy) This game isn't quite worth the money. The game is unique, and addicting at first to see what parts you can get, but once you get them all it becomes boring very quickly. There is a highscore board, but in reality that's about it. You can go through all 100 levels and play for days, but the levels are EXACTLY the same, abesolutely nothing changes between them. So I have to say this was a bad purchase. If you are a highly competitive person perhaps you will like this, but others will not.			"

Could work if the game was meant to be better than it is now where you can only shoot straight ahead, so you'll be falling down towards an enemy while firing, and not being able to see the enemy until it's too late to turn and fly up.

												Luftrausers is a game where you engage fighter planes over sea. Made by Devolver Digital and Vlambeer, it has a delicious arcade feel to it, meaning it can be played for 5 mins or 5 hrs, depending on the mood you may be in. Multiple enemy types to destroy, many leaving the player with a great feeling of satisfaction (I'm looking at you, battleships and blimps).There are lots of different parts available to the player for the customization of their rauser. There are also many unlockable color palettes to choose from, which allow you to change up the flavor of your rausing here and there. The difficulty is perfectly scaling, increasing a little more with each kill, each passing second of your continued survival. The one big drawback I've found with this game is no multiplayer option. Even a local VS mode would help add so much more variety to this already immensly addicting game. If you like techo/electro music with a sort of diesel influence, you will love the soundtrack of Luftrausers. It has a great selection of tracks which perfectly match up to the setting of your aireal combat. If you are looking for a mobile-esque timesink, look no further than LUFTRAUSERS!9/10 needs moar firepower			"

												The fighting mechanics are unique but not in a good way, they are too clunky and make it very difficult and frustrating to try to kill ships. All rounds are mostly the same, the only drive is to try to kill as many enemies as possible before you die to unlock parts,  and it does not feel like your skill really matters in the outcome. There are no really interesting fights, badass bosses or in general some unexpected events to break the monotony, it's just the same brainless planes and ships that only have different degrees of hp and bullets. Just saying, for less money you can buy metal slug 3 which has much more content and much more interesting enemies, badass bosses, fluid mechanics, secrets, multiplayer ecc. All in all not much to say about this game, I did not find it particularly fun, and it's definitely not worth 9 euros.			"

												LUFTRAUSERS (the title is, apparently, all caps) is a very simple 2D arcade-style game. You control a plane which flies around and shoots enemy planes. Unlike a schmup, where you proceed left-to-right or top-to-bottom, this is a side view, looking at a plane flying over an ocean, dogfighting vertically and firing on boats below.The game has a highly non-standard control scheme – you can fire, you can boost, and you can pitch your plane up and down, in a full 360 degree circle. The controls are very simple and kind of unusual, but you get the hang of them after a while.The game has 8 different enemy types – basic planes, a nastier kind of plane, giant blimps, basic boats, submarines, battleships, and two rare enemy types which almost never spawn. You will encounter them all in fairly short order, and at that point, you’ve seen all that the game really has to offer – there is an alternate mode which is basically a bullet hell mode, but even the regular mode can start bordering on that at times.You can customize your plane with five different weapons, five different bodies, and five different engines, each of which alter the gameplay of the game in reasonably significant ways, but ultimately the variety granted by these unlockable parts wears off after a short while. There are in-game missions which allow you to unlock parts and color schemes, each of which is attached to one of the parts, with each part having six such missions attached to it. If you beat all the missions, you unlock a final, alternate plane.Really, this game is decent enough gameplay wise, but it just doesn’t have much depth to it. It is really simple and there just isn’t much variety to it in the end, so you’re likely to get bored with it after a short time.If you got it as part of a bundle or something, it might be worth looking at, but it just isn’t worth buying – it just feels too simple to feel like an adequate stand-alone game.

												Cool idea, but not worth $10.This is nothing more than any general flash game, and runs about as well, if you're lucky.What promises to be a fun arcade shooter with customization is a bunch of options that are not particularly useful or good against everything, which leads you into positions of not being able to do anything, making the entire affair rather boring, overall.The sense of health is tried to be made intuitive through visuals but does not seem consistent in representation, some hits taking off 2 to 3 times as much than they do at other times.Good idea, but not much execution.

$2 Flash Game with a $10 Pricetag$10 for this?! Are you for real?! Got this at 75% off and I'm still not sure I got the money's worth... it literally plays like a free flash game you find online.-The game is fun for the first ten minutes but it gets repetitive very fast. You see all of what this game has to offer pretty quickly. The lack of enemy variety doesn't help. There's no motivation to continue playing except for the objectives on the plane pieces; 90% of which are easy as all f*ck and the other 10% are basically impossible without blind luck (Oh hey, that rhymed). If you're an achievement hunter that's into some mental masochism- here's your new kink-The only thing this game really has going for it is trying out differen't airplane combinations. I won't lie, it is fun seeing/playing the different combinations and reading the unique names for each one... but that whole experience is quickly sullied when you find out how repetitive it still ends up being. Thinking up some clever/funny names does not justify a $10 pricetag to me. Most of the combinations really don't change the gameplay at all either (only two that I can think of that really do any major gameplay changes the Melee body and the Underwater engine). Any other piece than those and you'll be flailing in the air firing aimlessly. -People are saying the controls are really tight- but I found them to be quite loose and floaty. Maybe because I used a controller? It hindered the gameplay signifigantly. It's nearly impossible to react to split-second situations... which is all this game is (a bullet hell of split-second situations). You'll be spending a majority of the time shooting frantically, not tactically. That's not to say you won't be shooting tactically (good luck taking down a battleship otherwise) it's just most of the time you'll be spamming your shots in a general direction hoping to hit something as opposed to actually aiming to hit something. I know, that's a factor in most (if not all) bullet hell/arcade shooter games like this, but it just seems way more apparent in this one. That it's entirely Luck > Skill. Dying every 2mins, just to respawn at the exact same point everytime, with the same slow start up everytime.... it gets monotonous fast. The controls could of helped that, but they don't. Least not with a controller.-Good luck if you wanna try rebinding keys. Misunderstanding the (easily misunderstandable) menu can get you to a point of being forced to manually find and delete an innocuous file in your /%APPDATA% folder... just to return the controls to the default settings... instead of a simple ""Reset to default"" in the options menu. Don't believe me? Go to the community hub and read the first Q&A on the FAQ. It's that much of a problem. I'd be willing to gamble that there's a recent post there with someone complaining and/or having trouble with the key bindings right now if you went and checked. The store page says ""Full Controller Support""... as far as I'm concerned, that's a lie-The ""cutscenes"" are a joke. Literally just flashes one picture when you kill one of the (7 or 8) different enemies for the first time...  I know it's an arcade game and all, but damn, why even bother if it's gonna be that terrible. Almost seems like a slap in the face after a certain point.-To top everything off you get a pretty ugly/stale looking theme and a lot of the other themes you unlock (the other only real attraction to this game (unless you're a closet nazi or something)) are either buggy or just hinder most situations by making enemies harder to see.If you're looking for a small, ""pass the time"" type of game just to blow a quick 10-15 minutes... I'd still say you can spend the time better beatin' off. Or, if you're tired from all that jerkin', you're still better off buying something like 'Bit Blaster' for 99c. 1/10th the price but 10x the fun. Ironic, too, because that game lists this one as one of the developers inspirationstldr -  This game is way overpriced for what it offers. If you really are sold about getting this then wait until it's on sale 75% off or more, or you'll probably regret it. "

												In a 9.0 review in EGM from 2014, Luftrausers is described in this way: ""Hearkening back to a bygone era of simple-yet-deep arcade games where you played for score, not story, Luftrausers takes basic ideas in concept and execution and turns them into hours of challenging, chaotic fun.""I agree with all the above, so you can stop there if you wish. Indeed, in Luftrausers, you get to make your grandfather proud, who served in an Unspecified War on an Unspecified Side as a decorated kamikaze fighter and managed to fly experimental laser-based *cough cough* Luftwaffe aircraft in the nostalgic era of Unspecified global conflict that spawned such innocent things as Popeye and nuclear fission and resulted in that same grandfather hiding in Rio de Janero for a few decades to conceive your mom and maybe eventually you too. It is a game that depicts acts of aerial valor and ultimate sacrifice on the wings of physically impossible aircraft diving in and out of the water to kill a lot of people for fun and high scores.I'm not trying to act surprised that this game called Luftrausers is what it is. It's supposedly funny, but I don't really get the jokes. If I throw on a fedora and crack a whip and punch the makers of the game in the face, I'll also go on record saying their game ""belongs in a museum!"" but specifically in the museum of Things A Lot of White People Thought Were Good Ideas, alongside a collective self-assurance that Resident Evil 5 is not racist or colonialist in any fashion, despite a macho government agent stomping through the Congo to accidentally shoot a whole bunch of dark people in the face for being diseased. I mean, as we all know, Starship Troopers is just an awesome stupid action movie about beautiful people fighting a good fight.I honestly don't get it and you are free to try to explain to me where all the elusive self awareness or ironies lie in the game. What are we supposed to make of this alternate reality version of Joust from Man-in-the-High-Castle America? What's the point of going after these aesthetics? Is the music that evokes the sound of countless oiled black boots marching only a ""gentle nod"" to a movement that murdered millions of people? Some idiot thinker coined the phrase ""all's fair in love and war"" and Luftrausers is low-key cool with donning a crisp SS uniform if there's savage arcade action to be had with an inbound bass drop. How quickly Dieselpunk gives way to Nazi-punk! If you pitched this game to me, I'd say it sounds fun. If you then showed me your private box of concept art next to pop-pop's secret insignias, I'd stop letting you out of my line of sight, expecting you to turn your feckless eyes on me to ask if I actually believe the Holocaust happened as some kind of secret handshake you expect me to accept.

												LUFTRAUSERS is addicting, let me start by saying that. You customize your plane, take to the sky, and have some bullethell fun.When I say it's addicting though, I don't mean it in a good way. It's addicting like heroin or crack cocaine is addicting, at it's core the game is barely playable.The game mechanics are fine, really, they are, you fly around in a way that no pilot should never ever have to fly (i.e. cutting the engine off to make a hard turn, spinning in circles just to engage at the last second before hitting the water), shoot at boats and planes, and later, shoot at dirigibles and submarines. Let me start with that first one: I saw one review of this game that described the game's controls as ""flawless."" This is in no way the case since it feels like someone took a bullet hell, stapled that vector graphic Tank battling game to it and called it a day. In no way should anyone have to control like this in a bullet hell.As I mentioned before, you can customize your plane, and this is neat. But this is where the game falters THE MOST. Most of the unlockable parts you, well, unlock, are absolutely useless. You can unlock a melee fighter body which can ram into thinks without even getting a scratch, but when you realize that this is a bullet hell you should be uninstalling the game. You can also unlock a few other bodies, but all of them are ♥♥♥♥ing useless with the exception maybe one or two. All of the other bodies basically cripple your plane in the hopes that you'll find the tactic fun or interesting. The weapons I don't really have a problem with. They all have their ups and downs with the exception of missile, which no sane human being would ever use, but for the most part they feel finished and polished. It's such a shame the dev didnt take the time to ♥♥♥♥ing do the same for the other parts you can apply to your plane.And then there's the amount of parts you can have. The game's store page boasts 125 combos to add to your plane, but when you factor in the undeniable truth that most of the bodies and engines are ♥♥♥♥ing useless, you're instead left with about 50 useful combinations. And, while 125 may seem like a lot of parts, YOU WILL UNLOCK THESE PARTS WITHIN AN HOUR, POSSIBLE EVEN LESS. THAT'S RIGHT, ALL OF THE PARTS WITHIN AN HOUR. I.E., THE BIG GOAL  OF THE GAME, IS ACHIEVABLE IN AN HOUR OR LESS. If they don't expand on the part customization section of the game, or at least improve what you get, I see no reason to even touch this game.Also, you get to unlock color schemes for completing the entirety of a challenge tree. They're eyesores. And the names of these color schemes are the devs' names backwards. ♥♥♥♥ING. CLEVER.The game's prequel was a flash game called LUFTRAUSER. With the tacked on S, it makes sense that this is not the only ♥♥♥♥ing thing that's tacked on. Don't buy this game.			"

What is it, and what's so good about it?Crunchy. Fast. Addicting. Simple.Much of the praise that you can attribute to Nuclear Throne is present in this arcade-style Vlambeer title, in which you play the role of a fighter pilot who flies a highly customizable jet. However! You fight a battle against insurmountable odds. A battle where your loss is inevitable. The question is, just how long can you last? How high of a score can you accrue?Every game begins relatively the same, with you launching out of a submarine and having to destroy some enemy fighter pilots who fly slow and fire ocassionally. Then, you'll see some boats who'll shoot in bursts of three. Before long, your screen will be full of barrages of anti-air flak coming from battleships and streams of machine gun shots stemming from ace-fighters. Once in a blue moon you'll see space-ships with lasers and if you're good enough to kill enough enemies you'll be having to deal with a Zeppelin overhead which serves as the boss of the game. Each enemy you kill moves the difficulty up a little bit, meaning there isn't difficulty spikes per se...it's really a gradual thing. Hardmode (called SFMT) just cranks it to the max off of the bat and makes the playing field more even (read as advantagous) for the AI.The controls boil down to the arrow keys and ""x"" to fire. Left and right are to turn your plane, while up is to accelerate in the direction you are facing. What's rather cool about Luftrausers is gravity. If you don't accelerate, you'll fall down to the water below and take damage over time for being submerged. Holding down x will allow you to fire indefinitely, but won't allow you to heal (which only happens when you aren't firing, thus potentially jeopordizing your combo). Your down arrow is only used for menus. This control set-up and gameplay style is remarkably simple, and equally so effective. Meaning keyboard users will find their frustration not in controlling the game, but rather from getting destroyed in SFMT mode like everybody else.And the music, just superb. The game only utilizes one ""song"" but drastically alters what it sounds like depending on what parts you use on your plane. I forget which part (weapon, body, propulsion) changes what instrument (riff, bass, percussion) but it does and it makes each combination sound rather unique. The crescendo of the song, which remains the same regardless of loadout, is perfect for divebombing a pesky battleship while your own aircraft is ablaze and getting out of there.To unlock parts and different colour schemes, you need to complete challenges. Like ""kill x number of fighters with this part"" , ""get x amount of points"" and what have you. Most are quite acheivable, some laughably so and others quite bloody aggravating.What of the bad?Despite all the customization you can do, there are some combinations that are just infinitely more effective than others. To the point where you'll just want to stick to a select few load-outs. For me, I found that builds that combined speed with constant fire (the laser in particular for it's combo-friendly nature) simply worked the best. To the point where you are able to survive indefinitely by speeding horizontally near water-level and avoiding higher altitudes and major vertical deviation.Some enemies rarely show up, namely the submarines (which have a microscopic chance to spawn when fighter-aces do) and the ""secret enemies"" (a fighter equipped with lasers and a sub with machine guns, also both tied to fighter-ace spawns). This wouldn't be much of a problem if some challenges weren't tied to killing 'em or killing 'em while at max combo. I've also noted that some challenges seem a tad broken, as the game sometimes doesn't track your killstreaks properly (kill x enemies while firing non-stop or without firing at all) despite the combo meter indicating the correct number.And apparently there is some clear-save glitch out there that others have encountered. I don't know how it happens and I fortunately have not stumbled upon it.So in conclusion...Luftrausers is an enjoyable, sometimes frustrating experience that'll burn a number of hours away and have you hungering for that high-score. Its visuals contain a good amount of character, its audio is crafty and any Time Pilot fans out there will probably christen it as the spiritual sequel also on steroids. If you are looking for ""story"", ""levels"" or ""dialogue"", you won't be getting it here. This is an arcade experience and not-so-serious flying sim, not a bloody fairy tale. Though in my head-canon, the main character is a future clone of the Red Baron fighting for control of the Principality of Sealand against an exaggerated Sealandic defense force in the year 1978Verdict9 USD worth of quarters hidden in the cockpit of a fighter plane out of 1 set of push-ups performed in a RAF training facility.

												Great time killer I must say. But I don't want to give it that kind of reputation. No, what  I want to say is that, IT MAKES YOU FEEL INVINCIBLE. Maybe its the soundtrack, or maybe it's the satisfaction of free-falling into a large group of planes and firing that one explosive round then flying away just as the music reaches its peak and the enemies explode into glorious ruble and points!! Easy to play controls and never gets boring. definitely worth 10$ absolutely amazing soundtrack. 10/10 from me :3			"

												This is where I wish Steam had some sort of ""middle ground"" for reviews, as it really does pain me to give this the ol' thumbs down.  However, I can't say I'd recommend the game as an overall experience at $10, despite all that it does oh-so-right.As many others have said, the game controls great, and it really is a lot of fun zipping around and shooting stuff.  The problem is that aside from the various part-specific objectives to complete, there isn't any progression when it comes to the actual game.  You pick your parts, head into combat, fight the same random assortment of the same seven or so enemies, eventually die, then repeat.  There aren't any other levels or anything, so the game ends up feeling more like a proof of concept for a much grander concept.  I saw all the enemy types in the game within about half an hour, unlocked all the plane parts before the two hour mark, and got tired of attempting the remaining objectives soon after.Still, it was really fun and unique before I hit the ""this game's really not going to throw anything else new at me, is it?"" point.  While ""leave them wanting more"" might work to some degree, I shouldn't be wanting as much more as I am out of Luftrausers.			"

												Luftrausers is a superficially simple, but perfectly tuned dogfighting game. Before your inevitable death, you dodge, weave and stall around the enemy hordes in your custom superplane, trying to take out as many of them as you can before the end comes. Every death brings the promise of higher rankings, and more unlocked options for your craft, each with their own challenges.Something like an even more arcadey version of the old Amiga game Jetstrike!.As with all Vlambeer titles, it's also terribly hard, especially in the later stages of challenges (I'll probably never unlock everything), but the design is perfect, down to the music (which remixes for every possible custom craft!).

												I've heard it described as asteroids with gravity, and simple as that description is, it is entirely acurate. The mechanics depend on your ability to maneuver through a dogfight in a 2D enviroment using only the ability to turn and acclerate. Where this game shines over its flash predecessor is in the ridiculous planes you can create and fly. With 125 different combinations and everything from an anti-gravity engine to a laser cannon on a WW2 bomber you'll find a combination that works for you and plenty that don't but are still crazy fun to fly.

												This game does three things I really like in games:1) A controlled physics sandbox2) Item synergy and emergent gameplay3) Multiple layers of depthLuftrausers is an extension of the flash game Luftrauser, which I played a ton. The first thing you'll notice is the striking visual style; not only is the sepia tone unique but also the way it blends shading and very low resolution rendering to create something that looks like pixels but has the feel and versatility of polygons. There are a ton of bullets on screen at once, defeated enemies blow up into bits, which then make splashes on the water, which by the way shows reflections. It's gorgeous.I guess the major gameplay mechanic is the jet system, which actually incentivizes not being held down constantly as without it you can turn on a dime. When you combine that with a gravity mechanic you get a really interesting physics sandbox of sorts. The other major mechanic is how you fire and heal; it again incentivizes not holding down a button constantly because you only auto-heal when you're not firing. Altogether these form a bullet hell unlike you've ever played before, with different strategies used for enemies below, above, and amongst you.What really sells it though is the upgrade system, you get different parts that you can mix and match and are very tangible, with a lot of weight given to their respective properties. This is where it's really emergent, as you can try new possibilities to test how the physics or other elements will respond. Yeah there are bad combos, but that only makes the great ones that much more special. There are even specific challenges curated for each and every part; it feels like a lot of thought went into each one. Also great is there's a lot of layers to the experience: at the beginning you'll play just to get a hang of manuvering about, and then you'll start trying to take out various enemies, like ships. All the while you'll be ranking up, which you can max out even if you're bad at the game. But then you're going to start unlocking ship parts, and testing each of those out. And then you're going to try to take out a blimp (which btw the first time is the most wtf moment, right?). And then there are missions to complete, and if you're old-fashioned you can always go for high score. There's a lot of content for such a single faceted game. My one complaint with the game does lie here, however, as I feel the difficulty spike after you unlock SFMT and start focusing on missions is a bit much and actually caused me to stop playing a game I would otherwise love to 100%, as there was just too little reward in the last half and probably too much in the first.

												When LUFTRAUSERS goes, it really GOES. Your fighter aircraft launches into the air. Give it a second or two, and a horde of smaller planes start chasing it. Battleships fire at you from below. And then larger planes start bringing down the pressure before a blimp threatens to obliterate you (that is, if you haven’t been obliterated already).Your challenge is to survive the frenetic action and take down these vessels as you weave through the enemy fire. The balancing act of returning fire and then letting off to allow your fighter reprieve to heal up is core to your gameplay.Experimenting with the different combinations of craft parts, completing missions and racking up higher and higher scores is all part of the fun here. LUFTRAUSERS is THE modern bullet hell-esque / arcade shooter game.			"

												Although LUFTRAUSERS is not a SHMUP in the traditional sense, I'm still gonna call it 'SHMUP ON DRUG' due to it's bullet hell and thre adrenaline rush.The gameplay is simple yet clever and addictive. You try to stay alive using customizable parts to suit your own play style. The 'stop-shooting-to-regenerate-health' mechanic keeps you focus on the most important part, KILL and STAY ALIVE, rather than putting you in difficult situations where you died just because you need to grab 'that healing item'The control is very responsive, although a bit confusing at first (if you're used to the six/eight axis free movement implemented in modern games), in LUFTRUASERS, you use LEFT/RIGHT to pivot/rotate your plane and UP to use the throttle/forward, but once you get used to it (and learned to master the control for the part combination you of your choice), you'll be going for the kill!AWESOME MUSICS			"

												I remember the first time I ever played this when it was still just a flash game. It was an OK game at best... just another typical arcade shooter adapted for use with web browsers. It certainly wasn't my favorite. The design seemed minimalist and the gameplay was not very satisfying, and the controls had quite a learning curve.Then, I saw this on Steam... and I thought, ""Why the hell not?""Honestly, that was a solid decision.Upon playing Luftrausers again, I felt an odd satisfaction in the way that the game had changed. The visuals were improved, albeit with the same graphical style, which really did feel pretty nice. I noticed also the in-game menus that the previous version lacked as well. When I launched my rauser for the first time, I struggled a bit with the controls but after a few tries I felt very maneuverable. The increased enemies and enemy variety made the game interesting enough to play.Upon returning to the hangar after a few unsuccessful missions, I found customizing my rauser and testing it out to be quite entertaining. I put together something that I thought would compliment my play style and I was not disappointed. After unlocking more parts, I prioritized experimenting to find a good combination. Needless to say, having the customization option that the prequel lacked is enthralling.Between the updated graphics, the customization, and the unique enemies, I would say that this is one of the best arcade games I have ever played. The amount of satisfaction is overwhelming. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys arcade-style shooters. I will be having lots of fun with this game in the near future.			"

The concept is simple and would feel more repetitive if it werent for the multitude of combinations in aircraft style. Controls feel as fluid as you can get in a game, every action on screen is either because you meant it or you made a mistake. The simple art style and music just tie everything up nicely. Dont expect to play this game for hundreds of hours (aint nobody got time for that shizz anyway) but its an awesome experience while it lasts.			"

												This game is just pure fun. It's very simple - all you do is fly around and shoot things - but it's the way it feels that makes it so much fun to play and almost impossible to put down. It has that one-more-round phenomenon going on.It's kind of a game that has to be experienced to fully get why it's so great, but watching some videos should give you a good impression. The planes are incredibly responsive and every weapon is super fun to use. There's a ton of unlockable plane parts too, which all make huge changes to how you might choose to approach the game. This, together with the different Achievement style missions attached to each part, gives the game a hell of a replay value.Visuals and music are also amazing. The minimalistic look makes it easy to see what's going on even when there's a million planes and bullets on the screen. The music is amazing and it changes dynamically (based on your plane I think?) so you'll never get tired of it.You might only end up playing Luftrausers for a few hours but they'll be some amazing hours.

												This is a fun pick up and play shooter with a nice retro aesthetic and fantastic music. The only downside I can see is that the in-game missions are very tedious when every combination has it's own mission set. I don't think I have the patience to do them all over and over.The extra hard difficulty approaches Shmup like bullet density and is a great challenge. Give it a shot when this is on sale!			"

												Look past the black bars either side of your screen, cumbersome menus and a framerate locked at 30 and you'll find a bona fide modern throwback on the level of Geometry Wars and Pacman CE DX. LUFTRAUSERS' levelling system will steal a good five or so hours from you before you've nothing left to do but chase high-scores. It plays wonderfully. This can't be over-emphasised enough. LUFTRAUSERS is so much fun to play. Every dogfight makes you feel like an ace. Every strafing run makes you feel cool. If you like polished, responsive mechanics, LUFTRAUSERS will be your jam.			"

												Although LUFTRAUSERS is not a SHMUP in the traditional sense, I'm still gonna call it 'SHMUP ON DRUG' due to it's bullet hell and thre adrenaline rush.The gameplay is simple yet clever and addictive. You try to stay alive using customizable parts to suit your own play style. The 'stop-shooting-to-regenerate-health' mechanic keeps you focus on the most important part, KILL and STAY ALIVE, rather than putting you in difficult situations where you died just because you need to grab 'that healing item'The control is very responsive, although a bit confusing at first (if you're used to the six/eight axis free movement implemented in modern games), in LUFTRUASERS, you use LEFT/RIGHT to pivot/rotate your plane and UP to use the throttle/forward, but once you get used to it (and learned to master the control for the part combination you of your choice), you'll be going for the kill!AWESOME MUSICS			"

												Luftrausers certainly does not break new ground. But then, it doesn't have to. It is the ultimate casual (ok, hardcore casual) title when you've got 5 minutes to waste, and not a second more. It is the distilled essence of what made the classic '80s arcade games fun. There's just enough customization and variation in the game to hook you for the short timespan  that you manage to stay alive (or should I say that this is the case when you're my age and your reflexes have slowed down to a crawl). I'd recommend it to any new dad, who doesn't have all that much time to invest into gaming, and wants some mindless distraction, somewhere between work and helping the wife with the latest addition to your family.

												Retro stylized, arcade, bullet-hell. Fast paced gameplay with short rounds pitting you, a lone pilot, against the unending horde of different planes, boats and assorted aircraft. Upon completing objective/challanges you unlock parts to cusotmize your plane with such as different weapons, engines and chassis, all of which alters how the plane handles and how you can effectively take out enemies. - Pros -High octane fun with gameplay that is easy to learn but hard to master. Each new part unlocked really alters handling and tactics. - Cons -Can become kind of repetetive.For the asking price it is at the very least a couple of hours of arcadey fun. If you like arcade games with a retro feel then you should play it.  "

												I haven't spent much time with this game as of yet but i love every time i do. This is a nice and simple game to pick up and play when ever you have some spare time but can easily take up hours of your time should you let it. The game is simply you flying your plane which you can customise your gun body and engine with several different unlockable parts for your plane.Most of the gameplay is based around the ability to cut your engine out making the flight feel incredibly satisfying. You can easily dart in and out of shots from numbers of planes ships and blimps making you feel truly in control of your ship. One of my favorite things about this game is honestly the soundtrack. Ever since the JSmith Marathon Stream i have owned the Vlambeer (As it was given away free) and i loved each of the demo'sfor this game and looked forward to the release of the game.Now the game has been out for sometime i am glad to say it was well worth the wait and im glad i spent my money on it.

Enter Luftrausers, which spices up the genera with an innovative control scheme. Now, instead of managing just your position, you need to manage your momentum and direction as well, both of which can be controlled independently, giving you the ability to pull off some white-knuckle manuvers.

												I was originally put off by this game because it looks like another ""retro"" indie game. After getting it as part of a humble bundle, I played a couple minutes and it confused the bejesus out of me. After about twenty minutes it started making sense and it is the craziest, retro-est, indiest game I've ever played, but not in a bad way.			"

												What strikes me most about this game is its sense of style -- and I don't mean something shallow here. ""Style"" goes not only for the graphics and music (though both are excellent), but also for the gameplay itself. Your warplane flies and tumbles in sharp but graceful arcs, allowing you to execute fun and deadly maneuvers to dodge seemingly impossible situations and bring down screen-fulls of enemies. The action is fast-paced and exciting without feeling mindless or overwhelming. While the basic idea of the game will seem very familiar -- in fact, Luftrausers would look at home in an old-fashioned arcade -- the actual gameplay experience ends up feeling quite refreshing and innovative.The graphics are simple, but very attractive, and the game definitely has its own unique look. There's a lot of detail hiding in these sepia-toned visuals. A little aircraft carrier is visible in the distance, launching those swarms of fighters you're battling. As your plane explodes, a skull-shaped mushroom cloud is visible for a split second, only to be blown away by the wind. You can tell that the art department put thought and effort into their work.The music is catchy, a kind of quasi-militaristic, but still fun, rhythm, and there's an interesting mechanic here. Your plane is composed of three different parts (weapon, body, and engine), and each has its own musical theme. The soundtrack for the game is actually the mix of these three themes put together (a mix that works quite well), and as you unlock new parts for each category, that element of the music will change, resulting in a subtly different, unique tune. It's subtle, clever, and another example of the game's attention to detail.The customizable parts also work quite well to keep the gameplay fresh. Each part you unlock will work in a completely different way, and will require a different play style. One of the body types allows you to ram enemies, but is fragile to all other damage, and will require nimbler flight and faster reflexes; one of the engines lets you plunge underwater, allowing you to evade pursuit beneath the waves, or attack battleships from below. It works to keep the game fresh. There's tons of combinations possible as you unlock new parts in each of the three categories. And each combination has its own name, highlighting the customized plane's personality! There's that attention to detail again.In short, it's a very fun, very stylish game, that seems quite simple, but has a many subtle details and fun quirks. It's perfect for quick but satisfying gaming breaks, but there's also enough here to keep you coming back, and to give you plenty of enjoyable gameplay time.			"

WARNING: This game is insanely hard! Really challenging and fun STG, with great controller support. It is score based: you always starts at the same point and have to survive the longest time possible destroying all the enemies you can. Soundtrack is almost entirely made of 8-bit style noises, what increases the nostalgic atmosphere from 80's arcade games. Obviously, graphics aren't revolutionary, but it fits the whole idea of the game and actually works!			"

												I first tried Luftrausers at Gamescom 2013. I was waiting in line to play the highly anticipated game Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number which I was looking forward to, and while waiting someone at Devolver approached me. The man asked if I wanted to try out Luftrausers. I saw the game and thought; ""♥♥♥♥, yet another arcade-shooter"" I really didn't feel like playing it, but I did so I wouldn't seem like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I'm glad that I'm not an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The game isn't for everyone, and I thought I was one of them. I was very wrong though.There isn't much story to the game, you control a jet figher with a mission to shoot down enemy planes and boats. For every kill you aquire you get points, which also adds on to a multiplier. You then have to stack up as many points as possible. When you get more points, you level up and can aquire new plane parts and weapons.The control is really smooth. For the first 5 minutes it might prove difficult to get into, but once it sits it flows really smooth. You will get a really satisfying feeling when you manouver aroung the enemies planes and projectiles.There isn't much more to say about the game really. The premise is simple; It's fast-paced, really fun, really addicting, and VERY indie. So if you're not a fan of small and fast paced indie-gems, this might not be something for you.			"

												Been waiting for this game ever since I heard about it when trying to find the older flash prototype for Luftrauser. It is incredibly fun to play and you can jump in and out of it whenever you want. The sound track is hugely improved, and the amount of damage you can take being shown is a huge improvement. The little audible ping when you get fully healed is a great touch. The Aces are really fun to fight against, pretty brutal when two spawn on you, too. I definitely recommend this game for anyone looking for a new game.			"

												Luftrausers is a game I looked forward to greatly and was met with disappointment. The game feels short of content and costs quite a bit. Upon reaching the blimp, you may think - like I did - that the game was just beginning, but that was just false hope. The game practically ends there. Beyond beating the blimp, there lies a more difficult mode in which the blimp spawns instantly, but there's no escalation. The challenges are also quite shallow and most are far too easy to beat. The addition of extra stages, such as beating the blimp with the super engine and going to space to destroy a spaceship or beating it with the underwater engine and going deep into the sea to defeat a submarine would have been interesting, easy-to-implement additions that would have given the game some much-needed beefing out. If you like constantly striving to beat high scores, you might still consider picking the game up in a sale.			"

												Another outstanding indie game published by DevolverThis game is incredible.  Great action-packed gameplay, cool stylized graphics, interesting mechanics (such as repairing your ship when not firing), groovy soundtrack that is interestly impacted based on what Rauser parts you use, etc.  The combat is frantic, and reminds me of an old Konami game called Time Pilot, mostly from a control perspective.  Another great thing is that the game not only encourages, but also rewards players for trying new Rausers, rather than just sticking with the same ones, via the soundtrack and the challenges that they have for it.  This game would work great on a handheld device, due to its quick gameplay rounds, chalenges, and unlockables.  This shouldn't come as a surprise for anyone familar with Vlambeer, best known for their smash hit iOS game Ridiculous Fishing.  I totally reccomend this, but if you have a Vita (which you probably don't) you might want to get it on that, just because the game seems like it would work well on a handheld.

This game is a fun and easy to pick up plane game that is easy to play, but difficult to master! The controls are customizable, but some types of controlling didn't work as well as a keyboard. The d-pad on a controller doesn't work well because you have to push up to thrust and left or right to steer at the same time; all while shooting! The control sticks work fairly well but it felt like I was turning slower and I kept trying to play it like a twin-stick shooter, but it doesn't boost the way you are pointing, only up boosts you. (If any of that section made any sense, Congratulations!)The gameplay is smooth and it feels great to lead 20 planes behind you and then turn around and blast them all away! And the game provides multiple ways in which to destroy everything in sight! Each plane part changes the name of your plane and changes some small part of the soundtrack, providing a different song every time.Overall this game is a blast to play and my only complaints are that some of the control schemes take a bit of getting used to because they seem different than the keyboard and that this game could have only been better with multiplayer- local or online- would have put this game totally through the roof! 9/10 Would Luftrause again...and again...and again!

												LUFTRAUSERS is a swift, explosive ♥♥♥♥fest of badassery. Every combination of fighter is fun, and is an instant refresh for any repetition you might have forced yourself into. The music is layered with every different part you choose, so it's easy to get attached to specific combinations and tunes. Looking at the leaderboard will make you feel inadequate, and hateful. There's no nonsense in between plays, so it's easy to get back in when you've been thrashed. Just moving in LUFTRAUSERS feels amazing. Depending on which engine you choose, you could get a nice sense of weight and heft, or make graceful, broad strokes through the air. The jet engine's snappy 180s are perfect for dodging a deluge of battleship bullets. Stay low to the water with armor and a laser, then ocsillate like a metronome of DEATH. I haven't tried every combonation, but I can't imagine going wrong. Play it, and feel your stomach drop out on a dive.			"

												Last March I discovered Vlambeer's Ridiculous Fishing and it became my first essential smartphone game.  What makes it so compelling is that the game starts simple, yet tough and the proceeds to reward you with dozens of neat perks to slightly break the game urging you to greater depths and new areas.Luftrausers has the same formula and it's freaking brilliant.  It controls not unlike an old Lunar Lander game.  It's tough to fly and in addition your being shot at from every direction.  But it suddenly rewards you with great plane customizations (""parts"") that break the game is slight, yet brilliant ways.  An engine that shoots bullets behind you, where you're not aiming.  Armor that lets you not take melee damage, at the expense of health.  An armor that explodes when you die, killing everything on screen.  The combination of the ""parts"" is up to you. In order to nudge you into trying new parts combinations there are a progression of missions for each part, and that's why you'll keep coming back for more.Vlambeer has once again shown that they are masters.

Controls are so fluid and natural, and the individual names of each Rauser are a really neat touch.Visually wonderful, and gameplay is at Valmbeers' standard of excellence. The music is fantastic too, each part of your Rauser triggers a different section of music.			"

												Quick paced arcadey dogfighting. Gets very tense but is very exciting too. By letting go of the throttle you continue flying but can turn very rapidly by throttling in the direction you want to go, which makes larger dogfights much more about agility and compensating for your lack of it than just getting hits off. The plane can be customised by switching gun, engine and body and every customisation radically changes how you fly and even changes the goals you have to complete to better suit what you've chosen. Also, the music changes depending on what you have equipped, which is a cool feature. However, if you're pretty good you should be able to complete the game in about 2 hours if not less and in this respect it feels like you might not be getting as much bang for your buck as you would with other titles at a similar price point. You may want to consider waiting for a sale before picking this up (which I still do highly recommend).			"

												This will mostly echo other negative reviews but here goes.Luftrausers in itself is a great game. The controls are tight, the action is fun, and the customization is interesting. However, it's insane that what amounts to a flash game that you would find for free on the internet is sold for $10 on Steam. After a couple of hours, this game completely lost its momentum. It started out great, but it's so shallow that it made me angry that I paid $2 for it on sale.The challenges get to the point that they are too hard to have fun. I don't know how to trigger blimp appearances or make submarines show up, but when the challenge involves destroying one of those specific enemies, the frustration becomes unbearable. It ultimately just becomes a repetitious chore, and the fact that there is only one song during gameplay (which starts over every time you start a new game) doesn't help.Luftrausers is the second game I've ever bought that wound up on my ""hidden"" list in my games library.

												Now I know what you are thinking, is this a port of an old unknown game? Is this some unfinished mess that used to be the pinnacle of gaming tech? Luftrausers is none of those things, but it is a new take on an old working concept and by god is it entertaining.  The game is created by an indie company Vlambeer who have also created tittles like Nuclear Throne and Super Crate Box. It's in the old arcade style and features all the colour variations of the time as well as unlockable themes in the game. You miss the old pink and blue outlook of video games? Well you can unlock it and play in pink and blue.   The game itself revolves around a simple concept of shoot everything that moves and don't get killed yerself. You have the customizations options of your Rauser which is the name of the plane apparently and you can change the wings body and tail of the plane changing how it handles and behaves. For example currently my favourite set up is the Biohazard MK 2 which uses the antigrav engine, nuke body and cannon for mahussive damage.  You don't really have a set goal in the game, you have plenty of missions to do and once you defeat the blimp with any means necessary, you will be able to turn up the heat in a new difficulty mode which I haven't dared to even go to yet as there is tons of crap flying everywhere straight from the get go.  Highly recommend this little indie tittle and It is worth the pocket lint on the bottom of yer pocket easily. It is fairly short and sure it has a few bugs here and there, mainly in the menu then in the game itself,but over all it is a breath of fresh air in to the current game market and for you younger players who didn't have the good fortune to grow up in the era of arcade video games, pick this up and see the best working take on an arcade shooter that really feels a remnant from the old days.

												I haven't spent much time with this game as of yet but i love every time i do. This is a nice and simple game to pick up and play when ever you have some spare time but can easily take up hours of your time should you let it. The game is simply you flying your plane which you can customise your gun body and engine with several different unlockable parts for your plane.Most of the gameplay is based around the ability to cut your engine out making the flight feel incredibly satisfying. You can easily dart in and out of shots from numbers of planes ships and blimps making you feel truly in control of your ship. One of my favorite things about this game is honestly the soundtrack. Ever since the JSmith Marathon Stream i have owned the Vlambeer (As it was given away free) and i loved each of the demo'sfor this game and looked forward to the release of the game.Now the game has been out for sometime i am glad to say it was well worth the wait and im glad i spent my money on it.

												Certainly we've all played a bullethell shooter at some point in our lives. However, the genera does tend to get samey after a while. Enter Luftrausers, which spices up the genera with an innovative control scheme. Now, instead of managing just your position, you need to manage your momentum and direction as well, both of which can be controlled independently, giving you the ability to pull off some white-knuckle manuvers. It may take some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be tearing up the skies with the best of 'em. Add to that a nice variety of enemies and a rocking soundtrack, and you've got one hell of a game!			"

												What strikes me most about this game is its sense of style -- and I don't mean something shallow here. ""Style"" goes not only for the graphics and music (though both are excellent), but also for the gameplay itself. Your warplane flies and tumbles in sharp but graceful arcs, allowing you to execute fun and deadly maneuvers to dodge seemingly impossible situations and bring down screen-fulls of enemies. The action is fast-paced and exciting without feeling mindless or overwhelming. While the basic idea of the game will seem very familiar -- in fact, Luftrausers would look at home in an old-fashioned arcade -- the actual gameplay experience ends up feeling quite refreshing and innovative.The graphics are simple, but very attractive, and the game definitely has its own unique look. There's a lot of detail hiding in these sepia-toned visuals. A little aircraft carrier is visible in the distance, launching those swarms of fighters you're battling. As your plane explodes, a skull-shaped mushroom cloud is visible for a split second, only to be blown away by the wind. You can tell that the art department put thought and effort into their work.The music is catchy, a kind of quasi-militaristic, but still fun, rhythm, and there's an interesting mechanic here. Your plane is composed of three different parts (weapon, body, and engine), and each has its own musical theme. The soundtrack for the game is actually the mix of these three themes put together (a mix that works quite well), and as you unlock new parts for each category, that element of the music will change, resulting in a subtly different, unique tune. It's subtle, clever, and another example of the game's attention to detail.The customizable parts also work quite well to keep the gameplay fresh. Each part you unlock will work in a completely different way, and will require a different play style. One of the body types allows you to ram enemies, but is fragile to all other damage, and will require nimbler flight and faster reflexes; one of the engines lets you plunge underwater, allowing you to evade pursuit beneath the waves, or attack battleships from below. It works to keep the game fresh. There's tons of combinations possible as you unlock new parts in each of the three categories. And each combination has its own name, highlighting the customized plane's personality! There's that attention to detail again.In short, it's a very fun, very stylish game, that seems quite simple, but has a many subtle details and fun quirks. It's perfect for quick but satisfying gaming breaks, but there's also enough here to keep you coming back, and to give you plenty of enjoyable gameplay time.			"

												Game can be  summed up like this:die 5 sec restart die 7 sec - restart, die 10 sec restart, get a cool upgrade - die 3 sec - restart.It's  not fun - the only thing that would make people want to play is to try and last a little longer and see if it makes a difference.I had friends play this while I watched as they professed they could do better and it was the same pattern until their face was soooo red from frustration they just got up and said "" you're right it blows"".Avg game time - 10 - 30 sec unless you are the.Upgrades - like prescription meds - you get one positive with a whole lot of negative.Sounds - some siren goes off most of the time indicating your about to die.Graphics - like the atari 2600 combat gamesAirplane game?  Falls into the  water just as much as flying (but you don't die for falling in the water). "

												This game is very arcadey; by that I mean if it cost a quarter to play you would be out hundreds of dollars very quickly. It also has the feel of many modern mobile games (the good ones) in its ""mission"" structure, its simple mechanics, and its combinatory building of airplanes.Basically you pilot a plane, shoot down other planes and boats, complete ""missions"" (i.e. destroy 10 boats total! destroy 3 aces in one combo! etc.) which unlock alternate weapons, bodies, or engines for your plane that have interesting abilities (this body makes it so you don't take damage running into other planes, this engine lets you survive in the water). These each come with their own missions to complete. The longer you survive on a level the more challenging it becomes; eventually an enormous blimp or laser-wielding super ships will appear. If you can destroy the blimp you unlock SFMT mode which is basically bullet hell. If you survive more than 30 seconds you're doing well.I thoroughly enjoyed the arcadey aspect of the game. A single play is quick, but you want to immediately jump right back in. The missions are a nice way to give you goals to work towards. I like that each combination of parts is given a unique name. It can be brutally difficult (especially SFMT mode) but it is a lot of fun.			"

												This game strikes a balance between a 10/10 mobile game and pc gaming. It's very simple and easy to understand - however the challenges get harder as you become better at it. This game is easy to sink a few hours into without noticing. Personally don't feel it's worth $10 but pick it up during a sale or a 'humble bundle' and you won't be disappointed.			"

 This has gotten my quality seal of approval. See why down below. If you like arcade style shooters, then this game is good. You have missions/objectives that you get with different weapons, armour, and engines. Once you complete some of them and level up, you might get some parts. You can mix and match and pick a mix all you like. One sad thing is that there is no stop button while playing, or, at least, it doesn't seem like it, so you'll have to use LAlt+F4. The first few achievements are easy to get, but there's an achievement you get for completing all of of the objectives, which also gives you the Urauser, which apparently is a nice and powerful ship.Things I would like to see:-ESC is for a menu that has 'Exit Game' 'Difficulty' and things like that.-An option to change the difficulty, as well as various difficulty levels.-Steam workshop for different weapons, engines, armours and enemy ships, as well as ability to make own maps with scripted events and properties, e.g. gravity, meteorites.-Options to have Arcade Style aspects on and off, an option in the main menu that you can toggle to turn off the black bars, and have less pixels/could just be split into two different options to allow for more variety.I would like to give this game an 8/10. Quite frankly, it's a really addictive game and a great way to kill time, as you will have to trouble getting the Urauser. I recommend that you get this game if you haven't already. "

												LUFTRAUSERS is a game near impossible to not admire at least a little bit during play. The combat is simlpy something to behold, as you zip across the sky in a beautiful, brown, bullet-filled sky while all hell breaks lose around you. It's a spectacle arcade SHMUP, and an extremely good one at that. It's really hard to not overplay how much fun the flying and shooting is in this game, it gives such an exhilarating and engaging feeling that's hard to find at this calibur. The game is recommendable on this aspect alone, the game is a prime example of a game that's just fun to play, you don't need any other motivation.Unfortunately, that's really all there is. The customization is limited, and a lot of the parts are kinda lack-luster in comparison to their counterparts. For example, I think the homing missiles, the cannon, the collision body, and bomb body are all utter garbage, their drawbacks all outweigh their benefits, and there are clearly better weapons. After for playing for just a few ours, the dominant strategy effect takes place and I see only three or four combinations worthy of my time. Randoming is fun as well, but a lot of the time you'll just get a back combination and die before you get anywhere really exciting. The names for each combination and mis-matched music tracks are really neat, but the novelty wears off as each match lasts just a few minutes. The missions are over in four or five hours and the SFMT, although gloriously hectic, gets a bit more frustrating than fun pretty quick. At the bottom line, the game sadly gets a little repetitive about four hours in.It's just that the game is so amazingly fun to play. Everything feels, looks, and sounds fantastic, it's a great experience. The price is a little steep for a game that gets a little old only four hours in, but if you don't mind fighting the same same seven enemy types over and over and over in rapid succession with stunted progression just for the sake of it, the game is simply and utterly fantastic.

Irony!) this is no reason not to play it. It's a game in the old style of play, where ""plot"" can be safely relegated to an instruction manual or outright ignored and the game caries itself on gameplay alone.In conclusion: it's $10.

												its a special kind of bullet hell that makes you reinvent the wheel in terms of maneuvering and return-fire.the big draws for me were the visual style, simple game design, and the modular soundtrack that changes when plane parts are swapped.in the gameplay department, the rausers are basically paper airplanes strapped to fireworks in terms of controls, rather than an actual dogfighting experience, but that's okay because it's tight as all get out.the big thing i'd have to point out  as a warning would be that the ""hundreds of missions"" advertised aren't actually missions, but more like side challenges implemented to your game runs, so to say? They're things like ""kill 20 planes in one run"" or ""destroy a battleship at MAX combo"" or things like that.the game design is entirely focused on a single kind of gameplay which can be altered but ultimately is the same goal every time: get kills before you get killed.I got this game for $8 with a customer loyalty coupon from Vlambeer and, if the new Metal Gear game hadn't come out on the same day, I would've seen myself playing this for a spell every few hours or so.It's addictive, but not wholly filling, so to speak.

												First off, it took only 15 seconds to download.The game is very simple and fun, it gets harder the longer you manage to survive.There are a ton of combinations available for your plane, and each one comes with its own slightly modified music.Also, the music is amazing, I listen to the soundtrack while I play other games, it's that good.But, either the difficulty ramps up a bit faster than it should, or I'm just bad... but probably the latter.

												Alright, so here's how this works. Its a bullet hell game. No story mode, nothing like that. You go out in your plane,  you shoot boats, planes, missles, etc, you die. a lot. however, you have objectives, like ""Kill 5 boats"". When you do these, you can unlock new parts that change the way it works. Your plane might have a laser and go really fast, or it could shoot 5 shots at once but be really tanky. there's even a body which is a nuke that kills everything when you die. Its the same idea, but with different ways to play and my god is it addictive. oh and ♥♥♥♥ battleships. but for the price, its alright. maybe wait for a sale, but yeah. :)			"

												Tons of fun. It feels great just being ""in"" the game, and the controls are so smooth. One thing that most people don't know is that the music is generated based on what parts you have equiped in your aircraft. Equipping a different engine will change a layer of the music, and a different weapon will change another layer, etc. Here's a great interview with the guy that did the music: http://www.classicalmpr.org/story/2015/01/29/top-score-jukio-kozilek-kallio-and-luftrausers "

												Simple, but oddly enough is quite addicting. The real enjoyment comes from mixing and matching different parts to create a ship that suits your play style. The challenges are pretty annoying to complete, however, and can lead to frustration (the ones involving submarines in particular fall into this, since you'll rarely see them). For the price low tag, though, it's worth the investment, and a good time killer.			"

												This fast paced game is sure to make your heart skip a few beats. It's challenging, but rewarding when you learn a new trick or take on a new situation. The game doesn't punish you for dying, you can just get right back in the action instantly. Plus, with interchangeable ship parts, there is a lot of experimentation to be had.Apart from the gameplay, the game also has one of the most interesting and polished art styles I have seen. Eveything looks beautiful and sleek, and the looks never become obtrusive or distract the player. It also has a wonderful soundtrack that changes according to the player's ship (very impressive).Of course a review would be incomplete without some cons.Complaint 1: When you customize your controls, the game still tells you to use the default controls.Complaint 2: The game looses it's replay value very quick.Complaint 3: The short bursts of gameplay is more a trait of mobile/phone games. It's not something you will find yourself playing for more than 30 to 45 minutes at a time. (Yet, if he did port the game to mobile, the small screen and touch controls probably would not work well...)			"

												Disclosure: I haven't ""Completed"" the game per se but have played enough to understand it.Luftrausers is a game where you play as a single plane taking on a near impossible task. It's you vs everything. The entire game is essentially a massive ""Objective: Survive"". There are roughly 9 different enemies in the game. The consist of different things like planes, ""Aces"" which are super-powered planes, and (Blank, not putting the full name, since it makes it a tad obvious what they do.) aces which are super powered aces. (Scary♥♥♥♥♥♥. There is also boats, battleships, submarines and the acemarine. (Real scary♥♥♥♥♥♥. Then you have the blimp. You're on your own to find out what each of these things do how ever. The game has a form of loadout system, using 3 parts. The gun, the body and the propulsion. Part of the fun in this game is finding different insane combinations and seeing how long you'll last. The body will for instance make you slower, but with more health, or faster with little health. I personally like to play as a glass cannon, going at mach speeds, but get scratched and I die. Can lead to some fun or frustrating playthroughs.There's enough variation to keep the game fresh how ever I can say from personal experience that I feel that it's a ""Go To"" game. When you have moments where you just want to hop on and play a game. No story or anything like that, just pure gameplay. Each playthrough is relatively short and depends on your skill. Sometimes a minute, sometimes 10. All depends on you. The standard music is pretty great. You'll be flying down from the sky, about to take out a battle ship and the music peaks up. It really feels great, when moments like that happens. There's 2 difficulty modes from what I can see. SFMT and Normal. Essentially, hear sirens and cry. You can periodically unlock new colour schemes for the game but I didn't think any of them match up with the original, how ever if you're looking for a new experience after playing for a while. Maybe just changing the colours is all you need.Conclusion, if you're looking for a game which you can keep coming back to, that doesn't take a lot of your time, yet has enough replay value for multiple playthroughs then this is a pretty decent game. I reccomend trying it out, and if you're still skeptical then wait for a sale. It was roughly 2-3 pounds when I bought it, which is a pretty nice price.			"

												This is where I wish Steam had some sort of ""middle ground"" for reviews, as it really does pain me to give this the ol' thumbs down.  However, I can't say I'd recommend the game as an overall experience at $10, despite all that it does oh-so-right.As many others have said, the game controls great, and it really is a lot of fun zipping around and shooting stuff.  The problem is that aside from the various part-specific objectives to complete, there isn't any progression when it comes to the actual game.  You pick your parts, head into combat, fight the same random assortment of the same seven or so enemies, eventually die, then repeat.  There aren't any other levels or anything, so the game ends up feeling more like a proof of concept for a much grander concept.  I saw all the enemy types in the game within about half an hour, unlocked all the plane parts before the two hour mark, and got tired of attempting the remaining objectives soon after.Still, it was really fun and unique before I hit the ""this game's really not going to throw anything else new at me, is it?"" point.  While ""leave them wanting more"" might work to some degree, I shouldn't be wanting as much more as I am out of Luftrausers.			"

												Surprisingly very fun arcade-y game.I'm always skeptical when in comes to pseudo-retro games, especially ones with lo-fi graphics, but obviously this is among the good ones. Basically, you pilot a plane, avoiding bullets & missiles while shooting down your many adversaries. As you play & achieve things, you are rewarded with new plane parts interchangeable in-between runs (runs are basically infinite and can only be renewed when you die). These parts are divided into weaponry, body & thruster.However, newer parts are not necessarily superior. All parts comes with their own pluses & minuses, based on the special property it carries (like a body made of a nuclear warhead, yeah, go figure). So it depends on your combination & how you play them.Equipping certain parts also means you are only allowed to unlock certain achievements. However, this can also be used to your advantage. For example, one of the achievement missions  for the basic machine gun would be to take down a battleship. This is to say, a rather impossible task. However, if you equip your plane with the nuclear warhead body while also equpping the machine gun, you can simply run into the ship to kill it, you, and everything else on the screen and there you have it. One battleship down while 'using' the machine gun.The game doesn't have any story, but it doesn't need one anyways. The setting is enough to give you the idea that it's a war, and you are just one among the many disposable soldiers.That said, due to the nature of the game it probably has low lasting appeal. However, due to its simplicity (doesn't necessarily mean it's easy though, far from it) it's also an easy pick up and play for when you just want to play a game but isn't in the mood to think much, but still wants more or less a challenge. If you don't have a game like that in your library yet, you might want to get this. "

Fair warning, though - I've never sat down to play 5 minutes and actually played ONLY 5 minutes. More like 10, 15, 20...Favorite parts combo: the Bob Raus. Not only do I find the name endlessly funny, but it feels great to play, even if it isn't the optimal choice. This game has almost no actual content and what it does have gets repeated every time you begin a new round, but hey, it makes me happy, and I really appreciate that. Thanks, Bob Raus!			"

												This game is almost as simple as a classic arcade game, yet there are some minor perks which beef the experience. Your main goal is usally to get the highest score while maximising your score multiplier, yet at the same time you are trying to complete mission objectives. finishing mission objectives unlocks parts which you can then use to customise your load out.The gameplay is fast paced difficult and satisfying. I would especially recommend it for someone who is building a modern day arcade machine or to someone who enjoys classic games like Galaga. If you are looking for a deep experience this game isn't for you, if you get frustrated quickly at games with a learning curve, don't bother. If you enjoy gaming challenge and find retro games nostalgic, this game is right up your alley. And the soundtrack is nice! "

												Need a quick break or a little burst of something fresh? Play 5 minutes of Luftrausers. Unless you're unreasonably good at this game, 5 minutes will be anywhere from 1 to 350 rounds of explosive breakneck kamikaze overload. Fair warning, though - I've never sat down to play 5 minutes and actually played ONLY 5 minutes. More like 10, 15, 20...Favorite parts combo: the Bob Raus. Not only do I find the name endlessly funny, but it feels great to play, even if it isn't the optimal choice. This game has almost no actual content and what it does have gets repeated every time you begin a new round, but hey, it makes me happy, and I really appreciate that. Thanks, Bob Raus!			"

The gameplay, music, and visuals are all outstanding. Keep it up Vlambeer! Buy this for sure!My one complaint is some of the challenges are very hard and the sfmt mode is extremely hard. For some people that will be a pro for the game but for me the difficulty was a bit much after getting through the first part of the game.			"

												Surprisingly very fun arcade-y game.I'm always skeptical when in comes to pseudo-retro games, especially ones with lo-fi graphics, but obviously this is among the good ones. Basically, you pilot a plane, avoiding bullets & missiles while shooting down your many adversaries. As you play & achieve things, you are rewarded with new plane parts interchangeable in-between runs (runs are basically infinite and can only be renewed when you die). These parts are divided into weaponry, body & thruster.However, newer parts are not necessarily superior. All parts comes with their own pluses & minuses, based on the special property it carries (like a body made of a nuclear warhead, yeah, go figure). So it depends on your combination & how you play them.Equipping certain parts also means you are only allowed to unlock certain achievements. However, this can also be used to your advantage. For example, one of the achievement missions  for the basic machine gun would be to take down a battleship. This is to say, a rather impossible task. However, if you equip your plane with the nuclear warhead body while also equpping the machine gun, you can simply run into the ship to kill it, you, and everything else on the screen and there you have it. One battleship down while 'using' the machine gun.The game doesn't have any story, but it doesn't need one anyways. The setting is enough to give you the idea that it's a war, and you are just one among the many disposable soldiers.That said, due to the nature of the game it probably has low lasting appeal. However, due to its simplicity (doesn't necessarily mean it's easy though, far from it) it's also an easy pick up and play for when you just want to play a game but isn't in the mood to think much, but still wants more or less a challenge. If you don't have a game like that in your library yet, you might want to get this. "

The menus are a little strange.+Super fun and easy to learn+Very replayable and has to coming back for more+Very challenging after a point but it's good fun to try to last as long as you can and complete task for more unlocks+Runs well even if you play on a battery powered trash can (like me) +They just added trading cards if you're into that (if not give them to me) +Lots of parts to put on your plane to make your ultimate death machine+AWESOME soundtrack that changes and evolves with your plane as you customize it, different parts add different beats and with certain combinations have cool songs- Strange menu loadout and you have to die in order to close the game as there is no option in a pause menu9/10 or 10/10  one my top ten favorites			"

												Luftrausers is a superficially simple, but perfectly tuned dogfighting game. Before your inevitable death, you dodge, weave and stall around the enemy hordes in your custom superplane, trying to take out as many of them as you can before the end comes. Every death brings the promise of higher rankings, and more unlocked options for your craft, each with their own challenges.Something like an even more arcadey version of the old Amiga game Jetstrike!.As with all Vlambeer titles, it's also terribly hard, especially in the later stages of challenges (I'll probably never unlock everything), but the design is perfect, down to the music (which remixes for every possible custom craft!).

												I've heard it described as asteroids with gravity, and simple as that description is, it is entirely acurate. The mechanics depend on your ability to maneuver through a dogfight in a 2D enviroment using only the ability to turn and acclerate. Where this game shines over its flash predecessor is in the ridiculous planes you can create and fly. With 125 different combinations and everything from an anti-gravity engine to a laser cannon on a WW2 bomber you'll find a combination that works for you and plenty that don't but are still crazy fun to fly.

												This game is a lot of fun, but there is a problem. The game's controls aren't the best. I have a hard time trying to switch parts on my aircraft because of the controls. Another thing I find bad about the game is the setting were you can change your controls, this is a really big problem and has to be fixed because if you click on the control customizer you will have a really hard time trying to fix your controls and there is no change to default thing which also needs to be added. Because of the sloppy choices for controls this has completly screwed up the game for me, I cannot play the game anymore because the game has no change to default button. "

												This game is freakin fantastic.  Do you want a quick but addictive game that has you constantly saying ""maybe just one more try"" over and over again?  Then this is made for you.Luftrausers is an arcade shooter in which you pilot a fighter plane.  The controls are incredibly simple: turn left, turn right, boost, and shoot, but that's all you need to feel like the world's coolest fighter pilot.  When you let off the boost, you enter a very floaty stall that allows you to turn more quickly to get those sharp turns and finely aimed shots off.  Using your boosters in combination with stalling to dodge bullets as they fly at you from all directions is one of the coolest and most gratifying things I have experienced in a game recently.What makes this game really great is the ability to customize your plane.  As you play, you earn parts that allow you to choose your plane's weapon, body, and engine, all of which have wildly different attributes that greatly affect the way that the plane works.  This lets you mess around and customize your play style, which I find to be incredibly fun.  Each part has its own missions/challenges for you to complete (ex: Kill 10 enemies without shooting them).  These missions help you level up faster and earn more parts, so you are encouraged to keep changing things and completing different missions instead of just sticking to one plane and never changing it.Let's see, what else is great about this game?  Well, the art style is lovely and the soundtrack is incredible.  What's even cooler is that different combinations of plane parts have subtle affects on both the art and the soundtrack!So, do I recommend Luftrausers?  Absolutely and wholeheartedly!  This game is so addictive that it will have you playing for hours, and for $10, I think that's a great deal.Still not convinced?  You can play a free version of this game here: http://not.vlambeer.com/luftrauser/It doesn't have nearly as many features, but it can give you a good idea of what the gameplay is like.			"

												LUFTRAUSERS, further to be known as Love Trousers, is simply fantastic and I would recommend to anyone.It's clean and simple, few controls and lacking in any form of complex HUD, all of which do what they need to beautifully.  It's a chaotic bullet hell mess, fast paced and you can feel the impact of the hits.  The use of the Stall mechanic allows you to use gravity for additional control, giving a feeling and sense of movement that can make you feel like an ace.  Momentum matters.Love Trousers is an frenzied action packed game that I find very satisfying to play- and will continue playing.			"

The graphics look simple, but the gameplay is phenominal. Fast paced, missions to complete, upgrades to get, levels to obtain, challenging enemies, which all gives the game a great amount of depth. I rarely write reviews, but I have to give this game two thumbs up. Well done!			"

												No exite butten, no option whatsoever, no tutorial... you dont need any of those. Just launch the game and have fun, the compat is very intensive and the soundrackt is just amazing.Actual review : You make your plane out of 3 components - weapon, body and engine. Every part has it own set of challenges assuring a nice longevity of the title. Every plane has it own theme playing and tbh the music is what's makes me going,  the theme evolves during the gameplay and motivates me to do my best to hear the most i can. Flying/shooting is easy to pick up but has enough dept, so you shouldnt be bored. Meh writing this is a waste of time just buy the damn game and experience it by yourself.			"

												like Geometry Wars for hipsters. -not the extreme-type of bullet hell shooter which makes it slightly more accessible -delightfully retro graphics and music (unlock and enable VIDEODREAMING mode and you'll really be tripping)-customizable loadouts where each part is technique waiting to be mastered. The soundtrack changes depending on what parts you pick is also a nice subtle touch-the challenges (reminiscent of Jetpack Joyride challenges) are also pretty accessible where you feel like you accomplished something instead of just grinding forever-nothing really more satisfying than having an epic run and it ending by yelling ♥♥♥♥ YOU and crashing into a blimp/battleship with the Nuke body-that feel when you launch the [CLASSIFIED] maybe not worth the full $10 for the amount of content but still a pretty good time			"

												Quite fun.  Not really a ""sit down and play for hours"" game, but great for a dogfight now and then, kinda like Hammerfight.  Unique achievements based on the aircraft type you choose, and plenty of options for different playstyles.  Not an easy game, either, especially if you go for the achievements while shooting (ha!) for a high score.  It started to feel a little grindy once I got to a certain experience level (I don't recall what leveling up does now; extra parts?) because I like to unlock gear and play with new options at a consistent rate.The color change options are fun to do now and then to make things look different.

												Picked it up in the sale, and i can definitely see this game becoming my go to pick up and play for a few minutes game until i find another game like that. Its fun to just go in and play a few rounds. Sometimes the round you just had  felt really good so you'll play another and that happens. The music is good i hope they release the soundtrack soon. This game has a really good feeling slingshot flying mechanic. There is delay with your control in flight so you have to take that into account when dealing with enemies. Your ship can also take a decent amount of shots before dying and all you need to do to heal up is fly around without shooting. Definitely recommend, I bought it for $5 but if i'd known how much I'd have enjoyed the game I'd have probably bought it at full price.Also you have to alt+tab out to leave the game and then right click and exit. So thats like a built in minigame puzzle that they put in for free			"

												Gameplay: Luftrausers is an arcade-style shoot 'em up based around completing objectives (e.g., score 5000 points, kill a battleship at max combo). Your aircraft's weapon, body, and engine are customizable, which encourages development of different tactics. Enemy spawn inconsistency adds variety to gameplay, but leaves certain objective completions largely in the hands of chance. Given the short life of a typical game (a few minutes), this randomness is tolerable, but I wish they would have toned it down. A high level of skill is nonetheless required, but you might have to burn though several dozen attempts before enemies spawn conducive to your current objectives.Controls: Compact and elegant: left, right, accelerate, fire. Body/engine build choices yield different maneuverability, all of which feel beautifully responsive (some more than others for intentional balance reasons). Controls are the highlight of Luftrausers, and fans of arcade classics will love it for its feel.Presentation: Its simple graphics are immediately readable, and aircraft-specific musical adjustments make me feel like an angel of death. Menu navigation feels a bit clumsy. My biggest presentation gripe is during the ""hardcore"" SFMT mode, where you are continuously exposed to a blaring air raid siren. The only in-game way to eliminate that overwhelming sound is to disable sound effects, which are crucial to high-level gameplay. The appealing minimalist aesthetic is offset by flaws which could have been easily addressed.			"

												At the time they were making Luftrausers, Vlambeer was dealing with the soul crushing experience of their previous game being cloned in the iOS marketplace.  Luftrausers is their expression of a personal hell, for our entertainment!An endless cycle of death, gunfire and explosions against a enemy that will never, ever die.  Only respawn in greater numbers.  The most effective weapon is a nuclear explosion that will take your enemies with you.  A dank soundtrack that sounds like a march to war, evolving as you play, but keeping the same plodding theme.After playing this game with headphones on a few nights ago, I achieved that wonderful state of videogameness where I could not leave the screen, putting all 3 settings on random and falling into such a groove with the constanly changing soundtrack that I found myself humming it all day afterward.

												Alright, so here's how this works. Its a bullet hell game. No story mode, nothing like that. You go out in your plane,  you shoot boats, planes, missles, etc, you die. a lot. however, you have objectives, like ""Kill 5 boats"". When you do these, you can unlock new parts that change the way it works. Your plane might have a laser and go really fast, or it could shoot 5 shots at once but be really tanky. there's even a body which is a nuke that kills everything when you die. Its the same idea, but with different ways to play and my god is it addictive. oh and ♥♥♥♥ battleships. but for the price, its alright. maybe wait for a sale, but yeah. :)			"

												Luftrausers is an intense bullet-hell that should be an essential arcade-style game for every Steam library. The game uses achievable, relatively simple goals to give purpose to your gameplay, offers simple, straightforward customization that allows for a diverse array of gameplay styles, and allows high accessibility to almost anyone as a result. The art style and sountrack both feel consistent and fitting for the game.Pros: Highly Accessible Simple, diverse customization Variety and excitement that lasts Consistent design and fitting soundtrack A simple, motivating sense of accomplishment as pieces are unlocked and objectives are completedCons: Controls take a while to get used to, but feel great once you've adjusted Options menu to change your controls is an input button pressing sequenceI'd recommend this game to just about anyone looking for an arcade bullet hell. The game is just slightly under becoming too chaotic for me, and I prefer it that way.			"

However, for me a least, it was just too difficult to kill the battleships, submarines etc .. I had no issues with all kinds of flying enemies but the ships down below were too hard to take down with the early level equipment available in the game, couldn't really progress much in order to get to the better equipment because the game started asking for hard to achieve objectives way too early in the game in my humble opinion ..I'm not going to play this game anymore but I still recommend it because it really is well made and fun to play, just not for the easily frustrated people.

												Despite its minimalistic graphic style, LUFTRAUSERS is a game that speaks to me on a very aesthetic level. Something about this monochromatic setting and great music makes me want to just fly around and enjoy views. The gameplay is perhaps not up to the challenge here, but it's fun enough to make me forgive ocastional crudeness. Overall, it's fun to boot it up for 30 minutes at a time and♥♥♥♥♥♥around in a supersonic jet with laser beam and self-destruction nuclear protocol.

												I played this game for 20 minutes or so, since I'm gonna force myself to play games that aren't CSGO.The game is very simple, almost no menu. All you have to do to restart when you die is press up on the joystick, and a new plane will launch.The controlls are a little awkward at first. Press up to go in the direction you are pointing, left and right to spin. You get the hang of it after a few rounds. Just as I thought I had enough after 3-4 rounds, I unlocked new plane parts. Now I can shoot a laser beam. And that made a huge difference. Then I unlocked engine parts that gave me more armor, move slower, and spin a little faster.From what I can tell, the game is simple, but enjoyable. Easy to pick up and put down. Would definitely recommend this game for $2-3 bucks, which I believe it goes on sale for. If you already own it, install it and play it for 30 minutes or so.			"

												Maybe I'm not on the same page as everyone with this game, but I feel like it's a borderline frustration game.The customization makes the gameplay very different each time you equip different items. This gives the game a lot more play time, and diversity, since the combinations of items makes you basically start from scratch to learn how to control your plane.You need to work very hard to feel satisfaction in this game. It takes a bit to get used maneuvering your plane, and even when you do the feeling of being shot down after a mere 2 minutes can be enough to make someone take a sledgehammer to their controller.For those who love an Asteroid-style Shmup and an intense challenge, get this game. For me though, the frustration of trying to progress gives me a similar feeling that I got while playing Flappy Birds.			"

												Picked it up in the sale, and i can definitely see this game becoming my go to pick up and play for a few minutes game until i find another game like that. Its fun to just go in and play a few rounds. Sometimes the round you just had  felt really good so you'll play another and that happens. The music is good i hope they release the soundtrack soon. This game has a really good feeling slingshot flying mechanic. There is delay with your control in flight so you have to take that into account when dealing with enemies. Your ship can also take a decent amount of shots before dying and all you need to do to heal up is fly around without shooting. Definitely recommend, I bought it for $5 but if i'd known how much I'd have enjoyed the game I'd have probably bought it at full price.Also you have to alt+tab out to leave the game and then right click and exit. So thats like a built in minigame puzzle that they put in for free			"

												At the time they were making Luftrausers, Vlambeer was dealing with the soul crushing experience of their previous game being cloned in the iOS marketplace.  Luftrausers is their expression of a personal hell, for our entertainment!An endless cycle of death, gunfire and explosions against a enemy that will never, ever die.  Only respawn in greater numbers.  The most effective weapon is a nuclear explosion that will take your enemies with you.  A dank soundtrack that sounds like a march to war, evolving as you play, but keeping the same plodding theme.After playing this game with headphones on a few nights ago, I achieved that wonderful state of videogameness where I could not leave the screen, putting all 3 settings on random and falling into such a groove with the constanly changing soundtrack that I found myself humming it all day afterward.

												Gameplay: Luftrausers is an arcade-style shoot 'em up based around completing objectives (e.g., score 5000 points, kill a battleship at max combo). Your aircraft's weapon, body, and engine are customizable, which encourages development of different tactics. Enemy spawn inconsistency adds variety to gameplay, but leaves certain objective completions largely in the hands of chance. Given the short life of a typical game (a few minutes), this randomness is tolerable, but I wish they would have toned it down. A high level of skill is nonetheless required, but you might have to burn though several dozen attempts before enemies spawn conducive to your current objectives.Controls: Compact and elegant: left, right, accelerate, fire. Body/engine build choices yield different maneuverability, all of which feel beautifully responsive (some more than others for intentional balance reasons). Controls are the highlight of Luftrausers, and fans of arcade classics will love it for its feel.Presentation: Its simple graphics are immediately readable, and aircraft-specific musical adjustments make me feel like an angel of death. Menu navigation feels a bit clumsy. My biggest presentation gripe is during the ""hardcore"" SFMT mode, where you are continuously exposed to a blaring air raid siren. The only in-game way to eliminate that overwhelming sound is to disable sound effects, which are crucial to high-level gameplay. The appealing minimalist aesthetic is offset by flaws which could have been easily addressed.			"

												Quite fun.  Not really a ""sit down and play for hours"" game, but great for a dogfight now and then, kinda like Hammerfight.  Unique achievements based on the aircraft type you choose, and plenty of options for different playstyles.  Not an easy game, either, especially if you go for the achievements while shooting (ha!) for a high score.  It started to feel a little grindy once I got to a certain experience level (I don't recall what leveling up does now; extra parts?) because I like to unlock gear and play with new options at a consistent rate.The color change options are fun to do now and then to make things look different.

												Alright, before we get going, I'll say right off the bat this game is not worth $10.  I might even go so far as to say it's not worth $5.  It's definitely a game you should only buy on special.Now, with that out of the way, let me start with the highlights of the game.The graphics and music are excellent, I love the artstyle in general, it's very quirky and has a lot of personality.  The game is quite difficult but simple to play.  Easy to pick up but hard to master certainly applies here, especially if you're going for points.Now, for the bad bits. Just a forewarning, this negative impression might be coloured by my own level of skill as opposed to the game itself, but either way, here's my two cents.Though the slightly random generation of the levels does help, it doesn't feel like there's quite enough enemy variety, at least not as far as I've seen. Perhaps there's much more if you survive for a lot longer than I have but I'm a bit skeptical.The game also focuses on combo chaining to get points but after you clear the initial wave of little planes that chase you, and if you're good enough to clear out the boats, all you're left with to kill are huge battleships, large aircraft that move much faster than you do and have a large chunk of HP, and massive airships (if you're lucky enough to have them spawn at all).  All of these enemies have too much HP for your weapons (which don't increase in power throughout your run) to take down with any efficiency, and the 5 second timer for your combo meter is not nearly generous enough for you to get more than a couple multipliers before it resets at this point.  There are still the cruise missiles and the fighter jets that streak around but the cruise missiles don't seem to appear in enough quantity and the fighter jets are too fast to reliably shoot down to keep up your combo meter.Also, speaking of the points, due to the flaws that I perceive in the score system, it is difficult to get much more than 10,000 points in a successful run, which makes unlocking new parts a bit of a grind since it can take tens of thousands of points to unlock a single new part for your plane later on.The final nail in the coffin for me is also the fact that, despite the interesting range of part combinations that you can put together in this game to create your own unique vehicle, I ended up feeling that the only combination that really worked to survive and score with any efficiency was pretty much laser + high HP body + fast engine.  The HP difference between the high HP body and everything else rendered almost all the other bodies moot, especially when you pair the high HP body with the high speed engine.  It doesn't help that all of these parts are quite literally the first set of parts you unlock.Clearly some of this is subjective in how you approach the game, how good of a player you are, and which body combination works for you (though it's hard to imagine how any of the other bodies could surpass the massive HP difference of the high HP body), but I feel the scoring system, weapon unlock system, and the unviability of the various part combinations makes this a frustrating experience that quickly becomes repetitive.

												Great arcade shoot-em-up. If you can't afford the ten dollar entrance fee, try out the free version of this game, it's awesome! Just search for Luftrauser and you'll find the prototype. Really, the full version of the game blows the original Game Dev Conference version out of the water, but it was built on the solid foundation of the original. One of the best Indie Games I had the pleasure of playing in 2014 and well worth ten dollars. If you like killing fake Nazis with nukes and jet engines powered by bullets, this is the game for you.

												From when I first turned it on, I was unable to stop playing this great game for nearly 5 hours. The feedback loop of just one more round along with no waiting time between attempts just kept me hooked. It has a great soundtrack, one which works amazingly when your ship is in critical condition while the heroic refrain of the track blazes high as you thread the needle through a sea of bullets and coming out the other side! The core gameplay mechanic is a joy to play with.There are some issues, notably it does not make it obvious how to quit (you can quit on the screen with the carrier). Along the same lines is that its menus could had done better. Some of the mission design (for unlocking new parts and giving you goals to work for) could had been better. Some of the parts could be better balanced. The game does seem perhaps a little too hard. Mostly in that I shake my fists at those pesky battleships, especially when more than one start stacking together to make a cloud of death. Yet as hard as the game is, you can eventually lock a mode which turns the game into a literal bullet hell.But on the whole, it was very enjoyable and a great surprise. Highly recommended.			"

Your main goal is usally to get the highest score while maximising your score multiplier, yet at the same time you are trying to complete mission objectives. finishing mission objectives unlocks parts which you can then use to customise your load out.The gameplay is fast paced difficult and satisfying. I would especially recommend it for someone who is building a modern day arcade machine or to someone who enjoys classic games like Galaga. If you are looking for a deep experience this game isn't for you, if you get frustrated quickly at games with a learning curve, don't bother.

												An awful trip to a level of graphics that really should be left in an era, circa 1988. I understand the 'retro' need for nostalgia - with the 16 (and sometimes) 8-bit looking games being popular these last couple of years. But this really does dip to a whole new level.Essentially, you've got a weird hybrid game of Altitude meeting a set piece from Access's classic Beach-Head from 1984. Except both of these games are more fun. Anyone old enough to remember another classic - Domark's 'Wings of Fury' will also find this familiar - but again, the shooting planes and attacking ships was much better done in that game too.I really am puzzled as to what they were trying to achieve with this game. It feels clumsy, truly horrific to look at in 2014 and just ultimately a very boring, bland game to play. I really wish I'd bothered with a demo before forking out even my measely £6.99 for it. It's not even worth that.1/10			"

												Luftrausers, no idea what it means. But who the ♥♥♥♥ cares!? It's ♥♥♥♥ing Luftrausers!! It's a welcome addition to the arcade bullet-hell genre, and it's a jackpot of interesting mechanics. In a way it's not even a traditional arcady bullet-hell game. It's a very modern take on the classics, with it's beautiful art style and smooth pixel-by-pixel animations. It is truly a work of art, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a quick achievment hunt, or a simple game to play on a laptop. Luftrausers is also available on Playstation Vita and Playstation 3 systems.			"

												Graphics: 2/3Story: 1/3Game Play: 3/3Re-playable: 1/1Sale Rate: 20%Total: 7/10Graphics: 2/3The game has a clean Indy style focusing on brown scale tones with large bullets so you can easily see and sometimes dodge them. Your own plane looks different enough that it doesn’t get lost in the fighting without it looking foolish and too cartoony. Everything sticks nicely to the games aesthetic and it looks like an old arcade machine. The music has a marching drive to it, spurring you on. There is a weird choice to make the music track restart on launch so if you die in the first few seconds you hear a sharp stop and start of the soundtrack. Story: 1/3As far as I can tell, you are a German flying the most advance plane in the war. The evil Churchill has declared total war against the Glorious Third Reich and only you can stop his relentless assault over the British Channel. You fight not for glory or for riches, you fight for the survival of your glorious empire. I don’t know if this was made by Germans or someone simply said, “you know what we have too much of? The Allies' side of the war. Let’s change that”. It wasn’t until I killed Churchill in his war zeppelin that I realized I was playing as a German. Since this is a score attack rogue-like game, it doesn’t need a story or dialog to keep you playing. It does create a uniform world with some discovery, but no great mystery. Doesn’t add or subtract anything.Game Play: 3/3This game gives some great visuals to assist your gameplay. There is no health bar or ammo, thereis only the dog fight. There is no power ups or health drops, there is only the dog fight. There are no allies, there is only the dog fight.When you take damage, the screen starts to get narrower. To regen health, you just stop shooting. Enemies play by the same rules as you, when you crash you lose health, but you might kill the enemy. To accomplish this your plane can maintain speed after you stop thrusting. So you can fly across the screen while shooting backwards. The controls are tight and the feedback is instant. There is a large number of supported play styles with different planes geared directly for. At a certain point you get a randomizer to add a new element to the game. Re-Playability: 1/1You unlock new parts after you die, and there is one plane body that turns you into a nuke on death. Should you buy it?I had more fun playing this with friends than alone. Has some good value, but nothing world changing, buy on a lite sale. Note: single player only, you need friends in room.			"

I spent a while dithering over whether it would be worth the £6.99 or whatever, planning to wait for a sale, but I've spent far more on games that turned out to be much less enjoyable.

Every part has it own set of challenges assuring a nice longevity of the title. Every plane has it own theme playing and tbh the music is what's makes me going,  the theme evolves during the gameplay and motivates me to do my best to hear the most i can. Flying/shooting is easy to pick up but has enough dept, so you shouldnt be bored. Meh writing this is a waste of time just buy the damn game and experience it by yourself.			"

												Luftrauser is in all likelihood the crunchiest and most enlightened retro shooter anyone in any dimension will ever play.  They give you the tools but you are your own worst enemy.   A perfect combination of simplicity, retro-style and skill.  Most importantly, the game feels fair.  When I lose I know I facked up.Possible con:  They changed the game mechanic from the original flash game.  It was really cool too.  Your plane went into a default counter-clockwise loop spin stall when not engaging engine which allowed for quick directional extractions.  They changed the mechanic to where there is no auto-loop when disengaging thrust..  now you control direction completely.  It's different but not better or worse.  So on that note I would seriously like to see an option to play in the original gamestyle which was quite compelling in its own right.P.S.  Hours played irrelevant.  Luftrauser is not shy in revealing its genius.			"

												Luftrausers is a game with amazing mechanics that is sadly marred by some borderline unreasonable objectives later into the game.The main draw of Luftrausers is the beautifully responsive flight mechanics that you get to play with. By cutting your engine, you are able to 'stall' in the air, allowing you to shoot in any direction as your craft is carried on by momentum and gravity. I cannot dexcribe how awesome it feels to arc over a battleship as you sweep your lasers across its hull, or blow a tailing enemy squadron out of the sky with a well timed cannon shot as you fall backwards towards the ocean.And yes, you do have multiple weapons options for your 'rauser' (plane). There are a number of customisation options for the guns, hull and engine, which are unlocked by some algorithm tied into mission completion (see next paragraph). Though these seemingly offer different playstyles, and add something to the progession model of the game, I found that a significant number of 'upgrades' were rendered (sometimes immediately) obsolete by clearly better alternatives. For example, the nuke body will perform a screen-wipe upon your death, but these kills aren't added to your score. So apart from helping with a small number of 'kill [X]' missions, this body is outright inferior to the body that just buffs your health.Though the game is designed to be like an old-school arcade game where the main objective is maximising score, for each customisation option, there is a short string of sub-objectives. This allows you to attempt up to three missions per round, with one tied to each part of your ship. These start out simple enough, but by the end of the game, they start to veer into RNG-fests that require you to kill high-profile enemies at maximum combo. (Kill an enemy to increase combo by 1, maxes at 20; standard combo fare.) But this requires you to get a max combo, sustain a max combo, and do the three-plus attack runs required to kill the target, all in one round. If that target never spawns (submarines, you scumbags!), then tough luck. I found myself quitting out of frustration after a while, because of the increasingly unreasonable missions.Having made those complains, I am still reccomending this game. Why? Because 'I cannot dexcribe how awesome it feels to arc over a battleship as you sweep your lasers across its hull'. I don't know how much life you'll get out of this game (it depends on your levels of perseverance), but it's cheap and the core mechanics are just that good.			"

												In Luftrausers there's only one ""level"". You can play this level with a great number of different planes, and each plane has its own missions, for example: ""Destroy 2 Battleships""; ""Kill x enemies without taking damage"". It's incredibly addictive, as you unlock new ship parts and tick off the missions assigned to each one. The controls are tight, yet fluid, and when you pull off deft maneuvers to weave through a hail of bullets, while at the same time taking down the swarm of fighters giving chase, you know you're a dogfighting ace.The game is brimming over with that Vlambeer 'juice': screenshakes, masses of particles, crunchy explosions and tactile mini-pauses and slowdown. This is a game that feels great to play, and that's why a single level has kept me playing for hours. Granted, when the missions became very difficult, I started to feel like I was putting more into the game than I was getting out of it. At that point it was time to hang up my aviator's hat and goggles. But to have kept me playing so long with so little is testament to the mechanics and polish of the game.			"

												I remember the first time I ever played this when it was still just a flash game. It was an OK game at best... just another typical arcade shooter adapted for use with web browsers. It certainly wasn't my favorite. The design seemed minimalist and the gameplay was not very satisfying, and the controls had quite a learning curve.Then, I saw this on Steam... and I thought, ""Why the hell not?""Honestly, that was a solid decision.Upon playing Luftrausers again, I felt an odd satisfaction in the way that the game had changed. The visuals were improved, albeit with the same graphical style, which really did feel pretty nice. I noticed also the in-game menus that the previous version lacked as well. When I launched my rauser for the first time, I struggled a bit with the controls but after a few tries I felt very maneuverable. The increased enemies and enemy variety made the game interesting enough to play.Upon returning to the hangar after a few unsuccessful missions, I found customizing my rauser and testing it out to be quite entertaining. I put together something that I thought would compliment my play style and I was not disappointed. After unlocking more parts, I prioritized experimenting to find a good combination. Needless to say, having the customization option that the prequel lacked is enthralling.Between the updated graphics, the customization, and the unique enemies, I would say that this is one of the best arcade games I have ever played. The amount of satisfaction is overwhelming. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys arcade-style shooters. I will be having lots of fun with this game in the near future.			"

												Luftrausers is a nice little arcade shooter. It's good at what it does, and doesn't pretend to be anything more than that. There's no multiplayer, no additional maps or levels, no extended story or plot. Just fly around and shoot as much stuff as you can until you inevitably die.The various upgrades to your weapon, body, and engine types have meaningful differences on gameplay and strategy. There are enough combinations - and incentives to try them - that the upgrade system extended my playtime longer than I expected. I found it to be a pretty difficult game, and it took a while for me to get acclimated to the control scheme, but I had fun with it. Easily worth the price of admission.			"

												Luftrausers is a fantastic shooter with simple controls.  As you play the game you can customize your rauser in 3 parts.  The gun, the body and the engine.  Each different part that you select unlocks different goals to achieve.  Ultimately there is one level with different challenges.  The more you play the more you level up (Max out at lvl 10).  You will also unlock different color schemes.  After you unlock everything you are essentially playing for points.  So design your favorite rauser and see how you compare to the rest of the world.  The gameplay is fast and fun.  The music is actually pretty good.  It is half German national music with hints of techno.  The original color scheme gives you that old timey WWII feel.  You can definitely put a good number of hours in on this game trying to unlock all the achievements and get a kick♥♥♥♥♥score.  I highly recommend it.			"

												Flying these love trousers is really quite the experience, this is an exhillerating bullet hell shooter with controls that shake the norm. However i find the game to be rather lacking for its $10 price tag, when compared to what else can be bought for that same price, though I picked it up during the sales and i recommend Luftrausers when its $5 or less.

												This game is very fun, fans of bullet hell will LOVE this. It has some very cool visuals and a lot of chalange. You have 5 diffrent Guns, Bodys and rockets to pick from, each having there own fun poking name.This game does have one down side though, it needs more varation in enemy, it would be more then awesome if they released a DLC that added the following:3-5 new techs unlocked secretlyAfter killing a submarine, normal fighters would spawn with a change (diffrent body, diffrent gun, diffrent speeds)A new Dog fight mode, were only the special ramdom enemies spawnedThis would make the game SO SO much better, and would add so much more replay value to it, i hope the publishes listen and get to work on somthing to add to it.

												Fast paced, brutally difficult, and beautiful 2D arcade shooter. You play as a customizeable superweapon and lay waste to clouds of fighter planes, massive battleships and submarines, and more. Pros- Tight control scheme with very enjoyable ship physics. You can easily pick up the game and play with little experience, and you will also learn fancy maneuvers over time and get better at dodging the clouds of bullets and missles that await you.- Great ship customization, switching ship weapon, chassis, and engines. 125 possible ships (and one secret ship). - Nice 2-D art, with fantastic animations. In addition to the sepia classic color scheme are a range of unlockable color palettes which cause varying amounts of eye-bleed.- Cool chiptune soundtrack. Your choice of ship parts will change elements of the soundtrack.- Nice missions system for every ship part. Completing missions unlock other ship parts, ship backgrounds, and the punishing difficulty mode SFMT.- I have personally never experienced any glitches or performance issues. HOWEVER: When you collide with another ship, gametime runs a little more slowly, and you might think the game is running choppily when this happens.Neutral- Extremely difficult gameplay, especially in the SFMT mode. Game quickly becomes a bullet hell, with quite low ship health and only one life per run. You will die a lot. You might like that.- Two difficulty modes, normal (quite difficult) and SFMT (virtually impossible). SFMT is difficult enough that you get an achievement for surviving 13 seconds.- Purely arcade game modes, no story or multiplayer to speak of. It's all focused on the gameplay, so if you don't dig the 2D dogfighting there's nothing here for you.- Some aspects of the game are very RNG based. You can get missions to kill specific enemy types that appear some small percentage of the time.Cons- Two of the achievements are obnoxiously difficult to complete, compared to the others. You will complete every achievement except the last two by 15 hours of gameplay. You might want to contact a mental health representative before attempting to complete all achievements in this game.- Visual style can make it difficult to understand exactly how damaged you are. You will often think you can eat a bullet that ends up killing you.- While the chiptune soundtrack can be customized a bit by your decision of ship parts, it has the exact same structure and mostly sounds the same between different combinations. It can be tedious, but you can always mute it and play your own music when you get tired of it.OVERALL: For me, this is an excellent arcade game. Great controls, exciting difficult gameplay, and a really fun aesthetic. All of my cons, besides the first one, are pretty small gripes, and for me the neutral points are mostly positive. I highly recommend the game.			"

												First off, let me just state two facts:1) Luftrausers is a fast-paced arcade-style flight game in which you pilot a modular fighter plane in the service of a military organization whose design is unsettlingly reminiscent of a certain loathed German political and ideological regime dating back to the late-1930's to mid-1940's.2) Luftrausers has been widely praised as stupidly fun and brilliantly well-designed and no one seems to give a rat's patoot about the disturbing portion of fact #1.The game's premise is simple enough: you're a fighter pilot whose plane is launched from a battleship in enemy territory, and you must shoot down every plane, ship, and other you encounter. Downing foes in rapid succession nets you combos to your score, making it much easier to get high scores through efficient and deadly play. Although you can repair your plane by simply getting out of combat and not shooting for a little while, you can only take a few hits before you explode; flying through enemy fire may be the right move on occasion, but try to avoid taking more than you can handle. Regardless, play is swift and death is rarely very painful - after each game, you get a quick recap of your stats, see what you've unlocked, adjust your equipment loadout, and get back in the skies almost immediately.Apart from the constant compulsion to get higher and higher scores, the game throws other goals at you as you progress, such as downing X of a certain unit in a single game, or as part of a single combo, or while entirely uninjured. Completing these unlocks new modular components for your plane (guns, engines, or body types), each of which significantly changes gameplay and comes with its own brand new set of goals.The actual gameplay is simple, but demands heavy skill. Pushing Up activates your thrust, causing you to move in whichever direction you're currently facing. Left and Right turn your ship, and X rains blazing death upon your foes. You only recover while not shooting, and you can turn much more quickly without the thrust on, so combat winds up involving a lot of careful boosts, drifting past the enemy, lighting them up with gunfire, and then boosting away to safety. Or it might involve vicious divebombing and kamikaze tactics. Or strafing from a safe distance. Or letting your rear-mounted guns take out pursuing units. As I said, your build drastically changes the gameplay, and you'll often find impossible goals become possible when you trade one component out for another. Chasing goals is surprisingly satisfying, and it's easy to lose several hours to the game when you only intended to play a couple quick rounds.Whether the game's disturbing aesthetic pushes or breaks the boundaries of good taste is up to you. There's no actual Nazi symbolism or behavior present in the game, but the motif and vibe is certainly there, and if that's a deal-breaker, that's perfectly understandable. However, the game itself is polished and perfect enough that I really do have to endorse it to anyone who enjoys unorthodox bullet hell gameplay and one of the finest customization systems in gaming history.

												This is a really great game for someone who wants an arcade game fix. This game really is a master piece when it comes to the arcade format of easy to learn but hard to master. The plane parts are all equally useful to the player and just depends on style with a few execptions we will get to latter. The overall experience is highly enjoyable with some complaints that are really annoying but do not take too much from the experience, first of all the menu is horribly designed, some parts are useless like the rockets which are no doubt the single weakest weapon in the history of virtual warfare and geting a good score is dependent on the enemies appearing in the right amounts leaving you wondering sometimes if they got the right post code. Like I said at the beginning this is no doubt a good arcade game, just be willing to endure a few annoyences.			"

												An arcade-style game where you fly your highly-customisable plane around, destroying all of the other planes and avoiding being destroyed. The plane can be changed in many ways (spraying bullets, dropping bombs, shooting missiles, better impact damage, faster, tougher, etc) which you unlock and then choose three for each game. Each plane part has associated challenges, so there’s always lots of to do and if you have trouble with one challenge, you can just try another. All the enemy plane types are in silhouette form, which makes them very easy to distinguish.One issue I had with the game is that the spawn patterns seem very random. Which can ruin a multiplier in a way that feels unfair.Overall a great game - nicely designed and the music fits very well.			"

												Luftrausers is the fairly new arcade shmup from Vlambeer, who is best known for their indie hit Super Crate Box. Super Crate Box, while a freeware and simplistic shoot-em-up game that probably isn't meant to have hours dumped into, was incredibly addicting and I ended up spending around 17 to 18 hours playing it total (not counting the occasional rainy afternoon I pick it up for a half hour before not touching it for weeks). Even though I haven't put that much time yet into Luftrausers, I'm already hooked. The gameplay starts off simple: you're a plane. You shoot other planes and boats. That's it. However, once you start really playing it and improving your game, you start unlocking new parts and start finding some more enemies, such as the blimp. And that's where Luftrausers shines: it's so simple, yet gets more ""complex"" as you get better. The gameplay, while pretty much the same thing over and over and over again, is enthralling and addictive--it's suffice to say that Luftrausers is one of those ""just one more turn"" ordeals. Enemy AI is well-done, often moving around and dodging your bullets, causing you to really make split-second strategical decisions so that you don't crash and burn. The customization is rich and adds a whole different aspect not seen in other Vlambeer titles, with dozens of engines, weapons, and bodies to scroll through and unlock. And the soundtrack is amazingly done, a truly beautiful symphony that adds to the ""gotta move fast!"" aspect of the game. My only gripe is the lack of VARIATION in the gameplay, but it's one that I'm not losing sleep over.OVERALL, Luftrausers is a gem of a game, combining sleek and stylish bullet-hell gameplay with well-done customization and a brilliant soundtrack. If you love Vlambeer or shmups, this is not to be missed. 9.5/10			"

												A fun and twitchy, full-on arcade game that can be played for minutes or hours. Really good stuff here, but perhaps best bought on sale. You may just play it a few times and then never come back, or sink your teeth in and try to unlock everything. Fun and chaotic shooter, worth a look.			"

												It's a good infinite blasting game. Odd graphics choice (especially in alternative color modes), but it does its job. Good fun. Will point out though that this is probably the same type of game where you'll pick it up, play it for a while, then get bored in relatively short order and put it down, but I think it'll probably good for the odd blast every so often.

												Luftrausers is a very fun and addictive game.This game brings me back to the days of playing Flash games during school hours, so it was some bonus nastolgia points. Deffinetly a game where ""just one more game"" turns into 10 games. Games don't take long so it's a good game to play when you have a short amount of time.Luftrausers is currently $9.99 on Steam. I unfortunatly do not recommend this game for that price, but would deffinelty recommend picking this one up during a sale or from a bundle.Overall a really fun game.			"

												From when I first turned it on, I was unable to stop playing this great game for nearly 5 hours. The feedback loop of just one more round along with no waiting time between attempts just kept me hooked. It has a great soundtrack, one which works amazingly when your ship is in critical condition while the heroic refrain of the track blazes high as you thread the needle through a sea of bullets and coming out the other side! The core gameplay mechanic is a joy to play with.There are some issues, notably it does not make it obvious how to quit (you can quit on the screen with the carrier). Along the same lines is that its menus could had done better. Some of the mission design (for unlocking new parts and giving you goals to work for) could had been better. Some of the parts could be better balanced. The game does seem perhaps a little too hard. Mostly in that I shake my fists at those pesky battleships, especially when more than one start stacking together to make a cloud of death. Yet as hard as the game is, you can eventually lock a mode which turns the game into a literal bullet hell.But on the whole, it was very enjoyable and a great surprise. Highly recommended.			"

												Redo-Review: Luftrausers is a fast paced arcade style 2D sidescrolling bullethell shooter. (Alot of adjectives I know.) The unique plane customization plus the individual tasks assigned to each piece adds a level of progression that is not usually seen in this style of game. Graphic style is basic but the sillouhetes are easy to distinguish. Music is some of the best out there for Indie Games, with each plane part you change out changing the song a little bit,9/10: Amazing fast paced Indie Game. Get it if you like dying alot.			"

												Luftrausers, no idea what it means. But who the ♥♥♥♥ cares!? It's ♥♥♥♥ing Luftrausers!! It's a welcome addition to the arcade bullet-hell genre, and it's a jackpot of interesting mechanics. In a way it's not even a traditional arcady bullet-hell game. It's a very modern take on the classics, with it's beautiful art style and smooth pixel-by-pixel animations. It is truly a work of art, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a quick achievment hunt, or a simple game to play on a laptop. Luftrausers is also available on Playstation Vita and Playstation 3 systems.			"

												I would absolutely recommend this game if it was working properly. When it was functioning it was a great, fast paced, shootemup with an interesting graphical style that was very pleasing to the eye while being very simple. The challenges presented for each module of your aircraft produce a feeling that makes you want to keep playing. Unlocking new parts and guns for the planes reaches its peak rather quickly, if you play well, so having teh challenges present for each module is a nice touch.Thats all the good i will say...The game worked great on my work pc, which was the first pc i installed it on. However when i tried to install the game on my gaming rig later that day, the game would not even get past the opening screen without one of about a million different variations of glitches would take over, making it impossible for me to even start flying a plane.I tried every fix i could find online and contacted the developers through the message boards. I got one reply initially that led me nowhere and then the devs seemed to just give up and abandon the message boards entirely. After not getting any replies to my numerous posts and questions for over 4 months i gave up on that idea. Tried to contact them by email. No luck. Back to fixes. you guessed it, no luck whatsoever.Now i am stuck with a game that will only run on my work computer, that i can scarcely play only when i am on break or waiting around after work for a colleague. The worst part is I ACTUALLY ENJOY THE GAME!I just wish the devs would have helped me and plenty others in fixing the major issues with the game. It really bothers me that i hear thorugh the boards they are already working on their next game (so now my hopes for fixing 'Luftrausers' is really crushed) and ""have been through some tough times"" so try to understand. I paid $10 for an indie title, so quite frankly, I ain't understandin' sh*t!			"

												Luftrausers is a nice little arcade shooter. It's good at what it does, and doesn't pretend to be anything more than that. There's no multiplayer, no additional maps or levels, no extended story or plot. Just fly around and shoot as much stuff as you can until you inevitably die.The various upgrades to your weapon, body, and engine types have meaningful differences on gameplay and strategy. There are enough combinations - and incentives to try them - that the upgrade system extended my playtime longer than I expected. I found it to be a pretty difficult game, and it took a while for me to get acclimated to the control scheme, but I had fun with it. Easily worth the price of admission.			"

Lots of customization. The only downside is in the beginning I found myself getting killed all the time by the computer... this is a bad thing because as quickly as my skills grew, so did my level. The enemies got harder and Im still finding myself getting killed just as easily now as i did my first playthrough. Though its frustrating, I cant peel myself away from it.

												Fantastic game for everyone.  Game is easy enough for casual players,  but has another harder mode incase you enjoy pain.  If you don't like the color scheme, you can unlock new ones bew completing mission specific to your Rauser.Can be a pain to close the game.  You have to die before the game lets you exit.8/10, would play again.			"

												Quite fun.  Not really a ""sit down and play for hours"" game, but great for a dogfight now and then, kinda like Hammerfight.  Unique achievements based on the aircraft type you choose, and plenty of options for different playstyles.  Not an easy game, either, especially if you go for the achievements while shooting (ha!) for a high score.  It started to feel a little grindy once I got to a certain experience level (I don't recall what leveling up does now; extra parts?) because I like to unlock gear and play with new options at a consistent rate.The color change options are fun to do now and then to make things look different.

												A lot of people say that this game is a pile of crap and that it's too hard or too short or too repeatative. Most of them would be right; It's too hard, too short and too repeatative, but it's definitely not crap in my opinion. What evolved from a flash game had come a long way into being what it is today. I've played many bullet hells in my youth, from Striker 1942 to Project Raiden to Sylpheed and even the unknown gem that is Einhander. Most of these games however are just lightweights to the REAL bullet hells that are out there hoever; you know, the kind that have and entire screen lit up with bullets that can only be dodged by a simple tap of the joy-stick as you just BARELY make it through alive? Yeah those make this game look like a chump, but never the less, this is in fact a bullethell game.It's a hard game to play, but the controls are simple to master. Once you understand the controls and have a better understanding of the momentum/physics mechanic of this game, the rest is left up to ou and your own skill. This game starts off simple enough, but eventually gets harder and hard with each enemy you destroy. You'll pit off against standard planes, PT boats, Jets, Battleships, Aces, missle launching submarines and even enormous blimps that act as floating combat stations. I found the game quite enjoyable, well when I wasn't trying to unlock new weapons by completeing acheivements for each peice of equipment I had on my plane. However even though I found the game quite fun, it has it's small flaws.The game only has on song, but the song changes depending on what chasis, weapon and engine you equip. After a while of progress eventually the enemies will start to swarm you, making it almost impossible to maneuvar as enemies seem to focus more on ramming into you with no self preservation and filling up the air with a seemingly endless barrage of bullets. Some acheivements are almost impossible to complete unless the stars are aligned just right and the gods of chaos decide that it is time for you to complete your calling. Finally, once you destroy a blimp, the supposed ""boss"" of this game, the enemy will begin to throw everything at you INCLUDING the kitchen sink and then some, which is where you'll realize that this is pretty much when the game's decided ""ok it's over, you can die now.""Even with these flaws though, the gameplay feels so good and satisfying, and the music is pretty catchy, even though it's starting to lose its touch. It's a guilty pleasure that I love to play and I would recommend that people play it at least once.			"

												Although LUFTRAUSERS is not a SHMUP in the traditional sense, I'm still gonna call it 'SHMUP ON DRUG' due to it's bullet hell and thre adrenaline rush.The gameplay is simple yet clever and addictive. You try to stay alive using customizable parts to suit your own play style. The 'stop-shooting-to-regenerate-health' mechanic keeps you focus on the most important part, KILL and STAY ALIVE, rather than putting you in difficult situations where you died just because you need to grab 'that healing item'The control is very responsive, although a bit confusing at first (if you're used to the six/eight axis free movement implemented in modern games), in LUFTRUASERS, you use LEFT/RIGHT to pivot/rotate your plane and UP to use the throttle/forward, but once you get used to it (and learned to master the control for the part combination you of your choice), you'll be going for the kill!AWESOME MUSICS			"

												Luftrausers certainly does not break new ground. But then, it doesn't have to. It is the ultimate casual (ok, hardcore casual) title when you've got 5 minutes to waste, and not a second more. It is the distilled essence of what made the classic '80s arcade games fun. There's just enough customization and variation in the game to hook you for the short timespan  that you manage to stay alive (or should I say that this is the case when you're my age and your reflexes have slowed down to a crawl). I'd recommend it to any new dad, who doesn't have all that much time to invest into gaming, and wants some mindless distraction, somewhere between work and helping the wife with the latest addition to your family.

												Extremely fun.  While I can see some fighting the controls a bit at first, it doesn't take any time to become comfortable with the  game.  While never totally easy, the game does start out at a very comfortable pace, but the action and difficulty can ramp up very quickly.  There are a few various parts to choose from when it comes to plane customization, but not an incredible amount.  This game is less about having a ton of options and things to do, it's focused and fun.  Menu controls are different with how you navigate the games various menus, but again it nothing that isn't quick to adjust to.I had one problem when I first got the game, I believe it didn't launch right or something like, which was easily fixed by disabling the Steam overlay.  But that was quite a while ago so the issue may be fixed.  But that's it in terms of issues.Overall it's an extremely fun and challenging game, that is way more addictive then it has any right to be.10/10			"

												""If you like that or any kind of arcade bullet hell games, or, Hell, if you even like planes, Pick this up""This was a free to play flash game. A very good one infact, a game based around the ability of stalling. They made it just right, so that you can dodge bullets by stalling and really get that feel of being an ace pilot. Now this game is a proper title, with the same graphics, but there is so much more replayability than before and the last game had a good amount.The first improvement is the options now is a thing. Allowing you to change several things, but also adding filters, which you dont see in many games. Secondly their are new units, that make the game so much more harder, even though it seems that the units from the last game seem to be stronger aswell. Lastly and so far my favorite, CUSTOMIZATION! You have several parts to put together a plane, that each has a diffrent playstyle and an interesting name to boot. This allows you to build a plane of your liking, Want a tankier plane, put a bigger hull, Want a lazer instead of a machinegun, You got it! This really adds alot to a game that was free.The game is also hard as nails. It is difficult to get anywhere, and several runs will be more than certain. Not only that, after you defeat a boss that will not be named, You get SFMT mode, which i cannot begin to touch due to the bullet hell that it creates. Aside, I have not seen a single bug, no crashes, no misplaced textures, This is probably due to the simplicity, Graphics are very basic, This means it pretty much run on anything, probably even a calculator, but its slightly hideous.If you are questioning if its worth it, type up luftrauser in a search engine, find the flash version. If you like that or any kind of arcade bullet hell games, or, Hell, if you even like planes, Pick this up, its cheap and is extremely replayable.8/10			"

												This game is a lot of fun, but there is a problem. The game's controls aren't the best. I have a hard time trying to switch parts on my aircraft because of the controls. Another thing I find bad about the game is the setting were you can change your controls, this is a really big problem and has to be fixed because if you click on the control customizer you will have a really hard time trying to fix your controls and there is no change to default thing which also needs to be added. Because of the sloppy choices for controls this has completly screwed up the game for me, I cannot play the game anymore because the game has no change to default button. "

												A nazi plane game of questionable historical accuracy. It's also ♥♥♥♥ing tough as balls like jesus christ I've been playing this for the past 10 hours trying to unlock as much as I can from it and I'm pretty sure it's physically impossible to 100%.Gameplay is very fun and rewarding when you actually get good enough to start killing things. The different ship combinations keep it interesting. Enemies could use more variation, or being able to customize the weapons (+damage/-rate of fire, for example, would be nice...). The sound track is very good.Mute the sound effects if you ever make it to the ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that is SFMT mode. Awoooogah.			"

												This is where I wish Steam had some sort of ""middle ground"" for reviews, as it really does pain me to give this the ol' thumbs down.  However, I can't say I'd recommend the game as an overall experience at $10, despite all that it does oh-so-right.As many others have said, the game controls great, and it really is a lot of fun zipping around and shooting stuff.  The problem is that aside from the various part-specific objectives to complete, there isn't any progression when it comes to the actual game.  You pick your parts, head into combat, fight the same random assortment of the same seven or so enemies, eventually die, then repeat.  There aren't any other levels or anything, so the game ends up feeling more like a proof of concept for a much grander concept.  I saw all the enemy types in the game within about half an hour, unlocked all the plane parts before the two hour mark, and got tired of attempting the remaining objectives soon after.Still, it was really fun and unique before I hit the ""this game's really not going to throw anything else new at me, is it?"" point.  While ""leave them wanting more"" might work to some degree, I shouldn't be wanting as much more as I am out of Luftrausers.			"

												Tons of fun. It feels great just being ""in"" the game, and the controls are so smooth. One thing that most people don't know is that the music is generated based on what parts you have equiped in your aircraft. Equipping a different engine will change a layer of the music, and a different weapon will change another layer, etc. Here's a great interview with the guy that did the music: http://www.classicalmpr.org/story/2015/01/29/top-score-jukio-kozilek-kallio-and-luftrausers "

LUFTRAUSERS style of art really caters to the laid back shoot and fly experience.  You can play as intently or as lazy and still have a BLAST.  The music varies with how you decide to build your RAUSER.  Each variation is given an interesting name adding a light back story of science and destruction.play LUFTRAUSERS with a game controller.

												One word review: a-RAUS-ingWhat can I say about this game that will do it justice? Short answer. Buy. This. Game.Luftrausers is a 2D, bullet hell, combo based dogfighting game which sees you playing as what is essentially a Nazi fighter pilot in not-so-WW2. You customise your ""Rauser"" with tonns of different parts that have their powers and weaknesses, like an engine that lets you fly underwater, but will receive more damage if you fly too high, or a body that explodes like a nuclear bomb when you die, allowing you to do a last ditch Kamikaze into one of the many enemies wanting to ruin your day. You can customise your weapon system, your body, and your engine. Depending on which parts you pick will affect the soundtrack in drastic ways. Overall, this game is an absolute gem. Any PC can run it, it has a load of replayability, an amazing soundtrack, slick retro visuals and at a fiver, its a bargain. Pick it up and get Rausing.			"

												This game is freakin fantastic.  Do you want a quick but addictive game that has you constantly saying ""maybe just one more try"" over and over again?  Then this is made for you.Luftrausers is an arcade shooter in which you pilot a fighter plane.  The controls are incredibly simple: turn left, turn right, boost, and shoot, but that's all you need to feel like the world's coolest fighter pilot.  When you let off the boost, you enter a very floaty stall that allows you to turn more quickly to get those sharp turns and finely aimed shots off.  Using your boosters in combination with stalling to dodge bullets as they fly at you from all directions is one of the coolest and most gratifying things I have experienced in a game recently.What makes this game really great is the ability to customize your plane.  As you play, you earn parts that allow you to choose your plane's weapon, body, and engine, all of which have wildly different attributes that greatly affect the way that the plane works.  This lets you mess around and customize your play style, which I find to be incredibly fun.  Each part has its own missions/challenges for you to complete (ex: Kill 10 enemies without shooting them).  These missions help you level up faster and earn more parts, so you are encouraged to keep changing things and completing different missions instead of just sticking to one plane and never changing it.Let's see, what else is great about this game?  Well, the art style is lovely and the soundtrack is incredible.  What's even cooler is that different combinations of plane parts have subtle affects on both the art and the soundtrack!So, do I recommend Luftrausers?  Absolutely and wholeheartedly!  This game is so addictive that it will have you playing for hours, and for $10, I think that's a great deal.Still not convinced?  You can play a free version of this game here: http://not.vlambeer.com/luftrauser/It doesn't have nearly as many features, but it can give you a good idea of what the gameplay is like.			"

												LUFTRAUSERS, further to be known as Love Trousers, is simply fantastic and I would recommend to anyone.It's clean and simple, few controls and lacking in any form of complex HUD, all of which do what they need to beautifully.  It's a chaotic bullet hell mess, fast paced and you can feel the impact of the hits.  The use of the Stall mechanic allows you to use gravity for additional control, giving a feeling and sense of movement that can make you feel like an ace.  Momentum matters.Love Trousers is an frenzied action packed game that I find very satisfying to play- and will continue playing.			"

The more you play, the more stuff you unlock. The gameplay goes by really fast but press up and your going again. This game screams 'I'll do just one more run'.			"

												I play a lot of 'pixel' games and I also play a lot of randomized games that torture you, such as Risk of Rain and Rogue Legacy. This game, it ranks pretty high on ease of learning, customizability, adrenaline-inducing action, and fun. And to top it off, I've only played about 20 minutes so far			"

												this is a shooter set in a futur/retro war. your mission is to take down as many enemy as you can before going down.by doing so, you will unlock parts for your craft, improving your fire rate, defense , speed. each part is spécifique though, and each bonus come with a malus. expect a fairly high degree of difficulties in the first try.this game have somes greate ideas and a some greate feedback. also the music is dinamic, based on the upgrads you have chosen !this game is strong in my opinion.note though that at the moment, there are somes bugs in the interface (witch is designed for console).there is a free early version on the dev site also.If you are an indie fan, this game is a must have, as it have some really good ideas.I expect around 5 hours of gameplay for me.

This game is a fun and easy to pick up plane game that is easy to play, but difficult to master! The controls are customizable, but some types of controlling didn't work as well as a keyboard. The d-pad on a controller doesn't work well because you have to push up to thrust and left or right to steer at the same time; all while shooting! The control sticks work fairly well but it felt like I was turning slower and I kept trying to play it like a twin-stick shooter, but it doesn't boost the way you are pointing, only up boosts you. (If any of that section made any sense, Congratulations!)The gameplay is smooth and it feels great to lead 20 planes behind you and then turn around and blast them all away! And the game provides multiple ways in which to destroy everything in sight! Each plane part changes the name of your plane and changes some small part of the soundtrack, providing a different song every time.Overall this game is a blast to play and my only complaints are that some of the control schemes take a bit of getting used to because they seem different than the keyboard and that this game could have only been better with multiplayer- local or online- would have put this game totally through the roof! 9/10 Would Luftrause again...and again...and again!

												LUFTRAUSERS is a swift, explosive ♥♥♥♥fest of badassery. Every combination of fighter is fun, and is an instant refresh for any repetition you might have forced yourself into. The music is layered with every different part you choose, so it's easy to get attached to specific combinations and tunes. Looking at the leaderboard will make you feel inadequate, and hateful. There's no nonsense in between plays, so it's easy to get back in when you've been thrashed. Just moving in LUFTRAUSERS feels amazing. Depending on which engine you choose, you could get a nice sense of weight and heft, or make graceful, broad strokes through the air. The jet engine's snappy 180s are perfect for dodging a deluge of battleship bullets. Stay low to the water with armor and a laser, then ocsillate like a metronome of DEATH. I haven't tried every combonation, but I can't imagine going wrong. Play it, and feel your stomach drop out on a dive.			"

												LUFTRAUSERS is a game near impossible to not admire at least a little bit during play. The combat is simlpy something to behold, as you zip across the sky in a beautiful, brown, bullet-filled sky while all hell breaks lose around you. It's a spectacle arcade SHMUP, and an extremely good one at that. It's really hard to not overplay how much fun the flying and shooting is in this game, it gives such an exhilarating and engaging feeling that's hard to find at this calibur. The game is recommendable on this aspect alone, the game is a prime example of a game that's just fun to play, you don't need any other motivation.Unfortunately, that's really all there is. The customization is limited, and a lot of the parts are kinda lack-luster in comparison to their counterparts. For example, I think the homing missiles, the cannon, the collision body, and bomb body are all utter garbage, their drawbacks all outweigh their benefits, and there are clearly better weapons. After for playing for just a few ours, the dominant strategy effect takes place and I see only three or four combinations worthy of my time. Randoming is fun as well, but a lot of the time you'll just get a back combination and die before you get anywhere really exciting. The names for each combination and mis-matched music tracks are really neat, but the novelty wears off as each match lasts just a few minutes. The missions are over in four or five hours and the SFMT, although gloriously hectic, gets a bit more frustrating than fun pretty quick. At the bottom line, the game sadly gets a little repetitive about four hours in.It's just that the game is so amazingly fun to play. Everything feels, looks, and sounds fantastic, it's a great experience. The price is a little steep for a game that gets a little old only four hours in, but if you don't mind fighting the same same seven enemy types over and over and over in rapid succession with stunted progression just for the sake of it, the game is simply and utterly fantastic.

												This game has roughly thirty seconds of actual gameplay in it and you will repeat those thirty seconds roughly five hundred times. This is a sentence you write about bad games with terrible design that you should never, ever touch.This is not one of those games. Those thirty seconds have included pirouetting through the air while burning people alive with a laser, blasting myself across the sunset using an engine made from a giant gun, and plowing my plane into the bow of a battleship and coming out the other side leaving only an exploding, smoking wreck behind me.Go.

A refreshing arcade game [KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]It's a nice arcade game (that escalates to ""bullet hell"" pretty quickly) where you play as a customizable World War II fighter and you have to destroy enemy planes, boats, battleships and a couple of bosses.The feature of this game is the ""gravity"" so you also have to account for it when flying.Too bad the game doesn't last long: after a couple of hours, as you unlock all the fighter's parts (weapons, body and engine... and not so many as the game description says), there is not much left to do.You can try to finish all the ""missions"", but some are ridiculous hard and the gameplay will just be the same. Again and again.A missed gem.Best played with KeyboardRecommended Buy Price < 5$Score 7/10 "

												Luftrausers is a nice little arcade shooter. It's good at what it does, and doesn't pretend to be anything more than that. There's no multiplayer, no additional maps or levels, no extended story or plot. Just fly around and shoot as much stuff as you can until you inevitably die.The various upgrades to your weapon, body, and engine types have meaningful differences on gameplay and strategy. There are enough combinations - and incentives to try them - that the upgrade system extended my playtime longer than I expected. I found it to be a pretty difficult game, and it took a while for me to get acclimated to the control scheme, but I had fun with it. Easily worth the price of admission.			"

												Fun for some time but some of the missions are a little annoying (depending mostly on luck, sometimes) and the ""hard-mode"" you unlock after a little while is just crazy.Like really crazy.Like you just die right away since the spawning of enemies in your spawn area is random.I suggest to buy this when it's under 4$.

												What a pleasant surprise.I obtained this game through a bundle. Upon looking at the graphics and gameplay, I thought this game would be awful. But, because I had purchased this game, I thought I might as well give it a try.Five minutes into it, I was giggling to myself and jumping with every close call that I narrowly avoided. It's a fun little game.The upgrades are a neat feature that allows for different playing styles. The controls handle very well, which is a real make-or-break for these types of games. I look forward to playing this arcade-style game some more.			"

												An arcade shooter with simple graphics and butt loads of fun.Dance through the air while playing with your engine and making incredibly satisfying turns and kills.With your first few runs being only seconds long this game will get you as soon you get the hang of it.Unlock new parts for your plane which will change the way you play completely. You start out with a regular plane that accelerates and shoots in a straight line, but soon you will fly a laser firing torpedo that mainly destroys by flying straight through the enemy planes and battleships.This quick arcade reaction game is good for a few quick runs or for biting down for hours trying to unlock the next engine.

												You are a fighter pilot in a WW2-esque, sci-fi setting. The gameplay is that of a bullet-hell shooter, but instead of facing one direction like space invaders, you're constantly flying against gravity, and swooping over the water to get a shot at ships. What makes this game so compelling is the tight controls. There is no story, so don't look for one. Kill stuff, dodge bullets, and find the weapon/body/thrust system that works best for you.My favourite is combining the armoured body with a super thruster back (that reduces turning ability when thrusting), and the massive flak cannon attachment on the front. Everything dies right away, but I don't.			"

												Fast-paced and very satisfying to play.If you've played the free flash version then you've pretty much played this. I expected more levels and stuff but all that the paid version adds is customizable planes, full-screen, and a spooky hard mode for masochists.In short: not worth getting if it isn't on sale.P.S they forgot to code an 'Exit to Windows' button and there are no graphics options whatsoever.

												Honestly, I enjoyed the game, but I simply cannot recommend it at the current price as there's simply too little content.The gameplay is tight and quite fun, but it unfortunately gets old pretty quickly, and 'challenges' such as destroying a set number of planes or ships do little to add to replayability. The soundtrack is barebones; there's ONE song which is 'remixed' depending on which plane parts you're using, which is a lazy, albeit creative way of getting around making an actual soundtrack.If you're big on games with dogfights then this might be your thing, but I would wait for a sale otherwise.

												Luftrausers is a game that you can instantly boot up and play without prior game knowledge and just instantly play because  of the dirt simple controls that are very fluent. yet it is VERY difficult to to do good at as you will find when one minute into the game you will have a bagillion things flying at you in all directions and all of them will try to kill you.To compliment this the Sepia stained 16-bit style graphics are simple yet beatiful the music fits in very well with the game as it gradualy builds up to a climax while the opponents in the game build up in terms of numbers			"

If you have a few Mins to spare, its a good game to drop-in for some satify pixel destruction.			"

												Only two game-modes, both survival style, but the controls gameplay music and art are polished to perfection and there is a great depth of content in the ship customization; each different part involves a different and viable playstyle. There truly are 125x2 ways to play the game. Coming up with strategies to suit different planes is fun! Missions, progression and unlockables are executed very well: you won't have to grind for parts, but you won't have everything dumped on you at once, and the harder missions are challenging without being frustrating.It's a bit like Altitude, but in well-polished fast-paced shmup form. Far prettier too.			"

												A game about aerial dogfights in a 2D Retro art style. Personally, I'm not a fan of the controls but the customization options allow for a lot of fun to be had in a relatively simple game. I may be slightly biased here as the developers, Vlambeer, are also responsible for one of my favourite games, Nuclear Throne. All in all however, I still feel this game is worth it, even more so, if you can get it on sale. Also, the little jokes in fighter's names is a nice touch.			"

												Not a bad game, very interesting take on the bullet heaven genre. For starters, you're not limited by moving in one direction. You can fly through the sky freely, shooting at whatever you'd like. Another unique thing is recovery by cease fire. It might sound simple to stop shooting and heal, but it's much more difficult to do so when you're surrounded by enemies. Customization is fun, building your own war-machine, each combination with it's own name. Over all the game is very fun.			"
