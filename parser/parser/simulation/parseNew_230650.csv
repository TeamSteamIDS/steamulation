												I'm a big fan of games that try to do something different. Lords of Football attempts to marry the football management experience with a sims-lite player management experience. How successfully it manages that seems to vary on a person by person basis. It may not be spreadsheety enough for the Football Manager fans and not Simsy enough for Sims fans.Personally, I love it. The unlicensed football-lite side reminds me of Sensible Soccer and the Simsy side... well yeah obvious. The point is, the resulting gaming experience is pretty unique and great fun. What's more, the dev team is taking the usual indie route of listening to players and working hard to improve aspects of the game. Consider the newly released database editor allowing you to fully customize all the teams and players to your heart's content.Ultimately, I like this game. I think the IP has potential and the developer has potential. I've clocked up 63 hours of playtime and I'm not done with it yet. Your mileage may vary but if you want to try something different then give it a shot, you might just find yourself hooked.			"

												Lords of Football has a great idea behind it, but it's an unripe fruit. After enjoying it for some time, you will inevitably notice some gaps in the gameplay mechanics.The original idea to combine footballer’s life simulation dynamics with football manager’s management mechanics is surely intriguing, but not fully developed, failing to entertain for more than a season or two.Although Lords of Football has some nice eccentricities and touches, it fails and also feels old and dated.Lords of Football is not a complete football manager that allows you to spend hours on tactical options or scouting for players. On the other hand, it is not a social simulation of footballers' life - you don't have much control over that aspect. The game can look like fun for a short while, but after a few hours it kills you with repetitiveness and boredom. A few interesting ideas aren't enough to save this game from oblivion. Overall 5/10.			"

												This game has a great concept, a god-like football sim, and it's very fun... for the first few hours, then after that it gets slow, boring, predictable, and just not extremely enjoyable.The idea is that you are sort of like a manager/coach/god of a football team, and you have to train your footballers into stars, but after the training period ends, they start their night life, which at first seems very awesome and diverse, but really is just the same old things over and over, if you let a star do something to much, i.e. gamble, they will develop an addiction for said activity. The managment styled training portion of the game is the best thing about it, where once a game starts it is a different story.The games are slow, and come with a stratagy focused look to them, but there really is no stratagy, you command some players to do special tasks, and you have a limited amount of times you can command your players before it recharges, it would be just swell if the commands weren't the only way to score goals in the game, but sadly, that's not the case, as the AI are so astoundedly stupid that leaving them be without any commands is pointless.Overall the game is brilliant at first glance, but after spending some time with it you realize issues, and those issues pile on top of each other, and really make the game unpleasant to play.3/10- Would probably play here and there again for the concept, but then realize how undeveloped it feels, and put it back down.

												This game is NOT Football Manager, so please dont rate it against that game. This is a unique Football Management Simulation with basic management tied in with a ""The Sims"" feel to it. Manage the Club and the squad, stear them away from Gambling etc and book them into a Clinic if they are too addicted!!I think this is a great foundation to what football management games should be like!

I have mixed feelings about this gameThe first thing you should know: Lords of football feels like a very superficial mix between The Sims and Football Manager. So don't expect to build houses and have a lot of customization like The Sims, and also don't expect to have all that in depth managment of Football Manager (it's not even close to that, it's REALLY simplistic. For example, you don't buy players, you simply build a wishlist based on skills and at the end of the season the game will drop some new guys in your squad). Besides all this, I have to say that I still had something fun after all.In this game you will basicly run the training and night life of your squad by simply picking players up with the mouse, lifting them and then droping them in a respective area trying to satisfy their desires to maintain their morale high. This gets repetitive relly soon, even after you begin to complete challanges (like winning X amout of gams or scoreing X amount of goals) and by these beeing able to ""build"" new training structures. The training part and the night life part plays all the same, only with different themed stuff.Things get different when the night ends and you get to manage your players in a real time match. Now here comes the sad part: as a coach you can build tactics in a really simplistic way and also call orders for your team from the side of the fied, but this ends up seeming completely pointless since it's better to let your players to play on their own. It's a interesting but totaly wasted mechanic. At the end the best way to go for me was simply choosing a default formation based on the best players I had on the squad (even if this meand a really weird formation), never putting a player out of his best position and never shouting an real time order.-Another bad thing is that there are really really few buildings and activities available. For the ""night life"" for example, you have 6 structures only each one with 2 different activities to choose from.-The graphics could be better, even though the user interface is quite friendly once you get used to the interesting filter system.-Selecting individual player can be a real pain, since it feels like the filters or even your mouse clicks don't always behave as they should.-Maintaining all of your players needs at a time is almost impossible since the game dosen't give you enought training/night time to do everithing they need.-The training field could really use some sort of auto-trigger system to help you put the players in the right place (if you played Dragon Age origins you know what I mean)-The DLCs also feels a bit like a waste. Who even thought that mixing a ""serious"" soccer game with medieval stuff would be funny?So in the end, this is a game where you will spend like 5 min draging and droping your players aroud the map and then another 5 minutes watching them play a match in really bad graphics (with some unpredictable behaviors), and repeat. In 15 hours, starting with a 3/5 stars team I turned it in the best team of the league. I think I have experienced almost everything the game has to offer, and I feel it's not enought. With a bit more of development and with more buildings/activities this game could really be awsome. But as it is, the game is not worth more than 10 US$.			"

												This is not a bad game, there are some positive creative ideas not so much of in depth like football manager. Its about managing the players, keeping track of their progress and their addictions and making sure they are good for the real match. Different players will have different personalities, some will like to party, some like to get drunk, some like to gamble etc. The match play is not bad, You can choose to watch and give commands or simulate the match. Once you achieve some objectives set by the chairman, you can build additional stuffs or upgrade. Controls are quite easy however tending to each players, controling their addictions and to reduce their addictions are not very user friendly.Theres no finance aspects to take care of, transfer market only available in the open period, you cannot scout in advance or sell players by setting the price, everything is done by the chairman. Theres not much things to do except tending to players, training, building and playing match etc.Overall, unless you have spare money to try something different, this game does give some creative sparks but will not be able to keep your interest long enough. If you are looking for more in depth game play, players and such , Football Manager will be way up there.5.5/10 (If you really have some spare spare money wana try something different or take a look)Shineshine logging out.

												This game is only for the hardcore soccer fans that loves to create their own team, players, logos, uniform, etc and manage their team to the top. At first it takes a little bit to get use to, but after you get used to this game you will love it. Its kinda like the sims at first because you get to see your players flirt with other girls, drink, gamble and try not to let them addicted to alcohol, and etc. I must admit this game is not for everyone because you only get to spectate the games, call plays and do other stuff that coaches do on and off the field, just like your typical soccer management game. I spend $3.00 on this game and i am loving it! I highly recommend this game for the hardcore soccer fans!! 8/10			"

												Solid game for those who like the Sims and sports simulators. Gameplay develops for several in-game seasons (depends on how fast you get achievements and your position in league), opening new facilities to make player training more specific. Evolving of bad habits of players is also fun.Matchday simulation has unique and very addictive control system. Much like Bioware games you can give instructions for certain players (sprint, pass, kick, etc.) on pause and then look how they play it. Don't forget about inertion, so you must think proactively to achieve better results.Game engine and matchday engine is mediocre, not the toppest one, but still picture does not seem badly outdated (surely better than FM matchday engine).

												I only played for a couple of hours so these will be my first impressions. This is not a bad game it just doesn't suite my taste. First, in the ""off-match-mode"" can you train you players, satisfy their needs etc. It is all interesting but the problem is that it is happening in real-time without a pause function. I only play turned based strategy games and I don't like real time strategy. So... this decision making in real time doesn't suite my taste at all.Secondly, ""in-match-mode"". The matches are actually quite funny to manage. The problem I have with the matches is that I can't go in and see my players profile in detail. For example, I can see that my player can play as a forward but I can't see if he also can play as a winger. I can only access this information outside the matches. Both these features makes the game unplayable for me. But with that said, if you like football and real time strategy games (or at least not dislike them), buy it on a sale and try it out.			"

												After finally giving this a decent go, I have to say I can't really recommend it. The cycle of training/nightlife/gameday gets fairly repetitive, and although at first it's kind of amusing shuffling your players from venue to venue to make sure they have their needs satisfied without getting hopelessly addicted to anything, and the training facility and nightspot unlocks help the variety a bit, it becomes much of a muchness after about a season of this. And the controls for when you play the actual matches are janky, to say the least.Obviously if you're after a proper football management game, well, you're already playing Football Manager, aren't you? The spin on this was to give it a bit of a Sims feel, but there's not really enough of that. You never really feel it's John Terry running around with his philandering.			"

												If you are looking for a simulation football game like Fifa then you came to the wrong place. This plays a little like Sims but without much control.In the day time you train your footballers.  The simulation is not very deep as you assign to each individual task (such as passing, shooting, strength and endurance) At night you assign each footballer a task that they enjoy and hopefully they will not come back symptomatic.  The game lacks depth in all of the areas described above.

												This game really is something different. It's a football simulation, but it also isn't. And it's a life simulator... But also isn't. It's a bit difficult to describe this game. The football side is not as overly detailed as Football Manager for instance, but then again, that would take the fun out. Here, you aren't just constantly looking at numbers. Not to say that the life simulation is all that. It's not on the level of The Sims. It is what it is. It's just... Different. Fresh. It's not for everyone, but I certainly enjoy it. Even though it might not be the best in either of the two genres it tries to combine. For instance, I see people complaining about how managing all the addictions isn't easy. But it isn't supposed to be. They're supposed to be humans, not mindless drones. The best moments in this game are when you just let loose a little bit. Sure, my main striker was staying out late pretty much every evening, not showing up for practice, starting conga lines in the streets or sleeping on the sidewalk. But he kept banging in goals and ended as the league's top scorer. So who am I to judge? I hope this game gets a sequel. Because there certainly is enough to improve on. But this game is also one with great potential to build upon.			"

												Thsi game is horrible. It acts like a a version of a SimSoccer game, but because of a few annoying things, like trying to keep your players out of trouble when it comes to their night lives, there is nothing fun about it. Basically, you have control over what they train for (which has almost no point at all, since they really don't get any better at anything), and where they go at night, but there is no real pay-off for all the hard work. Even attempting to transfer players in and out seems to have no effect. Stay away from this game.			"

You can just let you favorite team do all the work or you can get really into it and fully set up each players training, tactics, addiction controls, punishments ect... It would be like the sims if the sims were as sim as this game can be. Right now most of europe is covered along with the USA MLS league as a DLC. Hopefully in the future they're will be the Asian, South American and African Leagues. *Updated for awards*			"

												Unfortunately I left this on in the background and forgot about it so I can't get a refund... To sum this game up - Ambitious, but rubbish. I picked Arsenal and after I got through the slow day where I had no idea what to do, I was into a game. I thought I'd set the team to play fast passing football with fairly high pressure to hold possesion. DON'T TRY THIS. IT DOESN'T WORK. When I told my players in the in-game instructions to pass a short distance, they would run that distance, stop, and then pass the ball. It was not uncommon for an opposing player to sweep in in this time and steal the ball away. I wouldn't have to worry of course, because the floaty physics means that I can walk back and catch up with play again. Not that it matters, because even when I ask my players to man-mark, they just keep doing the same thing.Despite all this, I didn't lose a game.For people who don't like football and don't like the Sims.

												Review based on 40 hrs gameplay.I not only give this game two thumbs up, but I highly recommend it for casual soccer fans. I’m not a true-blue soccer fan but I like the game of soccer. I coach my guys up, put’em on the pitch, and it’s very satisfying.Lords of Football is all about training, tactics and strategy. Then you get to deal with your guys’ off-the-field stuff as well. To be honest, the game is engaging and there isn’t a dull moment. But if you don’t want to be bothered with any of that stuff, you don’t have to be.It took me 25 hours to figure out how to effectively use the in-game orders to players. Now I’m REALLY enjoying match day. I’m not just watching the game; I’m actively participating in it. I feel like a real football manager standing on the pitch.I recommend the game because it’s fun to get into. Then once you get into it, a whole new fun opens up. It will dominate your time if you let it. Each match is an opportunity to show off your skills as a coach.			"

												This review is on Lords of Football:Pros:This game has captured what it is like to be a manager in real life and face problems with the team.Lords of Football also makes training fun and simulative so it isn't boringAssigning big amounts of players to stations/training areas is great with an easy pickup system(I personally love that feature)The game also lets you simulate or play a game of football when a match is played which is a nice feature.Achievements seem very easy most you will unlock by playing the game. A lot of them seem to be winning leagues. Cons:When playing a game you cannot control players like in Fifa only allowed to make callouts like a coach. The game does not let use the names of proper teams it uses fake names such as ""Blue Eagle"" instead of ""Manchester City"". The game becomes sort of boring during matches unless seemed. Graphics are not up to date and poor but acceptable.Conclusion:This game only tailors to hard core football fans.I myself are not a hardcore fan but still enjoy this game.Rating:6/10			"

												Playing this game, I imagined a man in my head. This man had recently picked up a copy of Football Manager 2014 and decided that, while he liked the basic premise of managing a football team, he felt that the game interface needed to feel more.. alive. So he did some research and found out that the most alive you can get in a simulation game is to have actual things with lives! So he played The Sims. ""This is a fun game,"" The Man thought. ""I bet I could merge this perfectly with Football Manager!""That man was wrong. He was wrong and I gave him my money. What a fool I was...			"

												I don't so much like football but I got this during the world cup as I like games like the sims. This game is ok I suppose, It's quite confusing for who does not know how football works but even I won my first game :PThe game is mainly about looking after your team and making sure they do the right things. Thats the part of the game I enjoy but when it comes to football, I just sim matches :)			"

												DOESN'T WORK. I am running this game on a brand new £1000 laptop with GeForce GTX860M (4GB) graphics card, 16GB RAM, i7-4710HQ processor and 1TB HDD with 8GB SSD and it won't even start up. This laptop runs cities in motion and cities XXL on the top graphics settings without an issue or lag. This game is broken. Do not buy it!			"

												This game really could use a proper tutorial. When you start you have no idea what you're supposed to be doing or what everything does. After some time you start to figure out how things works, and everything just gets quite boring fast.			"

												Now this is one of those games that has potential but hasn't reached it yet here are my positives:+Intresting Gameplay (For a bit)+For a football fan this is going to be a good/alright game because everything you want as a managerFor now thats the only positives, now for for the cons:-Bad graphics-Poor desgin-After a while it gets repetitiveSo for this game im going to give it a 5 out of 10. (But it has potential)			"
