								I thought the game played solid. Plenty of Mech variations and weapons. I had no problem climbing in and doing battle. The missions are well made and full featured, and the bots play well. Not bad for early access. I'm sure they'll be adding stuff and tweaking the hell out of it in the coming months. I'm looking forward to when we can form squads and track stats and have an effect on the war. Then this game will become really great.			"

								edit: updated a review to give more info a bitThis is one of the most 'solid' EA release I have ever played. If you are looking for a solid Mechwarrior-like combat, this game can give you that. There are things that need polishing. However, the downside is that you can hardly find people to play with due to the soft launch. Devs are fixing things and will do a proper launch soon.To top it off, it is a Team vs Team, heavy mech combat. You cannot skate around super fast and do crazy manuever like Armored Cored's mech. Your mech is basically a tank with legs, so no fancy movements.You build your mech from several chasis(will be adding in the future updates), put on the weapons and equipments. To balance the fight smaller chasis is faster, but less armor, and carry lighter equipments. Bigger chasis is slower, but tougher, more armomr, heavier weapons, however, loadout comes down to the battle points, you cannot just put anything in there, it is limited by battle points for each mech, and different mech will have different points.The combat itself is fun, especially with another player. There is AI support for both single and multiplayer match, but it is not that smart, however, they do there jobs well, especially when they are with players. Combat will be tactical to certain points that you need to manage your weapons, you can fire all weapons at once or as a selective group, which can be set in the hangar. Weapons have its effective range, some can easily overload your system, and some weapons' projectile do travel the distance, so they can be dodged.There may be claims that it takes too long to take down a mech, which is not true if you know what you are doing. Your mech (as of the current build) has 3 parts, torso, and 2 legs, and around 7-8 additional parts depending on your loadout. These parts have their own HP, so if you just shoot at every part, not just particular part. It will take a while to take down a mech. Mechs can be take-down by destroying their bodies, or both of their legs.old:Nice and Solid Gameplay despite the EA release, but the Soft Launch is killing it slowly.			"

								If you are expecting to get a polished Mech game up front with a large server population, please do not buy this game, watch it with interest but do not buy.If you want to help participate in helping to flesh out and test a fun Mech combat game this might be for you. For much less then I blow on a meal, I bought access into this game figuring I would just wait and see. I have found playing just a short while that I can see some potential in this game. Being in an Australian timezone I feel it will be a long time before I can play online with the dedicated servers due to ping and player numbers, so I am restricted to Single player. However the beauty of this game is if I can get enough friends interested, I can run my own dedicated server.The fact this game even has that mode is GREAT, it adds much more variety & options then the drudgery that is playing MWO, or Hawken. ""SO FAR"" the devs are showing interest in the community feedback so far which is great, if they can keep that up, that will help them a long way. The graphics aren't phenomal, though respectable, the gameplay mechanics work, though do need a lot of work, and the devs are stated that is part of their plan which is good. The overall Vision the developers have for this game is very good, its just a matter of whether they are able to get there.If you just consider this a Speccie stock purchase, and play a bit now and then and provide feedback it will hopefully help the Devs get this game to where they want.

								As a Starsiege fan I have to say that I was pretty surprised at what I got for an early access game. The game just went live today but already you can see a lot of cool things happening in regards to giving you that stompy mech experiance that has been missing all these years. It's also really nice that there are both online and offline options so you can play against other players or try out different mech configs on your own. So overall while its a bit rough around the edges, so far so good :)			"

								I'm fan of Mechwarrior. But i reject MWO because there is no singleplayer game.After many searched, i decided to buy this game.I really hope the developer put more effort into it. The price is should be worth more than what is the content now.There are few thing i suggest to be ready first:-Optimise graphic setting, really lagging during full screen-Simple tutorial for battle controling.-Texture improvement-Sound improvementI recommend buying if you're fan of MechWarrior. GIve a support for it.I not recomend buying if you're looking immersive visual & sound gameplay.			"

								From the few hours i have put into this game, i personally love it. It's a great alternative to MWO, minus the grind. Granted, the game is still buggy, and not many people play it, so the multiplayer section is kinda bleak, but the game has amazing potential. The graphics are a lot better than MWO, and the gameplay is a lot smoother, IMO of course. I highly recommend this game if you want a smaller alternative to MWO, but you have to remember, this game is still in early access, so it's not going to be AAA quality. Yet. The developers are constantly communicating with the customers, and are extremely helpful. So, if you want a Mechwarrior style game, but also want awesome developer help that actually LISTENS to it's customers, this is the game for you!			"

								As a fan of the Mech Assult series on the original Xbox, This is a great game to play to help feed my hunger for more. Now thats not saying its AS good. But its still a fun game. There is no tutorial, No description for the game modes, But on the upside its a easy to learn game. The combat is not as polished, and is a little sluggish. once you learn your best loadout it gets much better. Pros: Mech Warrior like feel, Plenty of customization, Fun (yet not polished) firefights.Cons: No Story mode (yet it seems to have some story mentioned in game modes) No tutorial or description for gameplay.  Bottom line: Its a great game worth the money and has lots of potential.                                      8ish/10 ""Too many mechs"" -SigmaBot			"

Early Access Review
								For an early access game this was surprisingly good, I mean few issues, relative stability, workable controls, it was all there.    However I was only there for the mechs, and the game did have a few mechs for you to play with.  Basically there's 4 default mechs that fall into the light to heavy catergories, then you have the option to build your own mech.  Now I know at this point you're probably drooling, but the options are limited.  Basically you pick a chasis, and you;ll be using the same chasis as one of the defualts, so there isn't a lot of variety there.  4 chasis, which you can customize the paint, camo, stickers, and logos on, then you get to add some weapons to your mech's hardpoints.  Each chasis has its own base armor rating as well as speed, and point level.  So everything you add onto your mech costs points, and adding extra armor will take points and reduce your overall speed.  Weapon types are very vanilla, gatling guns, lasers, rockets, flamethrowers, nothing out of the ordinary or jaw dropping for that matter.  However you can still customize quite a bit, trying to create that perfect battle mech.  I go with low overload weapons, usually gatling guns, gatling lazers, and maybe a rocket pod so I can spam my opponet.  Most players I saw were using the railguns and after a few shots would overload their weapons then stand around like an idiot while they waited for their weapons to cool down.  Your mech has several hit locations on them, each with its own raiting.  So your opponent, or you, can prioritize certain parts.  For me and my mech Tiny Savage, I circle my opponet and target the legs, once the legs go you'll have a hard time being able to turn effectively, then I just keep running circles and blast away.  Or you could knock out a certain weapon system, or just shoot at whatever part of the mech you feel like.  Just note that once your cockpits health gets low, you'll start to seem some distortion going on, and you'll have a hard time seeing things.  If this happens, or your mech has taken a beating, just find your nearest repair center which will have combat ready in no time.  I will say that the AI is dumb, like dumb as a bag of rocks.  Often times they will just run to a location and stand there the entire game.  Other times they'll take a certain amount of damage and immediately stop fighting and run back to their base to try and repair themselves.  Matches can take a while to complete, especially attrition, because somehow those ticket counters never seem to go down fast enough.  Overall I would suggest that you check this game out, especially if you're a fan of mechanized combat, but I'd wait and see if this thing goes on sale, because the $19.99/$14.99 I spent was a bit much for an early access game that doesn't have a whole lot of content in it. All things considered though, its a good game, and its fun, I put 76 minutes into without even realizing it. So 7/10 mostly for the lack of mech types available, and the terrible AI, however I expect all of that to be fixed once this game launches fully.			"

								Dark Horizons is back and now you can make your mech yours. There's four chassis on which you can load weapons, armour and tools, from really light scout-like vehicles that are hard to hit to slow, lumbering hulks bristling with hurt and thick armour.The style is very different to Lore, being less twitch and more tactics, but you can tell they're both Dark Horizons games.  As such, running alone is a much bigger risk than it was in Lore, so take some friends with you.Definitely reccomend. See you on the battlefield!			"

								Not a ton of content and a lack of a tutorial (or at least, I didn't find one) but it's in EA so that's most likely going to be fixed.  As far as the gameplay goes, so far it's amazing.  My only issue with it is the lack of an explanation of what stuff is.  I want to have a mech with those beam weapon things... but I have no idea what they are called T.T  Like most EA games I have reviewed so far I'm going to say this game is worth the investment.  Maybe you will not like the alpha because of it's lack of content and tutorials, but it's only going to be getting better.Update: Newest update fixed the issue I was having with finding lazers :D Safe to say that the game is much better already and I can't wait to see what the next update will add!

								Campaign is coming along, the Faction wars stuff is cool too. New contract missions give something for players looking for Single Player missions to do.Early Access so there's obviously some bugs still. Considering that, this game is still pretty strong and well done. Especially at this early alpha phase. I'm a huge fan of the game so far and can't wait to get into more battles. There are maps both big and small to allow quick brutal mech matches as well as more drawn out conflicts. I personally prefer the small maps.Learning the weapons so far is the trickiest bit, and building your own loadouts. As this game develops it's definitely one to keep an eye on if you like mech games. The new update for Faction Wars is looking great too.NOTE: This review was written BEFORE I started helping out with the game.			"

								This game is very rough.  No tutorial that I could find, and although there is a bot option in Instant Action, other players do join pretty quick.  I guess just check the key bindings and figure it out.  It's not too bad of a learning curve.The game plays pretty good.  The lightmechs are real fast, the heavy mechs slow, though with 3rd person view only (for now - develepers stated working on cockpit view) and crazy jump jets it sometimes feels like you're piloting a figurine on a tabletop not a multi ton mech.  It has some large, wide open levels and I've had some pretty intense battles. There is a decent selection of pre made Mechs, some you'll even reckognize form Battletech or Mechwarrior.  They all have different capabilities and the developrs have done a good job making some feel and handle very different, some refinement is needed.The graphics are right now fairly rough but I expect texture updates eventually.  All in all, if you're looking for arcade type combat in mechs try it out, I  imagine after some updates the controls might turn a bit more.....realisitic?  Is that possible in a fictional game?  Anyway, hopefully you get what I'm trying to say.If you love giant mech games and know what buying early aceess can mean and the risks involved (such as games never being finished or taking radical turns and not being the same game you bought) then I recommend it, as it's on sale (or was) and 5$ is decent to support the developrs.If not a huge fun but a moderate fan, or missed the sale, it might be worth waiting to see the game in a more polished state before decding to support it or not, and you might get another sale in the meantime.6.5/10 at full price, 7.5/10 on sale........for the time beingMaybe I'll see you on the battlefield!

The part that sold me besides its gameplay mechanics that are similar to the name above is the fact that it is not Free to Play. The Mechs are highly customizable with decals and weapons.

								Mech games in general are very niche these days. There are a ton of dev sponsored events but they usually have quite a few players and the one i was able to make it to was extremely fun. Expecting ea games that are niche to have large playerbases is a false perception that is probably influenced by ea titles like dayz or rust that have very large playerbases skewing the fact most ea games just dont draw that many people no matter how good they are. these are mostly indie devs without large marketing budgets.This game has the framework to be great. There are, in my opinion, certain mechanics missing that would make the game more dynamic and fun, i.e. rocketjumping on the ground, so like ac3 being able to boost for a short time to gain some speed and be a dodging mechanic all in one. The sniper rifles and long range weapons are a great start to make this game go in the direction the devs seem to want (from my experience so far) as a more militaristic, average pased mech game relying on positioning, aim, and teamwork. Not to mention, the devs on this game, unlike many many ea titles, actually listen to and respond to the playerbase. I mean the real intention of ea is to help developers develop and finish the game youre purchasing....right? Ive mentioned a few ideas to the devs so far, and i wont say I had anything to do with them adding it in, but for example the long range weapons i suggested a few months ago, well guess what? They put it in the game! And its a really great addition. In my opinion this factor alone makes this game well worth a measly fifteen dollars. This game will grow over time, with the cockpit views, more and more weapons and mech types, more customization of the mechs themselves, better ai, better graphics (already looking really sharp with the shader changes), and of course, the soon to be redmund favorite of faction wars. I havent been this excited for the future of an ea title in a long time.Sure there arent many people in servers very often, but I mean Im not sure what youd expect from an ea game like this. Plus the devs come from a background of writing backends for netcode of games with other studios (i might be wrong on the terminology) gives me great confidence that MP play will be stable and lag/choke free in the future, especially when your faction might lose their last territory from a missle lagging and winning someone a match.10/10 must buy for mech lovers.

								I have to say I want to love this game. I still play a lot. The best part about it is building and trying out the mechs. Some of the problem is that no one is playing so you have to play by yourself and the bots are not very smart, or maybe too smart they go hide in the ocean. Every once in a while you have a great game against the bots, but not on every board. 	I would like to see a board where you have unlimited ammo. 	The bots would not have to be strong but they need to attack and spawn more of them. I love shooting at them. Missiles are great but you don’t have enough of them need a way to reload on the spot. Long way back to the base to reload waste to much time.	Look at some of the games like the Day of Defense on their zombie mode it has wave of bots attacking you. Old game still a lot of people playing. Make a map similar to them. But have them mech bots attacking	On a lot of your boards you have no way to reload after you run out of ammo. This is just sad because some of these are good maps the bots attack.	I really hope you all do something for this game fast its dyeing. 	More weapons. More ammo. Attacking bots.  Different maps. Unlimited ammo. This game could be great 	Since this game came out I’ve enjoyed it enough that I’ve bought a few more Mech games and played them, they’re fun, but I keep coming back to this one. I really would love to see you all make it. But I think you need a few more game designers to come up with something different to make it playable. I have the most kills on this game and possibly the most hours. I really would like to tell everyone to buy this game. I’ve changed my review 3 times now. Hoping to give you the thumbs up award.  But I can’t yet. I really have a hard time telling anyone to buy this game please do something that will change that.I will say this if you like building mechs. and trying them out. somewhat of a slow game buy it. I have to say I enjoy playing or I would not have so many hours on the game. its not bad but I think it could be so much more.Please if you have any questions contact me here and I will get back to you.

Parts can be destroyed individually, but I have yet to feel any real penalties.

Early Access Review
								It's pretty much just mecharrior 4 at least when it ocmes to the engine but lacking the ability to see an arm blow off or core explosions.It has a bare bones mp but has potentialNo single player though they say they are working on one but I wouldn't give it any chance of being an interesting one as I doubt it will have any good voice acting or anything.Buildins dont blow upVery tiny player base.Ultimately it's just not really worth the price or tim meplaying until it's out of ea and has gotten a lot more meat playing the game which I just dont see happening.Not the worst game ever at all but it's just no that much fun very few choices when it comes to mechs like 4 or 5 I cant remember been a long time since I've put any time into the game.

								This game still needs a lot of work.  Graphics are ok, gameplay has many issues, and crashes a lot.  Need to keep this one in the oven for a few more days.			"

								If you are on the fence about getting this game I would adivse you to stay away from it. The servers are unpopulated, the gameplay feels clunky, and the graphics are poor.			"

Early Access Review
								Being a fan of mech game I bought this game (March 2017), this is my initial view after about 2hrs of gameplay.It's in it's early stages, so here's my initial thoughts on how it stands.The graphics are still very choppy, especially textures (even on a high-end rig) & its easy to get 'lost' in the polygons of buildings ('Ghost Town' map).The customization is coming along nicely but everything needs to be polished (both look & feel).I'm not a fan of online game playing (a far prefer single player missions & campaign modes), so I'm pretty exited about this game.It plays quite well on a controller (although seperatly rotating upper-body can get confusing, especially in cockpit mode).I'm sure it will all add-up to a great experience  !

Early Access Review
								After seeing the beta release I can not only give a fair review but can say this game is full of awesomeness. Totally worth it. Best mech game I have seen since Mechwarrior 4:Mercs and it's still in EA!Owned about a dozen or more mech games over the years. Being a fan of mech games especially the Mechwarrior series. I longed for a good mech game like this one.I saw a lot of potential in this game when I discovered it just over a month ago. I liked the rpg elements, the different types of mechs, weapons, maps, etc. It was small and needed work but not a lot to complain about. It was the best thing out there and I wanted to see where it was headed.As soon as I opened the beta release it reminded me of the training levels of the good old days of Mechwarrior. Everything looked better than I could have ever imagined it.Been waiting many years for something like this. $14.99 is nothing.  I would easily pay double for an hd version of Mechwarrior 3 Gold if it were released on Steam.  These are the types of Early Access that get you really excited. Seeing a good product become a whole lot better. Become something exceptional. All the improvements in this new beta release 4/10/2017 are a milestone. Everything looks just fantastic.			"
