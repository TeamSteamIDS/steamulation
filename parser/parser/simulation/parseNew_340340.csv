												If this looks like Pewdiebait to you, you are probably right. I usually suck at distinguishing pewdiebait from real games, but this game is not very interesting when you start playing it. It's more like having to do chores as a dog. Boring as hell. Sure, there are some fun dogs, but as soon as it dies it's gone and you will have to hope for something that doesn't suck as much. It seems alright at first, but soon you will start to notice that within every 5 seconds you have to fix one of the bars that's down to red. You will have to eat, sleep and poop so frequently you start wondering if this dog has any sense of time. Thanks to the lack of explanation you are also left in the dark as to what you should do to fix something, how to keep on sleeping until the bar is full (It interrupts at irregular intervals) and how much food you actually have. You will also notice a vicious cycle of I have no food -> I have no money to buy food -> I dig for money -> I need more food but I have no food -> I have no money to buy food and so on and so on and so on. The game contains some fun easter eggs here and there but without a real goal and seemingly effectless shops the game will bore you before you even started to like it. It's cheap, so if you really need to kill some time you might want this, but you're better off doing almost anything else.			"

												Look, I was going to write a dumb sarcastic thing in all caps about how wacky this game is and all, but I just don't think it's worth the effort. You deserve better, Mr. Discerning Steam Customer. Here's the real♥♥♥♥♥♥This game isn't good. People enjoy quirky, gimmicky games like Goat Simulator and I Am Bread because there's something substantial and replayable behind the silly premise. You buy, let's say Surgeon Simulator, because hahaha that's not how you do a heart transplant, but you keep coming back because you're getting the hang of manually controlling your hand and manipulating your tools, and you begin to do it more for the fun and challenge of it than the joke. Above all, you keep coming back.On the other hand, underneath the skin of Dog Sim is a bunch of tedious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. You have, I kid you not, like five meters to keep track of. You need to babysit these meters constantly. When your food or water meter depletes, your actual, time-until-you-die health meter begins to slowly tick down, and I could not find a way to restore that for the life of me. Unfortunately, your sleep meter decreases every time you eat or drink to increase those meters (or do anything else), and depletion of the sleep meter causes you to pass out for several seconds, during which you may be robbed of all of your dog money by a passing raccoon, or killed instantly by a car if (God forbid) you passed out on a highway. This may sound pedantic given how much the developers stress that lives in this game are fleeting and easily lost, but there is progression here. You don't want to die while you're playing an arcade game or sussing out an easter egg, right? You end up so busy monitoring your health that you don't have any time to actually explore, so what's the point in trying?In conclusion, savee that $4 and get yourself a little extra bacon on that next burger instead. Oh sorry, what I meant to say was LOL I PEED ON A FIRE HYDRANT AND GOT RUN OVER 11/10 GOTY. I ATE CHOCOLATE AND POOPED ON A HYDRANT AND THE POOP EXPLODED 5/5 MMM I LOVE WACKY JOKE. YUM YUM PUT THE MEMES IN MY MOUTH AGHLGLGLGL GOD YES. I AM A HUSK OF A HUMAN BEING AND ONLY THE SHALLOWEST OF JINGLE-KEY CLOWN GAMES CAN FILL ME.

												Okay, I got this on a whim cus it looked fun and it had overall positive reviews. Bad line: I regret my decision.This game sucks on so many levels...and speaking of which, there is literally hardly anything to do. Imagine Goat Simulator with 1/100 of the map, 2d crappy graphics, and 1/1000th of things to do, and you would have this mess. If it was a flash game on Armor Games or Kongregate, I would give it a 1 out of 5, but this, this is much lower than that since I am ashamed to have paid for it.			"

If you can't tail the current promo is quite likely the only time this youtube-bait title can be worth its current pricetag, at $0.02 if you're also buying Squirreltopia. I claw that pricetag and thought ""It's cheap as dirt and installs in two shakes of a lamb's tail!

[Review copy provided]Domestic Dog Simulator is, as you you may have guessed, a simulator game where you play as a dog. The game was developed by Surreal Distractions who maybe, just maybe, were inspired by another slightly related anti-game? But before I start to review this game, I would like to say that I am appreciative that I was able to have been given this game and though it may not overly appeal to me, some of you may genuinely enjoy it.Once you have hatched from your egg, you'll be wondering what the hell you are supposed to actually do. On the store page it does give a slight suggestion: Play, eat, drink, and sleep, remember to take care of yourself! But your first experience will be something more like this: Play, eat, drink, and sleep, remember to take care of yourself! ♥♥♥♥♥♥ oh sorry, urinate on everything. Once you have gotten bored from excreting your bodily fluids and getting hit by cars, you might like to try playing with a ball. Yep, that was fun for about 2 seconds. You are able to customise your house in this game and your dog which may appeal to you, but other than that all you can really do in the game is summed up in the ""joke reviews"" which are actually entirely serious. Here are a couple:Originally posted by (CHOPPAH) frankly:Recommended0.1 hrs on recordPosted: 14 SeptemberI spent 10 minutes peeing on everything, got confused, and turned the game off. 10/10 would recommend.Originally posted by Sticky Nut Juice:Recommended0.6 hrs on recordPosted: 21 SeptemberI pee'd on some stuff, got fleas, and played arcade games fun for a an hour or twoThe pixel graphics are very colourful and may be appealing for some to look at. Recieving a new dog with green hair and black lines across it is always interesting to see. Even though the game lacks in most other areas, it does give a certain seductive charm with its vibrant appearance.A question I asked myself when playing was, is it funny? You can urinate on almost everything and even eat your own poop, but that slight chuckle in your mind tends to wear off after the first 10 minutes of playing.There is some music in the game. It's quite emotionally gripping. Not really, it actually gets quite droning after a while but atleast it's not completely silent.Entertainment-As you will have probably gotten the impression from my points before, the game isn't overly entertaining and really doesn't entice me to go and play it some more. It is repetitive and is the type of game that you would only drop in to play for 2 minutes.Summary Pros+Is enjoyable to discover the different things for the first time+Customisation of your dog/house+Trading cards+GraphicsNeutral+/-Music is okay, but tends to drone on a bitCons-After discovering most of the features of the game it becomes quite repetitive-Doesn't give you any sort of direction or objective (no tutorial)-The humour wears off after 10 minutes-Isn't very entertainingConclusionDomestic Dog Simulator was certainly not the worst game I have ever played. There are plenty of games worse than this that exceed $3 and get up to $50+. This game will not be enjoyed by everyone, but if you do think that you would actually enjoy this game then maybe get it on sale and see what you think.5.5/10Liked that review? I have others! "

												You know what, I don't care about some of the hate for these types of ""joke games"". They have a place, just like any other game. Critique like ""They just want a quick cash grab!"" makes me laugh. You don't think the major triple A title companies wanna make money? You think the goal is to simply entertain people and go out of business?This is an indie title, on a sale it costs next to nothing. For that you get a laugh or two, and a short, simple game. It functions (least in the current state I've played it), and I don't see any indication anywhere on it's store page that it is trying to sell consumers something it is not, or lie to consumers. Then it's allright to be whatever you are as a game, and some will enjoy it and others will not. If there's a chance you don't find these types of silly games amusing, then you should perhaps stay clear.Some bigger and smaller titles have lied straight in the face of fans and gamers about what they are. That I can not stand. Okay, it may not be straight up lying or illegal, but to show contents at conventons that don't appear in the final product, to not have people try out a certain mode before release date because they know it doesn't function properly but they don't have the time or means to fix it in time. This constant rushing out titles for deadlines instead of actually making the game properly. Game breaking bugs is more of a rule than an exception now, because they will be patched in time so it's fine, right? No, the point is still you can't play the game on release date, so why start selling it then? Why not start selling it once it's actually finished? The bargain bins are overflowing with halfmade games, some of which had great potentials.I rather have a functional little game that is what it is, and don't cost more than it is worth, than the exact opposite.This is a silly little game, and it made me smile. And from what I've seen from the forums the devs try to adress issues and answer questions, which means there's a communication there and a will to please gamers. For me, that says alot.			"

												This game taught me even in this day and age of Steam Greenlight, that I shouldn't judge a book by it's cover.At first glance, this game looks like the same godawful joke games that are a dime-a-dozen these days around these parts. When you start to peel away the layers though, you find a pleasantly surprising time managment sim game. Your dog needs to poop, sleep, and eat. It's up to you to go out into the world and figure out the best way to get these objectives completed.You need to dig for cash to buy food, toys, collars, and other accessories for your home. There are arcade games to spend your money on, but I'd suggest making sure you have a full food dish first.You can't spend all day outside. This pup needs sleep. Your energy will deplete as you're out and about, so you need to wisely expend energy and take naps regularly.For the asking price, there is a welcome amount of depth here.			"

												I feel like this game is worth the money. I havent regreted the decision to buy this game, I love it. Here is a list of pros and cons:Pros:-Pee on things + other animals-Dig for money-Buy items to decorate your house-ATM card (lets you keep your money between all dogs that you have)-Go to the vets (only when you get hurt)-Etc.Cons:-Cannot save the game to keep the dog you originally haveThe only thing that I can not figure out is how to bark, but I am working on that ;)10/10 would reccomend if you are a person who likes simulators, or if you just like funny games in general!

												Peeing on a butterfly leveled me up. This statement alone should tell you what your in for when it comes to DDS. At heart its a silly game but for the most part is designed very well. With no clear cut goals, your job is simple. Survive, eat, poop, and do other normal things a dog would do. Then do weird stuff to earn cash. Like dig up graves, herd sheep, catch Frisbees plus more! Then take your hard earned dog money! Then buy the conveniences all dogs dream of like, giant TV's and huge entertainment centers. Perhaps redecorate, get a new fur color. The choice is yours and how you go about them is completely up to you. For $2.99, you pay for what you get. Its a silly game and simple. Keep this in mind when you make your purchase and you might find yourself having fun and living the dog life in Domestic Dog Simulator.I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

												woof/woof - Would dog again.bark bark bark bark bark. - bark bark""You either die a good boy, or live long enough to see yourself become the bad dog..."" ~ AnonymousOur story begins with me being born.Spent the first five years growing up, having fun[i3.kym-cdn.com], working hard[i1.kym-cdn.com], and [meme-lol.com].I played a couple of games [scenekids.com] too.But that's not important. My story is my rise and downfall. You see one time when walking I got fleas from a tree, it took me awhile before I realized I had them and eventually went to the vet. After this, I continued my life as normal, until I got hit by a car(this would be the first of many) and was flown to the vet before waking up feeling almost deprived of life, having to spend a couple of days to recover. It wasn't that bad though. Afterwards I started thinking a bit about finding a mate.And just so happened one time after working I saw a possible mate and proceeded with some compliments[i.imgur.com]. It didn't go well. I continued trying for a bit, but just about every time it ended up the same way[fc00.deviantart.net], starting to just make me apathetic as time went on..So I got back to what I was normally doing, I went outside planning on going to the work of digging holes. But then I noticed a machine, it said chocolate or something, that whole day was a blur. But I bought it because I was just curious, and even if it did kill me it's not like I cared too much. After working the majority of the day my stomach felt odd, so I went to the bathroom as I usually do near a fire-hydrant, and after walking away, I hear a boom, turning around quickly to assess the situation. Apparently my♥♥♥♥♥♥had exploded, water going everywhere as the fire hydrant was destroyed. I started thinking momentarily and got a devilish smile. I was going to get revenge on the damned cars and their drivers for all the times they hit us. So I spent all of my money on the chocolate machine, and set my presents in the street, waiting. And then it happened, it started exploding as cars were destroyed among crashing from the various explosions. I kept this up, crashing multiple cars. I was in the middle of my spree when I go to set another trap, I set one down, and as the minute I try to escape from the street, I get hit by car going much faster, I was sure it was going to kill me as the first car I was ever hit by was moving much slower. I woke up in a hospital bed. Apparently they assumed I was another victim, I made it back home before I just started recovering, taking in what I had done. It took me a while before I came to my senses, this isn't what I want, none of this senseless violence and bloodshed. So I vowed not to do this again unless I had a very good reason, only to protect someone or myself.I would continue living my life for another year or so, having been in another two accidents from being hit by cars and having to recover, but things started getting a bit boring. Even after buying myself some new things from the stores[i1.kym-cdn.com]. I found out about grilling meat though as there was a grill and a machine that sold frozen meat, damn, the food was good[fc04.deviantart.net].I kept living as things started getting more boring, but then I heard about some mystery involving the woof woods. Apparently some people say there's a strange phenomenon going over there about flowers and something about seeing strange lights in the sky deep within the forest. Best to check it out. So I went there, saw the flowers and started sniffing them, nothing odd about them, nor claimed territory yet. So I claimed it, but then I found out some flowers I couldn't claim as my own, but then I realized they were leading me somewhere, almost sort of like an arrow, so I followed the direction, coming across another patch, did the same thing, another direction, I kept doing this until I started to get hungry, so I came back another day, eventually keeping this up. This was getting creepy[blog.sfgate.com]. Eventually, I came across it, a light, a box illuminating, I sniffed it, it glowed brighter. I woke up in my house, there being a flying frisbee next to me. It's a fun toy, glad I got it. Apparently it's also alien technology, I solved the mystery, and I got a prize for it. I felt accomplished.[lh3.googleusercontent.com]A couple of days later I found a cemetery, wasn't really sure why the territory wasn't marked, so I started marking it, then like the flowers in the woof woods, I came across a gravestone that I couldn't mark. It had the markings ""B5"" on it. I wasn't really sure what this meant, as expressed when I said outloud, ""What is that supposed to mean?!"", however when I said that, apparently it started moving, I jumped a bit at first, but then it revealed a path, and I went down, it was pretty scary down there, so I bailed as soon as I got in.Not too much else happened for awhile, and then I started getting sick of paying for the food I bought that would somes be worth more than one day's amount of work. I started to feel this wasn't that fair, not to me and probably not to a couple of others, so I made a plan, I would steal food, because paying for it was just getting old, having to hope that one day's work was enough to get me food, sometimes it was, sometimes it wasn't, it was a bit of a gamble occasionally, possibly because of my buying habits, didn't matter too much to me, so I figured out where the food was being made, and started making attempts to get in, first starting with♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on the power boxes outside, that didn't work, then tried the chocolate traps on the main door, same result, I kept investigating for a couple of days, and one night I found the door open, so I went in, I found lasers and electric floor panels, but I knew the food was back there. I started moving through the traps.First laser, first floor panel, second laser. Then I felt really tired, I didn't realize that I wasn't sleeping much during my investigating, I should have slept more. Oh well, no turning back, I'll have to power through it. So moved myself through more traps, felt more tired, more traps, fell asleep again momentarily in front of a laser and quickly got myself forward before it turned back on again. Then I made it to the barrels of food. Time to get them out. I got them on their side and rolled them onto an electrical panel, waited for it to turn off and started pushing them again. Last thing I remember is the barrel being very comfortable and closing my eyes for a moment. I had woke up in a hospital bed, I was broke, I was tired, I was hungry. I had to get up and head home, I can try again once I get there. But there was the street. And I started crossing it. Slowly, weakly, then I heard it, I turned my head to see a car speeding towards me. I knew this was it, I'm too weak for my body to take a hit like the one coming up, but by the time I thought that it was already so close.

												Bascially a de-make of Tokyo Jungle for PC. I bought this game on a whim with some friends thinking it was an odd name and an interesting concept, but looked fun! WE WERE RIGHT. We had a blast with it! We would pass off the controls as soon as our dog died and see how long the next person could survive. Finding things out that the others didn't was a great feeling. The music is very well done and the game is more than great for its pricetag. If you enjoy Tamagotchis or Tokyo Jungle on PS3, then this game is a must!			"

												I don't know why people are hating on this game, ITS 3 BUCKS. I personaly think this game is fun for the price, but the only downside is that the developers are just doing tiny changes, why not add a map or somthing?? Sure this game is Really hard to understand and the fact that you have to babysit the meters is fine, if your looking for a small quirky fun game you wanna play from time to time. Then get it, and I hope the developers work on this more. So overall, yes I would reccomend this game!			"

I've gotten more out of other games the same price or lower.You get to be silly weird dog, but there is nothing to do in silly weird dog place. You can dig perpetually for money to eat or buy useless♥♥♥♥♥♥for your house that there is nothing to do in, or you can look at one-off boring mini-games and places.

												This obnoxious tripe was bought for me on my birthday by a friend as a joke. It's designed to give hyperactive 15-year-olds something to scream about on their Youtube channels. It's boring, repetitive and annoying, and belongs in a dark corner of Newgrounds. I didn't even pay for it and I feel slighted. I'd advise you to spend your hard-earned dollars elsewhere.			"

												Video games have a long history with capitalism. We’re used to scavenging garbage and loot for the merchant in town, playing our part in the endless recycling of items into cash which usually serves as the point for which the rest of the game rotates (especially if it happens to have a strong multiplayer focus). Sometimes we take up the role of the vender ourselves, be it in a higher management position (most city building sims) or direct transactions (Recettear), building our own economy by exploiting the nondescript customers who seem to exist solely to patronize our shop. There isn't anything particularly novel then about a game hinged around mass consumerism, but where Domestic Dog Simulator fails most is in masking or even pretending to recognize the economic loops providing it a skeleton of purpose, or hav ing anything interesting to say or do with them.You might imagine a game with as bland and direct a title as Domestic Dog Simulator would at the least be what it says on the tin, but aside from allowing you to take part in a handful of stereotypically doggy things (ie.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on everything) there isn’t much that seems designed to imitate canine life. Maybe that’s because you aren’t actually playing as a dog, instead being presented with an egg which then hatches into disturbing robotic and Lovecraftian abominations, as if they were meant to encompass the entire animal kingdom by pulling bits and pieces from species that should never be mixed.And then you’re let loose into a town of shops and minor distractions. What exactly you’re meant to do from this point on is difficult to discern, but judging by the price tags affixed to every wall and object it seems clear you’ve been dropped into something of a consumer’s paradise. There are so many TVs upon which nothing plays, so many bizarre pieces of art to hang in your empty home. Vending machines sit on every corner ready to dispense a beverage at the push of a button, or perhaps you’d prefer the unmanned cafe, coffees waiting for you on the counter.There is so much random stuff to buy in Domestic Dog Simulator, which is especially odd given there isn’t any clear way to make money to purchase any of it. Eventually I stumbled upon a random lot behind my house with a convenient sign telling me to “dig”, so obediently I began scratching at the ground and was soon rewarded with a bundle of cash that had inexplicably been buried here. “Good” the game seemed to be saying to me, “now run off to one of the shops and pick out something nice.”This, it would seem, was the life I was intended to live. One of physical labor feeding into a desire to buy things I could do nothing with. There’s no real economy in Domestic Dog Simulator, you simply exist to consume, with the menial tasks required to obtain anything attempting to disguise how hideously pointless everything is. Perhaps then this could have served to illustrate the imaginary meaning used to justify unchecked consumption, but there is no attempt at critique, no commentary on the dangers of systemic capitalistic control or even a hint that the developer recognized what they were making. It just gives the player what it thinks they want, no frills attached, with a giant billboard of the developer’s other game, Squirreltopia, being the closest it comes to actually saying something about the world it has created. I suppose it still gets the last laugh though from everyone who bought it.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. "

												Well then. Where does one begin about this game? First off let me say some stuff you have a 69% chance of finding helpfull. So i was gifted this by a good friend who likes domestic dogs and simulations. Coming across this game must have been amazing. Being the selfless guy he is he thaught better of spending his money to play it himself but instead bought it for me. Now lets talk about the core game. Domestic dog simulator is the latest in doge technology with a thrilling backstory and interesting characters. You play as a dog whose life is turned upside down when he realises he has nothing to do. You must find things for him to do and earn points. I cant really stress just how great this game can be at times. I would not be suprised if the story line was written by Vince gilligan or someone equally skilled because the acting immersed me into a world of domestic dogs which is what i was looking for. There is but one con which is the multiplayer. In a boring lesson i fantasize about being a domestic dog and running around with other domestic dogs. I know the AI are so advanced you could call them actual people but I would still pay for a multiplayer on domestic dogs just so i could fulfill my fantasies and actually learn stuff in lessons. Now if you have looked at other reviews like on IGN them please dont be fooled by the 7.5/10 ""too much doges"" because it is criminal to give a game with such a high quality a 7.5 out of 10. I myself must give this game a 9.69/10. ""not enough doges"". I spent a good 3000 hours on this game but because the gameplay was so fresh it broke my hard drive so i had to get a new one and redo my campaign to doggy stardom. This is why it says i have only played for 5 minutes. You will love this game if you want to be a dog or love dogs. Also for under £4 i really do recommend it. I would like to thank my friend Marcus for buying me this game and i would like to thank the devs for creating such a wonderful game. Not many people can make you so emotionally attached to a virtual life but SPOILERS when my dog got run over i....*sigh* i hadnt just lost a life.. I had lost  a friend.			"

												I really enjoy this game! It reminds me a lot of tamagotchi (digital pet toy).The game gets repetitive quickly as it is short, however. The achievements are fun and I'm enjoying trying to get them all. I really like how many types of dog/house combinations that are possible. The music is great and I love all the minigames inside of the game. If you're looking for a short, cute, casual game with a hint of nostalgia, check this one out!			"

They're usually some YouTube bait le epic maymay one note joke sh*t, and its not good.This isnt one of those games, in my opinion.I really enjoy this game; it looks and sounds and plays like something I would play on and NES (even with an impossibly high number of colours) in a very good way. Theres a lot more depth to the game than what is immediately obvious. There are a bunch of secrets that I really enjoyed, a few arcade games within the game that were also solid, some minigames and a Nintendo Hard warehouse robbery thats randomized. And the soundtrack is a good one too.I would give this game a solid 8/10 and a recommendation. Especially for the price, it's a great buy; I found the game really fun and charming, and still find myself playing it from time to time.			"

												Boy. Excuse my yarn-stringed review here, never written a steam review before. May as well post one here, I like this game, and enthuse about it to my friends, not only because if they don't like it they don't have to waste a bunch of money, but also because it's a fun pick up and play game.I picked this game up ages ago back when it was Domestic Dog Simulator. A lot of my friends bashed it at the time, I'm kind of frugal/poor and saw this cute atari-style game for cheap during the sale. Don't regret picking it up way back when.It's funny, but humour is subjective, either you find it funny, or you don't. People are individuals, we all have different tastes, so it's not like we can expect everyone to find the same things funny, on the same note, people most definately can have tastes in humour that lead them to find this sense of comedy boorish, unfunny, etc.It all boils down to what kind of experience you want from a game. If you were looking for a real dog simulator game... This really isn't that great, tbh. It's almost taking the♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's definately good for a bit of fun, a lot of bang for your buck. There's minigames, lots of things to do, too.Honestly? I can't really write a majorly convincing review for this game as to why you can buy it, because it'd be like trying to convince you to like MY sense of humour, which is pretty impossible. Just don't take it too seriously, it's not that deep fam. "

												Well I didn't buy it at least.I don't get it. I just don't. Like yeah okay you're a dog haha you can pee on things an do dog things in pixelated graphics woo.But it's only just a joke that lasts for a whole 0.4 hours until you've seen pretty much everything the game has to offer. I guess if you're *that guy* who likes this kinda humor and is willing to spend like 3 dollars on a gag game like this then yeah go for it bruh.But I shouldn't be too hard on it I guess? The dev's working on it, so there's always the possibility that the game expands upon our wildest imaginations, or maybe it just continues to be the poor man's tamagotchi it currently is. There's actually plenty of potential for interesting game mechanics that could extend the fun of the game if done right. But hatever this game's supposed to be, it's not bad for what it is, but what it is sucks.Hey, maybe you should put it on mobile with micro-transactions and gems, then it'd strike gold.tl;dr shallow joke steam review bait that only has long lasting appeal to very shallow joke people.Oh also the mini-games are pretty fun so there's that.

												Well I didn't buy it at least.I don't get it. I just don't. Like yeah okay you're a dog haha you can pee on things an do dog things in pixelated graphics woo.But it's only just a joke that lasts for a whole 0.4 hours until you've seen pretty much everything the game has to offer. I guess if you're *that guy* who likes this kinda humor and is willing to spend like 3 dollars on a gag game like this then yeah go for it bruh.But I shouldn't be too hard on it I guess? The dev's working on it, so there's always the possibility that the game expands upon our wildest imaginations, or maybe it just continues to be the poor man's tamagotchi it currently is. There's actually plenty of potential for interesting game mechanics that could extend the fun of the game if done right. But hatever this game's supposed to be, it's not bad for what it is, but what it is sucks.Hey, maybe you should put it on mobile with micro-transactions and gems, then it'd strike gold.tl;dr shallow joke steam review bait that only has long lasting appeal to very shallow joke people.Oh also the mini-games are pretty fun so there's that.

												Sure, it doesnt have alot of content, but the content it has is pretty fun (The dev is also adding DLC in the future) :) The achievements are very fun to complete, and is there really another game where you can just go around and pee on everything? It's a cute little game that I enjoyed playing through, and it is priced accordingly (3$) It is a very simple, fun, cheap game that I would rate 6/10. If it was more then 3$ however, I wouldn't buy it. (I got it for like 1 cent >:))			"

I started out as robo-dog and then died some how and respawned as a completely different and normal looking dog.  They tried for this forced 8-bit look to their graphics that just makes it look like a horrible bootleg of an old DOS game.  There is 8-bit done right, and then theres this game.  If you're looking for a whacky, silly game this isn't it.  Don't waste your money and instead buy something thats way better like Goat Simulator or Super Amazing Wagon Adventure.Game Play: 0/10Sound: 0/10Graphics: -5/10Replay Value: 0/10			"

Domestic Dog Simulator is a simulator game where you play as a dog, 8-bit style and full of colours and animations.This game is Funny and entertaining.The game starts in our house. As the egg. Then, we start playig. We need to eat,♥♥♥♥♥♥ poop and do a lot of things to keep alive :)everything we can do as a dog and there are really good things, some little challenges, and some violent and frustrating deaths,sometimes bringing me close to heart attack. It's not easy to play for about 1 hour, reach level 4, and then die from one car hit.In this game we can do EVERYTHING as the dogs from REAL LIFE. There are not a big list of things they do in RL. They poop, pee on EVERYTHING, break stuff, bark for no reason, eat some ugly poop and chase squirrels.This game is actually funny and pretty short in terms of getting 100% of achievements.We also have some cool animals except dogs in this game. There are some ninja turtles, rabbits, raccoons, pigs and sheeps...  I also love the idea of unique ""POOP EXPLOSIVE"". We can even destroy a car with it :D There is also some hidden places, if u don't wanna get bored by searching it, just google about it like a normal man (y) ! Also, we can dig and find money/bones/meat.. :D Cooool thing is that we have an ATM Card, so we can store our money. Vets are pretty cool. I was afraid of them, but now when they removed my fleas i like them <3 <3 Ok, this got a little weird, right doc?And yes, here i go. We can ROB !!YES ! We can rob warehouse ! I just don't know will my dog rob me, i hope he wont.. Damn, this game is sooo strange. Ghosts,Robs,Stuff Breaking..I'm done. ##### PRO'S : ##### 1. I like the idea of ""DOG GHOSTS"". We can find them in the church/cementry area, north of our house. 2. Ninja turtles,rabbits, raccoons, sheps , pigs and few more, is the animals we can find in this game.3. Unique idea of ATM Cards.4. POOP Explosive. I think i never heard about it before this game..5. Game is short in terms of getting 100% of achievements.6. Unique idea of randomly spawn as ALIEN DOG and evenn recieve achievement for that. Yes, ALIEN DOG we can spawn as is ""Houndeye"" from the game Half-Life 2.##### CON'S : ##### 1. We cannot save game and our original dog. 2. It's really too cheap. TRUST ME, THIS GAME IS ONE OF THE BEST ANIMAL SIMULATOR GAMES

												this game isnt worth 1 dollar, nor 2, and definitly not 3 dollars.

JUST LIKE A REAL DOG. THATS IT! YOU ARENT MENT TO HAVE FUN, YOU ARE MENT TO BE A DOG. A BORING DOG THAT JUST EATS AND SLEEPS. IT EVEN SAYS IT IN THE NAEM ""DOMESTIC DOG SIMULATOR"" THATS IT, THATS ALL. DONT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU HAVE  3 #$%!ING BUCKS TO WASTE			"

												Sometimes I wonder what developers think about when making a game that makes them go… “yeah, I’ll totally sell this game!” even if the price is under $4.Domestic Dog by Surreal Distractions is one such game. A dog-sim of sorts wanting to masquerade for something with actual substance (as I suppose most “something simulator” games are… ), you will be greeted with absolutely no tutorial and no idea of what the hell you’re supposed to do. Survive, I suppose. Basically you manage a dog that grows out of some sort of egg – the dog you get is random, and when you die, another one appears (not the same one, so you lose any “progress” made). You have food, water, dog money?, sleep – a few other stats to keep track of, basic stuff. You need to keep those up or you may pass out and/or die in the process. Tip of the day, in case it’s not obvious: You also have to mind cars, since they may run you over.What to do in the game? Well, be a dog, maybe? Eat, drink, poop, pee (sorry, I mean, ‘fire your weapon’) , bark at other dogs, eat said poo… you have a minuscule map, a shop with pointless things, and pretty much that’s it for the game. Boring doesn’t even begin to describe it. There is really nothing to salvage for me in this game: the graphics are terrible, pixelation has never looked so bad, and outdated (sorry, I mean, ‘retro’) bright colors are sure to blind you. Because we all know if we refer to a game as “retro” it automatically must forgive all design flaws. Yup!The UI feels cluttered and messy, everything seems to be moving, or too bright, or otherwise vying for your attention. The dogs themselves look rather ugly, even for alien dogs. To crown the beauty, the quite matching but horrifying 8-bit styled music and sounds effects (which are really loud, by the way!) are hideous. There is no semblance of a menu that I could see, thus I could find no way to lower the volume, and quite frankly I didn’t even bother to look beyond the esc key, I just muted everything while I played.If you enjoyed this then that's great, but it was absolutely NOT the game for me.So, would I recommend this? Sorry, but no. Steer clear.			"

												english/german review here.i played this game like 2 hours until now and i saw pretty much everything (until now. wait for patches!) still its fun to pick it up and play. today at school i thought of this game and thought of derping around as dog. its really fun and worth the money! ich habe das spiel bisher ca 2 stunden gespielt und schon alles gesehn was es zu sehen gibt (bis jetzt. wartet auf patches!) es macht trotzdem noch spaß es zu spielen. heute in der schule musste ich sogar dran denken und hab mich TIERISCH darauf gefreut bisschen rumzublödeln. es macht wirklich spaß und ist das geld wert!

												This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developers.Domestic Dog Simulator is a very weird experience and I had a lot of difficulties trying to write this review so here goes my best shot. Domestic Dog Simulator is just that, a dog simulator. You are spawned in the map and you can go around and do doggy activities like♥♥♥♥♥♥on everything you see, dig holes and play arcade games. The game is as crazy as it sounds but the game is really bad. The game is played like a classic NES game where you can walk around and try to find treasures. You can use the money you find to decorate your house and stuff like that. The game gets incredibly boring incredibly fast as there is not much stuff to do. The game is also really buggy. Animals glitch through walls, the controls sometimes don't work and stuff like that. The music is really bad, and there's not a lot to do. Overall there's is not much to say about Domestic Dog Simulator. It's just a bad game. Only get this game on a heavy sale or just skip it entirely. I give Domestic Dog Simulator a 3/10			"

												Stone simulator, bread simulator, grass simulator... and now a domestic dog simulator.In this game you play as a dog. I expected something  similar than nintendogs but the game looks like a spectrum game of 80's. You must eat, drink and sleep to survive,walk around neighbourhood and pee and poo everywhere you want.Not bad to play a couple of hours but there is no more far away.  It has  achivements and trading cards , so this is its best point. PD: Thanks to Shade00			"

												Even though I was provided a free key by the developer, I cannot recommend this game in good faith. I did enjoy it for a couple of hours, so that may very well be worth the $3 to many people. It has charm, and it's amusing, and I liked the mini-games - but the primary problem was there there simply was not enough content. After an hour or two, you will have done pretty much everything. Any time further spent will either be just goofing around, or chasing pointless and grindy achievements. Buy it on sale, or if you just want some short-term light amusement and to support an indie dev.			"

												This game is, well, interesting.Graphics: 6/10It has a very pixelated style. It is 8-bit, (I suppose?) and, well, to put it frankly, not very memorable or pretty. There isn't much to say about this since the game is very small. Also, Why is it called Domestic Dog Simulator? It doesn't feature many domestic dogs, with many more sick deformities.Sound: N/AI played muted, so I don't care.Gameplay:5/10Well, the gameplay is very meh. There isn't much stuff to do on the map yet, and I hope there are more updates, but so far there is almost nothing. There is almost no threat, except fleas and the all to annoying cars. The game boast marking territory, but even if you do, it does nothing. It is just a silly game, with much work to be done.Final Score: 6/10I wish you the best of luck, and I hope you update the game soon.			"

												After playing this game for 300 hours total (offline) I can safely say that Domestic Dog Simulator is now my go-to game for training as a Domestic Dog. Ever since I was a young girl, I wished that I could be a Domestic Dog. I trained for day and night, I went through hundreds of puppies, mirroring them, mimicking them. I knew there had to be a better way.I truly have to thank the developers of Domestic Dog Simulator. You have completely turned my life around - given me reason. You have explained to me how I can truly do what I live for in life, and made me realise my true and full potential.Thank you, my friends. Thank you.(6/10, alright game.)			"

												According to all known lawsof aviation, there is no way a beeshould be able to fly. Its wings are too small to getits fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't carewhat humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow!Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry?- Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening?- I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your fatherpaid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate.We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz.- Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.- Bye! Barry, I told you,stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam.- Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel?- A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school,three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I tooka day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry.- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie?- Yeah. - You going to the funeral?- No, I'm not going. Everybody knows,sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel.Such a hothead. I guess he could havejust gotten out of the way. I love this incorporatingan amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp...under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men.- We are! - Bee-men.- Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oitygraduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your careerat Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennasinside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like?- A little scary. Welcome to Honex,a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee,have worked your whole life to get to the point where youcan work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant PollenJocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected,scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctivegolden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot.- She's my cousin! - She is?- Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right.- At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspectof bee existence. These bees are stress-testinga new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes?- Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement,the Krelman. - What does that do?- Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs aresmall ones. But bees know that every small job,if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the jobyou pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life?I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees,as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?""How can you say that? One job forever?That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only haveto make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could theynever have told us that? Why would you question anything?We're bees. We're the most perfectlyfunctioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe thingswork a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you knowwhat I'm talking about. Please clear the gate.Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!- Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's likeoutside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks!- Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters!You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were.- I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knowswhere, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a PollenJock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollenthan you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol.Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing itand the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies?Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys.- Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerousbeing a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned meagainst a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat,and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my!- I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today,wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patchsix miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh?- Barry! A puddle jump for us,but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am.- You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy?Are you bee enough? I might be. It all dependson what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices.- But you only get one. Do you ever get boreddoing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you justmove it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm.It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad,the more I think about it, maybe the honey fieldjust isn't right for me. You were thinking of what,making balloon animals? That's a bad jobfor a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not surehe wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes.- I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're goinginto honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer?- No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now.I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Geta gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today!- Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobswill be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available?- Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations!Step to the side. - What'd you get?- Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first?- No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open,not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman?- Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See?He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

It may seem as though I'm saying that I dislike the game and don't enjoy, but realize that I made this review with the minimum requirement of 5 minutes of game time.  After actually playing this I can see that while the game does have its problems (as does every game), it is also very entertaining.Since it is fairly cheap, I recommend trying it to see if you enjoy it or not.  And while you're at it, try figuring out some of the secrets in the game!			"

												A fun game, genuinely fun; but not without its faults.  The only real problem it has is how quickly your hunger stat drops and how much food costs, you'd think how often you need the food it would be cheaper, or in greater quantity. Also, buying food in bulk doesnt work, i wasted so much money before I realized.			"

												I purchased this game on sale for 2.20$ ( Canadian ). And. All I have to say is that. This game is amazing. I rate 8/8. Only now do I know what it feels like to ride around on rollerblades peeing on innocent friendly dogs while wearing a very stylish collar! I'd get arrested if I did that in real life. I can now say I know what that feels like. Buy this game.			"

												I understand that a game for $2 isn't going to have the most content but it's fun to explore and find out what to do. I can see why they would have few instructions because the fun part is figuring it out, rather than being forced through a boring tutorial. It isn't rocket science. If you are a dog loving freak (like me) and looking for a casual game to kill some down time, it's worth the pocket change.			"

												The finest dog rpg available. Seriously, there are a surprising number of activities to keep you entertained. Parts of it clearly exist just to be gross/weird (although it is certainly realistic for a dog to eat its own poop), but it's just flat out fun to explore and experiment to find all the things you can do and what rewards they'll give you. For the low price, it's a nice diversion from more serious fare.			"

												Domestic Dog Simulator is a lot like Goat Simulator. The game's charm revolves around its alien way of interpreting what a dog is, much like Goat Simulator does with its titular Goat. ""DOGS POOP TO LEVEL UP,"" says the alien being who has constructed this simulator. ""DOGS WAGE WARS WITH CARS BY EATING CHOCOLATE AND TAKING EXPLOSIVE DUMPS ON THE ROAD. DOGS ALSO SMOKE WEED BY EXTRACTING THE POPPY SEEDS FROM THE DOGNIP PLANTS. DOGS ALSO DIG HOLES IN THE GROUND TO MAKE DOG DOLLARS, WHICH DOGS USE TO BUY FLAT SCREEN TVs.""All of that is fun, however I am not so sure that the RPG elements mesh well with the dog simulator element of the game. Half the time I didn't know what the hell the UI was trying to tell me. When the poop bar is full, do I need to poop? Or is that when the poop bar is empty? What is the dog face all about? (It turns out it's a dog happiness meter, something I could easily replenish by playing an arcade game.) It has a very lovely retro look and feel, but I think it needs to explain itself better.I got approximately an hour's worth of fun out of this game, but I didn't find myself wanting to come back to it after that, much like Goat Simulator lasting around four hours before I abandoned it. If you're the pedantic sort who likes making charts in Excel comparing the amount of money vs. the amount of time, I think three bucks for an hour's worth of whatever the hell this is is a fine deal.  (This game was purchased and gifted by Lemon. Lemon is a fine man who runs The F Plus podcast[thefpl.us], a podcast which I am on. He is also the co-creator of a game called The Wrongest Words, where players are given horrid things to defend in front of their friends and family! It's like Fibbage, except Fibbage doesn't let you try to defend dried pee as a perfume or Laura Ingalls Wilder.

												Whats the point of writing a negative review about a game that is worth the price it seems, I payed 2 bucks and thats what I got! two bucks of fun. Honestly I'd be more than happy to play more as it gets updated. Its simply, a little tedious at times and the day/ night goes so fast I feel like other certain actions, like digging need the same speed up... but over all. Yeah the game is just that. so take the sticks out of your butts, downvotes and take my review with a grain of salt. Its not bad but its not like its the best game on steam EVER.			"

												Any game that uses streams of pee and big steaming piles of poo as weapons and for doing graffiti - is a game I need to try! Half-joking, but hey, dogs gotta do what dogs gotta do!  I wish there was in-game help or a tutorial system that explained things the first time around. Not sure what to do with bones I dig up. Not sure what to do with meat that I grilled. I can't seem to eat or chew them, just kick them around... but regardless it's a fun little game when you just want some quick goof off time.  I paid two dollars for it and already got my money's worth just exploring the game mechanics.  If you like inexpensive games with humor, this spoof on a dog's life is for you.  And if not, who cares when it's that cheap?			"

It is pretty basic, but a lot of thought, timing and patience is required to complete some tasks.Worth it if you want a game to just muck around with and play when you're bored. I personally enjoy watching my dogs cruise around town on rollerblades while high on dognip and blowing up cars with explosive poop. Classy.			"

												For the price it was worth it. I do have some recomendations for making the game even better. The firsts one is a better tutorial, or a list of the keys to use. I still do not know how to pick a bone up. If the dog can not pick up the bone, ball, or other things please make it possible. that would be great if my dog could chew on a bone. also it would be funny to dress my dog up in funny outfits. Another great thing to add is barking. Dogs are suppost to bark with the acception of Basenjis. It would be so funny if My dog could hump other dogs. some people might think it is crude. being able to have your dog go for a swim, or bathe would be awesome. So many more ideas. I will just leave it at that.Love:Alora campbell (The extreme game enthusiast)			"

												A fun little game where you run around as a dog, doing dog stuff. Not too complex at all (once you get past the initial bump) and the wide range of dogs, rooms, etc. is quite nice, too. The achievements are fun and sometimes amusing. A couple of things I wish it had are directions at the start (explanations, maybe a little tutorial so that you know what you're expected to be doing to make money and so on) and a save file, even if it autosaves. That way if you need to leave, you can come back to it later.			"

												Well, this was an amusing title. xD If you ever wanted to play The Sims as a pet, well, you've sort of got that here.  It's rather bizarre I suppose but I had a lot of fun with it.  You can dig up holes in various spots to get money (or herd animals to certain spots but digging seemed faster).  That money is used for food, toys, house decorations, new collars, or whatever is in the stores.  They are quite a few secret areas to discover (I was lazy and used a guide) and some mini arcade games to play (Dogger - a dog frogger, Dig Dog - a dog boulderdash, and a few others).So yeah...there isn't any real overarching goal to the game but just have fun♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on things, barking at other dogs or animals, digging up holes, laying down explosive poop (after eating chocolate)...you know, just being a dog. ;)  The soundtrack is sorta 8-bitish which fits the graphic style of the game and definiting digging (har har) some of the tracks found ingame.I picked it up from a Groupees bundle so I didn't pay anywhere near what it's priced at, but I've enjoyed it regardless for the short time I've spent on it.  It's basically a time waster to get some laughs at so if you need something like that then give this a shot!			"

												The perfect game to play when you just want to relax and kill time. Very simple controls and simple game play, perfect for those who enjoy ""old school"" graphics but not the best for those who hate casual games. A very nice game for a very decent price.			"

												Well, this was an amusing title. xD If you ever wanted to play The Sims as a pet, well, you've sort of got that here.  It's rather bizarre I suppose but I had a lot of fun with it.  You can dig up holes in various spots to get money (or herd animals to certain spots but digging seemed faster).  That money is used for food, toys, house decorations, new collars, or whatever is in the stores.  They are quite a few secret areas to discover (I was lazy and used a guide) and some mini arcade games to play (Dogger - a dog frogger, Dig Dog - a dog boulderdash, and a few others).So yeah...there isn't any real overarching goal to the game but just have fun♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on things, barking at other dogs or animals, digging up holes, laying down explosive poop (after eating chocolate)...you know, just being a dog. ;)  The soundtrack is sorta 8-bitish which fits the graphic style of the game and definiting digging (har har) some of the tracks found ingame.I picked it up from a Groupees bundle so I didn't pay anywhere near what it's priced at, but I've enjoyed it regardless for the short time I've spent on it.  It's basically a time waster to get some laughs at so if you need something like that then give this a shot!			"

												I think in order to like this game the idea of a virtual pet should be one you found apealing either in your child hood or recently. The point of the game is to dog (yes the verb dog). Its silly, gross, simple, pointless, and generally just light fun. I got this game because my younger brother saw it on youtube and wanted it really bad and I have to say it was entertaining to play around with. If you are looking for a puzzle game, this isnt it. This legit is a silly dog game with some fun SIMPLE aspects and puzzle like mini game things. If its on sale I\'d get it. I did pay full price for it though and Im happy with it. Its a fun pass time when you have legit nothing to do or a good game to get little kids with a sense of humer.			"

												If you're a fan of pixel games, buy Domestic Dog Simulator. I adored it completely.There's a good few hours of work to do the achievements, and so many possibilities. Also- the game is still being updated.5/5, would recommend.			"

												It's okay. Domestic Dog Simulator and Goat Simulator are the only two faux-Simulator games I know of that are worth anything.DDS has the potential to be fun. There are several different diversions and things to do. Randomly generated dogs and certain areas keep things interesting enough. There's something strangely hypnotic about it. The dogs require a gratuitous amount of maintaining their stats (Hunger, Thirst, Poop, etc.) but you only need to have the majority of them in good standing; you can go without food and happiness for long periods of time so long as you continue to drink, sleep and be fit. There's an EKG beside your stats that will fluctuate - will beep when you're in mortal danger.At times the controls that require tap-tap-tapping of WASD can put you in danger when you wouldn't think you should be (lasers in the warehouse have a much bigger hit radius than it'd seem) - standard complaint with most of those pixel-side-scrolling-things. Once you've make made the rounds a few times, the world suddenly feels empty. There are no sound options and the windowed mode is laughable (requires a magnifying glass). I enjoy playing DDS (thus far - unsure of how long that'll last), so I record this as a Positive Recommendation. I implore potential buyers to read the negative reviews; seems the positive reviews are full of headache-inducing ""jokes"" - the negative reviews (other'n the raging ones) are much more relevant to those who want to know what's what.Domestic Dog Simulator IS another one of ""those"" ""Simulator"" games, but it's acceptable, (>)decent(?) even.

												Yeah, this is a silly gimmick game. But the cost is so low, that even if I played just for three hours, well, it's one euro per hour and it's still cheaper than a public toilet, if I wanted to sit there for three hours.Good:-It's a brainless time-killer, but it does the job.-Music is pretty cool, to be quite honest.-It has cards and achievements.-You can pee on stuff.Bad:-It lags outdoors. Terribly. My PC is very bad, true, but this game isn't Skyrim. Please, do something about the optimalisation.-You can't save, and I have heavy suspicion it's caused not by making the gameplay more challenging, or having possibility to check out more dogs, but by dev being lazy.-Graphics are like drawn by a 12-year old. All dogs look like creepy aliens. But maybe it's done on purpose. The colors are eerie, but not jarring.So, in conclusion:If you want some easy, silly entertainment and you enjoy bizzare and sometimes a little crude humor, go for it.			"

												HORRIBLE.This is the first game I have disliked so  much that I had to write a review. You can't  do very much in this game, if you want an open world animal sim then just play goat simulator, it is 100x better than this game. I bought it thinking it would be a fun simulator, I was wrong. Here's my advice, save your 3 dollars and buy anything else.			"

												A fun little game where you run around as a dog, doing dog stuff. Not too complex at all (once you get past the initial bump) and the wide range of dogs, rooms, etc. is quite nice, too. The achievements are fun and sometimes amusing. A couple of things I wish it had are directions at the start (explanations, maybe a little tutorial so that you know what you're expected to be doing to make money and so on) and a save file, even if it autosaves. That way if you need to leave, you can come back to it later.			"
