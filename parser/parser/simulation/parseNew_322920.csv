												NOT A PRE-RELEASE REVIEWThis is one of my favorite alpha games ever to hit Steam.. And It's a damn shame I have to stomp it into the ground because during the estimated 1-2 years of work I expected this game to take before beginning to reach a finished state, the developers had a stroke of genius and decided that it would be a good idea to call this HEAVY ALPHA GAME a FULLY RELEASED TITLE after being on Steam for only 5-6 months. Doing so, Avalanche Studios have yet again showed the world that they do not give a damn about actually delivering a polished product to customers and fans alike and instead falsely advertise & release yet another unfinished glitch-fest onto Steam like a big, flaccid díck onto your dinner table, expecting a price-tag of 30€ for an experience you can expect out of a glitchy tech demo.I mean holy hell. They JUST spewed out a new dinosaur with this ""release update"".. AND IT HAS NO TESTING DONE TO IT WHATSOEVER. If you still insist on buying this garbage, kindly make note of the following issues the game currently has:------------------------------------------------------------------1. Animations for both dinosaurs and players are on a ""Proof of Concept"" level at most, and when combined with point 2, It makes for a disgusting game-play experience as far as immersion is concerned.2. The AI is absolutely atrocious. All dinosaurs can get extremely stuck on certain hills, get seizures or freeze up indefinitely if you decide to go up on a rock, the T-Rex can use you as a surf-board and stand ontop of you indefinitely without being able to attack if you go prone and have him not see and ""aggro"" you directly (Realistic, right?), The smallest of dinosaurs can take 10+ shotgun slugs to the head (and smash their skulls to thousand pieces) and still be alive & charge your person endlessly with no difficulty or signs of being stunned whatsoever, T-Rexes can with a 100% accuracy pinpoint your location If they hear you, say, walk at a steady pace 500 meters away, they WILL rush your location and insta-gib you unless you log out. Fun fun fun!3. The game has a disgusting lack of realism. Building on the previous statement of the dinosaurs having nonexistant AI in regards to stun or reactions overall, the game does not allow you to do VERY basic things like jumping while also having an absolutely broken ""Hit-detection"" system whereas you can know the exact angle and 3d space of say, a raptor's heart, shoot it with a shotgun slug.. And have the bullet either go through him completely, missing all organs or hit another bodypart. It's disgustingly random and sometimes, you can even get one-shot-kills without hitting any organs - and have no damage show up in the dino death re-cap window. There are also another giant design problem and that is the way that foilage works in this game. Dinosaurs do not say, leave grass bent or otherwise moved when they pass through it. It's like they're ghosts, so every time you chase or otherwise look for a dino where foilage is thick - you WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE IT. EVEN IF YOU KNOW IT'S RIGHT INFRONT OF YOU IN THE GRASS. It is one of these GIANT design issues that force you to avoid grassy areas all-together and it really brings light on how much of an alpha game this shít of a title really is.4. The game is very unoptimized. Most PC's struggle to run this game and while I didn't have any particular big problems myself, the forums speak for themselves though and following the numerous complaints I saw, I made a closer inspection and did infact see that my G-Card had a tendency to being extremely hot when playing.5. The developers do not take advice or read the forums. Ditto. It took them literally 3-4 months to notice a typo in the forum section called ""Thoughts & Suggtesions"" or something like that and that's just a depressing realization as there are literally hundreds of posts made - Not ONE of them has seen their ideas/suggestions been implemented into the game.6. There is legitimately no goal in this game. You roam around like an idiot (sometimes for a whole hour or more if you're unlucky), looking for dinosaurs with a shoddy bow and If you want to have different weapons, you HAVE TO <-- go to a pre-defined location and rummage through larger crates... Or die and go to the store that have rétárded level restrictions on all weapons & ammo that can sometimes require you to kill literally hundreds of dinos before having THE OPTION <-- to spend your own points to spawn with the gun you want next time you die. Crafting? End-game? Goals? Plot? Story? What's that?7. Sounds are downright broken and extremely confusing. Your own footsteps can make stomping noises with that of a T-Rex if you take small steps and listen carefully while certain raptors simply have no sounds to them at all except the standard ""chop"" attack bits while others have loud yelping calls, aggro noises, etc etc. While It certainly has jump-scared me a few times to get my buttocks suddenly chewed on by something that didn't make even the tiniest of noise, having some raptors suddenly become Batman in the Jungle while the rest are akin with that of howler monkeys is not a good as far as gameplay consistency is concerned.------------------------------------------------------------------Avoid this game and for the love of god, avoid the developers just as much. unless you enjoy being ripped off.

												===ANOTHER UPDATE===The birds are completely fixed now and no longer pick you up and drop you from a height and kill you. They'll only do that now when you're on low health so it's much better. The game has improved since my last update, the triceratops now act like rhinos instead of deer which is much better. ===UPDATE===They've updated the birds and the game is once again enjoyable as long as you stay away from the volcano (where the birds spawn). But I still stand by my comments about it not being a release spec game, this is still the quality of an early access game by far. ========================================REVIEW ON FIRST DAY OF RELEASE:In early access this game was brilliant. On release however, they added the new flying dino with a strange name which I can't remember... The new species has ruined the balance of the game, it'd been added with little to no thought whatsoever. It's a rushed release. In it's current state, I would not buy the game. I won't be playing it in it's current state either. The game used to be challenging but enjoyable, now it's overly challenging with you dying 10 times an hour and eventually rage quitting with nothing enjoyable about it. I'd rather take on a T-Rex than the over powered birds. With a T-Rex, you can hear it, you can see it coming, you have a chance. These birds, you'll probably shoot it once it'll grab you and drop you from a height and you die and there's nothing you can do about it. There are still crashes, tons of glitches, this is no where near a ""release spec"" game. Don't buy the game unless they've updated it and fixed the above.			"

												There are simply too many unresolved balancing mechanics, and features missing for this to be labeled as a ""full"" release. As much as I love the concept, the execution here is flawed, and you will soon find these flaws as you progress playing. For now I am sad to have to give this game a thumb down, it has ways to go before I can call it a good game.			"

												First off, this IS NOT a terrible game by any means. There is a lot of potential. I however would not suggest it due to the fact that there is so little to do. You can kill a few dinosaurs and go on about your business. You'll get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥a few times, because of the occasional spawn kill but it gets boring. Not a high enough loot drop ratio to make things entirely fair and/or  interesting. Once you kill some t-rex's and trikes everything is boring from my perspective. If you've been eye-balling this game like I was, just wait a while because, as of right now, it's not worth $30. Just my opinion, take it with a grain of salt.			"

												While the concept behind this game has potential, the developers seem to have abandoned the development. It feels very empty, predictable, and lacking features you would expect in this kind of game. The devs expressed to the players that they will develop this game over time, yet that has not been the case at all. The only update I have seen in the several months I have owned it is a few rare dino skins; hardly a feature to make it worth waiting for updates for.As with others that have reviewed this game, it seems like the devs have baited players to purchase this game, only to use the funds to continue work on their free-to-play conterpart: The Hunter.I must say that until the devs actually commit resources to further development, I cannot, and do not recommend this game to ANYONE!SLIGHT UPDATE: This game still sucks as of 8/2016. The only other update to this game since I have owned it was to add missing sounds back in January.My recommendation is still for everyone to avoid this game and developer!If you're looking for a dino game, I suggest that you check out ""Primal Carnage: Extinction"" instead. It's not a fantastic game, but it's much better than this pile of garbage!			"

Early Access Review
								In laymans terms, this game mixes the Carnivores experience with a survival aspect. I found myself listening very closely for cues about nearby dinosaurs, as well as looking for dangerous foliage. The sound in this game is so excellent, it's hard to describe in words. This is one of the few dinosaur games in a long time that feels 'serious', in my opinion. There are a fair share of bugs (rubberbanding dinosaurs, some collision issues), but for 85% of the game, you more than likely wont notice an issue. This game fills a void that I have been longing to satiate for years. Highly recommended!Check out the video for a hands-on look (no terrible BG music or lame voiceovers, I promise!)http://www.twitch.tv/gamethesison/b/599497190EDIT: I'll leave this anecdotal part here             5 minutes in, a Tyrannosaur charged me, drug me down a mountain, and feasted on my body. 10/10 would die again			"

												God d****t, god f*****g d****t it happened again.Another product not ready for release. D':[EDIT3]: I would like to update this review to address some of the points brought up by some reviewers who have thumbed up this game: 1) People who thumb down this game are little kids who just want call of duty can can't handle the difficulty of this game.  My response: Um, hello? Have you been playing this game?  It's seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly easy now.  I have no idea what you are talking about.  Yes, things used to be very dangerous, you used to have to actually hunt, but now you can just run full speed through the forest and if anything comes at you all you have to do is step to the side or next to a rock and because of the crappy pathing you can just blow anything away COD stye.  Let me just say for those that have not yet bought this game, anyone who makes this argument has no idea what they are talking about.  I mean seriously, there's one guy on here with like 500 hours on this game saying that . . . 500 ♥♥♥♥ing hours . . . 500 ♥♥♥♥ING HOURS! 500 ♥♥♥♥ING HOURS IN A ♥♥♥♥ING HALF BAKED EARLY ACCESS WITH 5 ♥♥♥♥ING DINOSAURS THAT PRETTY MUCH JUST RANDOMLY WALK AROUND!  500 ♥♥♥♥ING HOURS!!!! ARE YOU ♥♥♥♥ING KIDDING ME?!?!  I PLAYED THE♥♥♥♥♥♥OUT OF SKYRIM WITH LIKE A BILLION CHARACTERS, WEAPONS, QUESTS, ETC. AND I COULD ONLY DO 300 HOURS AND YOU'RE ♥♥♥♥ING TELLING ME YOU PUT IN 500 ♥♥♥♥ING HOURS WITH LIKE A FEW ♥♥♥♥ING  WEAPONS AND 5 ♥♥♥♥ING DINOSAURS THAT ALMOST DO ♥♥♥♥ING NOTHING.  This game is not ♥♥♥♥ing better than my beloved Skyrim.  Don't waste your money.2) Yeah they shouldn't have released this game and yeah they messed up on the release update but they are trying to fix it so everything will be ok.My response: I think you are delusional. :p  They are trying to fix the update because they haven't gotten any money because of all the negative reviews.  That is the only reason they have responded.  So let me explain what's really going on.  This is a cash grab.  The developers are trying to pull a fast one on us by making this very flashy appearing game that we have all been desiring for a long time, make it barely playable, release it as a full game, and rake in the doe as people buy this game thinking its something it's not.  They know exactly what they are doing and there will be nothing further added on to the game once they make it playable again after those f****** birds.  Furethermore, even if they fix the game from the update that's not the problem, the problem is that they are trying to rip us off by trying to make this whole debacule ok.  Well it's not ok babe.  So for those who haven't bought this yet, don't waste your money.Chasing the early access dragon never pays off; I swear I will never do early access again.[EDIT]:  I hope this is an April fools joke.[EDIT2]: Nope not an April fools joke. Also, this is not a pre-release review!I just don't understand, this game has so much potential, it is so awesome even when it was early access.  Why release it now when it clearly is alpha?So let me go through some of the clear issues real fast:1) As another review said, they just released a new dinosaur. . . untested. . .2) The entire island is made of predators (except the triceratops) . . .3) There are no interaction between dinosaurs (no t-rex eating raptors etc.)4) you can easily step to the side and are invulnerable to the raptors due to primitive pathing.5) AI in general is meh.  Dinosarus just walk around aimlessly until they sense a player and either run away or run towards them.  Sometimes you might be hunted by a raptor which is cool right up til you simply step to the side and blow him away cause he's a complete retard. 6) No real survival mechanics despite the claim in the discription.  As far as survival mechanics go, you just get weapons and shoot at poorly AI driven lizards.7) Sounds have no direction so you cannot tell where the dinosaurs are comming from.  You just know they are somewhere around you.8) Primitive hunting mechanics that are not explained at all.  There's cammo you can find but I'm not sure it actually does anything, nothing with smells as far as I can tell, and sounds are a factor but are prone to glitches.  A.k.a. it is impossible to hide from a T-Rex.  You can track dinosaurs and there is sign but it's obvious, takes no real effort, and your gps does all the work somehow for you.9) The characters look like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hipsters who have some fetish for taking weird selfies with whatever they've managed to kill on this island. DX  Makes me want to get eaten.10) There are so many things that obvously need to be put into the game for a full release but aren't its seriously depressing.  I mean this game could be good, like really really good.Basically I would recommend this game if and only if it was put back into early access and reasonably regular updates happened over the course of a year or two.  That is what we all expected and were happy with.  I mean seriously I'm perfectly fine with a game taking time to develop as long as reasonable progress is made.While this game has amazing potential, I cannot in good faith recommend it because it is alpha and should NOT be considered a full release.[EDIT]: And these god d**n birds have ruined everything.  Seriously I'm pretty sure this release is an early April fools joke because this is ridiculous.  I mean seriously unbelieveable.  If it is just a joke I will update this review to a recommend.[EDIT2]: Nope not April fools joke.  And you know what the worst part is?""We are satisfied with how the Early Access phase went, with comminuty's help we managed to develop and implement everything we planned and promised when we set off on this journey three and a half months ago - two new dinosaur species, PVP and team support, player XP, in-game currency and store, localization in 13 languages, two new weapons and lots of tweaks and fixes. ""So comming strait from the Dev's mouth here's how all this went down:First they came to the community with a concept that seemed great.  Then in three + months they added ""two new dinosaur species, PVP and team support, player XP, in-game currency and store, localization in 13 languages, two new weapons and lots of tweaks and fixes"", said the game was done and decided to charge $30 instead of the early access $20 (so apparently according to the Devs what actually amounts to a tiny bit of content and basic functionality is worth $10 percopy in and of itself).Well let's just say you need to do a lot more than that to finish a game.

												****** DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ****** ****** DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ****** ****** DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ******This game is absolutley terrible, it is underdeveloped, unplanned and was obviously just a quick scheme to get some funds for the company. The IDEA for the game was good, and I really tied to like it, but the application was horrific (I'm listing 10 reasons below)1. They simply took the engine of the previous theHunter game and added a few dinosaurs, no improvements on the engine or any attempt to make the game actually exciting (So yes I'm saying 99% of the time the game is Very BORING).2. Your character can't carry more than 20KG, which is not nearly enough in comparison to the amount of bullets it takes to kill a single dinosaur (once I shot a triceretops with 23 bullets before it dropped, and that is only ONE dinosaur, it took me about week in real life to gather all those bullets). I managed to kill 2 T-rex's due to the Clipping bug where they got stuck in the wall. They either have to make the dinosaurs weaker, add more bullets, or add more backpack space.3. Your character dies 90% of the time with a single attack, a T-rex (one blow and you're dead), the Quetzalcoatlus picks you up and throws you down and you're dead, the Utahraptor comes in packs of 5 or 6 so unless you're carrying a vast amount of bullets, surving them is rather slim (but carrying a lot of bullets is also extremely unlikley since you have a 20KG limit)4. You start off with a machete, which does practically no damage at all. They wan't to give you the ""feel"" of a survival game, but no options to build a shelter or a place to store bullets and guns you've picked up (since you're sitting with limited space on you as a person), also no place to purchase more bullets once you run out.5. The game has a purchasing system where you get money for every kill (upon spawing ONLY), but you have to be an incredibly high level to be able to unlock decent guns, which is very stupid since you start off most of the time getting killed in the first 10 minutes (because you have no way to defend yourself properly).6. Running is a severe problem since the character is so slow, he only sprints for 100mtrs and takes forever to regenerate his stamina. Your character weights 60KG in the game and normally people that weight can sprint a LOT further since they have no extra body weight to carry.7. There are practically only carnivores in the game, which makes no sense at all (Apart from the triceretops). If there are only carnivores, what exactly do THEY eat? The had to add a lot more herbivores as well example: Galimimus (for the herd effect), Brachiosaurus (big game hunting), stegosaures etc.8. If it is supposed to be a hunting game, then your character must be able to look at tree bark to check for trails, you must be able to climb trees to be able to shoot the dinosaurs from above, little shelters close to watering holes. I honestly think the developers themselves never even went hunting once.9. As mentioned in section 2, dinosaurs have the capabilities to fly and travel through solid objects like rocks, but of course YOU dont. Your character cant even jump over small objects (since there is no such option), making climbing the volcano mountain in the middle of the map extremely tedious and it takes MUCH longer than what it would in real life (Also I think the developers never climbed a mountain in their lives either).10. The game (if you still want to call it that) is REALLY EXPENSIVE $29.99, with the same amount of money you can purchase much better games than this on Steam, since the developers aren't sure if they wanted to release a HUNTING game or a Survival game. So they took the worse out of both genres, added an insane price tag to it and sold it to the community. They ripped people off with theHunter, and now they're ripping people off with theHunter:PrimalI normally don't complain about bad purchases, but seriously DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THEIR MARKETING (as I was), rather spend your money on something else.****** DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ************ DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ************ DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ****** "

												The Hunter Primal. After reading dozens of reviews, and playing it for a few dozen hours myself I have come to some conclusions about the game. First off this is NOT a game for EVERYONE. Are you patient? This is arguably the most expensive tramping simulator out there... No kidding! There have been times when I've tramped for over an hour and not seen a Dino or anything of real interest except very beautiful scenery, but even that can get old. Or, you can load the game up and stumble across several T-Rex or half a dozen Raptors that tear you to shreds and cause you to lose all your gear that you've spent over ten hours collecting.A lot of people review the game negatively based upon the fact the game ""isn't finished"". The game is perfectly playable and enjoyable as it is, and is indeed ""finished"" it isn't however very ""polished"" and a few areas of the game could do with vast improvement, in fact a lot of areas could. If you need a slick, styled, polished game, this probably isn't for you. This game however is extremely immersive, and also very lonely. One of the great reasons for this game is the sense of abandonment, the aloneness, even with other players in the game. It's a harsh environment, there's big creatures out to kill and eat you, weapons are scarce and ammo is scarcer. It really does get the adrenaline going, which is a definite pro.Some say the game is easy, some say the game is hard. The game is both and neither. The difficulty is based on serveral variable factors, your skill at FPS, your gear (guns, ammo level, camo), your environment (jungle, plains, hills etc..), and the ammount and type of dinos around at the time. Sometimes it's near impossible to even stay alive, other times you're tramping around shooting things without a worry or care in the world. This is enjoyable as at times you can relax at times you need to focus more.All in all I enjoy this game very much, I wish there were more types of dinosaurs, and some parts were more polished but I very happily recommend it to people who fit the criteria above. Load up! Lets go hunting!			"

Full Review:Now that I have at least an hour under my belt, my initial impressions are as follows:Pros:1) Superb Sound design and stage. The forests and wildlife sound authentic, and the dinosaurs don't use recycled soundbytes from other games/movies.2) Graphical fidelity is great, but it's nothing to write home about. 3) The difficulty is refreshing and adds a feeling of helplessness as you're pursued by otherworldy creatures.4) Based on the developer's track record, this game won't be abandonded. I'm looking at you, The Stomping Land.Cons:1) It's immediately clear that this isn't a finished product and requires more content. In most instances the game will spawn you next to one of the three available dinosaurs, which loses its charm after being mauled several times.2) I haven't been able to host or join multiplayer sessions. This will most likely be patched within the coming days before Christmas.3) Key-Binding seems to be a bit unorthodox. I found myself rebinding most of the default keys to more comfortable orientations to suit my casual play-style. 4) Odd instances of AI-behavior and glitches. Despite being well-hidden, dinosaurs are inclined to walk directly towards you and into your line of sight; I also died in a pond reaching only my thighs.5) The Island is very large, but it still lacks a great deal of polish. More folliage and natural landscaping would do wonders for this game.Final thoughts: If you're thinking of picking up this game, wait until more content is introduced. Ultimately, I picked this up as a future investment, and because I just love me some dinah-saours. Consider this a future recommendation.			"

												Me and this guy were walking around and saw a T-Rex, so we went prone. The giant god damn reptile walked right over us while we were laying there ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ our pants. When we thought we were safe, we slowly crawled away. After a few seconds passed, I heard a screen shaking, eardrum popping, massive sounding roar as I turned around to see my friend get devoured by a reptillian Satan. The beast then looked to me. We locked eyes for a moment, and a sense of understanding moved through me. It was then that the beast moved unto me, roared in my face, and ate me.10/10, would die again. But now for an actual review. After puting an extensive amount of time playing the game, I feel that I am ready to give a completely honest and full fledged review. This game, at its core, is very hit or miss. Some people will love it, while others will instantly denounce it for being too hard or a cash grab. While I believe the game is well worth the money, don't take my word for it. I will attempt to give the pros and cons of the game in a completely unbiased fashion, so that you may form your own opinion about the game before you buy it.PROS: 1. World and Atmosphere. This game couples amazing sound design with stunning visuals creates an amazing immersive world. You can hear T-Rexes stomping around from miles away, and spot Quezalcoatluses flying in the sky before they have a chance to see you. While this does add to the immersion, it also rewards attentive players who can see a threat before it even knows they exist.2. Weapons and Damage Models. The weapons of Primal are very grounded in reality. All weapons match to their respective ammunition types and every weapon looks, sounds, and feels like an actual weapon. Firearms are loud, bows have believable ballistics, and everything feels very solid. Coming from someone who is very experienced with firearms, I can attest to the realism of this game's weapons. Also, being based on a realistic hunting game, Primal's damage models are very precise. Heart shots are king, while general body/gut shots will not instantly drop most of Primal's beasts. Overall, the guns are good.3. The Actual Gameplay. Primal's gameplay is very intense, You can go from walking through a peaceful field to being chased by Utahraptors in mere seconds. This isn't a casual game. Deaths are punishing while kills are immensly rewarding. Even with high level gear, carelessness is often punished with death. CONS:1. Bugs. While the games stability has been immensely improved, the game still has lots of bugs. It wil crash every so often, and movement is very finicky. Also, the only servers are hosted through other player's internet connections, resulting in high pings and short lived servers. 2. Developement. Until recently, this game had been declared dead by most. The developers of this game are very invested in other projects and seem to view Primal of a sort of hobby on the side. On the up side, they have issued a survey for players to take and have also decided to try and tackle some of the bugs. Even though the game has officially released, they still intend on giving it regular updates.CONSENSUS: Primal is a great concept, but it is still in the making. While basic gameplay is good, there are still things that need to be ironed out and content that should be added in. While I understand some negative reviews, I believe that many of them portray this game in a bad light. Many people simply expect things from the game that it simply cannot offer. There isn't crafting or base building (as of yet) because the game is developed and marketed as a dinosaur hunting game. But, in the end, it is for you to decide. If you enjoy challenging or intense games, this is for you. If you're looking for another Primal Carnage of Orion: Prelude, then you will be dissapointed.			"

												Sorry to say, I'm very dissapointed with this game. I went in with high expectations, i mean after all, a survival game with Dinos? that sounds amazing! sad to say it was not. Mainly, there isn't enough content. I can't believe they would call this finished. There are none of your typical survival game aspects in here at all. No base building, trap building, crafting, hunger, nothing. You spend the whole game wandering this GIANT map, (which wouldnt be such an issue if you didnt walk slower than a crippled grandmother), trying to find supply boxes (which mind you, are NO WHERE near eachother) in order to defend yourself against near impossible to kill dinosaurs. Then, hopefully, if you manage to stay alive long enough, you can freely track and hunt the dinosaurs. Thats it. seriously, thats all. Not to mention there are only a grand total of 5 dinosaurs in the game. all of which are carnivores. (minus the Triceratops) and if you get spoted by a Utahraptor, you are pretty much screwed. you have limited defense, and you can't run very far or fast. Its irritating.The enviroment could use some cleaning up aswell. As much as they are beautiful, and perfect for screenshots and such, they aren't very functional for gameplay. most of the map has very steep hills, making it seem like the player shouldn't be there. Its very rocky, making it difficult to manuver. Most of the terrain is uneven, water clips through the beaches at places it shouldnt, the water randomly gets deep in some spots and seeing as you can't swim, also makes it hard to move across some beaches, and rivers/streams. Not to mention you can't jump. You also cant carry very much, which becomes problematic, if you cant store your ammo anywhere. Especially when you usually spend mostof the game with far more ammo than weapons. (and more ammo for weapons you dont have)Honestly, I'm very dissapointed. The idea for this game was great, but it's far from finished and is lacking severly in content. ESPECIALLY when they want $30 for it. dont waste the money.			"

								Edit to precurser review: I would now recommend this game to anyone looking. While it is not all together in its current state, I have been in contact with the developers and they do have plans to continually update it with what the community wants. By purchasing this game, you show them that there is a market for it, and encourage them to better the game. Here is a video to show some gameplay mechanics.... Don't judge too hard, this was only my 3rd time playing

			Hunt - Explore - Survive The most realistic prehistoric survival game ever created. Featuring a huge Jurassic environment populated by horrifying all-stars such as T-Rex, Triceratops, Utahraptor.		

Edit: Some more footage with the shotgun. Protip.... dont engage a T-Rex by yourself unless you have ungodly amounts of high powered ammo.


YouTube™ Video: theHunter: Primal Gameplay - T-Rex Hunt 

			Views: 254		

			Skip to 11:42 for action The Hunter becomes the Hunted - Part 1 - I found a shotgun and some slugs so I decided to go after the biggest beast in the game. It did not go so well as you will see.		

Pros: -Awesome sounds-Visually Stunning-Massive map-Stealth SystemCons-some of the weapons are underpowered (will explain later)-I have yet to kill a T-Rex. (May be a pro to some, but i put 8 slugs in ones heart/lung/brain.... plus 10 arrows in the lung region.... it should have died)-To many dinosaurs (wouldnt be a problem if you could actually kill them)-You move to slowly, and the stamina bar that allows you to run is depleted WAY to quickly, and recharges WAY to slowly. (seriously devs, go for a run, an average in-shape human can run alot farther than you imagine, and recover rather quickly)-Only 3 dinos (Im sure they plan on adding moreEdit: After playing this game for  nearly 6 hours now, I wanted to redo this review. I still find some of the weapons to be underpowered coming from a real life point of view. Both the slug shotgun, and magnum handgun should be much more powerful than they are, but they provide a fun challenge. The hitboxes on the dinosuars are still a bit off IMO, however once you get the learning curve, you can get it with a bit of luck. It is pretty fun to explore the island and try to hunt or avoid being seen. The graphics are beautiful, and ive found myself stopping several times to enjoy the view. If this game continues to be updated, it will be great by the time it reaches full rollout!Note for the devs:I found a few bugs so far I wanted to report-Tab doesnt always pull up pda-Rebalance gun damage-As long as a dino is behind you, it cannot hurt you-when you create a new game it is not truely new, it also doesnt spawn you with anything half the time-When you leave the game and come back, sometimes your secondary weapon is gone.As the game progresses and updates are made I will change my rating and review, I will also have gameplay video up shortly that I will link.Thanks for reading!Edit 12/16/14: The developer contacted me confirming they had recieved my feedback and would be implementing several parts.I will be changing my recommendation to a thumbs up once the first update is out. As long as the devs will listen to the community and continue to put out updates, I will reccomend it. As I continue to play it, I enjoy it more and more. Of it still isnt fully there, but it is an enjoyable time waster. As of now there really is no objective, Im hoping some objective will be added later. Also another thing that I have found to be annoying is the fact that you cant stack  items. If you find a pile of 2 arrows, and one of 3 you cannot combine them. Once again im sure this will be fixed later.			"

												It's really getting worse.I palyed this game when it was in Early Access, it seemed like the developers heard to the community. The game was really unfinished and needed a huge amount of work.To be honest, it still needs a huge amount of work. I don't know why they released it in this early state. The dinosaurs need more ""life"", more authtical behaviour in their habits.The flying dinosaurs need to be removed and redone. This ruined the balancing.Really developers, get it back to Early Access and do your homework, the community is/was still trying to help you. Listen to them and discuss with them.			"

												As many of you have noticed in the reviews on March 31, this game is finnaly out of its (quote)EARLY ACCESS(qoute) and I must say that it is terrabey unbalanced. To call this game a full release is a joke, they only added 2 dinosaurs in the short months when it was announced. One is just a shrunken verison of a dinosaur already in game and the other was an untested flying pterodactyl that is near impossable to defend yourself against. And I know its called something else but I'm usying the more well know name because I can't even pronounce its name in-game.For new players it sucks because when you first load up the game you cannot buy anything since you have no money, your level 0 and the only thing your pod gives you to defend yourself is a machete that honestly is as usefull as a wiffle bat.It really hurts me to give this game a thumbs down because I love dinosaurs but I cannot defend this title because of the asinine choices that where made preemptively during this game's development.P.S. The .50 cal is garbage			"

Posted: April 11, 2015
												Before we start, I want to be clear: You're enjoyment (and the relevance of this review) depends entirely on what you're expecting from TheHunter: Primal. If you are expecting a slow-burn, high tension survival title in an alien world of dinosaurs, you may garner a lot of enjoyment from this game.If you are expecting a immersive, realistic hunting simulator where you pursue and down the greatest creatures to ever walk the land, you will probably be disappointed.First, the positive: the game is beautiful. The textures are crisp. The dinosaurs are quite colourful and varied looking, yet still manage to blend in enough to require careful spotting. The plantlife is dense and oppressive. The weather is startling to see for the first time. The world is huge and packed with dense forests, open plains, beaches and swampland.The dinosaur damage model is highly detailed, with careful shot placement required to ensure that Utahraptor goes down in one shot, or at least bleeds out before it runs too far to track the body.The sound design is also well thought out, as careful listening is needed to pick up approaching predators and tell their mood.What are the major problems with this game? The largest (in my opinion) is the stamina and running mechanics. I mentioned this game is huge. It truly is, yet you walk with the speed and haste of a high-class Victorian lady visiting the Botanic Gardens on Sunday afternoon. The stamina bar is woefully low and is depleted in 10-15 seconds of running (the running too is far slower than any person with full use of their legs would manage when being pursued by hungry dinos). It refills much slower than it is consumed. I can understand wanting to discourage endless running over kilometres without breaking a sweat, but for the self-proclaimed ""most realistic prehistoric survival game ever created"", this is extremely tiresome, not to mention immersion breaking. It also makes no sense from a standpoint of offering a challenge to players: most everything can outrun you if it makes a beeline for you, and running already makes extra noise, so why bother adding ANOTHER impediment to your escape? It would have made more sense to add a general ""exhaustion"" meter that slowly increases the more you run, that slows machete swings and makes aiming more difficult as it fills.It also makes tracking wounded dinos a pain, as they will run far from your position in the time it takes them to bleed out. The choice of stamina bar clashes harshly with the wide open spaces and fast dinos around you, especially considering you are meant to be a fit, strong colonist capable of crafting machetes and bows from scrap.This brings me to the second major complaint: the predatory dinosaurs. The predators on this island are incredibly numerous, and VERY dangerous. This may sound exactly like a predatory dinosaur should be, but let me ellaborate. These creatures are determined to catch you. VERY determined. Too determined. T-rexs will more often than not just *happen* to wander in a straight line towards you, and once there refuse to leave until you move from hiding. Once again this would not be a problem if it were not for other choices made in development, such as the inability to run for any real length of time, and the limited weaponry or distractions. Just to reiterate, this helps makes the game stressful and tense, effective for survival gamers, but infuriating for hunting enthusiasts who simply want to grab a rifle and track down a triceratops.Other complaints involve the lack of swimming mechanics to allow lake crossings, or even crossing 10ft wide bays at the beach, the dinosaurs' stilted attack animations (that do fortunately make the machete a viable weapon against solitary raptors), and the absurdly high populations of predators. Arrows are also extremely difficult to track in flight, and hence getting a grip on the shooting mechanics is primarily trial and error (since you can't retrieve arrows from the ground you're discouraged from practicing shooting trees and stones). The predators themselves are too... predatory. Why is it the T-rex's will always go out of their way to catch a bite sized meal like me when a raptor just walked by them. Why can't they ever just not be hungry you know... LIKE REAL ANIMALS. In fact, other than apparently clearing out when a T-rex wanders their way, the other dinos don't come into ANY conflict with each other, limiting your strategies to deal with them.If the developers DID intend this to be a survival game primarily, then I'm baffled by the lack of food requirements (other than health regenerating eggs and mushrooms), proper shelter (other then some bare concrete walls to hide behind) or other survival staples. The only goals really are to go from landmark to landmark across open ground, avoid the overly numerous Tyrannosaurs, gather some ammo and hunt something for points, before lettting yourself die so you can use those points to buy a better weapon. Survival in this game is too often down to dumb luck. HOPEFULLY a T-rex won't march right up to you just as you got a .44 magnum with no bullets. HOPEFULLY a Quetzacoatls won't grab you as you're lining up a shot on a raptor and drop you 70ft to you're death. HOPEFULLY those raptors won't wander on top of your hiding spot.If what you were expecting was The Hunter with dinosaurs, where you choose from a variety of weapons a gadgets to track down elusive and deadly creatures in their natural habitat, then you'll probably be disappointed. I appreciate that Expansive Worlds wanted something different for this game. And there is still time to make a strong impression in future updates. But I feel that if they had simply ported the weapons and hunting mechanics from the Hunter, and made this current game mode optional, they would have made a stronger first impression.Too sum up: Buy if you want to crawl past huge predators, sneak around raptor packs and quietly through herds of triceratops with hair trigger tempers.Don't buy if you're looking for a hardcore hunting simulator where you can bring you're favourite mauser rifle to bag a velociraptor at 150m.To each their own I suppose.

												Update 4/11/2015:They did a MAJOR overhaul on the Quetzalcoatlus and it made the game A LOT more bearable. Quetzalcoatlus aren't EVERYWHERE now (they only spawn near Volcano's and really high lands). This alone made the game so much better. Now you can actually EXPLORE the land without definite insta-death.However, every other issue I've stated is still a thing.1) You rarely see dinosaurs in a game about dinosaurs.2) You travel for LOOOOONG lengths of time (up to 50mins) with absolutely nothing happening.3) Killing dinosaurs is nigh impossible at the start of the game (i.e. Levels 1 through 5-ish)4) If you haven't racked up a few kills for exp and money then good luck killing anything after an hour.Once you get to higher levels (9+) the game becomes a lot more tolerable; but from a gamer point of view: Why would I want to keep playing a game if the start of it is dreadful, boring, and hard (in the sense that you can't really kill anything)? I mean, yes, the survival aspect becomes fun once you're higher level; but with that promise, why would a person new to the game stick around long enough to sift through the bane of this game? I know I called the game ""Garbage"" in my original review; but it's not. What it is, is unbearable (at first). And you'll have to put up with that unbearable irritation for a long time because levels aren't easy to gain (since dinos are rare to come across). Once you get past that, however, you could potentially start to enjoy yourself.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Original Review: This game is a COMPLETE waste of money! Hear me out, because I keep coming back to this game, TRYING to like it, but it's terrible. And here's why:-There's NOTHING to do:You spend, I kid you not, 90%+ of this game walking around with absolutely NOTHING eventful happening. NOTHING in this world can really be interacted with except for loot crates and dinos. Your objective for most of the game, survuve. How are you gonna survive? Find camp points that have survival equipment (weapons, camo-clothing, healing supplies, etc). But the map is HUGE and that becomes obvious when you're walking with your GPS for 20 minutes and you've literally only traveled a distance about the size of 1/3 your pinky finger. None of these camps are anywhere NEAR close to each other, either; so if you're at a camp and you try to travel to the next closest one, be prepared to walk in a straight line for about 50 minutes, with NOTHING happening.-It's nearly impossible to kill dinosaurs in a game about KILLING DINOSAURS:Game Story - ""You're a convict sent to a dino planet to kill as many dinos as possible to pave the future for potential civilizations."" Early game, you MAY get lucky enough to find small Raptors. You can kill those with the machete that you get for free when you spawn, and that's where you get experience and money to buy things when you die and have to respawn anew. However, the dinosaurs age within game, and after 30 minutes they're fully grown (your gps tells you the age). Cool mechanic, BUT YOU CAN'T KILL THEM BY THAT POINT! Fighting baby Raptors is likely to yield success, BUT your health is gonna be dried up by that point, so you're going to eventually die. HOWEVER, the timer for the dinos doesn't reset! So now you have ADULT raptors, which you can't kill because as soon as you get close to killing them, they run away; and there is NO catching up to them. You can run, but your stamia is a handicap BEYOND BELIEF! You can track them with your GPS (via blood trail, foot tracks, dung, etc) but you'll be tracking for at least 20 minutes before you catch up to it. The dinos can bleed out and eventually die once you hit them; cool mechanic, HOWEVER, the time for that varies and the odds are, you WONT find the dino that you wounded; but if you do it'll be like I said before, ""Tracking them for 20 minutes before you finally catch up"". Mind you, this is just the case for the raptors, THE EASIEST THING TO KILL IN THE GAME!-Quetzalcoatlus... Quetzalcoatlus...If you can tolerate walking around doing nothing for 90% of the game, and don't mind the fact that after 30 minutes, you wont be able to kill dinosaurs anymore, then I present to you, the one dinosaur, that ruins this entire game. Quetzalcoatlus. This flying dinosaur is the ONE major flaw that was put into this boring, uneventful, over priced, waste of time game! Quetzalcoatlus flys down, picks you up, and carries you around for 10 (Mississippi) seconds. Then he drops you and you die... No questions about it. You WILL die when it drops you. I've survived drops twice (I don't know how) but then it circles around to finish the job... Quetzalcoatlus is the primary reason this game is absolute garbage. You think walking for 50 minutes to reach a camp and get its spoils finally pays off. Nope. Quetzalcoatlus are ALWAYS around these camps. You can go in and get the stuff, yeah, but Quetzalcoatlus WILL catch you while you try to leave, and it WILL kill you. When you die your body becomes a pack of bones that you can come back and loot for your old equipment; but of course Quetzalcoatlus will STILL be in the area; in fact, MORE Quetzalcoatlus will be in the area! Because it seems like every time you die to one, another one spawns in the area! Quetzalcoatlus are only a threat in open areas? Oh ok, so my options in this game are 1) Be safe from them while I walk around the forest areas where's there are no camps to get equipment, little hope of actually seeing a dinosaur, and just endless walking around with absolutely nothing else to do. or 2) Walk out to a camp in hopes of finding things to survive and die to Quetzalcoatlus, walk out into the open in hopes of exploring this huge world and die to Quetzalcoatlus, or try to walk from this forest to another forest and die to Quetzalcoatlus.-There are very few dinosaur sightings in a game about DINOSAURS!It's so rare to actually see a dinosaur in this horrible game. You'll find tracks and other signs of them in your area, but they're constantly moving, and they're faster than you and don't have STAMINA ISSUES! You will NOT see dinosaurs often. So you will not kill dinosaurs often. So you will not gain money or experience to buy things that will help you kill dinosaurs... which are rare to find in a game ABOUT dinosaurs! There is one dinosaur that you can easily find though. Quetzalcoatlus! Just look up into the sky and there he is! Walk out of the boring tree's and die! Or stay in the boring uneventful tree's and NOT die! GREAT GAME!			"

								Honest and non-misleading gameplay:


YouTube™ Video: theHunter: Primal - Starting Off! - Pt.1 

			Views: 3,000		

			Welcome to theHunter: Primal, a dinosaur hunting game, here we are introduced to the game, and test out our beginner skills.		

Comparing this to The Stomping Land and Beasts of Prey, this game easily beats both. When you enter this game you can instantly see a lot of work was put into it, with the huge highly detailed island, with the dinosaur models with textures done so well and the very nice ground vegetation which give the game such a great sense of realism. As a hunting game, the AI needs a lot of work, they are not buggy but rather dumb, like zombies in DayZ, and if they spot you they are close to impossible to kill, which in some cases can become frustrating. The mobile tracker device works perfectly, but I feel as if the original game deserves that credit.As a survival game I get a nice immersed horrified feeling, the aspects of this game can really come off quite scary, as the forest tried so hard to do.So far I can say that it is worth the money, the game shows hard work by the developers, and I have hope they can maintain creating a more realistic primal hunting game.

								As an expert in the field of paleontology I have a vast knowledge of dinosaurs, in particular the velociraptor; so therefore, I feel that I am in a strong position to express my thoughts on the hunting grounds of Primal Eden.I arrived on this planet having agreed to fly over it for a small fee as a tour guide (of some sort). At no point did I believe that these people were remotely crazy enough to land the plane. I woke up on an abandoned runway having been knocked out via a blow to the head. The distant sound of a man and woman shouting at the top of their voices filled my entire body with dread and fear as I came around. I knew this was now a fight for survival!As I moved swiftly and quietly through the thick, dense and foggy bush I hoped that I would find signs of life such as camps left over by previous people who dared venture to this ludicrous planet. Perhaps I could find some sort of radio or telephone that I could use to call for help. By now the valley around me filled with the unnerving sounds of various carnivores. The roars piercing my heart and sending tremors straight through my spine. There was no hope.As I laid helplessly in a thick set plant I felt the horrifying thud as the ground started to shake. I then realised it was the same terror I had experienced some years ago in Jurassic Park. The thunderous sound began to get louder and louder. I then ran as fast as my legs would allow over the valley hill and found an abandoned camp called Sir Arthur’s Folley. To my delight and amazement I found a .700 rifle and 2 bullets. I do not like guns but I intended to survive this island as I have done twice previously. As I loaded the bullets the tyrannosaurus rex came crashing through the trees behind me…...I knew what had to be done.I tried to throw a stone to distract the foul beast but to no avail. His head raised into the air as he then let of a rambunctious growl before charging at me. I immediately ran behind one the compounds concrete walls in fear of what was about to happen, with adrenaline pumping around my body I looked around the wall at the oncoming charge. I raised my rifle and shot the creature in the head! Nothing happened... I then ran back behind the wall where I realised my health was low from when I dropped down the small cliff into the camp. I sprayed myself with magic spray that made me feel revitalised and full of energy. The mighty head of the beast then clipped straight through the corner of the wall scaring the s**t out of me. “How the f**k can you do that” I angrily yelled at the beast. It then stood still so I took my shot, BANG, I hit the animal in the upper chest just below the neck. He let of an almighty howl as I punctured the left lung. As I aimed down the sight for one last time I pulled the trigger….nothing happened. I had no ammo.I then thought LEG IT, so I ran down the hill until my stamina had deserted me. I laid down in a bush hoping the foul creature had not seen me. My heart was thumping and sweat was pouring from my entire body. The footsteps crashed down the hill behind me. I laid there motionless. The T Rex then stopped not knowing where I was. I had done it, I had got away from the beast when I then heard footsteps to my left. I looked to find a guy in a bright yellow shirt and orange trousers standing in my bush. I then slowly looked around at the T Rex as he then spotted me, charged me and then ate me. NOOOOOOOOO! The guy in yellow and orange clothes then proceeded to steal my gear and disappear into the night.Hmmm, maybe I get into character a little too much when I play this game….It is an epic game especially when played with other people. Getting ambushed by raptors or five people running from two T Rex’s is sooo much fun! Awesome game that you must try.			"

												I want to start by saying that this game has a lot of potential. (im sure you heard that many times but trust me, this game has a LOT of potential) The biggest problem with the game right now isnt the lack of weapons or dinosaurs, its not even the horrible AI, the biggest problem right now is the fact that its no longer in alpha. By fully releasing the game the devs are saying ""Yep, its done, no more updates."" now, im hoping that I'm wrong and that the developers will continue to update the game (add new dinos, guns ect...) You see at the moment the game is only fun to play with others, you simply hunt dinos together, you'll enjoy that for an hour or two but you will eventually realize thatA) there is no goal, you just hunt. (there isnt a survival aspect to the game, you can just stay in a zone where dinos don't spawn, there is no reason to leave these zones.)B) there are only five dinos, and two of them are basically the same one. (smaller and bigger variants)C) The game is buggy, and obviously is still in alpha (even though the devs say otherwise)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- You should only buy this game if the devs will keep updating it, if they'll keep adding new stuff, if they keep fixing the glitches. What you should do is watch the game, check the store page every now and then, if you see more (significant) updates then yes buy it. But at the moment it seems that its very likely that the devs will abandon this game.so....Q: SHOULD I BUY THE GAME???A: nope....not yet. "

Early Access Review
								First time me and my friend played, we didn't fully grasp how the game was to be so difficult, and being the naive little insubordinates that we were, we skimmed through guides and just ignored them altogether (Which I wholeheartedly recommend.) After stumbling across the woods to find eachother, bows in hand, we set off to what we thought would be our opening into Dinosaur hunting greatness, and how we were oh so wrong. We had found our first Raptor, and immediatly started plunging arrow after arrow into the flesh of the Jurassic Park reject. We were able to wound it slightly, and it ran off.

												I personally found this game fun initially.... however, I could not reccomend this game to anyone in it's current state.. last patch was 10 months after the last one (which basically added a few skins) and all it ""patched"" was 2 bugs.. There is miniscule to zero development in this game, whis is really sad, as this game had so much potential.. If you want to try it out, make sure you can get your money back... Steam... you should be able to offer partial refunds if there is awful dev support... perhaps this will stop developers teasing their cutomers with potentially interesting games, get customers to part with their money, then forget about it and reap the cash. You should also punish bad developers in some way.. in this case perhaps withdraw their titles from Steam until you are satisfied that YOUR customers are happy...			"

Product received for free
												I really like the concept of the game. I've had and played this game since pre-release. It had so much potential. In its current state it is playable, but there are a lot of little bugs that will annoy you over time and you'll reach end game rather quickly with nothing else to motivate you to continue playing. The company behind the game is the main issue I have with the game and not the game concept itself. They are just not putting enough effort into keeping the game fresh and bug free. It's a real shame to see a good idea go to waste, but the company has a real bad track record for neglecting their other titles in similar fashions as they have with this one and being only motivated by money sadly. Now that they have people's money I don't honestly expect anything new (and not just some reskin or rehash) added to the game unless it costs extra and the only bug fixes I'd expect to ever see are ones that are gamebreaking but the little fine tuning ones like the multiplayer bugs will most likely never get fixed. I gave the game and the company a huge amount of time to prove me wrong, but sadly they haven't so now I don't have much hope that this game will ever reach its top potential. I have to vote negative on the game and not recommend it to others unless you're getting it free or as a gift. Just don't waste your money. It's pretty much a game that you'll play through completely once and never touch again as the replayability factor just isn't there. All I can hope for is at some point the company cleans up its act and comes back and actually cares about this game enough to take advantage of its full potential. If that ever does occur I will gladly change my review, but I'm not holding my breath at this point.			"

												edit: What you all have to realize is this is not this developers main project. Updates will be sparse at times. ""10/10 like Dark Souls with Dinosaurs""- IGNWelcome to Primal Eden, where your♥♥♥♥♥♥gets shoved in faster than you can say ""The hell just made that noise?"".I've played theHunter since 2011, and knowing the Devs, and how they are, when I first saw this I thought it was a joke.I was really excited to see that it wasn't, and even more excited to see it was coming out not long after I read about it.It's pretty hard to get the hang of at first but you will get it eventually, before it got updated to you starting with 10 arrows, and it was 5, after figuring out the general anatomy of the raptors I could take down usually 3 before I ran out. I recommend playing with a group, as it helps tremendously. I have to say I'm not a fan of unreasonably hard games, this pushed it at first, but I just kinda pushed through it, and now enjoy how difficult it is. After killing 3 Rex's 2 Triceratops, and about 200 raptors, I can only see this better as time goes on.Now if you guys are weary of early access because of Dev's ditching projects, that is DEFINETLY not going to happen with this, The guys that work on theHunter are some of the best Dev's out there with communicating and listening to the community, theHunter came out in 2008 and is being continuously developed with most of the ideas coming from the community itself, as I'm sure will happen with this too. They only add new animals every few months or so to the original because it's a pretty niche market and not a whole lot of money comes in, which is also why they have the micro-transaction system the way it is. However, this game is getting a tremendous amount of attention from famous Youtuber's and being the fact that it's survival which is the ""in"" genre, I HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend this game, as once you get passed the steep learning curve, it'll become one of the best games you've played in awhile. And like I previously stated, It's only going to get better from here.Now if you'll excuse me, this .700 isn't going to kill Prehistoric-Alien creatures itself.			"

												There's something wrong when the fun goes out when you just try to scavenge ammo instead of just hunting dinosaurs, I feel though the survival & pvp aspect doesn't fit in this sort of game. D:Dinosaurs look fine, AI sucks and ultimately lack of immersion. When you play for a few hours you start to think, what's my actual goal here.So in short, it was a mistake for me to buy this game. I can hardly recommend this game with this pricetag.			"

												I love this game, but I have to tell people to NOT BUY IT until the current problems are resolved. The game is ridden with bugs, many people have lost everything they worked so hard for. And despite us being paying customers, the devs don't give one crap about us. We've raised the issue here, on their Facebook page, and I'm sure elsewhere, and they are as silent as the grave.DO NOT BUY THE GAME WHILE THE DEVS ARE ACTING LIKE THIS. They don't deserve your money.			"

												(sigh...) Lets be clear about this: I loved this game, I still do. But I cannot recommend this to anyone at all just because it is extremely unfinished. When the Pre-alpha started in December I had really high hopes for this game. But I quickly realized that a really buggy pre-alpha really hurt the publicity of this game, so much that I feared that this game would be scrapped. It seems as if my fears have come true. As a $30 dollar game it is alright. The objective of the game is to survive long enough so that you can gear up and hunt dinosaurs. It follows the basic structure of thehunter in that the OBJECTIVE is hunting. This confused allot of people at the beginning, they thought it was a DayZ with dino's which it is not. With a large Island and a 5 species of dinosaurs you can have alot of fun. Running from Raptors, hunting Triceratops, and teaming up to kill T-Rexes is essentially what you will be doing. Most of this game revolves around teamwork to take down the biggest and baddest of dinosaurs. This is really what made this game stand out. It fostered a teambuilding enviroment without holding your hand. But as with most pre-alpha's it had its downsides.It started with only 3 types of dinosaurs (which grew to 5 types) which really wasn't that great. The weapons were lacking, the AI was terrible and it was all around a buggy game. Over the past 3 months the developers had been working really hard to polish up the pre-alpha and so it seemed as if everything was going just fine. Alas that was not the case...Currently the game still feels like its stuck in pre-alpha, there are still bugs, a low amount of content, AI STILL SUCKS, there are only a few weapons in game, and in general it is unfinished all around. This really sucks as it had alot of potential to ge a GREAT game but in its current iteration I WOULD GIVE IT A 5/10 AT BEST. Will I still play it, Yeah. But I would not advise you to buy it. Hopefully the devs will continue to produce more content and this jewel of a game can be saved. If they do fix it I will revisit this revew but for now, save your money and buy any of the other great indie games out there. It will be a much better use of your time and money.			"

												A game that showed a lot of promise during the Early Access days and had the potential to become one of the best, most immersive and most realistic hunting simulators, in the end failed horribly to deliver. What we have now is a game with minimal content, barely acceptable for a ""full release"", while ridden with so many bugs and glitches that they alone could easily ruin the experience for many. In the end, it somehow managed to become a game that was much better and a lot more fun to play during its Early Access days and as long as the developing team refuses to care, fix problems and add new content, even as DLC, I personally wish it could revert to that.Positive: + Large map, beautiful environment, realistic landscape + Good atmosphere, ambient sounds, day-night cycle and weather effects + The game gives a nice initial feeling and the first few times you get approached by a T-Rex can be pretty thrilling, but it gets old fast + Controls when trying to aim are clunky, but that actually adds to the realism + For a hunting simulator, I suppose it has a good variety of weaponsNegative: - The island may look beautiful at first, but once you've walked all over the map once, it all feels the same - Camouflage used to matter during Early Access, now it's irrelevant. Hiding prone and motionless under bushes saved your life more than often back then, now most of the time it makes no difference - Dinosaur AI, especially that of the T-Rex, has gotten worse and worse over the course of development. The T-Rex used to behave like a clueless animal when shot out of the blue, now it instantly locates your position and runs to you in a straight line, like a heat-seeking missile, stops and eats you without even wasting a second to look around for you. It doesn't get more unrealistic than that as in actuality, most of the time the animal wouldn't even be able to identify which direction it got wounded from - Only five species, two of which share the same model in different scales - All five species are aggressive, four of them being actual predators, the opposite of what you'd expect from a hunting session - On top of that, supplies and ammunition are so scarce that it feels a lot more like a survival game than a hunting game. Hence why I always called it ""theHunted: Primal"". The player is clearly the prey in this one - The dinosaurs never eat, drink, sleep or interact with each other, killing the realism - Hitboxes are and have always been a mess - Dinosaurs may still attack you through concrete walls and thick trees, one of the major glitches that was addressed countless times but was never fixed - Server issues and reports from players losing their entire inventories or never receiving the items purchased from the in-game after-death store are more frequent than one could imagineBorderline Ridiculous: ... You can carry about 18 bullets for the .50 sniper rifle when you are in your underwear, but you can only carry about 15-16 if you put on pants and a shirt. Even less if you put on sunglasses and a hat! ... The character runs out of stamina after sprinting for a few dozen meters, while the dinosaurs can sprint to the ends of eternity without pause ... The character also has some sort of mental deficiency, as he/she suddenly becomes unable to throw a rock while crouching on one knee ... Watching a T-Rex walking up an almost vertical hillside practically defies descriptionConclusion: Bugs, glitches and lack of content aside, it may be worth the purchase for its current price of €10 if you don't expect to be amazed, if you are curious and if you don't mind the expense and the indifference of the creators, as it will probably offer some good times, but let me remind you that the game cost €20 during Early Access. That alone says a lot.			"

												This game can be described as ""unfinished"" at best.The gameplay is clunky, the dinosaur AI is predictable, the game has numerous bugs and crashed a few times during my experience. There are only 4 different dinosaurs in this game, the worst one by far being the Quetzalcoatlus. Don't believe the patch notes, they're everywhere and will scoop you up and drop you to your death over and over until you rage quit. They pretty much patrol any open area or point of value, have a huge field of view and then camp your corpse after they kill you.Dont buy this game in it's current form. You were warned.....			"

												Me and my friend played the hell out of this during early acess, but when I tried the recent update the game felt unbalanced with the new dinosaur species, and since this is officially out of early acess I'm starting to get the uneasy felling that this will end up like The Stomping Land, untill the devs update this game with more polish and content I regrettably have to give this  thumbs down for now, I will change this once its updated more (if it gets more updates that is).This has so much potential to be one of the best (if not the greatest) dinosaur games ever made, I really hope this doesn't get abandoned.Edit: Well it seems my faith in this has Shriveled out of existance.Avalanche Studios/Expansive Worlds if you're reading this, ♥♥♥♥ you (every single one of you that worked on this) of aborting this Game out of Early Access like a 3-Month old Fetus from a 15-Year Old Girl and then deciding to go back to theHunter: Primal's Paywall-Infested ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sibling.If you weren't so corrupted by Money you could've made this Game one of the best Hunting Simulators ever (hell this could've been one of the best Dinosaur Games ever if you didn't surgically remove it out of Early Access), but no you decided its Paywall-Infected Piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥Predecessor would be more profitable than a fully priced Game with no Microtransactions or Paywalls.♥♥♥♥ you Avalanche Studios/Expansive Worlds, I hope your next Game flops so hard that you shut down from the Karma for Abandoning this and not giving it proper Updates anymore.Come at me.

												So I’ve noticed that this game has mixed reviews, most of the negative ones being written by people who have played it for a couple of hours and have been eaten alive, chewed up and spat back out only to be able to write  “this game sucks”. Well my fellow steamers, you are in luck! You’re about to get a summary from someone who’s played the game for 87 hours.I did write a ton about thehunter: Primal, but figured who will want to read a review the same size as The Wall the Nights Watch guard? So I’ve kindly summarised it.•	thehunter: Primal is an online hunting survival game. •	There are 5 different types of dinosaur, •	11 different weapons and many items. •	There is a shop where you can use in-game currency to buy weapons and items however you need to unlock them by levelling up. (It is not a P2W game)•	Everything wants to kill you. •	Hunting is similar to thehunter, you need to shoot the dinosaurs in the right place. But as the dinosaurs are usually trying to find you, you come across them more often.•	It is hard and challenging, but you get used to it once you've played for a few hours.•	There are no 24/7 servers and setting up your own can be difficult as you have to open ports.•	You can be a lone wolf or chose to band together with friends or you can try to make friends. However if playing the PVP mode, only team up with people you trust, as it’s a dog eat dog world out there.Pros•	It’s hard to play, but rewarding when you do well.•	Great game to play with friends.•	Very big map. •	PVP is fun.•	Levelling up system.•	In-game shop.•	Updated by devs.•	At moments you are terrified.•	Nice to hunt and be hunted. •	Day and Night.•	You get immersed in the world.•	Great dinosaur behaviour.Cons•	It’s hard to play, and annoying when you die a lot.•	PVP can be brutal.•	No 24/7 Severs and setting up your own can be a pain as you have to open ports.•	Render distance is similar to thehunter so dinosaurs/humans disappear when they get too far (however they have to be quite far to disappear.)•	Hit points on humans need to improve.•	Levelling up system needs something to show hunters how close they are to the next level.•	Transition from night to day needs to improve.If you like to be challenged then this is a good game for you, especially the PVP. Hunting dinosaurs is really exciting and something cool is always happening in the game. This is the kind of thing you will expect:You’ve been tracking a Triceratops you shot for the last 10 minutes, and you’re lead into a forest. Suddenly you hear raptors communicating with each other, then silence and a rush of footsteps. Screams from the U-Raptors fill your ears and you and your hunting party start manically firing at 5 U-Raptors ambushing you.Whilst PVPing you're making your way up the volcano with your hunting party and are hounded by the flying Quetzalcoatlus,  one of your party is caught by the Quetzalcoatlus and he’s flown into the sky and then dropped to his death. But the rest of you manage to make it to the base at the top. However a rival hunting party is already there and a fire fight ensues. Your team get mascaraed and you lose all your stuff.   Or you’re walking through the open plains and start hearing thud after thud and the ground begins to shake, you realise a T-Rex is coming for you and all you can do is run. But remember you have a high calibre weapon so try to take it on. You begin shooting at it and its getting closer and closer, just as it’s about to rip you to pieces you see an opening to its heart and shoot your .700, killing it instantly.   "

Early Access Review
								So, Primal. What can I say about Primal. Well in what other games are you forced to hide in a bush for half an hour with you buddy, whilst cowering from a T Rex? Honestly though, quite a good game, ill go over some pros and cons. Good: The atmospheric nature of the game is great; both the sounds and graphics are quite pretty. The core game play is actually pretty nailed down despite it being early access, you can shoot Dinosaurs and throw rocks and what ever, what more do you need?Despite there being little in game right now, it's actually quite fun grouping up with your buddies and treking through the jungle, surviving and all that jazz. Bad: The game lacks some content, I mean, we could do with some more guns, maybe some dynamic events. Base building would be great in this game. Then again, early access so what ever, no big deal. Run speed at the current gesture comes in two catagories: Faster than light or extremely slow. It would be nice to get a happy medium. The lobby/hosting needs some work. The Dinosaurs can be quite stupid sometimes, then again, they had small brains right?All in all, I reccomend this game, especially if you want to waste £15 and possibily have some fun doing it. I mean, its not the greatest game in the world, you'll find out how much patience you have and you will be in a bush for 80% of your game time, but even that being said, it's oddly addictive and way more fun with others.

												Updated April 1st Release:This is NOT a full release of a game.  It should be labeled as being in BETA at best.  Models and environment are top-notch.  Dino attacks still need some serious work.  Simple things like a drag-and-drop inventory aren't finished yet.  And most of all there's still no realistic interaction between the dinos, i.e. dinos preying on other dinos.  But its a lot better than it was.  It's getting there.  It has SO MUCH potential.This may be one of my all-time favorite games. But its not for everyone. It's like being a cop, I suspect. A midget cop in a barbarian cannibal universe. Armed with a big ♥♥♥♥ing gun. That you don't always have ammo for. So you hide in a trash can and watch them eat your friends and neighbors and wait for them to leave. So you can get the ammo left on their fly-blown corpses. So you can track those barbarian cannibals down and explode their livers. Then you take selfies with their dead bodies.Early Release Review:I will say up front that this is a hunting game.  You can spend a lot of time where nothing happens.  Ammo can be feast or famine, as it should be in a survival game.  The game pays off for those with patience and persistence.  You can sprint around so long as you hear nothing.  When you hear raptors, you have to slow down.  Move away.  ""Make like a hole in the water.""  Despite its myriad of disastrous alpha bugs and severe lack of content, I LOVE this game.  The environment is best I've ever seen.  There's a real feeling of terror when you hear a pack of raptors and have 2 shells left.  Or you're solo armed modestly with a Tyrannosaur  20m that has your scent.  Surviving encounters like this and the eventual vengeance exacted through patience and planning is exhilarating.  Teaming up and taking down a T-rex is fantastic fun. Beginning tips:  Weapons are at the settlements.  Download a basic map that shows the settlement locs and you'll have a gun in no time.  Ammo is found randomly in the wild.  Then find someone you can tag along with and work with them to get camo and ammo.  Once you've done this, the game really opens up for you.  Shoot for the heart/lungs/spine.  With the bow, don't wait for them to get right up on you.  Work for a clean LOS to the target and reveal yourself at > 10 meters so they come straight at you, exposing their chest for a killshot.			"

												I recommend this game, but with severe reservation. I have played this game a decent amount alone, with friends, and have made friends whilst playing it. The atmosphere is gorgeous, the dinosaurs terrifying at every point in the game no matter what items you have, and a game that works so incredibly well with teamwork. The issue: Development hit a extremely hard wall to the point it was ""released"" even when incomplete. This angered me that, with still so many issues and room for so much to be added, it was abandoned and left behind. From there I moved to ARK Survival Evolved and havent regretted it, looking back on theHunter: Primal with some friends, I regret that development stopped.Honestly this was one of my favorite games to ever come out on account of how terrifying and realistic it can become when trying to survive. They say it is a hunting game, but they fail to hint you that you are the one being hunted.So should you buy this game? Depends. Are you okay with a noncomplete game that has development seemingly halted at the moment? If so, and you love being terrified by the footsteps of T-Rex's and the screeches of raptors, then this game is for you. I'd give it a 10/10 for memories and content, but a 6/10 for developer involvement.			"

I really feel like I was scammed, I don't see how they can even call this a game. It plays like a demo for a much better game, except I paid $25 for it and that's all there is. If this was still early access I might let it slide, but to call this a completed game is just a joke. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It's not worth more than $5.

								First of all this is by far one of if not the best survival game i played. And I have a lot of experience in survival gaming.You cannot compare it any of other genre-like titles (e.g. Dayz, Forest,..)It is focused on hunting, while you are equally hunted by carnivores and players.+ real-looking island/jungle+ intense and terrifying atmosphere+ good teamplay/PVP+ real-looking models+ outstanding sound design (!)+ exploring+ looting+ smart AI+ no need to eat/drink+ no crafting+ realistic hitzones - it is a hunting sim!+ very challenging - it is not meant to be easy!- some bugs- no dedicated servers yet- too less animal wildlife- too less gear at the moment- Island could be a bigger imo- needs more playermodels (customization)- maybe to harsh for new unexperienced huntersAll in all, it is early access, but it is already a great success for me. Finally I found the hunting game I was always dreaming of. You remember Carnivores? Go get The Hunter Primal, this one's for you!			"

												What the ♥♥♥♥ dude. Seriously. Fix that pterodactyl, or im sorry, quetzalcoatlus because you dicided to use the less ocurring and known version of the pterodactyl. They shouldnt be just flying around whilly nilly, in the same area for a long♥♥♥♥♥time, and constantly randomly seeing you, and fly down and pick your♥♥♥♥♥up and drop you. You should either remove the sob, or have a way to defend yourself from it. And secondly hit detection. ADD IT. i wanna hear when im hitting something, tree ground animal, excetera. im flinging around my useless machete, and seeing in text that im hitting him. COOL DUDE. And third, add a ♥♥♥♥ing jump option. Even if you think it wont neccesarily be needed often, just add it. Its rewarding in a game to just be able to ♥♥♥♥ing jump in place if you want too, or jump to get unstuck, or fiddle with a ledge. (thanks la noire for being a ♥♥♥♥♥ like that) And 4, single player is basically multiplayer by yourself. Fix that in a way. No im not sure how, but if you want to exit the game, ♥♥♥♥ing exit right away, no need to wait to ""exit"" when you relaunch the game it changes your spawn annyways for god sakes (which is also stupid) and 5th, ♥♥♥♥ YOURSELVES. Might not seem helpful, but do it. Did you even play your own game? Those simple things i said can be noticed withing the first 5seconds to five minutes.. And sixth, the GPS.. The pointer moving and not the map moving when you turn kind of messes up your bairings a bit, and is confusing sometimes. Fix that♥♥♥♥♥♥ Make the map move when you turn and not the pointer. Thank you sir.			"

												I really wish I could give this game a good review. It's a hunting game. With DINOSAURS. Who couldn't love that?Well, how about bugs? Do you love those? Because that should be this game's actual subtitle. TheHunter: Insects Flying Right at Your Face.The bugs are appalling and abundant. I'd say you lose one out of every five trophies to a bug these days. There's tons more bugs too - getting stuck in death state, server crashing when you come back alive to get your stuff, rexes sometimes don't come off aggro when you die and start running in a straight line towards where you respawned to kill you AGAIN (hilarious to watch when you're not being chased!), animals get stuck on terrain constantly, and half the time the game server is down so you can't play. People are also leaving after the last update, I've noticed. After almost a year of silence, the devs returned with the shortest patch notes known to mankind, and now the servers are down AGAIN thirteen days later. And the fixes they did implement? ""Bug fixes"" which no one has really noticed, and they fixed the system saving negative numbers (for cheat reasons.) Meanwhile, they just introduced a huge new map and several new animals on their pay-to-actually-play sister game.If you don't take your game seriously, your players won't either, so of COURSE they're gonna cheat! The game itself is poorly balanced between how much is in the game, how much ammo you need to bring down a dinosaur, and how much you can carry. You're not hunting dinosaurs, you're hunting ammo. Always. Hunting. For ammo.The dinosaurs themselves are actually pretty well-modeled and animated. I love the textures as well. The rex is legitimately terrifying when you see it and you're not prepared. Usually you can tell where they are because they're loud, but I've had several sneak up and eat me without a sound (bug?) which doesn't seem fair. The trikes provide a nice challenge. I'd really like to see some more dinosaurs though. Three predators, an herbivore, and a flyer isn't much. Why not some more herbivores, like a real ecosystem would work? The Queen is a rewarding challenge, though. Too bad even if you do 80% of the damage, the kill is still awarded to whoever fired the last shot, even if they're shooting a puny .44 or just a ramshackle bow and did 1% damage.Don't support devs abandoning their games. Don't support buggy, poorly balanced games. If you're dying for a good dinosaur game, this one at least runs better than Ark and is a more fun and rewarding challenge than The Isle, so for $10 you get what you pay for. It's cool for the first few hours, trying to level, trying to find weapons and ammo and you'll die a few times. You think it'll get more fun when you're a higher level, maybe, or they'll be some perks. Barely. Not anything you couldn't just find in a box elsewhere on the map.3/10 Still runs smoother than Ark. Most of my reviews include better alternatives to the games. In this case, an all-around better game is Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn. It has parasaurolophus, triceratops, ankylosaurus, stegosaurus, gallimimus, ceratosaurus, tyrannosaurus, pterosaurs, multiple maps at visibly different settings, you can jump right in and hunt, there's fewer bugs (but then again, a restaurant in Detroit has fewer bugs than this game) and the dinosaurs are MASSIVE, as they would actually be. It really does feel like hunting giants. This? This is a great idea done spectacularly, spectacularly poorly. If the devs would pay theHunter: Primal a quarter of the attention that the REAL moneymaker (see: the more expensive) game gets, there would be a tiny fraction of the bugs and there would be more positive reviews. I sincerely hope the developers bother to read these reviews, but based on their maintenance on the game, I very much doubt it. So this review is to you, the consumer. DON'T BUY THIS. Don't support the neglect of games. Don't support buggy games with no fix in sight. And don't support shoddy business practices, like putting out a game to grab money and then walking out, only to return sporadically once a year to say a couple words and leave again. They're game developers, not my dad - we have a higher standard of them than that, and your money is better than that.You should take your $10 and instead use it to go buy yourself lunch. More love went into your McDonald's meal than goes into this game.I bought this game when it first came out. For $20. They have since dropped the price. Gee, I wonder why.			"

												A lot of people have criticized this game for being slow-paced and having only a small selection of dinosaurs to hunt.  I think it's because a lot of folks purchased this game expecting it to be like Turok - a fast paced, blood-soaked, action-shooter.  But this game plays a lot more like an open-world Resident Evil/Don't Starve with dinosaurs.  This game is about tension, about patience, and about getting scared out of your pants.  The open-world is gorgeous, and unlike most open-world games, this one seems empty - just as a real wild area would feel.  This means when you find a dinosaur or, more likely, groups of them, the impact on you and your choices and gameplay is enormous.  And having only a few species in any one area is more ""realistic"" anyway, a small island can't support big populations.  Each dinosaur species requires completely unique strategies and tactics to take it down, and will hunt (or not hunt) you in completely different ways.  That's much more enriching than having 500 monsters who all just bum-rush you and just need a headshot to kill them.  Yawn.The first time you're staring at a treeline and see a pack of raptors melt out of the shadows and start stalking across the open plains, or are cresting a ridgeline and see, in the distance, a huge tyrannosaur wandering along the ridge toward you, silhouetted against the starlit sky, and you start praying to anyone who's listening that it goes the other way and never finds you. . . you'll be hooked, I promise.I won't lie, this game is *rough*. It definitely feels like an indie game, the controls can be a bit buggy, and the AI oscillates wildly from being unutterably brilliant to ""that raptor keeps running into that tree"".  But in terms of pure, emotional turmoil and painting a picture of constant tension and subtle, creeping terror I've simply never ever seen in a game before, Hunter Primal is worth a shot.  So, pick this up if you want a deep adrenaline rush.  Don't pick it up if you want Call of Duty with dinosaurs.  Simple as that.P.S. This game gives me nightmares about being hunted by dinosaurs.  That's how well it's crafted to get at your mammalian prey-instincts!			"

												I really like The Hunter: Primal, but I am disappointed about it's lack of content. I am hoping the developers would eventually develop as much variety as The Hunter has, many maps, many guns, many dinosaur types. It's rather limited at the moment on what it has to offer and as of now they have stated they aren't working on any major content releases.I am enjoying it, none the less. But I have a hard time 100% recommending anyone purchase it, considering it could quickly become a bit tedious and boring to some who have no interest in the PvP mode.I'm going to include the table I made for comparison with a similar game. Ultimately I recommend Primal for those looking for a more demanding experience, but only if you're the more patient type. There's a lot of walking around in between the action.If you've got a twitchy trigger finger and you just want to hunt a lot of dinosaurs without a lot of walking, Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn might be more your speed and a little easier on your wallet.  Category TH: Primal Carnivores: DHR   Weapons: More Realistic, Better Feel, More Variety (11 types), Limited Upgrades (May be able to attach a scope on some weapons) More Arcadey, Less Variety (4 types), More Upgrades (3-4 per weapon, though not visual)   Scenery: Very realistic, detailed, one very large map, very pretty More cartoony, detailed, several moderately sized maps, nice to look at   Dinosaurs: Very limited variety (5 species), mostly carnivores Larger variety, (9 species) carnivores and herbivores   Difficulty: Challenging Casual   Modes: Singleplayer and Multiplayer (PvE & PvP) Singleplayer Only   Price: $29.99 $14.99  "

												Great game with alot of potential but unfortuantely it was ruined by the devs who decided it was a great idea to give up on it. I spent a  lot of my time hyping for this game before it came out and was a little dissapointed with the amount of content it had when it released. But knowing expansive worlds I was almost sure they were going to add more content but i was sadly mistaken. Their last update to the game was 4 months ago and almost nothing has been said on their twitter. This game has been completely abandoned. SMH :(			"

												I don't like leaving negative reviews, but this time, I have to. I bought this game when it was still in Early Access because I really liked the concept of playing TheHunter with dinos. I stopped playing because the game was full of bugs and really boring. I've tried to play it again a few days ago, and it still is, even if they added new dinos and got rid of annoying things. They tried to make something between a hunting game and a survival game. I would have loved this. Problem is : It's neither. It's not a hunting game, because you have to spend a lot of time gathering ♥♥♥♥♥ons of weapons and ammo before being able to kill anything, especially if you have to track a wounded "" Big "" dino ( Triceratops or T-Rex ), because you'll probably be attacked while doing so and you have to be able to defend yourself. It's not a survival game because it has nothing of a survival except the "" Everything will try to kill you "" concept. You can't build a base, you can't craft items, you don't have to eat/drink/sleep...So, you just walk around for hours and hours, try to gather weapons and enough ammo and hope not to see a single dino before you have enough things to be able to defend yourself. It can take a lot of time, because weapons and ammo spawn randomly in boxes far from each other, and your character is f*cking slow ( Plus you can't really run because you don't want to alert dinos anyway ).This game has potential, but at this moment, it's just boring...

Early Access Review
								So far it is fun, difficult but fun. I actually waited up all morning/night to get this and right now it is obviously EA so not everything is in it. But so far it is rathe fun tracking, I love the feed back button in the game so right when you see or think of something to change or add, or a bug you can. It is not a normal hunting sim though, obviously the dinosaurs are rather tough, and super sneaky. And take more than one shot to kill, as of now from what guns I found. You must find your weapons/ammo/health. So it is like a hunting sim crossed with a survival sim in a game sense that is.			"

												I've logged MANY hours into this ""survival"" based hunting game, and I've come away feeling  a bit underwhelmed. I will say this about this game, it has HUGE potential, but sadly it's taken a back seat to it's cousin, ""The Hunter"". The amount of glitches and the stupid easy ability to hack this game makes it no fun at all, if you're one of the few people who play it as intended. If you aren't using glitched or hacked equipment, your odds of survival are very, very slim. The foundation is very good, and it pains me to see a potentially good game go to♥♥♥♥♥♥because the Devs are too focused on a 1 paticular product. Take a page out of Blizzards play book, and you'll see they run and focus on several products at once, without discriminating another one. With a few more dinosaurs, some crafting/building and some glitch/hack fixes, this game would rival ARK in popularity (in my opinion). For now, if you want dinosaur action, rent a movie =P .			"

I promise you that.This game got poor reviews but I did enjoy it as a survival experience.This game is fun but if you have ADD/ADHD or a short attention span then I suggest you play Killing Floor.

Posted: April 3, 2015
												Let me start by saying that theHunter: Primal has a lot of potential to be a great game.I'm a huge fan of the original ""theHunter"", and have been playing it for at least 5 years now. Still play it quite often to this day.I was always a fan of hunting games (Deer Hunter 2005, was amazing), and dinosaur games (Many hours were spent playing the Carnivores series of games, even the broken JP: Trespasser and Turok), so when I heard about theHunter:Primal, I was stoked to say the least.Before purchasing this game I had high hopes of it basically being a clone of the original game, replacing the local fauna from our time period with the prehistoric variety, while keeping the same solid, fun gameplay that has made theHunter so popular since it's release quite a few years ago.What I got feels like an extremely rushed, unfinished, buggy ""game"" that still feels like it's in an early alpha state.I can't stress this enough: THIS GAME DOES NOT FEEL FINISHED.The animations are for the most part awful. Don't get me wrong; when the dinosaurs aren't walking or anything they look very nice, and as realistic as anyone could expect from species that have been extinct for millions of years. But as soon as they start to walk/run, that's where the animations all go to hell. I've seen triceratops doing backflips trying to walk up hills, Dissappearing right infront of your eyes, and then magically reappearing a few hunded feet away.I've had Tyrannosaurs walk right up to me and stumble around me in circles before walking away, and when they get 100 feet or so away from me, suddenly realize I'm there, and then eat me (I was walking around while standing up this entire time).I've 1-hit-killed a Utah Raptor with a makeshift bow, while I was unable to drop a Triceratops by putting 6x 12guage slugs into it point blank, among others.Another problem I have with this ""game"" is where in the original, you would spot lots of animal tracks, etc. Making it fun to stalk whichever animal you were following. In Primal, any sort of tracks or sign seem to be very few, and far between. I've followed a Triceratops as it stomps through the river banks for about 20 minutes, all while not leaving a single track. How are you supposed to hunt in this ""hunting game"" if there are no tracks or sign to go by?Also, why did they feel the need to make this a survival style game, where you spend most of your time wandering around aimlessly trying to find a weapon powerful enough to even kill a raptor the size of a turkey?I'd be much happier if they went with the same hunting mechanic as the original where you pick your weapon loadout at the lodge before you head out.  I know they basically replaced the lodge with the drop ships, but the fact that you need to earn so many credits for even a basic weapon, makes this game ridiculously tedious, and hard to enjoy.You should start the game with at least a capable rifle, and then scavenge/buy more ammo as you need it. Sure, have the player able to find new weapons in crates still, but at least give them a capable weapon to start with so they can enjoy the game. I didn't buy a hunting game to ""survive"", I bought it so I could hunt dinosaurs. And if I were going to hunt dinosaurs in real life, you can be damn sure I'd be taking a rifle with me from the get-go.Another small issue that needs to be fixed is the weird ""wave-splashing"" effect, that seems to come out of the ground or in the middle of a lake. I think the water would look much better if that effect was just scrapped completely.The flora in this game also doesn't seem to be nearly as convincing as it is in the original theHunter game. I'm not sure what it is about it, but it just doesn't look as good as the original. I love the look of the forests in the original game. The jungles in Primal, not so much.Also, the sound is a big issue with me. In the original ""theHunter"", the sound has it's issues, sure (mainly just the fact that footsteps would sound like they're on top of you, even though they could be 100 yards away), but for the most part. ""theHunter"" sounds beautiful, the entire time you're playing.In Primal, the sounds in the forests/jungle aren't anywhere near as immersive, and it also suffers from the same ""close-sounding"" footsteps problem. Also, some of the sounds are just strange. I'm not sure if it's just Utah Raptors, or all (I think there's like five...) of the species, but there's always this strange ""dragging"" sound when one is close, and I have no idea what that sound is supposed to represent, but it just sounds awful, and not natural at all.I've also encountered quite a few areas where there is a beeping sound as if I'm close to a supply crate, but there is nothing to be found. So after searching the area for a while to see if there is a ""hidden"" crate, I just give up, and leave. This has happened in quite a few areas for me.Now, I don't want to sound like I'm completely bashing this game, because I really want it to succed. I just feel that there's no way they should have let it out of early access in the current state it's in, and they definitely shouldn't have called it a full release. It's not even in beta state in my opinion. They should have spent at least another 6-8 months on it, and ironed out the bugs at least, before releasing it. And that's not including all of the gameplay issues I have with this game.I wouldn't recommend buying this game yet, wait for them to (hopefully) release some major patches for it, to bring it closer to something that feels like an actual game, and not a tech demo. I'm glad they didn't go with the subscription price model like the original (Although I'm guessing that's the only thing that's kept the project alive for so long, otherwise they'd have no incentive to keep updating it), but I fear this ""game"" is going to become filled with microtransactions to bring it up to the caliber of hunting simulation it's predecessor is.

												This game... I don't even know where to begin, honestly. When this game first came out in beta, it was absolutely amazing. Sure, there were bugs and it felt slightly empty, but it showed promise and was a hunting simulator for DINOSAURS. Now when I say hunting simulator, I'm not talking about some new age Cabela's game where the whole goal is to track deer to a preset location for a monster buck with the same score in every disc and every playthrough. No, this game was unique. Everything was different, dinosaurs were rather rare and so it made the hunting aspect so much more enjoyable. For an early access game, i expected nothing less from the makers of TheHunter. Let's flash forward a bit now. The game was released fully with like three to four more primary additions from early access. That' it. Since then, there has been minimal contact from the developers, the bugs still persist, and anger and disappointment still exist in the community. This game was, from the start, only meant to be an extremely minor side project for the some of the developers at Avalanche. What said developers do not seem to grasp is that this game caters to a whole different demographic of people, which for some reason doesn't seem to interest the marketing department of this company at all. So, ultimately, it seems as though Avalanche only gives a damn about two game frachises: The original ""TheHunter"" and ""Just Cause"". Any others are pretty much trash, with the only attention it deserves is to pick it up off the floor. I am extremely disappointed in the state of this game and from what I can tell, its not going to get better. I will still play this game, (at least if a new patch comes out which reenables my ability to actually start it without freezing pre-title screen), but ultimately, its not worth the $10 to purchase. I regret having made my purchase in the past, but i have had fun on it with my friends.TL;DRDon't buy it unless it starts selling for like $5. The game isn't worth it.It's buggy, empty, and pitiful.So much wasted energy on a potentially amazing game from a company who doesn't give a damn about its fans unless they play ""TheHunter"" and pay a subscription.

Early Access Review
								I guess I'll write a few things about the game. TL:DR version at bottom, even that is long.First things first, this is an EA release which means its full of issues and is incomplete as far as content goes. Visually it looks very good, and the sounds are good though there are a few glitches, especially when standing near someone who is trigger happy, or about to be eaten.  The issues I have no doubt will be ironed out but their release target of early March 2015 is rapidly approaching.  And as far as content, if this game ends up getting the same kind of attention to updates and additions as theHunter has, then we will not be wanting for different critters to hunt, or varying types of gear.As far as the gameplay goes this is one of the most fun games I've played in quite a while, and doubly so when playing with friends. And you do need to play with some friends or at least make some and travel around in a group, as your suvival chances are very slim with no allies.  The only thing that becomes an issue when in a large group is ammunition, as there is usually a shortage for everyone, not like that is better for solo players however.The problem here lies in the loot tables, or rather the amount of loot/ammo whatever that shows up in each box. The boxes need to have at least double the ammo available if not more, and there really is no point in having a stack of 1 round that you cannot merge into other stacks, same with healing sprays.(Fixed! You can now stack ammo and stuff, GJ Devs!) Players shold be able to jump, and possibly climb low walls and rocks.And lastly, as with theHunter, there really needs to be dedicated servers for this game, as the host/client connection issues that plague theHunter are present in this game, with players timing out or crashing every few minutes, it can become frustrating just to play for a few hours.TL;DR versionPros- Amazingly fun with a group.Good visuals, some of the scenery is quite beautiful.Good sound, the sound of a T-Rex stomping near me makes my whole house shake with the sound turned up!Great potentialCons-Incredibly high learning curve.Exceptionally difficult almost futile to play solo, turning some gamers away, and others to hacking/exploits.Obvious glitches and bugs that would cripple a live release (I expect they will fix this by release)No Dedicated Servers, and with the crappy hosting/client system this will keep many players from fully experiencing the game.Tiny pool of creatures to hunt (Obvious that more will be added)Small pool of weapons (also expect this to change soon; WTF no .50 BMG? SRS GIEZ)No combining stacks of ammo or healing sprays? (Fixed stacking now works!)Very low loot tables, crates need at least double the ammo/healing loot if not more.No jumping, climbing or swimming, cause these trained dinosaur hunters haven't learned that, and they can't even run very far.Any idiot can hack the game, at the very least, hosts need to be able to ban players from their servers, as one bad experience can ruin the game for people.Takeaway: Great fun with a few friends and easily worth 20 bucks.

												If you don't like the hunter you probably wont like this game. That's just the way it is! Its not for the cod or bf2 fans. Its not run and gunning and running around without consequences. You have to play it like you are actually hunting or as close to that as you can get in a game. If you run you'll only spook the herbivores and call the predators. You have to place your shots. I see all these videos and almost 90% of the time they shoot for the head. You must go for those body shots, Like real hunting specifically the vitals besides dinos in this game have small brains and the chance of hitting them there is slim if at all. Hit em in the hart or the lungs and their gona go down if not immediately then within a few feet. Your the hunter and the hunted depending on the situation.Ive only been playing about 7 hours but I haven't died once yet, have no room left to carry anything and I have full camo because im careful and not in any rush. Ive never used the run meter once because you don't even need it if you play the way the game is intended. The metter is also for swinging handheld weapons so conserve it if you like to use it for running. The game is also very beautiful especially when everything is on high.With all this said, are there issues with the game? Of course. Is the game getting better? I think so and the immersion is really that good especially the thunder and lightening. Dinos do get stuck on cliffs, the t-rex has some issues and yes there is no swimming to name a few. Basically  I think that most of the complaints are from people who expect this game to be something it never was going to be. I also believe the games not the problem here its the people who play it, then complain that its not what THEY expected it to be.Like I said at the beginning of this review, If you like the hunter than you'll like the the hunter primal. If your looking for run and gun or a swimming simulator then go play something else because this isn't it nor will it ever be. Please also remember, when they say realistic that is also realative! My deffinition of what realistic is, of course is different than yours but as games go this one comes very close. If its not realistic enough for you then I suggest going outside and doing some real hunting!			"

Early Access Review
								I've been avoiding early access recently, too many games on there that feel like a 2nd year computer games students university project floated on steam to make some undergraduate a little extra beer money, too often left buggy and unfinished, all that promise, and my cash, gone.Fortunately then, for theHunter: Primal that isnt the case here, and the game is in development by a studio that I've known and come to trust for a number of years now, who are commited to working with their community, and have a good solid history of regular updates and not abandoning their projects.Since I picked up the game on release yesterday, I've already seen 3 updates to the game pushed out, just off the back of tweaks the team realised were necessary from the early initial reports, which to me is suggestive of a good team.Built with the same avalanche engine that powers the games ""older brother"", theHunter: Primal builds on the back of a good solid hunting simulator and adds dinosaurs and survival to the mix.  Armed with nothing more than a bow, a handful of arrows and the clothes on your back, it's up to you to seek out better equipment and to try and survive.  As it's early access, the types of dinosaur are limited at the moment, with plans to add further animals as the development moves on.  Sure there's some kinks to be worked out, and some balancing issues to make the game enjoyable for the widest audience, but it's fully playable and highly enjoyable now.My favorite ingame experience so far?It was midnight, it was dark, and a badly timed trip had left me at the bottom of an open valley with trees on the slopes to either side of me.  A kilometer up ahead, the grasslands gave way to rock, and open country on the side of the islands volcano, a safe haven for me, if I could reach it, where I could hide amongst the crags with a clear view and wait out the dawn.But that was a kilometer away.  Much closer, the heavy footfalls and roar of a T-Rex reminded me I needed to keep moving.  Somewhere nearby the strange, laughter like chittering of a raptor let me know I was not alone.  Was I hunter, or prey?Carefully I moved through the undergrowth, hoping to sneak away, every sound seeming amplified, and fear running her icy fingers down my spine.  My character brushed up against something toxic and coughed, the noise so unexpected, caused me to freak out and jump out of my chair, before logging out and then laughing at myself for it.  Would I recommend the game to others? Absolutely.  If you enjoy hunting, dinosaurs or survival style games, then it's definitely worth a look.  As a caveat, however, this thing is in early access.  Expect a few bugs, balance issues and for things to change, but if you can live with that, it's really worth it.			"

												I wish it had more then 5 dinos...but its never going to get more. Pros: World is massive.       - Sounds are fantastic, and scary. Gunfire sounds extremely well in this game. You can hear a fellow hunter over 800m away fire round after round as he is swarmed by raptors.  Raptors sound great and you can hear them close in on you.       -Terrain does what it should, the forest and different areas are very dense with foilage. So raptors can get real close to you without you seeing them. Stealth is a MAJOR part of gameplay.        -The community seems very friendly and willing to help you or talk with you. Almost every game ive joined ive left adding a friend on steam.  Hunting together is extremely fun and has saved my life a few times being in a larger group. In that same note, ive seen 2 t-rexs tear up a crowd of players in a valley i was attempting to join up with.      -The actual hunting can be really fun, as these dinosaurs can be tracked across the entire map, provided your skilled enough to keep their trail. It looks similiar to what i believe evolve is going to have for tracks. You can use dino calls, you scavenge for your gear like a dayz game, but your customizing and inventory is like an old school resident evil. Not much to it yet, there are scopes and different weapons but not many so far. 1 bow, 1 pistol, 2 rifles, 1 shotgun. different rounds for them liek the shotty has buck and slug.  The cons:     -DINO AI..(sometimes)......it needs patching but potential is there. A dinosaur can hear you, see you, and even track you. The raptors work in packs and can provide an issue because you do seem to get attacked by them from multpile directions. However, sometimes they charge past you, or walk right by you even tho your not hidden, they walk funny up hills, they sometimes aimlessly make wierd turns,The trex seems to have a few malfunctions aswell. Theres only 3 dinosaurs at the moment, with what i assume is ALOT more to come. SOmetimes dinosaurs stand there or get stuck and you can take them down easily. Other times, you get killed and never even saw it coming. Due to the small amount of species in the game thus far, their interactions from what i have seen are minimal. Smaller dinos run away from the big one. I would love to see the world become more alive in future updates. Maybe come over a hill and find a pack of raptors attacking a herd of herbavores or a single trex. I wish the raptors necks would turn to acknowldge you, the seem very rigid at times. other times its fine.ConclusionIts in alpha, and its already as solid as the carnivors games we had on pc in the early 2000s. Even with the bugs, that we all know alphas must go through, this game is a blast, and i do recommend it alsong as you dont get mad easily and can undertsand there will be problems as the game polishes out. I am having a blast though...I made this 1min 40 sec youtube video of the game just for fun,

The dinosaurs are buggy, there is no way to excape a t-rex, somehow he can see you from across the forest when you can crouched behind a huge rock. I bought this on the steam sale, and after playing it thought it was still in beta or something so i shouldn't be so mad.

												I have to say this game feels unfinished in many ways. From mechanics to physics to no swimming to Dino-AI. Seriosly, when have you ever heard someone gag like they are being waterboarded standing in knee deep water?? I also feel that a game like this should have game cotroller support and not require walking for miles just to reach the human players you are co-operating with. It's extremely frustrating and feels hostile to co-op gameplay.  I walked for miles to reach my team mates who were actually engaging dinosaurs, while I didn't see any of them. To be blunt, the spawning system sucks.It has potential but I feel like there are better man vs dinosaur games out there like Primal Carnage Extinction. Sure, I just got the game and played it for an hour but first impressions are not good. Especially considering it's a game from ""Just Cause"" developers Avalanche Studios.			"

								This is the most realistic prehistoric hunting game I've played. Makes the Carnivores series seem not so impressive. The island is huge, detailed, and beautiful. Great night/day transistions. Amazing dinosaurs. Hard, but very fun survival game. Can't wait until they release the full version.Pros:Amazing GraphicsBeautiful DinosaursMassive and detailed mapCons:A LOT of walking. Seriously, you can walk for over an hour to get to certain places.Meeting a T-Rex is basically a death sentance. Incredibly hard to get away once being spotted by an UtahraptorReasons to get this game:Get this is you like ultra realistic walking simulators Get this if like being reminded about just how bad you are at video gamesGet this to realise just how quickly you'd be eaten by dinos in real lifeAnd FINALLY, get this game if you like to be chased and eaten by Utahraptors in 5 seconds...Awesome Game.

It still has the chance to get back up and running, perhaps even get as big as TheHunter itself.

												This game is great ... excellent graphics textures and terrain etc ...  devs did a good job on dinosaur AI, tracking and bullet damage system, which are hard things to get right.It can be a hard and cruel game which makes it feel that much more rewarding when you get kills and find good weapons and ammo. It gets a bit easier when you get to level 20 and can buy shotgun and buckshot ammo to fight your way back to your backpackIf you want to realistically simulate hunting dinosaurs and like a challenge, this game does the jobIf this is what you are looking for then you should ignore all the butthurt players posting reviews  who can't handle how hard the game is ... or expect some shiny new dinosaur, gun or hat to be added every week otherwise they rage quit.It would be good if the devs were more focused on improving and expanding TheHunter:Primal but it doesn't stop what has been made so far from being a unique and enjoyable game			"

								Hunt - Explore - Survive. This 3 things are very important in game. For hunting you never musn't run because some on dinosaurs can hear you and attack you from behind. So all you need to is just to walk and you will come to place to place. At begging you start with bow and pda. For searching new weapons you need to find camps, there will be items or not, better items you have faster and more damage you will give. After you die you will lose the items you found and you will start again with bow and pda so be careful of dinosaurs and big hills. The map is huge. You need to spend pretty much hours to go everywhere. If you want to survive you don't need to run always move and when you see dino try to avoid him or attack him if is not so dangerous... You need to go away from some plants that can steal your health or kill, avoid big hills because you can die if is a rock mountain. Some of Dinosaurs are not dangerous... But for reward is good to kill them.... Game is really awesome hunting game i ever play...  You can even play with your friends and hunting together!10/10!			"

												The game starts off with a single pioneer. You are basically forced to Primal Eden at gunpoint to help the Expansion Galaxies eradicate dinosaurs on the planet. If you die your close relatives volunteer to pick up where you left off.      Once on the planet for the first time, you have nothing more than a machete, settlers mate and clothes with no camo value at all. The game is an open world first-person shooter. You can find weapons or buy them if you are a high enough rank.        When you kill one of the  five dinosaurs on the planet. You use your settlers mate to harvest it. There are rare dinosaurs as well that drop special weapons that is later purchasable through the In game market when you die. From the harvests you gain G, that is used to purchase these weapons and equipment.       There are these settlements throughout Primal Eden that offer crates of weapons, equipment, and ammo. Certain settlements offer special weapons that are extremely expensive in the in-game market. Like the .50 cal rifle that is only found in one location and only spawns one per server.      Hosting a game is a bit difficult to setup. The game has a fair amount of bugs. You will have to open ports 42303 and 27015 in order to host. The game has no dedicated servers and what this means is your PC will become a server basically. You may still get the port error code message even if your ports are forwarded correctly. Your game may crash with other errors as well.      If you're into open world  survival horror first person shooters where you can hunt dinosaurs or other players. Then I highly recommend this game. It has its fair share of bugs, but the games direction is something unique and different			"

Early Access Review
								My current review:Alright lets start with some things I see commonly come up:-There is no Micro-transactions, it is a one time purchase.-People seem to worry about it being abandoned like The Stomping Land. Avalanche Studios would have too much to lose if they ditched the game so do not see that happening. They are the ones responsible for the Just Cause games, I do not see them being willing to ditch a game to ruin sales of their other major games.-Yes there is bugs, it is early access.-Yes there is a lot of walking and patience required at some parts, this is hunting not a run and gun war game.So far I am quite enjoying this game even at it's beginning state, from the amazing visuals to hunting and being hunted by dinosaurs. There is currently 3 types of dinosaurs, 2 more planned during Early Access phase before release. You start off next to a pod in which you will receive a bow, arrows, and a map fragment, these items are quite weak (but can kill if used properly) and after exploring and surviving the dinosaur inhabitants you will stumble upon encampments and chests in which you can find loot. This can be anything from ammo, camo, health right up to guns.If you are not careful you could wind up in the jaws of a T-Rex or ambushed by a pack of Raptors. Stealth is your friend when hunting these creatures. T-Rexs are not really advisable to hunt alone as they are extremely tough to take down but with a group of fellow hunters you can take them on. Raptors can track you and even plan to flank you, plenty of times some will creep up on you without you even noticing keeping you on your toes a lot of the time.Your items go with you after you relog or switch servers, they are with you until you die at which point if you want your items back you will have to run back to where you died to reclaim your items if someone has not already looted your items. PVP is an option for servers to have as well.Some people do complain about the damage of the weapons against the dinosaurs but the thing is, they're dinosaurs, not thin skinned humans. They have thick skin, thick skulls and small brains, you want to aim for vital organs such as the lungs/heart for the maximum effectiveness. A well placed shot will take down a Raptor in one shot, a T-Rex can be taken down with several well placed shots although if you hit in a not so vulnerable area it will take a lot more to take the mighty beasts down. Animals if hurt enough will bleed out over time as well, so do not just automatically expect a fleeing animal survived. Even the mighty T-Rex may flee if hurt enough.I do not want to give much about the story of the game away, but there is a bit of a storyline behind it which you will discover while playing if you keep your eyes peeled out for such things.As for bugs, there is a few and I have crashed a few times but not enough for me to really complain. I could go on but this is already long. Overall if this is your type of game and do not mind supporting Early Access titles I would recommend it, if that does not sound like your thing, then wait it out.			"

												Before you read too much into this, theHunter: Primal is a good game.However, the lack of updates and support from developers leaves this game feeling too empty and unrewarding for the player.The game currently features only 5 dinosaurs to hunt which isn't bad to start, but it get's old fast. This isn't helped by the fact that two of them behave very similarly, so you basically only have 4 unique dinos to hunt.Again, if the game were recieving constant updates this would be fine, but it's become pretty clear that this game is dead to them so they can work on more lucrative projects.The only bonus I guess would be that nothing is locked behind a pay wall like in theHunter. You get everything just for buying the game.That being said, the game itself is fun. It is an actual hunting simulator that you hunt dinosaurs in. Many people complain that it takes too long to get from A to B and that there isn't enough going on for most of the game. While things are spread VERY far appart and it can take a long time to walk to where you want to go... it's a hunting simulator.You're supposed to track things for a long time and have to walk long distances. It makes it feel more real for me. Just don't be expecting to run into the dino you're looking for after a few minutes or have giant, fast paced battles constantly.The game is very much: walk, track, walk, track, walk, track, shoot, track, walk, etc.Again, fine for some people, but not most.The main point of complaint would be lack of updates. The game does feel unfinished with only 5 dinos and no real reward system other than just buying better equipment. (Which is actually just annoying due to ammo and weight restrictions.)TL;DR: Amazing concept and execution hampered by the fact that the devs care more about money than this game. It's fun for a few hours but get's old fast. If you really want a realistic dino hunting game, buy this when it's on sale.			"

												Added Flying Dinos and ruined the game. Very lack luster like every other game out nowadays. Devs never put any thought into making the experience enjoyable. Since this is the full release my answer is now safe to say, don't buy this. Before full release I would have said to buy this.			"

Early Access Review
								Day 4.Still hiding in the foliage, with 2 buckshot left.T Rex is out there somewhere, I can hear it... stomping around.Surrounded by Raptors, and If they find me, I will have to start shooting, but the T Rex will hear the shots...Just gotta wait it out a little bit longer...----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you're a fan of stealth mixed with survival / scavenging, then this game is perfect for you. T Rex's are perhaps the most terrifying thing you will ever try to run, hide, or even fight, as even hiding silently they can randomly find you within dense foliage, or inside a hollow tree trunk.There are a few problems with the inventory such as 1 buckshot round can take up the same amount of space as 5 buckshot rounds for example. It's like ammo is sorted out into individual groups, and once you run out of shots in an ""ammo group"", then you have to go into your inventory and place new group into the active slot, which would be tedious during a big fight. The game is very slow paced, as the player must allways take care when traveling from outpost to outpost. Sprinting randomly while traveling can leave the player in dire situations. I haven't been able to play multiplayer yet, but when I do I will update my early access review. Overall, the game has a ""hardcore"" feeling to it, and I have enjoyed the game so far.UPDATEStarted getting into multiplayer, but no PVP stuff (perhaps for the better). We managed to take down a T Rex after tracking it for about 20 minutes, as it was wounded and we were following blood trails.Video of the moment below.

												In early access this game was actually quite good. The 3 dinosaurs, and duplicating glitches, allowed people to enjoy the game and have fun playing it. The ballence of rexs and the other dinosaurs were almost perfect, and if it released then, way more people would have played it. Then here comes the new updates, which ruined the game. First, the machette was added instead of the usual bow. The bow was good because, with experence, you could kill any dinosaur you wish. But now its almost impossible to hit or kill the flying Quetzalcoatlus or the rex due to the rex having its ability to stomp on you (even if you are ahead of it sometimes you can be ""stomped""). What I also dislike was when the rex was in early alpha, you could dodge the rex, and could kill it with any type of weapon (even a bow if you had enough arrows). If would charge and you would dodge it. Simple as that. Then came the ""improvements"" with it. The first and fixed part was an increased spawn rate (which was bad, I will come back to this point in a minute), and secondly they ""fixed"" the rex running in one direction and can now (on a dime) spin and one shot you. Pair that with horrible hit markers and you got a n almost unkillable beast. The last and final straw was when they added the Quetzalcoatlus. They made the birds so common and so deadly (it would pick you up and drop you to your death) that most players stopped playing until the devs created a patch for them. The other ""broken"" thing about them is that it is almost impossible to ""lead"" you gun when they fly, and can only land a hit on them when they are in their attack charge. The worst part about these ""birds"" is that they can only be one shotted with a 700. gun (the 2nd best gun in the game) and even if you shoot it n the face with shotgun shells, it will shake off the damage and still kill you. Overall a unfinished and unpolished game. Needs major fixes for its community to not move onto another game.			"

												This game had so much potential, and started off on the right game, but the studio once again decided to turn a good idea into a way to make as much money as they can and then forget about it.This game should not have left early access for at least another year, there are still plenty of glitches, the game is missing any major content.  Right now its walking simulator with 4 different species of dinos, a couple guns, and an uninteresting map.  While the Animations and sounds for the dinos are pretty nice, the ai really does not come down to much more than basic pathfinding and randoms on whether or not they'll pick you up when your near.At most this only has 5 or 6 hours of gameplay if your lucky, afterwards, it gets pretty boring.Really upset with this game, when it first hit early access I was very excited for the future of this game, but, I guess some developers just don't know how to stick with a game.

												This game is amazing and could easily be the developers BIGGEST TITLE and the best dinosaur game on the market! Unfortunately, the developers don't seem interested in the community feedback and game changing updates in the near future isn't a probable possibility. If they wound only listen to the community and show some enthusiasm and support for the things the player base wants then this game would easily be a 10/10!. Until then I have to give this game a thumbs down. The Hunter Primal is like owning your dream car. Its beautiful, perfect and everything you ever wanted. The title is in your name and you have full ownership, unfortunately they never made a key for it...So whats the point of having this awesome dream car that I CAN'T DRIVE. The Hunter Primal, nearly perfect, but unfinished.			"

												I was pretty happy with how the game evolved during the last months, with some great features like :- the shop- the leveling system (damn I love to level up things §§)- new dinosaurs (YAY FLYING DINO)- the map with recent Terramorphing is quite enjoyable- the devs are quite fast on correcting some bugs (See cons)But, in the meantime :- Game is unbalenced and the release of a species doesn't help- Most of the locations are useless - Some new bugs are appearing constantly If the game was still in early access I'd highly encourage people to try it out, but as a final release this is a shame.Will update if the game keeps getting updated with news elements, and not only hotfixes or bug correcting.

												*UPDATE:*Someone asked why i bought the game in first place, well i remember playing Carnivores 2 for PC when i was a kid and it was incredibly fun.Now keep something in mind, Carnivores 2 had 600% more Dinosaurs, more weapons, a in-game shop with airdrops and even had a Hall of Trophies where you can select a 20 limit show room with your dinosaur harvests and the freaking game is 16 years old... that's right 1999.* *This review used to be positiveAlmost half year playing the god forsaken game when the game was still in the beta, the developers doesn't even care, they don't know how to balance mechanics and they keep f*cking up even harder every time a patch comes in, they keep ""fixing"" cheats instead of fixing actual game breaking bugs or imposible-to-even-play bugs, been more than 5 months and:-You still die by invisible T-rexes 5 seconds or even 2 inmdiatelly after each respawn making the items you buy useless and a complete waste of gold and yes you heard right EACH because EVERY-SINGLE-TIME you respawn you'll get killed by a T-rex no matter where you respawn or how far from the previous death you'll die nonstop until you restart the game or it crashes. -The textures keep f*cking up and the most time you playing without restarting the server the glitchier they become.-After 12a.m. pacific time the servers become sh*t making the lobbies slower, the dinosaurs to teleport, glitch, become invisible, respawn in the sky, kill with 1 hit and fly away to a random place, do a permanent moon walk still taking dammage and acting like they are alive making players waste bullets on them and many other bugs and glitches.-The map can dissapear or just don't show the icons of important places you already visited if you start the game, join a server, leave the server and joining another one without restarting the game.-Bodyparts from the player can dissapear mid-game making the cammo used in this slots be useless and literally non-existant from the game.-Poisonous plants can insta heal the 100% hp of the player-The AI still goes ape sh*t, the dinosaurs can't walk over rocks otherwhise they moon walk endlessly, they get stuck on trees, walls, etc, if 2 players shoot at the same time the dinosaur walks in circles, when they die while sprinting or leaping there is a small chance of the dinosaur flying away, dissapear or get assimilated to the floor making impossible a way to harvest the creature (if it flies away you can still find it at a random position of the entire map).-Awful banning system, if you ban someone from the server the player can still join with no problems no matter how many bans you already gave to the same person.-Constant bugs that involve: Sounds glitching, rain to randomly change (it'd be raining but the sound doesn't triggers and the hunting effects of rain doesn't apply, or it couldn't be raining but the effect would still apply or you could hear the rain but the graphics doesn't show it, etc.)-Splitting ammo into different stacks for friends now dissapears the ammo dropped.-Incomming sound from Rexes constantly glitching, getting cut in half or just comming out like a broken diologue-Broken hitboxes where at times hitting the same spot you get a heart shot and other times hitting in a completely different place you would still get the heart shot or hitting the tail you'll end up with a lung shot.And much more.They released the game as ""full"" when it even has more glitches than Skate 3 and with a even more broke AI than a Ubisoft game.I could buy Don't Starve Together and Besiege with the money spent on this game2/10 It's one of those games that should never leave the beta, proclaiming this as a ""Full Game"" is criminal			"

												TheHunter: PRIMALOVERVIEWOK.... So theHunter: Primal is very very similar to theHunter (obviously) however the main difference are the fact that you cannot purchase anything and then equip them when you first start because it is not a hunting expedition, it's survival... However they have just added an in-game money system, where everytime you harvest a dino, you get money and when you level up, you unlock something in the shop, so when you die, you get taken to a shop where you can purchase weapons and whatnot before you spawn...But it's not like other survival games... you can't build stuff... you basically just gotta scavenge containers and bags and/or kill other players and take their stuff... if it's set to PVP of course...The graphics are a little better than the hunter in my opinion and who can ever forget the beautiful sunrise and sunset water colours... and choice scenery!As far as gameplay, the mechanics are buggy, but can only get better with time. The player movements are different from the Hunter the walking and running are faster, but they have introduced a sprint system which uses stamina and is extremely loud to attract dinosaurs. (Only use in emergency) The hunter mate (although called settler mate) works exactly the same way, spotting and tracking works the same but there isn’t tracking or spotting skill levels, and of course trophy shots and harvesting work the same way also. You don't get experience for weapon use in this game either... There is also a new tracking feature in which I really like... when you wound an animal and you track it's blood, it tells you in percentage how injured it is... for eg.... after shooting a T-Rex 6 times with a shotgun, after scanning it's blood it told me that it had 45-60% health left and the next time I shot it once... it said 30-48% (as well as body/intestine shot etc)THE GOOD- Great graphics - Excellent immersion (especially when the t-rex is nearby or when a raptor knows you're there and he/she calls out to the pack to help look for you)- Cool map with central volcano (no dinosaur game is complete without a volcano to set the mood)- Has major potential for many wonderful things- No pay to win, no money at all (except in-game currency from harvesting)- Injury percentage for prey- When you die, you can retrieve your goods from your old backpack... as long as no-one else has pillaged it!!- Thunderstorms :D- Mean looking dinosaursTHE BAD- Lots of gameplay bugs and a rushed full release from Early Access- Only five dinosaurs... T-Rex, Utahraptors, Triceratops, Velociraptors and Quetzalcoatlus (Dino-birds)- Scavenging gets boring and old really quickly - needs traditional ‘the Hunter’ mode- Controls are very stiff and sometimes sluggish- Bad framerates in high detailed areas such as swamps and dense jungle regions- Faulty hit register, (shoot the 6,000kg T-Rex in the heart with a .700 while it's standing still and it registers as only a body hit, where sometimes I can drop a 10,000kg Triceratops on the run with one .308 round to the heart, where the bullet hole is on the leg... Can be quite frustrating at times... as you die from not dropping them or you run out of ammo...- Quetzalcoatlus seem to be able to swoop through hilly terrain and through metal spikes and grab you, even though you shot them in the head...- Sound is a little buggy crossing from biome to biome- The Quetzalcoatlus, although remarkable are very annoying and frustrating to deal with at times...WHAT IT NEEDS- Need to be able to craft something, to build defences to stand a chance killing dinosaurs without dying- Needs more dinosaur species (especially herbivores) and less of the current ones for a nice balanced game- Need to see the Dinosaurs attacking each other... raptors attacking T-rex and Triceratops, Velociraptors getting taken by Quetzalcoatlus and the traditional T-Rex versus triceratops battle...- Maybe a 4 wheeler would be good as usually the game spawns you on the other side of the map as your friends- The T-rex needs to have a bigger roar like on Jurassic Park... to really make your hairs stand on end.- A traditional ‘the Hunter’ mode, to create expeditions instead of scrounging around...VERDICTOverall I give this game a 6.5/10, well worth $15 - $20 AUD MAX... but knowing the developers... they did such an awesome job with ‘the Hunter’... So I expect the same with this... So if you like the Hunter I recommend getting ‘the Hunter: Primal’, especially since Dinosaurs will soon be ruling Hollywood again, it's nice to finally see a switch from zombie survival for once.Also a funny thing... when you find some T-Rex poo, you'll notice it has human arms and some skulls in it... fkn hilarious!! Even funnier than that Jurassic Park satellite phone scene!!			"

I lost all progress and equipment and requested a refund. Apparently the developers abandoned this game and no longer support it or fix issues with it. I recommend not purchasing it.Edit, July 27, 2016: The issue of losing progress and equipment is a rare occurance corrected by exiting the game and restarting. Since I can't get a refund, I still play the game, but stand by my initial assessment since the developers seem to have abandoned this game and likely won't fix it. I still don't recommend purchasing it for this reason.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is going to get even more fun when they add more dinos. But even in early access as it is, I'm enjoying this game a lot. When you start out, its one of the most frightening experiences when you run into a Utah Raptor pack or a T-Rex for the first time. It is tough in the beginning before you pickup guns/gear, as that orange jump suit and bow & arrow don't help you out a ton. But I enjoy a challenge. Now that I've learned the mechanics and gotten the best gear the most dangerous predetor on the island is me ;)They ain't never seen a duck like me!			"

												I enjoyed this damn game and once again got my hopes up for an alpha. I was willing to look over the AI issues, bugs, chunkiness and lack of games systems because of the early assess phase. I am disappointed they even skipped the beta phase and went straight to full release, doubling the price tag in the process. The release of the Quetzalcoatlus is a joke, the thing can fly through terrain and one shot you in a dense forest, even though it is meant to be in open plains. I do not recommend this game to any gamer/dinosaur lover. The inventory is unfinished and stupid, this whole game reeks of unfinished work. The devs just got lazy and put a turd on sale. I do not recommend this game at all.			"

												I'll recommend it when it's been finished, with no glitches. The content doesn't bother me so much, they can always add new dinos, pterosaurs etc as they go and the ones they have are relitively scientifically acurate. The irritating thing is how glitchy it still is, there are so many major problems, from flying velociraptors, underwater T-rex's, Quetzals stuck in animation loops and empty and unchangable inventories when you know you have kit. Then of course there is the game completely crashing because your bow loads a rock on it.I expected more of a survival type game, with hunger to keep at bay, some safer areas to set up camps and the ability to craft better weapons etc. Unless you manage to meet up with another player or two making noise via shooting or running is pretty much suicide.On the other hand, apart from the horrendous glitching and a bit of a question mark over the Tyranosaurs apparent steel plated skin the game is enjoyable when it's working.

												I enjoyed this game, it had a lot of potential back then...so much so in fact that I put some time and effort in answering a survey the devs sent out over a year ago. There were actually quite a lot of us who helped the devs identify all the current gameplay issues, and give them some feedback on how we who like the game to progress moving forward. The devs had made it well clear that they were prepared to put in the effort into creating new content for the game, and the community and the players believed them and supported them.A little over a year later (after completing the survey), we finally hear back from the dev team with a laughable patch, stating the game is now in full release (with the price heavily knocked down).Needless to say we all know what that means. The dev team has abandoned development on this game and has run away with the early access money from the players and most importantly, they did not deliver on their promise to the whole community.I must say I'm baffled that Steam allows these developers to get away with charging full price on a game and failing to deliver: it’s a lack of respect on both the players and on steams’ standards.Most importantly, it teaches us that we should never purchase a game in early access. Lesson learned then. Do not purchase this game. "

												After collecting 100% of the Steam achievements in a total of 240 hours of gameplay I can state that theHunter: Primal is a crappy and disapointing game. Here is my explanation why: I was already familiair with the hunting simulator theHunter and the announcement of theHunter: Primal got my interest in 2014. I bloody loved the game when it got available for early access and it was such a blast to hunt dinosaurs, explore the map, trying to find gear with all kinds of people from all over the world. And the best things was that there only was more to come! Or was there...The game got fully released with only a couple of more dinosaur species, dinosaur variants and weapons with the occasional bug fixes. Today it still feels like it is in early access and unfinished. After all I can conclude that the developers did a cashgrab with this game and then totally abandoned it. Such a shame, because the game had so much potential and an active community. Sadly, the pricedrop indicated to me at least that it is not going to be any better soon. I do not recommend this game, the customer is being poorly treated.Positive points:+ Graphics+ Large Map+ Hitting vital organs matters+ Multiplayer can be a lot funNegative points:- Lack of overall content- Clunky controlls- Dinosaur AI tends to be annoying- Framedrops in certain areas- Game crashes			"

												For those dinosaur fanactics out there, those who enjoyed  carnivores 1 & 2. And any other hunting sim, your welcome to come try theHunter Primal. I have over 400 hours in this game, by far one of my personal favorites among my group of games. Also best played with friends. Going to lay the line out flat now so you guys know the cons before anything else in this game.1. It's a survival/hunting game, so you have to scanvenge for gear and level for better gear. This depends on your forte in gaming, but there is no crafting in this game. So minecrafters......stay out.2. Still a few bugs to do with in game, but no need to fear. The devs have cleaned this game quite a bit since early access and its smooth and clean. so far anyway :D3. if you faint of heart and you don't have a good set of headphones, i suggest you get them otherwise you'll be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ your pants every 5 mins at the start of your first day alone :P good luck!Now the pros of this game1. 5 dinosaur species, Trex, 2 sets of raptors, Velociraptor and Utahraptor <(I'm from jurassic park). and the famous triceratops and lastly the quatzocoatlutus. Each animal is extremely unique and can be very dangerous to you if you dont know whats up, read up your guides and even then, you won't be prepared. 2. Buddies, amazing that you have em. With the games Co-op/pvp servers which you can create on your own simply opening a port in your router. Now you have friends to play with and dont forget steam voice chat! communcation is key when hunting a rex. Or maybe you get caught in a ravine and mashed by 30 raptors :P3. Very expansive world, there isnt anywhere on this map you can't travel and mutliple biomes to explore. From the plains to the volcano it doesnt get any better then this. I have personally walked the map a few times now, and it roughly takes up to 8 hours if not more to cover it all. Have fun!4. Graphics are gorgeous even on a lower power PC. The animals look amazing, between the butterflys to the leaves falling the game doesnt get any better than that.Now you now the pros and cons and a whole 30 bucks and look what it got me :P 400 hours of good ole fashioned fun so please join the game and our community. The more support this game gets the more dinos it may or may not have to weapons etc. And think of you and your buddies getting together to go hunt a rex for that big trophy only to be eaten! Its a blast and it gets my 5 out 5 stars. Good luck out in the field folks!			"

												DON'T LET THE POSITIVE REVIEWS FOOL YOU! MOST OF THOSE WERE WRITTEN BY PEOPLE DURING THE GAME'S EARLY ACCESS STAGE. WHICH THE DEVS ARE CONVENIENTLY INCLUDING WITH THE GAMES FULL RELEASE!Major network issues with the game. To this day a lot of people still have trouble hosting, even after forwarding the correct ports, which they shouldn't have to do in the first place!This game was more fun in its EA stage than it is right now. They released it prematurely without ironing out all the bugs. The dino populations and AI are still a mess. There are glitches o' plenty (Birds grabbing you even though you're clearly out of reach, Rexes biting through walls etc.) Gameplay is missing basic fundamentals. (No jump ability, Crippled Aim Down Site/Slow movement while aiming, inadequate stamina, etc.)No dedicated servers. (official or player hosted)No control for the Game host. (weather control, selective dino species, gear theft -other players can take your gear in the PVE environment-)There are no interactions between the Dinos. No Bull Trikes battling each other. No raptors ganging up on Trikes. No rexes eating raptors. Boasting ""most realistic"" and then delivering this as a final product? You gotta be kidding me...At one point I loved where this game was going. At this point I cannot recommend it.I really hope they make some drastic changes soon. I'd like to enjoy this game again sometime.And for the dumba$$es rejecting this review even though all I've done is pointed out facts. If you don't agree with facts maybe consider jumping on the scientology bandwaggon. You'd fit right in there!Here's a video I made supporting some of my claims. Just to show that some of these A$$clowns rejecting this review have no idea what a good functioning game is.

Since I made this video Dino AI is still a mess. The updates are very infrequent and the Devs have stated that they do not intend to work on the game anytime soon. I predict this game will ultimately crash and burn as there are many interesting alternatives on the horizon.			"

												While theHunter: Primal was an interesting idea and new take on theHunter I think that the potential is wasted. I would of recommended this game during Alpha and a lot of other reviewers would of too, but in the end the product was squandered through the all too common mindset that an unfinished game will sell.There is little ecodiversity, compared theHunter's array of prey and predatory animals you'll soon get bored of hunting Raptors and find yourself more than annoyed when the little rappies come and nibble away at your health. When you get to T-Rexes, Tris and Queztals you'll find it a worthless endeavour, more or less making you waste tons of ammo.There is never a moment when you can experience an uninterupted and satisfying moment, it's like a copohany of prehistoric animals just trying to eat you.Don't waste your money. Especially now.			"

Early Access Review
I think this should be called ""TheHunted"".Great game! Although still in Early Access, I think this game is oozing with potential, a few things will need to be changed and added, such as sorting out the spawnzones, adding more dinosaurs and changing how frequent those darn raptors are, but all in due time! Although this version has more to do with Survival, it is still much like the original TheHunter, as this game is very strategic and also very entertaining, intense and immersive once you get going! (especially on multi player).This is how my gameplay has been so far: 1st life: Spawned into the world, only to find myself instantly surrounded by Utahraptors, I majestically pulled out my bow and managed to kill 4 of the little buggers, only to be killed by a 5th one that caught me off guard... ""Clever girl..."".2nd life: Spawned to hear more Utahraptors; I ran before obtaining a bow and died instantly.3rd life: Spawned in a clearing, only to hear a loud, booming roar behind me. Before I had the chance to turn around: I got T-REKT.4th life: managed to crawl my way out of danger and eventually found a basic rifle.... TheHunted had become TheHunter, this is what it's all about - time to get my revenge!			"

												Let's keep it simple.Graphics: 9/10Graphics here are nice and solid for the genre.  It won't make you wet yourself with glee but it's nice and clean.  No painful visual issues, at all.  Whoever did the lighting work did an excellent job.Controls: 8/10The controls are a bit unwieldy.  I adjusted the keyboard settings and it became quite comfortable though.  (Tip: The grave accent key to the left of the 1 is an excellent key to reassign something to for this one)Pacing: 5/10I found the pacing very odd.  I understand that it is an in dev game but there is oddly little to do.  Maybe more will come later but for those considering buying let me simplify it.  Right now, your life will consist of first hiding and crawling around on your belly to avoid scaly monsters.  Then, if you are very very lucky, you will get a weapon and it becomes your job to stop hiding and hunt them.    There are no other activities, strictly speaking, as far as I can tell.  You decide if that's fun for you.Price: 3/10While I definitely see the possibility for this game to become good I would say, 'Save your money for a bit.'  This either will drop in price or become worth the current one.  If you have limited gaming funds, try something else.  It is still too uncertain to say where this one will go.			"

												All though theHunter: Primal looks promising, that's just it, a game sold on promises alone with which few are filled.Expansive map that's a chore to navigate on foot with more predators than herbivores making up the breadth of the dino roster. You're going to have a difficult time having fun being tossed back in the spawn again and again.			"

												     This game HAD good potential... still does if the developers will actually come back to this game to fix some issues, provide support and add more content. My experience with support so far is terrible. I sent them an email about this error code (250477278) that has been keeping me from even starting the game since I couldn't find a fix for it in the forums, it took 12 days for anyone to reply back. They COULD HAVE just told me what this error meant or if they even knew what it meant in the first reply but for some reason didn't and just said ""sorry for the delay. Your ticket was found in our spam folder due to the ammount of time passed, if the issue hasn't been resolved or solution found please respond and we will look into it ASAP...""      I replied back the very next day telling them the issue still hasn't been resolved yet and asked them if they could tell me what the error code means... it's been another 8 days and still no reply from them even letting me know if they have seen the message, are working on this issue or not... so far about an hour of my time on record for this game has been me sitting in the launcher screen trying to see if it's a graphics setting I have set causing these issues but have had no success and I have even tried reinstalling the game. It really does feel like the developers just took the money and ran so in this current state I have to advise against buying this game, because if something breaks it doesnt look like the developers are going to care too much.

Post Early Access Update!I've got to say, with all of the constant bug fixing Avalanche has done to this game alone, you'd be crazy not to buy this game. Not to mention all of the great additions they've managed to add on the way. I am also very happy to see the 20% off discount with the game's full release. Grab this great game, folks.Early Access ReviewThis game looks like it has GREAT potential in the near future, as long as the developers continue to patch and update the current alpha version. As it stands I would have to recommend this game as long as updates are continuously released and good changes are made.Of course, it is a 50/50 when purchasing a game this early in alpha stages. THERE ARE BUGS! Keep this in mind.PROS:- Great optimization- Realistic dino sounds. You can hear them a mile away.- Good sound quality.- Higher than average graphics. (I have screenshots on my profile w/high settings.)- Beautiful scenery.CONS:- Unstable and strange AI. Sometimes dinos walk over you, sometimes they chase you for miles.- The dreaded ""Player Timing Out Message"" whenever someone leaves a server.- Random crashing (Has gotten better with patches)All of these things are subject to change, as the game is in alpha!

								This game is GREAT so far.I died a few times after searching for items and being found by Raptors but it was awesome to see how the game looks and how the dinos behave. I was able to kill one Raptor with a bow so far which was fun. I can't wait to see how the game progresses during this early access period.I did encounter an achievment glitch which gave me 4 achievments on entering my frineds map. They were all travel achievments that I did not earn which would have been given after traveling 15km - 200km but thats not a big issue :PThe dinosaurs look great and tracking is fun just like in theHunter but the way you funtion has slightly changed. Running is now done by holding down [c] and the inventory is updated to fit the type of gameplay more I suppose.			"

												This game still has got so much potential, but the devs just need to get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together and at least make a DLC if nothing else. Also, this game should be in early access as it has a relatively pathetic amount of content, although even in it's current state the game is very immersive.It seems like they'll be including a DLC in recent days. I think that's amazing, even though you could call this ''robbery'' since the game is still nowhere near finished I think the devs just need more motivation and this could still be one of the best dinosaur games ever to be released. Since most of you are not going to be reading all this I'll just get straight to the pros and cons of this game.Pros-Beautiful and large world-Plenty of potential-Extremely immersiveCons-Dinosaurs are way underpowered, especially utahraptor and velociraptor. If you're looking for a horror game with dinosaurs in it, this isn't your best choice-Huge lack of dinosaur species-No workshop supportNow, would I recommend this game in it's current state? Well that really depends on what you are looking for when buying this game. If you want to experience the dinosaurs living in their natural environment and experience the prehistoric-like ambience you will most likely love this game, even in it's current state. But if you aren't interested in this, and you want this game just to hunt the dinosaurs I would not recommend this game at the moment since there are only a few dinosaur species to hunt.			"

Early Access Review
								Really fantastic game! I can't even count how many times I've screamed out loud in terror as a pack of Utahraptors rushed me or a T-rex snuck up on me. It's a very intense and addictive game, but I recommend adding more than just the 2 new dinosaurs (whatever they may be) in the further future. You need more herbivores than just the Triceratops, so that you can have a realistic ecosystem. Also, if you plan on adding animals like Edmontosaurus or Parasaurolophus, there will definitely need to be better herding mechanics like with the Caribou and Elk in theHunter. So yeah, my only real concern right now is primmitive herding mechanic and lack of herbivores, but I'm certain you guys won't disappoint!			"

												I spent the almost entirity of my time playing this game dealing with an extremely annnoying texture glitch that I couldn't find any help for anywhere. Finally after about 2 hours I gave up and deciced ok even though my game has all the foliage mixed and blended together so I can't see where any of the supposed drop caches are supposed to be. I'll try to ignore it and just play. Then I spent the next 20 minutes dying over and over from  the flying dinosaurs on the map. There was no way to counteract them I couldn't hide, run, on fight them off becasue I couldn't find any weapons due to the strange foliage problem. I doubt I would have been able to kill them if I even wasn't dealiing with my strange glitch as what these enemies do is pick you up, fly you way up in the sky, and drop you for a one hit kill. The game overall feels very unfinsihed and should not have been released in this state. I really wish I had not bought it and as long as it is in this state no one should.			"

												Dont really know what i have to say about this game... i bought it during alpha and expected big things from the game, and i got this at full release:1. 5 Dinosaurs........ 5 DINOSAURS?!?! 4 of them being agressive and only 1 herbivore2. the ai is so dumb! the dinosaurs only have a couple attacks which are extremely basic and you're never suprised by dinosaur encounters3. the game is boring, i know its a hunting game and hunting in real life is quite slow paced but the dinosaurs could at least attack each other which would create some excitement when you encounter the occurance.4. the game doesn't know what it's trying to be, is it a hunter game or a survival game? i can't tell.5. finally, the game is moderately fun, WHEN you're encountering a dinosaur WITH enough ammo and a weaponOverall, my final verdict/word to describe the game is unfinished, and if the developers do nothing with the game after the full release i urge you to not buy this game no matter the discounts it has because it probably isn't selling enough.

												Ok, so let me start by saying I do enjoy this game a lot, but I (and im sure many others) would like it a lot better if there were more dino's and possibly even more weapons, but I'm not too fussed about it.GAMEPLAYtheHunter: Primal is a hunting game. So don't go into it expecting to be able to kill the dino's, cook their meat and eat it, or be able to build a shelter. This game is a survival game, but not in the sense like the forest or stranded deep. I haven't played the normal theHunter game so I'm not sure if this game has the same mechanics, but i do enjoy the tracking system, and the ability to use stealth to your advantage to either hunt or get away from a dino. The game has no plot or storyline which does make it a bit boring for those people who expect to have an overall mission. 8/10 for gameplay.THE MAPThe world that this game is set on is visually stunning (if you have a decent computer) and is actually really big, so you can spend a lot of hours just navigating your way around the map and discovering the different environments which in itself is enjoyable. The addition of settlements is great because they can provide players with a goal or shelter. 10/10 for the map.MULTIPLAYERThis game is pretty much just a multiplayer game. There is no point even bothering to play singleplayer because you will die. I am yet to play on a PvP server because personally I find it more enjoyable to hunt with others, not against them. This game is meant for friends to actually play together and take down a rex, which is why you can buy it in a 4-pack. You will find people even in PvE servers that will backstab you and take your stuff, but you will find even more people that will help you survive if you are a new player ( I have helped multiple new player get to a settlement and get some gear). 8/10 for multiplayer.DINO AI, SPAWNRATE AND HITBOXESOk, so this is defeniatly the biggest issue that the game has. The AI for most of the dino's is really annoying and is kinda dumb (they are working on improving this though). The spawnrate of dino's is actually reasonably good at the moment, and pretty much all old players will know of the problems created by some updates (When they increased the rex spawn rate so you couldn't walk through a field without seeing 10 rexes, and the Quetz update where you couldn't walk though a field without being dropped to your death). The hitboxes at the moment are terrible and gotta be fixed. I have been picked up by quetz's when i am standing 10 feet on either side of it, and bitten by Utahraptors even when I sidestep them. 6/10 for the AI, spawnrate and hitboxesOVERALL VERDICTOverall, i would defeniatly recommend this game for people looking for a game which provides a good teamwork experience, and are looking to make friends while hunting dino's (it's a win-win if you ask me). I would tell people that want a game where they can just jump in and start spraying dino's to look somewhere else.7/10 rating for the whole game.			"

												This game has a great atmosphere and definitely a must-have for anyone who likes a challenging game. However it requires hours of walking around to get anywhere for ammo or gear which isn't guaranteed. So if you like a game with bullets flying and dinosaurs dying then this isn't the game for you.Things I like:It's a real challenge.Have to constantly stop and listen to your surroundings which is sometimes covered up by the sound of your footsteps.Tracking, tracked a Triceratops for half an hour only to run into a pack of Utahraptors.The sounds of utahraptors.The dinosaurs look great.Things I don't:Only one herbivore which runs almost every time it's attacked besides a single charge at you on rare occasions.It takes ages to go to a newer area.

This game is intense, accurate, challenging and overall fun. I have some suggestions for dev team. Add some more herbivores like stegosaurs, Gallimimus or Pachysephalosaurus (some example), and add a way to travel by water, maybe add one or two aquatic reptiles like lioplueridon or plesiosaurs, as there are other islands, but no way to get to them. Also, and most importantly, fix as many of the bugs and glithces as possible, as they ruin the game for some. Final Score: 8/10 Would play again IGN :)			"

								One of the best games I have erver played but it needs a lot of work, a couple of more dinosaurs like the spinosaur and carnotaurus, a couple more hervibores will be amazing like the Pachycephalosaurus and the Protoceratops, being able to swim would be nice too and water danger would be amazing like the megalodon or mosasaurus.The bow is too weak, you could add a better bow or crafting arrows and better arrows system, upgrading your bow would be nice too, I would like to see more weapons in the game and more tools like a coleman pick ore something like that, making a tent will be nice for hidding.This game still a lot of upgrades... but i simply love it!

												I have been with this game from alpha, they could have made this game great, instead all you get is a very buggy game, with bad physics, (i.e.) 4 ton dinosaurs that wont stop rolling down hills, Pterasaurs that bug out mid air, low ammo drops, a terrible grind to level 50, you have to intentionally die to get ammo, the games cache seems broken, always fails to update, lack of dnosaur species, lack of good hunting equipment, lack of vehicles, or some form of hunters blind, lack of a base camp, lack of some form of escape from dinosaurs, terrible corpse runs.. Good weather effects, and graphics, but thats about it...It is my belief that they gave up on this game ages ago...They could have made this game a triple a title, instead they made it crap....oh well hopefully someone else will create a bad♥♥♥♥♥dinosaur game..The could have also made personal servers instead of their master server ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I will never support this company again..

												Considering all of the negative reviews I've seen, I didn't go into this expecting much. Yet, maybe that's why I came out of it pleasantly surprised at the quite enjoyable game play. It's similar to theHunter, which is also made by the same people, in the way it plays. You follow tracks or dinosaur sounds to find them, then shoot them, and have to track them down to claim your prize. However, this being dinosaurs, it doesn't tend to go that smoothly.I will admit I've encountered the bug or two, having been launched into the air by a raptor who took a bite out of my face before running away, the stand button suddenly not working as I'm having my groin ravaged or watching as raptors furiously run into a wall as they attempt to flee from me after I've shot them.However, despite all this. It's fun, and can be quite exhilarating when you suddenly find yourself smashed into by a Quetz for the first time or hear the footsteps of a T-Rex that's now dangerously close, having to fall to the floor and hold your breath in the hopes it will pass you by.

												I was very, very surprised to see that this game was released to soon after entering early access. A name like Avalanche Studios carries weight with me, and that's mostly the reason I bought this game a few days after it came out on early access. It didn't have much content, but it was in early access, so I has expecting that they'd add more. I was so very much hoping that I'd able to return to this game after a few months of development. I was wrong. First of all, this is not a bad game. It's a good game, don't get me wrong. The graphics are amazing, the sound design is probably the best of any game I've ever played, the dinosaurs are well designed and the terrain is well crafted. The world is massive and will take you at least an hour to walk from one side to the other on foot. With that being said, mechanically, this game is sound, more or less. The new flying dinos broke the game with their bugs, (thankfully, the worst one was fixed) they fly through terrain, are sometimes impossible to see or hear, and make you unable to reclaim your gear after you become dino-chow. There are a few more bugs related to the dinosaurs, but thankfully I've never encountered a crash.The game (to my knowledge) advertised this to be a survival game, but, don't be fooled: there is anything that remotely has to do with the ""survival"" genre that we've come to know and love within games like The Forest and Stranded Deep. The only type of ""survival"" to be found here is the kind where you avoid not being killed. This IS ""survival"", per se, as surviving literally means ""not dying"", but hey, semantics. I was really looking forward to the kind of survival that I thought was being advertised, and I suppose that it could be said that it was my misinterpretation of what I read that lead to my disappointment. I was so excited to make a base, look for food, water and weapons, make medicines and then go hunting for some large extraterrestrial lizards. (Yes, in case you didn't know, this game takes place on an alien planet.) I do know for sure that this game labels itself as ""realistic"". This is probably where my misconception originated from:""Hunt - Explore - Survive The most realistic prehistoric survival game ever created."" theHunter: Primal, 2014. There's nothing realistic about hunting dinosaurs on an alien planet. Trust me. I know my♥♥♥♥♥♥ But do I care about that? No, of course not. I get to hunt dinosaurs realistically, of course. All sillyness aside, and to summarize what I've just said, I'm sad I can't have a real dino-hunting/survival game. This leads me to me largest and most bitter gripe with this game: there's no content. There's nothing. Literally. Well, not literally... there's a few gigs of space being taken up by this on my C: drive, but it's substance is lacking quite a lot. There are a total of 5 dinosaurs to hunt. 5 dinosaurs in total.This is a dinosaur hunting game with only 5 dinosaurs. Why? There are only a few weapons too. These are what I can think of: Magnum, Rifle, Shotgun, .50 cal Sniper Rifle, Machete, Bow. The bow is REALLY buggy too, and I've never found the .50 cal Sniper Rifle. While there are some cool attachments you can put on your weapons, there is no excusing the lack of content here. Sure the world is big, but what good is it if there's nothing to do. The game is thirsty, it's STARVING, its emaciated; just begging---""Please, please, give me sustenance! Food, water!"" And we're here, kneeling beside this sad mess of skin and bones, screaming, ""Yes! Please! Feed it, FEED IT! WE BEG OF YOU!""The developer answered our cries for more content by saying, ""Hmm... maybe. If it sold more copies, we might.""(I can provide a link to the discussion thread where a dev said this, if anyone wants it. Assuming they don't delete it, of course. The thread is titled ""Post-release heads up.)Uhh. I paid $20 dollars for this game. For some unimaginable reason, the devs think that the small, bare-bones amount of content they added within the few short months of early access somehow, and unexplainably, warrented a 50% increase to the price of the game. It's insulting, really. I never would have bought this game in early access if I knew that they wouldn't add anything to it. That's the risk we take when we buy early access games and technically it is our fault for making a bad purchase, but still, it makes me feel sh*tty. Something needs to be done about early access and fast, otherwise, I'm probably never going to buy early access again. The sheer amount of failures of games that come out of that proverbial cesspool too early, or in this case, looking like a actor/actress who overdid the pea soup diet for their first appearance at the Academy Awards is staggering. To conclude, this game is a massive disappointment and a massive waste of potential, one of the largest for me in recent memory. Do youself and your loved ones a favor and stay away from this thing. I might have expected this sort of thing from Expansive Worlds, but not Avalanche. Why Avalanche, why! I'm not not sure what kind of role they played in developing this game, but just the fact alone that they had anything to do with this game makes me want to give Just Cause 3 a miss.			"

												I wouldn't call this a hunting game, since you will most likely spend very little time actually hunting.Hunting in this game is more of a brief side challenge to the main game, which is slowly walking around a giant map trying not to die while you find tools just to get started.The game actually has a giant and varied map, which is pretty, even if it gets a bit blocky in some areas. The downside of having a huge map however is that there is NO FAST TRAVEL. Expect to slowly walk (and briefly run) through a mostly empty map for your entire playthrough. Join a friends server? You may end up having to walk across the entire map to reach them upon joining, alone with no items. Unfortunately, even though you are given a good mapping tool, you will rarely ever be able to make the most of it.The game is basically 100% ironman mode. On death you lose ALL map data, ALL weapons, and ALL equipment.Then you will be transported quite a distance away from your body, with a blank map and a machete. If you're lucky, you MIGHT be able to make it to your body and recover your items (but not map) without dying again to whatever killed you in the first place, be it Trex, or incredibly steep cliffs that you always seem to spawn at the bottom of.This game also doesn't have a single player mode, the closest thing being a private passworded server.I HIGHLY recommend that if you choose to play this, you only play it with a group of friends who are also REALLY into walking/hunting games. You can try looking for public online games, but you may have issues finding someone who speaks your language to hunt with.While you sort of level up from killing dinos, the only thing it really affects is what items you can buy after each death, assuming you have any credits to do so.If you are looking for a fun, easy to get into hunting game, DO NOT PLAY THIS.

												I got this game in a bundle, but it would still be well worth $10.It has a top notch immersive environment with a full day/night cycle as well as weather effects. The sound design is absolutely amazing and you will feel yourself in a pristine island. The calls of dinosaurs in the distance, or the rustling of leaves in the foliage, or the ominous steady stomps from T-rexes are just a few of the environmental surround that you will experience.There are weapon crates scattered all over the island, but these are still a bit scarce. This is the first game to actually give me a survival-feel that are absent in most open world survival/apocalypse games. The dinosaurs are scarce too, or will feel like it until you learn to notice footprints and the small darting movements from the corner of your eyes in thick jungles.Two negatives I want to address. The island is freaking big but you travel really slow. That does add immersion but also adds tediousness. I recommend getting a trainer that gives unlimited sprint (but even that is slow).The second is that the devs abandoned the game. So what you experience the first 10 hours will probably be just about everything the game has to offer in terms of novelty.I would still recommend it, if you're into an immersive game.			"

This is an amazing game!!I've played this for over Twenty hours so far, and I love it!!!  I am a huge fan of theHunter so when I saw this was going to be released I know I would have to buy it.  This game has tons of potential, and is very great for an alpha game.  This game really will get your blood rushing when you hear the magnificent Tyrannosaurus rex growl!  When you first get in the game you get a bow, five arrows, and a map fragment.  There is now PVP in theHunter series, if your a fan of PVP you would enjoy it. If your not? You will still enjoy this game.  If you want to hunt a T-rex by your self good luck with that you need about 2-4 people at least to get one of those down.  Any ways this game is amazing and you should check it out this is one of the best 20$ I've spent in a really long time.  -Shawn SpencerQuestions? Post below.			"

Early Access Review
								Editted 9 MarchSo i played this game for a long while now. I realy like the game and its dinosaurs. Yes they have feathers wich means the developers didnt fall into the jurassic park trap and made all the dino's like the movies. DINOSAURSThe game now has 4 dino's the Tyranosaurus Rex the Triceratops the Utah Raptor wich is the raptor they SHOULD've used in jurassic park and the Velociraptor. I like the modelling of the dino's and the behaviour off them is great. I realy Like the new AI Utahraptors are a lot more dangerous and can instakill if you give them the chance. The Velociraptors are a nice species that is realy hard to see in fiolage and can be a real thread if you are almost out of ammo. It gives a more scary feeling to the game wich is always good.Rexes are smarter too and use their senses more like smell and hearing. So you should keep your distance without the proper ammo.Triceratops should still attack more 1 out of 10 attacks at the moment and this isnt enough I think it should be if you shoot badly it should attack you.GAME OVERALLI like this game a lot, this is the game i was looking for, for about 10 years now. The survival and hunting combo is great. Many people are talking about crafting etc but i dont like this. I like it how it is now but i would like some missions. Maybe some sort of campaign in single player and one seperate for multiplayer. Like bring a package there or hunt these animals maybe give some rexes names like in the logs. ( big chop etc...) Yes i know about the steam achievements but I dont think this will keep me busy. Leveling is nice and if you choose you can buy some ammo or even weapons and camo in the shop but only when you die. I first thought it to be a bit lame but now I understand that it is to give you a headstart and I like it. It means that you still have to loot after you bought things when you run out.PVE or PVPWell i only played PVE and I realy like the fact of hunting together. Only one thing could be added in PVE and thats locked bags so if you die nobody can steal your stuff. For that they need to do PVP.WEAPONSBow - Its the first weapon you get on primal eden. Its not very powerfull so you have to get close range with dinosaurs and aim very well. I wouldnt advice using it on a rex..44 handgun - Nice little handgun for using on the velociraptors and utahraptors although its not strong enough for rex you can kill a trice with it if you aim it right.Shotgun - My second favorite weapon its a very good weapon against all dino's when you learn how to use it. I have killed many rexes with it close range and against large utah raptor packs its realy the only option to get out off it alive. It has 2 kinds of bullets Buck wich spreads and Slug wich is a large solid bullet i leave it up to you to find out wich is best for what..308 Marksman Rifle - My favorite weapon I use it for all dino's although its very very hard to kill a rex with it because a rex doesnt take much damage from it long range. I think this is unrealistic though and if it becomes more powerfull over long ranges I would use it against rexes aswell.Oh yeah and it has a scope maybe thats why I like it so much :)..700 Dual Barrel Rifle - It is the strongest weapon available in the game but weirdly I dont like it very much. It is a heavy rifle and it can kill a rex in 1 - 4 shots if aimed properly.Because you have limited inventory space you can only take 2 big weapons and 1 little weapon. I choose the shotgun and .308 every single time so I can cary enough ammo for both.DEVELOPERSWel i heard some horror story's about developers before. (ehum stomping lands...) But i think we can trust this lot, they always answer when they can and they keep fixing bugs and adding stuff.I realy like what im seeing here keep it up ;).CONCLUSIONFor an early acces game i can only say its great. The developers keep bussy. Its a nice sometimes even enslaving game. If you add ingame missions for me and my mates I would be more than happy.If I have to give this game a grade I would give it 8 out of 10 maybe it gets to 10 out of 10 when its ready ;).I would recomment this game to people who like hunting games or shooting games where you have to sneak a lot. And ofcourse people who like dino's. But its not a silly game in wich you cant die by casual playing so keep that in mind.			"

												Short version: Do not buy this game.Long version: If you're looking for a good Dinosaur hunting game. This is not it. If your looking for a DayZ style survival game where you spend every moment wondering if that sound you heard was a carnivourous dinosaur about to eat you right from the moment you start with next to nothing to defend yourself. Only to have this happen over and over again. Then fine, this game is perfect for the person with the greatest amount of peaceful zen known to all man kind. This game could make a buddhist monk throw a laptop in anger. It's♥♥♥♥♥♥ and nothing like the good old Dino hunting games I played in the past known as the ""Carnovour"" series. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivores_%28series%29The ""Carnivour"" series is the kind of game we need. Given that this game contained the name of ""theHunter"" I expected as much. I was greatly dissapointed.			"

								To be honest, I can't compare it to DayZ and/or Rust because it falls into a different category of survival. There is no crafting, hunger etc. (thank god). It gets it's map design concepts from previous dinosaur games such as Turok and Jurassic: The hunted and improves upon them greatly. You can get lost in the atmosphere and your imagination can run rampant. Was that a dinosaur I just heard? Or was my imagination playing tricks on me again? The Pros:Tense and Foreboding atmosphereOutstanding map designAmazing SoundtrackNo in-game purchases Smart A.I.MultiplayerThe Cons: Multiplayer is buggy (It's early access, what did you expect?)Only 3 dinosaurs to hunt currentlyWalking is a little slowA.I. pathing is weird around certain obstaclesI only played a few hours so far in singleplayer and already I have had my fair share of memorable moments. I defiantly have high hopes for this game so far. I highly recommend this game if you want to play a serious dinosaur survival game. "

												CONS: You have to work really hard to be able to buy weapons, as you start the game with nothing. Once you  buy them, you only keep them for one game session. After that, they will not spawn in your pod, but rather some distance away maybe easy to get to, maybe not.. The game is also very slow pace. Running and sometimes even walking is out of the question: you will probably lure something hostile and die unless you sneak.Also, don't be surprised if you lose everything because of the game crashing or losing connection to the server. The player is treated as if they died and never recovered the gear, so you will lose everything if you lose connection.PROS: Know that this game is difficult and is sort of unorthodox in some ways, like how weapons are spawned and that you start with nothing. Pretty much everything about the environment is hostile, even the plants poison you. If you want just a hunting game, I would suggest theHunter rather than theHunter Primal.That being said, this game is very good. It is beleivable, yet not overly complex, so the behavior of the predators and how to use the environment become predictable with practice. This is really not so much a hunting game, especially if being played solo, but rather a survival game. Once you're able to buy or find an arsenal of powerful weapons you can finally begin to act like a top predator. Most of the begining hours will be spent finding weapons and killing smaller game. Run from the T Rex until you know you can kill it. Honestly, you can easily be killed by almost all of the dinos, even the flying ones, which look so mediocre.			"

I for one find it pretty difficult however that is a good thing it is definitely more fun with friends hiding from the dinosaurs with friends has been more fun than actually hunting them :3 In my personal opinion I do wish this game would have more and hopefully one day it will but still I recommend it 200+ hours and still loving it.

								I've played this game for a few days now, and wow! Such an immersive world. It is frigthening as all heck, it is intense as you won't belive, yet so addictive. There are still few issues with the game here and there, but the shear beauty of the game more than makes up for it. Now, lets list some pros and cons:Pros:1) Gorgeous scenery and good graphics2) Cool weapons3) 10/10 Audio is unbelievable. You will poo your pants the first time the screen shakes and you hear the t-rex stomping!4) Supports multiplayer and is extremely fun to play with friends5) The dinos looks so amazing6) Giant world to exploreCons:1) The dinosaurs can act a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at times, they don't really behave as you would expect2) If you crouch or lie still, the dinos will still find and kill you. There is no way to not die if spotted by one3) Messy inventory aka. no way to ""mash"" ammo together. It just takes up unnessecary space4) Camoflage does not really work as you would expectIf I had the chance to make any changes in the game as is, I would make the dinosaurs behavoiur a bit more ""predictable"" and realistic in terms of what you would expect to happen if you were either walking very quiet or lying perfectly still. It can be extremely annoying at times when you spot a dino 200 meters away, lie still, and somehow the thing still manages to track you down and eat you for lunch.All in all I really do recommend this game to pretty much any one.

								If you enjoyed TheHunter and wished you could have an opportunity to hunt dinosaurs with more of a suspense/horror feel to it- this may be the game your looking for. Its got five weapons as of this point in development- Bow, pistol, shotgun with slugs or buckshot, 308 rifle, and the .700 double rifle. Your prey are raptors, tricerotops, and Tyranosaurrus Rex. The game starts off very punishing as you discover alot of your movements only work to aid raptors and rexes to find you. But you get used to how everything works and soon your getting the first attacks in and eventually rounding up the troops and getting revenge on the rex that just ate you.Seeing a rex lower its head and widen its stance to get ready to charge is downright horrifying. The stomping around as it gets closer and eventually shakes the screen with screams puts you into the scenerio of being the prey for once. Raptors have calls that you will learn as well. They have different vocalisations for when they hear you, when they spot you, and even then they plan on lunging at you.There are some downers about the game though becuase its still early in development. It crashes alot still, often times at clutch moments right before a big takedown, or after you die, when you drop items, or during a trophy shot. Hosting a game requires you to open ports and thats annoying for many. I still find that this game is highly addicting and worth playing. I have no doubt in my mind that many of the issues will be ironed out before its formal release. I do love this game and I've been playing it non stop. I recommend this game whole-heartedly.			"

												A couple of days ago I would have gave this a thumbs up and said ""This is by far one of the better early access games"". Then they decided to throw the flying dino in the game (which is broken overpowered) and apparently decided to up the spawns on other dinos. At least from what i've seen today. I'm not sure if the developers got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at the guy giving them the deadline and said ""fine, lets jack this #### up and give them the release they want"" or if they are actually that incompetent as to what players want in a game. At any rate, unless they either do a rollback patch or fix the current state of the game it's essentially unplayable. Unless you enjoy dying every few minutes. You may make it 15 minutes with EXTREME caution and a lucky spawn. Good luck killing anything of value though.			"

												This game had so much potential during early access. SOOO MUCH. This could've been game of the year (being generous). But like most every other game creators and developers out there, they just want your money. I got this during early access thinking it was going to be some awesome game with tons of dino's, and gun's. Also the thought of building a fort or post, to hunt from, and keep my guns, sounded awesome as most people thought. This game had SOO much going for it. And then it was released and the only thing we got out of all the ideas, us players have been showering the developers with, was a flying dino. Thats it. Just 1 dino. I was in shock. But then i thought wait. They just want your money.  So, bottom line, if you want a buggy, laggy (sometimes), crappy (via multiplayer) game that lets you hunt only 5 dinos then by all means waste your hard earned money on this. However if your a smart, hardworking individual then dont buy this game. Trust me			"

												I recommend this game even with the massive amounts of negative reviews. Yes the Quetzalcoatlus is way to OP, it needs some work but it was released YESTERDAY.... they already have an update stating they have some tweaking to do with it. This game is meant for people who want to spend time HUNTING, not slaughtering dinosaurs. Yes the flying dinos are a huge pain but they are avoidable, stay to the forest, if the Triceratops you have been tracking for the last hour crosses a very large field you have to consider the risk...(Do I really want to cross open ground? Can I make it to the trees before that Quetzalcoatlus circles back around into swooping range?). There is alot of excitement in being able to take my time and get a vital shot on my target (and knowing you have to make the shot count because you can't wound it and let it run into the plains.) Just blasting the dino full of holes and chasing it across the country hoping it bleeds to death is not hunting...			"

								This game is amazing ,atmospheric , light and shade in its ambiance with pretty fluttering insect life,and there's the Dinosaurs !!PVE and PVP , yup you can kill other players , hunt em down and kill em!Yes a glitchy bug ridden experiance , but that said, your paying for early access and all that entails.it can be a very hard game if you dont follow certain principles , ie stealth ,camoflage, spotting ,staying away from the top of cliff faces =Phowever its made easier and more efficiant as you can team up in groups and hunt in a pack , or you may prefer to hunt solo , there's a quick learning curve in staying alive in playing solo.The guns are great , they look and sound awsome, sometimes echoing around the vast landscape , and it is VAST with teasing out of reach islands begging to be explored , there is no swim mechanic implemented as of yet , so there's a fair bit of speculation knocking around ,so thats healthy i'd guess?.I have played since its release , and the development team do inform the community and patch reasonably often,and there is an ingame option for feedback directly to them , This game / simulator if reached to the expectancy i personally think is deserved will be a legend amongst any hunting title.In my humble opinion its very far from complete and i cannot imagine it will be ready by release date.So if you want to treat yourself , BUY THIS !!Its scarey and beautiful massive and immersive.

								tldr; I'm recommending this game, but only if you're a fan of Avalanche Studio's other hunting sim, theHunter, and games with roguelike death mechanics, like DayZ or Dark Souls, and only if you'd like to support the development of the game. It's at a point that I would consider very early development.After only playing this game for a little over an hour, I can say it's extremely challenging in it's current form. If you're adverse to dying a lot early on in a game, then this isn't for you. Unlike in theHunter, everything in these hunting grounds is in reality hunting you, and it's your job to avoid them as best you can, at least until you can get a better weapon than the crappy bow you start with.When you first spawn, you're presented with the all too familiar tracking/GPS tool you use in theHunter. In this it's called the Settlersmate, the premise of the game being you're a convict, banished to an island on a planet called Primal Eden, and tasked with ""cleaning up"" the island of it's wild life. In front of you is what appears to be the pod you are dropped onto the planet in. It contains an improvised bow, 10 arrows and a map fragment. That's your starting kit, but don't expect to be taking down a lot with it. It does very little to most of the inhabitants of this paradise, other than to serve to♥♥♥♥♥♥them off. The map fragment uncovers a small, random portion of the map, which is mostly blanketed by a 'fog of war'.From then on, you're pretty much on your own to roam around the map. Keep a sharp eye on your Settlersmate, because there are supply crates that can contain ammunition, possibly weapons (although I've only ever found the starter bows), and occasionally new items of clothing scattered about, and a few POIs you can stumble across that usually have loot crates, and even a little bit of lore.If you're unlucky enough to come across any dino activity, it works pretty much the same as in theHunter. You get an audible queue from your Settlersmate and you can left click to analyze the sound or track marks.This game mixes the hunting simulation of theHunter with roguelike elements of games akin to DayZ (if the zombies were gaint eating machines that can run at 30mph). You die, you respawn in a random location on the map (which looks to be quite enormous), with the starter kit.Pros:Extremely large map (although right now seems mostly empty of POIs)Uses a proven game engine, so the graphics are decent for such a lite client.Uses theHunter's tracking system.Great audio queues.Cons:Dinosaur AI can be quite derpy. The first dino I encountered was a T-rex, and after circling a wooden structure to avoid it, it seemed to become stuck in stuck on it. Dinos also seem to have some kind of 6th sense, and almost always wander straight towards you when you get within a certain distance of them.The starter gear seems woefully inadequate. If you're very lucky, you can kill a utahraptor with 1 or 2 arrows, but the 2 to 3 other 'raptors in the pack will kill you, and forget about even denting a T-rex, I plugged 1 with about 30 arrows in the head, it was seriously a pin cushion, and it did little more than♥♥♥♥♥♥it off.I only encountered 2 dinosaur species. I've read there's only 3 in the game.Extreme levels of challenge makes this a game not everyone will like, but if you're a fan of Avalanche's other hunting sim, you might enjoy the reversal of roles.

												Another game that had great potential but failed to deliver.Graphics are great, that's about it.Plagued by bugs that ruin the experience, I mean, when a T-Rex gets stuck on stone or roots and you can stand there punching it 100 times with bare fists until it dies where is the sense of danger?Unfortunately the above happens more often than one would expect coupled with other glitches such as waves in the middle of land is more than I can put up with, no point playing anymore.

Early Access Review
								Considering the price, this is the best game I've ever bought on Early Access. It's got a great living ecosystem, well-functioning cooperative and competitive play, and a massive world. My only complaint is the constant pauses in gameplay due to players losing connection to a server (like if their internet goes off, for example). These pauses last no longer than 13 seconds but still can be rather frustrating. The problem is easily solved though by making your own server and ensuring everyone has a stable ping.			"

												This game needed another 6 months at least in the alpha stage. It didn't even go to beta, just straight to full release with another $10 slapped onto it. Clearly the devs don't care about this one and couldnt be ♥♥♥♥ed progressing with this game any more. It could be so much more, in its current state it is unplayable. The new flying chicken will make sure your average survival time is about 2 minuets. There still are ♥♥♥♥ tons of bugs to sort out and the gameplay mechanics are minnimal for a ""full release"". This is honestly not worth the buy. Do not buy this game.			"

												I have recommended and gifted this game to others. I love this game. the only things I have issues with is weapons useage is kinda clumsy as you have to raise and lower weapon with a command instead of being in the ready. It seems at times the T REX is broken because you shoot at it and it charges then stops like it can not find you. Other than that this is my top game.			"

Early Access Review
								Editado 15/05/2016:La verdad ya no vale la pena casi este juego, muchos bugs sin solucion, los desarrolladores no dan la cara, y si aparecen solo es cada 6 meses si es que sacan alguna actualizacion inservible que ademas deja otros bugs.No han corregido bugs pequeños como un logro que esta malo desde hace mas de 1 año, un bug con el visor de la 308 que esta hace 6 meses, entre otros.El AI de los dinos es muy predecible, incluso los Trex no causan mayor problema, la diferencia es que ahora el triceratops tambien te ataca casi sin motivo.No quieren agregar mas dinos, no quieren corregir los bugs, no quieren agregar dlc, no quieren agregar otra isla, no quieren llevar el juego hacia delante, no quieren hacer nada.Mas alla de todo sigo jugandolo porque me parece uno de los mejores juegos de caza con dinos.De cualquier manera, no lo recomiendo mas.Game is not worth anymore, lots of bugs unfixed, devs fade away, and if they show up its only every 6 months with some update for a lil fix that only breaks the game even more.They never fixed lil bugs like an achieve, wich its bugged since EA, another bug with the scope that its broken since like 1 year ago.Dinos AI its predictible, even Rexes doesnt cause major issues, only difference its that now trics attack u without reason.They dont want to add more dinos, dont want to fix the bugs, dont want to add dlc, dont want to add a new island, dont want this game to go further, they dont want to do anythin with it.I still play it cause i found it one of the best hunt sim with dinos out there. Anyways, i wont recommend this game anymore.3/10			"

												theHunter:Primal is a better game if you can find some cool people to team with on a multiplayer server. Working together makes the game easier and stories, such as rescue missions for other players, regularly occur which adds depth. I wish the developers would add more different types of dinosaurs but I doubt they will. This should be said about all Early Access games but... don't buy it unless you're happy paying for the game in its current state.			"

You become immersed in the scenery, the texture, the raw beauty.The number of critters  inclined to eat you increase with experience gained.  Like Doom, the shotgun is your friend!!  Buy the ax as soon as eligible, as it works much better against the rapters than the saber.  The sounds and actions of the critters are realistic.  Just Surperb!! "

												This game needs to go back to early access, because it is not even somewhat close to finished.My reasons...1. the most  ""realistic"" aspect of the game is the fact that you die. (you still respawn)2. the A.I. in the game is predictable, and no matter what the dinosaurs always know where you are.3. the machete that you start with needs to either be less wasteful of the stamina or have higher damage, because it sucks4. the fact that you have to either spend 30mins-2hours playing just to find a decent weapon or buy one from the shop but you can't because the dinosaurs are too tough to kill with your starting weapon so you can't rank up.I hope that this is an April Fool's joke. Otherwise this game has just turned into a developer cashgrab.			"

												theHuntter Primal takes a lot of patience to play. I've been playing this for awhile now and besides the occonasional crash this game has some great potential. ""The dinosaurs get stuck"" they RARELY get stuck when I start the game. Besides, when they do get stuck, you can easily kill them. The game runs smoothly on my computer. The reason the frame rate is so bad is probably the computer you're using! The""Dinosaurs on impossible to kill"" yes they are. I've killed utahraptors, velociraptors, triceratops, and even a T-rex and a Quetzalcoatlus! You can actually kill the dinos!""The dinosaurs never suprise you"" YES THEY DO!!! I was looking for a Quetzalcoatlus and couldn't find him. Next thing I knew I was in the air.""Walking simulator 2015"" the game is in prehistoric times. Plus, it's on an abondoned planet that hasn't been colonized. Would you really expect there to be vehicles? I'm not complaing. This is supposed to be related to The Hunter. In that game, you used to NO vehicles. If you use any vehicles you would most likely get outnumbered by dino's very quickly. This isn't a fighting game. This is a game that supposed to be on STEALTH.

								First, i would like to clearly state that this is from day one launch on early accessproblems? tons.specifics? game crashes alot, servers all suck, very hard to find and get to people, even harder to survive, find ammo but no weapons so on and so forthSo is there anything good about it?YES!the atmosphere of being alone and helpless is terrific! defiantly on par with some of the best horror games ive played. You are literally thrown into an unkown place with a bow and arrow, crappy weapons basicly.It is visually stunning. You will be looking around in wonder, to have your arm ripped off by a rex.And the feeling of finally reaching somebody is amazing. Made through a entire forest, not sure if any predators were nearby, saw a base, and began to meet up with a fellow comrade at said base, which had guns. Was so happy to finally find somebody AND get weapons!then the game crashed.Like i said, not perfect, yet. I defiantly see a good future for this game			"

												I think this game is a good game, but it has something that needs fixing.The stuff that needs to be fixed are a bunch of bugs and they are:- Dino get stuck in something or just stop moving.- Loose your stuff after u have quitted and then rejoin- Sometimes you will not spawn with a melee weapon (in the pod)- Crashes -etcBut they are not game breaking bugs imo, but they can be a bit annoying sometimes.But anyway...The game has a good environment to go around, good sound and gameplay. but i wish the devs could have given us more maps to hunt on and  also new dinos cuz it can be boring after you have played this game for a while. But anyway do i recommend this game?Answer: If you have played one of the hunter games before and like to hunt after dinos and can handle a few bugs...then yes.If not....just wait for the game to be on sale and try it out.also keep in mind that this game might or might not be your kind of game.

												I got this game in a Bundle thinking it would be a really good game to play with my friends, However the gameplay wasn't enough to keep my full attention. it wasn't very exciting to travel less than 20 feet only to be killed by 3 Utahraptors that was the first time i actually played it. right then and there I knew something was wrong with the mechanics of this game. a few things I really didn't like about this game. #1 there is no hip fire when trying to get away from anything you can only aim and fire you cannot move away or even try to escape anything attacking you while trying to fire at it. #2 when you have traveled across the map and you die the map goes blank again like you were never there, unless you can get back to where you died before dying again and again. #3 this is not a single player game it is but it's meant to be played in groups of people the only problem with this is when you play a single player game you travel and so do others and when you join a Multiplayer map people are all over the place you can't ever find them not even your friends. it's a mission just to find anyone on a server. #4 the graphics on this game don't impress me not many settings not many options. #5 and A.I themselves get stuck if one is chasing you and you go up a hill it will get stuck on a rock and stay there allowing you to kill it. it won't go around it wont try to get unstuck it will just stay in that place and keep running. #6 Carry weight you can only carry so much weight and when you have the .700 Double Barrel Rifle it takes up a lot of weight 25% i believe, even though they claim it's the most effective rifle to take down the T-rex finding ammo for this rifle is almost impossible trying to stay alive while finding it is also impossible. Ammo in general is easy to find keeping it is another thing how many shots does it take to kill a T-Rex? everything you shoot at you run out of ammo they charge you kill you with one hit and you start the game over again and again and this gets a little repeitive. I didn't read any of the reviews on this game because I wanted to play it for myself and do my own review.  this game has a lot of potential but it lacks a lot of things that will make it a great Multiplayer game. #7 the glitches are very annoying the crashes are as well, you can't save your progress to keep your map open or to find your way back to the pile of poop to get your Map fragments that the T-Rex pooped out When it ate you. I was hoping for a lot of great things in this game but I only found that the more I played it the more I hated it. #8 the weapons or lack of them. 11 different kinds of weapons but no Machine guns no throwing weapons no explosives no shoulder fired weapons So the very basic weapons to survive the Dinosaur world, if your alone and you fire at one most likely it will kill you. maybe the devs who made this game had godmode and unlimited ammo because I highly doubt they can survive 1 day without it. #9 when you split ammo you lose some of it somehow could be a glitch but it has happened since day 1 and it's annoying. this is one of those games that you should look at watch some video's of it but keep walking. i would have hated to play this game right out of early access and now it's been a while I can see the problems with the game when it was released are still going strong. #10 in a group of 8 people we decided to go through a dense forrest to get to 4 other players who were on the other side Well between us all we had a small Army of weapons none of us made it out because the Velociraptors killed everyone they move faster than you can aim at them they kill you even faster they jump on your face start sucking out your eyeballs and move onto the next hunter when your dead. they are easy to kill but you have to be able to hit them. the game settings keep changing during gameplay if you set your aim at a higher rate and your look at a higher look the first time you encounter anything the game changes your settings so you can't keep up with the movement of the Dinosaurs and that is another reason I hate this game. needing to go back into settings but wait you can't you can only do that before you start the game what a joke. no game settings while in game? 2 Thumbs down on this game. I think ill wait for about a year before playing this title again.			"

												I also received this game in a bundle. I honestly think it was part of a bundlestars bundle.When i received it i rolled my eyes abit, as most of my bundles I get from friends after I pick them up a game or two we kinda buy games for one another to try as a group. I saw the reviews and they seemed absolutely attrocious.Fast forward to playing this game. Asides from your items not saving on your person when the server gets shut down. I really, like the suspense in this game. Sure it's got afew developement glitches and optimization issues that could probably be resolved. So here are some of my pro's and cons.Pro: -Tracker is awesome, as well as your ability to see tracks and the estimated time the tracks were made.-The suspense when hunting a T-Rex is incredible, they don't auto run to you. Instead they sniff you out if your laying down and they've caught your scent.-Raptors will attack you, but if you fight them off they will dip, for self preservation.-Dino's will hunt one another.Cons-Some A.I.'s will occassionally glitch out(story: after two-three hours i fired afew round into a raptor that wasn't moving... i unloaded into it afew more rounds... it didn't die. I walked up to it...nothing)-No graphics settings, what you see when you log in is what you get.-Server's are host-player based and rarely Server, server based.-Zero PVP.All around it's pretty fun. I certainly wouldn't buy it for full price inless improvement's are made. But if you see it on sale or pick it up on a bundle. Try this game. Alot of these reviews are just twelve yearolds spreading the usual internet cancer.			"

												the hunter is a good game mainly cos you have your gear you go hunt, this is far from what i expected, you start with nothing but a machete and will spend hours crawling on your stomach avoiding everything that moves trying to find a weapon which are spread out extremely far the crates you find are random so you will find ammo in most but as of yet no guns when lucky a bow with some arrows get killed lose those level requirements on getting any starter gear any settlements that have MAY have guns usually has a trex and raptors patrolling it yes it says there roaming but they will never leave the settlement, to often i found myself almost falling asleep as i walk for hours on end makin detours to avoid everything i understand dinos are dangerous but come on in the name the hunter : primal doesnt deserve the name the hunter as it is always hunted odds completely stacked against you which would be ok if you had more then a bow and the occassional rock to throw odds would still be in the dinos favour and the game wouldnt seem so boring i never tracked a dino as there was no point i had nothing to kill it with the bow willl give it a slight itch and really bad mood so you will find yourself walking for hours and hours i sometimes perposely died just to switch things up due to boredom its borderline like walking around a dino sanctuary zoo were you would not be aloud to kill dinos in which case id rather watch jurassic park, its 100% survival without the gear to do it even after hours of tedious mind numbingly boring work (yes work its not a game to me if i feel i should be payed to play it) as for gunplay il edit this if i ever happen to find a gun until then il admire the very occassional ammo i find moments before being eaten if you would like a hunting game get ark its far from realistic but you atleast get a fighting chance even if its only a spear that took you 5-10 minutes to make better then walking for hours for a pair of pants sunglasses ammo and a sharp set of trex teeth around your head start over wash rinse repeat if this was fixed id give this game a 10/10 but for now i think il stick to the normal version of the hunter and hope that they will add more predators to that instead so i rate this game a 2/10 great graphics only get you so far it all becomes a blur after holding w for 3 hours  "

												As shown, this review was made April 2015.This is a game about hunting dinosaurs. Most of the negative reviews indicate how hard this game can be. Hunting dinosaur  shouldn't be easy.Just like hunting the real world, you need to make your shots at the game's vitals. If you try to headshot a Triceratops it not going to work. If you patiently sneak up to and make a heart/lung shot with a rifle, you'll likely one shot it.Some other reviews indicate how Quetzalcoatlus, a flying dinosaur are overpowered. The developer has since then made quite a few nerfs towards them. Also, if your good they are easy to oneshot with a shotgun.A few bugs are present, but game breaking ones aren't very common.The developer seems to be continuously updating the game, recently just added quite a few weapons into the game. It looks like the game is going a good direction.			"

Introduction:theHunter is best hunting simulator on steam. And now you can be a hunter on a prehistoric island. What is better than running around in an island with friends hunting T-Rex's and other dinosaurs? This game is a great addition to theHunter series. Being theHunter but with new prey to hunt is great. This game is very well developed, and has quite an active player base with dedicated servers to join friends or other random players. Pros:You can hunt DINOSAURSBeautiful graphics and animationsGood net code for online gameplayProgress/gear can be server transferredGood weapon mechanicsVery large mapCons:Few guns or weapons to choose fromLimited clothes/gear selectionSome dinosaurs seem to take too much damageNo vehicles so get ready to walk/run a lotSometimes repetitive kills of the same typeNo progression system except leveling which doesn't directly give you anythingConclusion:If you enjoy theHunter, theHunter: Primal is great addition to your library. This gives the same great realistic hunting experience but with dinosaurs that chase you. Only if the overall item list was larger and more diverse prey this game would be perfect. If you're looking for a realistic hunting game with a touch of fantasy this a good choice.For more reviews check out  Original Curators Group  "

								If your up for a challenge hunt, then load in by yourself. Its not hard finding the animals.....they will find you. It starts you with a bow and from there you can use it to protect yourself as you branch out to find weapon and supply crates. If you enjoy a difficult play style then this will keep you on the edge of your seat.If you have a few friends who also have this game, a lot of fun can be had. The only issue, is you always have one friend that can talk your group into the worst ideas.....such as all 6 of you trying to take down a t-rex with only bows. Can it be done? I dont know, most of us got ate and the survivors spent quite a bit of time crawling out of the area to regroup. It was a bad idea and we all knew it but it was alot of fun.The people who are reviewing this, saying its too hard, are not skilled players or they have no friends....or both. Just as you do in any hunting game, where you place your shots matter, go for the vital organs or spine. Just keep in mind that the animals your hunting in this game, are not going to get spooked and run away.As of the time I am writing this, I have 12.3 hrs logged and 0 t-rex kills. But I will continue to play and quote Jurassic Park one liners. When a t-rex is charging a buddy, its too hard not to be yelling over the mic, ""Shoot Her, Shoot Her"" or when a friend dies to one 5 min into the game you just gotta say, ""The t-rex doesnt want to be fed, she wants to hunt"" Buy the game and experience what im talking about. Need a hunting buddy, join us on our teamspeak server at: ts.prismgamingnetwork.com "

												This is the best game featuring dinosaurs I've ever played.  The Cretaceaous style world looks and sounds great.  The dinosaurs sound realistic to me, meaning they sound like actual animals instead of movie monsters.  Their behavior seems believable as well.  This is a hunting game and not an all out action game, so patience and thought are required.  There is a minimal storyline that serves it's purpose, but this game is all about your experiences hunting, being hunted, and trying to survive.  This game creates some truly frightening situations.  You really feel like you're being stalked.I think there should have been a couple more herbavore species in the game, because as far as i know, the triceratops is the only plant eater in the game.  The rest are carnivores, which makes it seem less realistc.  The weapons are very scarce.  I'm glad it takes time and effort to get them, but sometimes they seem too hard to come by.  I always play alone, so this problem is probably not so bad in multiplayer, since you can scavenge weapons from dead players.  I would certainly recomend this game to anyone that likes dinosaurs and/or hunting games.  I'm already hoping for a Jurassic themed sequel or add on.      "

												I can see how The Hunter: Primal can be a hit or miss. The game has sub par graphics and many technical problems, so why am i recommending it. 1) The graphics are still good and it is accaptable for an indie game, i call it this because it is a small company. The graphics do not bother me in the slightest.2) The gameplay is difficult but very fun. You must learn where certain dinosaurs roam and avoid the dangerous areas until equiped properly. In many of my encounters i am killed quickly but i learned to avoid dinosaurs until i had looted a gun from a supply box. Tactics and teamwork is essential to playing this game.3) The developers are active and constanlty fixing issues and adding new content to their game.4) Supplies are always limited adding a scare factor to encounters. Inorder to survive you MUST pick your fights wisely, a pack utahraptors may be best avoided than going comando. 5) Each type of dinosaur has a different personality and tactic they employ. You need to learn the behavior of the dinosaur that you are hunting or you will become the hunted.6) Players are typically very helpful and friendly.Overall i would recommend this game to a player who is looking for a game to play on the side. It has many entertaining aspects and the community is very friendly.			"

												Join pvp room.Shot people to death when they were getting chased by a t-rex.10/10 would shot their legs again.However, there are just only 5 dinos and dev has very little update. Not many things you can do, yet. Just hide, run, collect weapons and hunt.The leveling system here allows you to buy weapon ONLY when you're spawning (after died). which is suck. Dev should  add a random drop shop that can buy stuff in limited time.The map is pretty huge, but good items only appear in some certain bases. So players wont go so far to the end of the map just to get a bow.Gameplay will get boring after awhile.But I will still recommend to play this game (only when they have discount, not worth for $30).Still hoping that the devs will continue to update this game frequently.EDIT:Finally some updates for this awesome game. New guns and new boss dinosaur definitely bring me back to this game.However, the devs have not fix the bug and hacking.SHOUT OUT TO PEOPLE WHO GOING TO BUY THIS GAME:1. This is not survival game as your character doesn't have to eat, build or sleep. Just HUNTING.2. New players should join multiplayer room as they could offer help. (Many players are maxed lvl and they are quite friendly)3. Hunting will get bored. Join PvP room for intense fun! (BUT, beware of hackers.)			"

												Ok, well worst dinosaur game on steam 5 dinos to hunt. Can't launch game unless online. Dead community maybe all hunted to death from dinos. Remaining survivors hack, thrash and bash the online gameplay through their cheating and steam does not have VAC to ban these people but don't really blame them because they actually contribute to the community slightly. Optimisations are pretty bad got a GTX 950, 16gb ram ddr4 and i5-6500 but can't run game at maximum 60 fps per second but not too much of a problem. Game should be called walking simulator with occasional micky mouse threats			"

								A M A Z I N G !!!!!So i've played about 2 hours today already, and am completely enthralled with the game. It is a huge beautiful open world (much like thehunter) ya know, with dinosaurs.  despite the massive lush visuals the game runs about as smooth as possible. the game mechanics are all the same as the regular  thehunter so its a very familiar feeling. except it should be called theHunted, because ""oh look at that amazing moon on the horizo...♥♥♥♥♥♥RAPTOR.   dead.""  this is like Arma Z but dinosaurs.  The early access is missing a bunch of stuff of course, the world does feel a little empty with only 3 dinos running around, once they have 7 or 8 it should feel much more filled.  maybe they can add like sabertooth tigers, pterodactyls,  brontosaurases..etc.   very fun though. only disappointing thing for me is you MUST be connected online to play, i don't understand that, i want to just play alone, singleplayer (which you CAN, but need to be connected online). but that is the way things are today. anyway, you should try this out if you like survival games. very challenging, lots of fun, and super...♥♥♥♥♥♥RAPTOR. dead.

												Ok so this game is a 51/49 in my opinion. Like I love to play it with the Utah raptors stalking you as you try to collect gear. But this game has the worst starting areas. I've litteraly killed a raptor following me for like 2km and then a Trex out of no where pops out and bites your head off. I wish they could add making a base and vehicles to make the exploring feel awesome and not having to worry if you can out run a trex. This game is awesome after you've started an hour into the game with a few kills under your belt and a gun but its a hard game to start out in. I love it yet hate it.6/10  If you want the challenge get it. If you hate challenges, why are you reading reviews on this game?			"

												Pros:A pretty big map, nice scenery and settlements, plenty to explore.11 weapons in the game, plenty of weapons to play around with, some powerful, some not.Fun to play with friends.You have to shoot at vital organs on the dinosaurs or end up wasting a lot of ammo, this is a nice accurate addition besides just shooting and the dinosaur dropping no matter where you hit.Raptors hunt in packs, coming from several directions.Dinosaurs make recognizable sounds, alerting you to where they are and depending on how loud the sound is, how far away they are and what they are.Pretty decent A.I, can be buggy at times but still pretty okay on that part.Accurate shooting, holding your breath makes your gun more steady, laying down and crouching do as well.Textures on dinosaurs are pretty nice looking and also vary.Several variants of dinosaurs like rare, uncommon, and common.Dinosaurs have different weights, each dinosaur has a mininum and maxiumum weight, some can be quite a bit smaller than others in that species.The heavier the dinosaur is, the more points you get from it and the more EG(in-game currency) and also the more xp you get from it.In-Game store when you die is a nice feature for getting ammo and new guns, although you need certain levels to get those.Leveling system makes it where you have things to work towards.About 67 achievements, very fun to try and get them all!You can grab rocks off the ground to throw and distract dinosaurs with temporarily allowing more shooting. Cons: Game seems to be abandoned by devs so far, no more updates.A.I is buggy at times for the dinosaurs.Quetzalcoatlus sometimes freezes after you kill it in mid air and finally drops out of the sky in a random location around you.Rexes come straight to you after you shoot them, there is no finding you involved, its just KNOWS where you shot it from and comes to get you, so you have to get several shots in, sometimes not allowing for good shots and leading to ammo waste.Game came out of Early Access before it was ready, making a lot of people annoyed and bringing up the negative review count.Getting your bag back after you die can get annoying if you don't have the money or levels to get guns when you die to escort yourself.Can be a hassle to find more ammo unless you just sit around waiting for camp boxes to respawn, doing this can take a while.Unstrustworthy people can steal your loot after you die if you're not careful when playing on public servers with people you don't know on the game.Items can dissapear from boxes if you split, say, ammo in it, put some in your inventory, close the box and open it again.Can be frustrating for new people and make them quit quicker than they would with a little guidance and help from a trustworthy player who has played for a while.Well that's all I can think of for now.TL:DRAll in all a fun game for a little bit at least, very fun with several friends to play with, fun to take down rexes like this.Decent A.I, some of it still needs work though.Devs pretty much abandoned game so far, so no more updates coming.Plenty of achievements to get.Dino's have different skins.Plenty of weapons to play with, both weak and powerful.In-Game store allows for re-stock when you die.When you play with people you can trust, you die less and have more fun.

												I played this game for about 20 hours now and it seems ok. Every now and then I would encounter a bug such as a flying Utahraptor(or whatever their called) or a wall-clipping T-Rex. This didn't happen often but when it did I lost alot of good stuff and I got quite upset. My final complaint is that the AI in this game are really dumb or really smart and by that I mean sometimes they would spot me from a mile away when im crouching or prone, other times I could walk right in front of them without being spotted. In conclusion when the game is being fair I have alot of fun hunting and tracking dinos. I understand that this game is still in development but some of the problems are killing my gaming experience.[EDIT 1, 4/7/16] I came back to this game after not playing it for awhile and I am glad to see that some issues have been fixed but unfortunately some new issue seemed to have popped up as well. Crate spawns appear to be unbalenced. There are times where I would be walking for a hour without finding a single crate and there are other times where I would find 5 crates in under 7 minutes. I also tried playing multiplayer PVP. I joinded an almost full server and walked around the map for two hours without finding a single person. Until the developers add a way to find and track players quicker I would not reccomend playing PVP. On the other hand PVE seems to be just fine. In PVE you can see other players on the map so it is easier to find people. In conclusion this game has gotton a lot better since my last review but I believe It still needs more work.Pros:-Realistic Dino Tracking-Nice Looking Enviornment(Not The Best Looking But Still Good)-Money/Shop System Works Fine-GPS FeatureCons:-Dinos Sometimes Wall-Clip(Walk/Kill Through Walls)-AI Are Really Dumb or Really Smart-Spawns Are Horrible-Crate Spawns Are UnbalencedGraphics-7.5/10AI-6/10Preformance-9/10Gameplay-7/10Overall I would rate this game a 7.5/10.

								This is pretty much The hunter + dayz + dinosaurs, it kinda works. I been playing more then a few hours.All animals got the same damage model as the normal The Hunter so they will bleed, can be taken out with hearthshot/longshots, the A.I. also acts in a similar manor, with animals fleeing.Might be a bit lacking in the content both weapons, locations and dinos, it had been really nice with some proper landmarks. had some connection issues in multiplayer. But it's been working fine Solo. Most of these things will become less and less of a issue.It's totally a ok game, if you like dayz/hunter style games.			"

												Before you make up your mind about this game due to negative comments or even positive ones hear me out.The game takes on a very slow paced hunting experience where you cannot rush and kill everything so I recomend don't get it if you have terrible patience. the main problem is that the developers gave up... I enjoyed this game so much and hate to give up on it because the developers would rather back other games that they own that ended up being very disliked (The hunter). This game has great potential as many people before me have said but it has not been updated in a very long time so unless I hear something from the developers im gonna keep this review negative. a personel note for the developers: please update this game it has amazing potential but you let it sit there and I personally have been looking for a good hunting game for a very long time and I want it to be this game so please get to it.

												I have been meaning to create a huge, in depth review of this game for quite a while, so I hope it is helpful to some new players that, hearing things said from others, may be a little wary.History of theHunter PrimalThe developers of theHunter and theHunter Primal, Expansive Worlds are constantly involved with educational visits and there is normally at least 2 interns at any time working in the development team alongside the regular, employed developers. The development team have also had lots of requests in the past to add dinosaurs to theHunter and had been interested in doing so in the past before, but they felt it would ruin the realism that many players of the game (a fair amount of which are real hunters). So, behind the scenes they started work on Primal, which was originally given the name 'Project Flintastek' (which according to google translates to 'Flintstones Fry', the developers are Swedish). Project Flintastek also quickly become a program for the interns to work on and quickly became a place where new ideas, gameplay mechanics and... stuff, would be worked on experimentally, after Project Flintastek was starting to look more and more like a complete game, Expansive Worlds decided to make it as a full game and started more serious development on it and thats where we are today.The StoryStory clearly isn't the main focus of theHunter Primal, nor should it be really, this game is about hunting primarily, however it still manages to tell an interesting story, that is, if you are eagle-eyed enough to find the hidden logs and traces left by previous Pioneers and some kind of native inhabitants, or just, really loopy people. The story that we know first off is that you are sent down onto this alien world to kill (hunt) the native inhabitants, which just happen to be very similar to the dinosaurs that we know from our past. If you fail? Your close family will be offered up as pioneers themselves. So, dont fail. Whilst I say that story shouldn't be the main focus of this game, it would be awesome if it were included/integrated more, such as finding an old camera that would then play a cutscene of a settlement being attacked, or something similar. But, yeah, interesting story but sadly most of it is hidden away in log entries of abandoned old settler mates.Upon stepping into the game world for the first time...You will be equipped with nothing but a Machete, some basic clothing and boots as well as a map fragment, which will highlight a random settlement on your map (these are the only places to find weapons). It immediatley hits home the feeling of helplessness as you are stuck on an alien planet, with just a machete to defend yourself. However, if you are just starting out, find a map on the internet and go to a settlement. You are going to need a better gun, I would also reccommend playing only on your own for a while as this will help you get better at the game more than if playing with friends.In the first hour of playing...Within the first hour you will have certainly met your first dinosaurs and hopefully have found your first proper weapon, preferably in reverse order. This is when you will, probably start to get frustrated. This game, you realise, is hard as nails and I will admit, it is very unforgiving for new players to theHunter series or just new players in general. However, if you stick at it like I did and keep trying, you will get the hang of it and start hunting dinosaurs, instead of them hunting you.General Review of the GametheHunter Primal is, and dont get me wrong here, incredibly frustrating, at times very difficult and can, at its very worst feel like a chore, having to go and get your stuff of your dead body whilst avoiding what killed you. But other than that, the game is so, so enjoyable and when you finally start to get the hang of the game and get used to all of the mechanics etc... it is the most rewarding experience I have ever seen in video games, the sheer feeling of joy when you finally kill your first T.Rex or when you track down a wounded Triceratops to find it later, dead from bleeding damage and to claim it as a kill, or when you find ammo for your favourite weapon or just discover new things, these special moments are what makes the game so, so worthwile. It can also be a very eerie and creepy experience, so people who don't want to get their heart racing should probably stay away from this title... it can get so intense when a T.Rex is just metres away from you and you are just lying in the ferns and vegetation, hoping that it wont spot you and that it will just leave already, the way the ground shakes with its footsteps can be downright horrifying.So, to put it rather simply, theHunter Primal can be frustrating, but is an intensley rewarding experience that can both make your heart race with joy, or fear. If you are looking for a survival and building game, you wont quite find that here, despite being classed as a survival game this is a hunting game truly, you won't find crafting here.Quick Reviews of Individual AspectsGraphics - The Graphics in this game are very good and suit the tone of the game well, certain things could be done better, such as the character models and various textures being stretched on some areas of the environment, but this is a good looking game.Gameplay - This game doesn't play like your typical survival shooter and actually takes a while to get used to how to use all of the functions and elements to aid your gameplay. The controls will feel slightly strange at first but you will definitley get used to it. It plays like a more fast-paced version of theHunter, the movement is faster as well as equipping weapons and items, everything is just smoother and more slick looking, so I would certainly reccommend that you go play theHunter if you are not sure about whether you will like this game, the movement etc is the same however the world and animal species are of couse, very different.Updates - The developers have never yet missed a weekly update, except when they went on christmas holiday, which, to be fair, is totally acceptable.Stability -  The game is, admittedly, somewhat plagued by glitches that can hamper (or at times, even enhance your experience) but none of them are of the game breaking variety.The Future of theHunter PrimalEven though the game is 'finished' at the time of writing (11/05/2015 GMT) the developers have not missed a single weekly update (most commonly published on Thursdays) that will always either contain bug fixes, new content or changes and tweaks to the existing game. The developers say that there is no guarantee of new content to be added to the game however the future looks bright. As theHunter Primal has and will continue to be not just a standalone game, but also a place for interns and the developers to test new ideas and mechanics so it is very likely that, maybe not as frequently as we have had new content recently but it is not unreasonable to assume that as things are experimented with that we will see new content in Primal.

Early Access Review
								I played and enjoyed The Hunter although I am not a fan of the subscription pricing. The Hunter: Primal has very similar gameplay mechanics but is very unpolished at this point in time. There is also not very much content. I would definitely recommend holding off on purchasing this game until it gets updated and polished. If you haven't played The Hunter, I would recommend going to their website and downloading the free-to-play game to see if you enjoy the gameplay mechanics before spending any money on The Hunter: Primal.

												If you like dinosaur games, this is one of the best. Although it is a hunting game, and has strong hunting elements such as tracking, score awarded for kills, and certain shots being more deadly than others depending on which vital organs are hit, I get much more of a survival-type game impression. The player must scavage around abandonded settlements to find better weapons, ammo, and clothing, while avoiding roaming dinosaurs and hostile other players. The dinosaur element, despite the variety being small, is very good. Dinosaurs, especially T-Rex, and its stronger Primal cousins, are very good at hunting players down, where the numbers of Utahraptors can be just as dangerous. This game reminds me a lot of a more modern Jurassic Tresspasser, and has the right element of fear when hiding from dangerous dinos and fighting for one's life.			"

												So.. I see that lately the reviews for this game are getting worse and worse... So i'll just say what i think and have experienced myself. Yea.. the game itself has some bugs and issues (such as the dinos glitching) but otherwise it's quite a good game... It's not as bad as people say it is! I mean.. the original theHunter i way worse.. you pay to play and things have durabilities.. while here in theHunter: Primal you just pay once aaand that's it, you don't need to pay anymore for anything ! Items don't have durabilities, every weapon in the game you can either find or collect in-game money and buy (you will also need to level up by killing and collecting things in order to be able to buy stronger weapons) Yes, dinos sometimes get stuck,glitched or dissapear.. sometimes items disappeared from your inv (i think they fixed it though) and it has some bugs but... I still do have hope since they started to update again (although they are small updates) and i think that game itself is about to have a big update some time in the future.. So .. if you think you will enjoy hunting dinos (aaand sometimes having to deal with glitches ofc) you should get this game, i do recommend it.			"

												I like this game, i was not expecting a CoD gameplay nor experience. AND THAT MARKS THIS GAME. This is a hunting game, you track footprints, you listen to sounds, you stay quiet, YOU ARE PATIENT.That is what marks this games, this is its true Experience. Cons: Developer abandoned this game. You get 5 dinossaurs Species (REX, Velociraptor big, velociraptor small, Triceratops & a flying one), each of those with some, where Rex & Raptors have 4 variations each.No such thing as daily objectives, targets, etc. Simply: Survive, Walk, Walk, Walk, Walk, listen.

												in its current state, gotta say nope. pass on it ""FOR NOW"". the game itself is decently solid, with a few minor bugs (hits not registering, clipping issues). but the biggist downfall of this game is the damn flying dino. pretty much no matter were you start out at, there flying above you. you have a improvised sword and bright orange clothing... put two and two together and guess what. your getting a free flight with a 200ft hard landing death. the only thing that can remotly save you is ducking at the right second... untill you have two after you... then three.. and you mid aswell just stand up and get ready to die.  and if your lucky enough to make it to a forested area you might have a chance at actually finding a weapon and kill a few dinos before you forget that your wondering out in the open and you hear swoop and your on your free flight again....

												PRO:++This game has got a great potential!+The screems of the dinosaurs are making it very special and youve got a good feeling of being 200mio. years back in     time.+The map is GIANTIC and very very very very BEAUTIFUL designed. Everything is looking pretty awesome if you are on a hill or something. (I made some screen shots if you want to see)+The Dinosaurs are looking good too and are able to get you into panic after a few second of their appear. :DKONTRA:-- The bugs...yeah there are many bugs and glitches which can save your live and equipment and thats cool but...its still a bug and so not rly nice to play with because it takes away the fun after too many times-I think there have to be more different Dinosaurs like; Stegosaurus, Pteranodon, Archeonitomimus and some water creatures like the Mosasaurus or Liopleurodon. OK mby not the last one, he`s to big at all xDThats was my review, thx for reading and I hope you enjoit it. (If I made some faults in the grammar, I`m sorry)			"

												Honestly the game is extremely broken right now. I don't know why the devs thought it was a good idea to have a save file  that anybody could edit with notepad and give themselves unlimited XP and Tokens to buy weapons. Also the save file doesn't even work correctly because it will not save your level or inventory after you leave the game. The game has decent enough graphics and the gameplay is very similiar to the original theHunter, but the numerous bugs, problems, and game breaking issues ruin it right now. The only way to even get the save file to work is to edit it with notepad, but what is stopping people from giving themselves unlimited XP? You guessed it! Nothing. Another thing is that online multiplayer games lag so bad that a lot of the time players lose connection to the host. This issue seems to get even worse when more players join the server. I have noticed that when the server has 8 or more players, de-sync gets so severe with the animals that they will freeze for a few seconds and then reappear several meters away from their previous position. Imagine the difficulty of shooting at a moving target when this happens. Also, if the host leaves the game, you will lose any progress you made during that match because of the broken save file. If they would simply implement host migration when the host quits the game it would make the game at least half as frustrating as it is. Dedicated servers would be a better alternative, but at this point that is wishful thinking. There are guides on how to fix the save issue but honestly to me it is borderline hacking because you can be a new player and give yourself 1000000 tokens just by editing a save file.I can only recommend this game if you are a die hard theHunter fan and this game is on Steam sale. Casual players, it isn't worth the $10. If you really wanna try it out, be ready to deal with the numerous bugs, random level reseting crashes, and laggy online gameplay.I have also submitted a support request to theHunters support page on their website and one of the developers emailed me that they are aware of the issues and are looking into a fix. When that fix is and what they will do is beyond me. If you are interested in buying this game I would wait a month or two and see if they release any patches first. Fingers crossed.			"

Early Access Review
								Well, those that played ""The Hunter"".. have always imagined a PvP against the other hunters.. here it is.. with the added feature of Dinos!! Not only can you set the 16 player servers to PvP, you will have to outsmart some raptors and T-Rex while hunting some triops.. small bugs in the early access stage but a pretty good looking game from the start!  You have to find items to build up your armament to take on these creatures.. You most likely will start with a longbow found in a pod.. pretty good feel in the game and massive size for the island.  You finally learn why crouching and staying ""quiet"" is an advantage ..  worth the buy in!!  Still..""the best forest"" in any game! if you're thinking of TheHunter: Primal before xmas... good suggestion.. install ""The Hunter"" first thru steam.. then buy The hunter Primal.. you will recieve a free shotgun and 30 days premium in ""The Hunter"".. win win..  give it a shot..primal has PvP as well as Dino hunting.. still ""The best forest"" in any game!! IF you already have a ""The Hunter"" account outside steam.. you have to ""link"" it to the Steam version for teh gifts..easy..easy.. just install the hunter from steam and play it. The first screen that pops up allows you to add the hunter account you had outside of steam right to it.. works like a charm.. after, you can keep the steam version or just disconnect the steam version and go back to playing it thru TheHunter website.. hope this helps.

												They should have kept this game in early access.  For the amount of content and the price, this game is currently not worth getting.  It is fun for a week and that is about it.The only way I find this game to be enjoyable after a week or so is to treat it like a Hunger Games.  The respawn kind of ruins that though.  There needs to be a death area while you wait for everyone else to die.  This game feels like it is stuck between a Hunger Games and Survival type of game.  As of right now I do not recommend this game.			"

								Game by itself is good. Its simple ,you are on an island on alien planet with dinosaurs and you are hunting them.But im taking it as a rewiev of an Early acces of an game and I would like to speak there about some bugs like:When I start the game and join a server I automatically get handgun,bow and one cool gloves that I found about a week ago.When I die I got nothing (you dont say) but when I exit the game and start it again a got those things back WTF (PS: it would be nice if I would get some ammo to those guns also)Another thing that I just hate is changing server=loosing all of your stuff (for me everything except my hangun,bow and gloves)And the last thing is that this game has no lags but a lot of people got crappy internet and it affects game of others. And trust when you are playing on a server about 1 hour and u got a shotgun and other cool stuff then you got really angry when someone has problems with his internet and it crashes whole server so you have to connect again and find all of your cool stuff againAnd the worst but funny thing on this game is Gravity the sudden killer :D6/10 Cool game (T-Rexes are OP)			"

								Overall, and accounting this is in early release/access, it’s a pretty decent game and I really like to play it.Like theHunter, it has great graphics (I love those sunshine/sunsets!) – it’s the same engine :) and really sweet sounds. The t-rex walking sound… is simply superb! And you can imagine that this game will get better and better over time, as EW by this many years doing the theHunter are experts in hunting games.Unlike theHunter, it’s a fast paced game where you will enjoy every minute. Sometimes I got bored in theHunter because I would rush and eventually scared off the animals ending up not seeing one or taking a lot of time to find one. In theHunter: Primal, you don’t have that problem. If you can’t find an animal, they will find you! (and you might regret it… lol). Also, there’s nothing else to pay in the game. In Primal, you just buy the game and that’s it. Everything that’s in game it’s yours and you don’t have to pay for anything else.Complete opinion at http://www.hucorner.com/blog/thehunter-primal-early-access/ "

I take a look at invetory to find a bow and few arrows plus a map chip. The sound was getting closer and 69 raptors rekt me during the first 420 seconds of the game.Day 2Respawned at a location near my deathpoint so i head that way more prepared. Was walking so sprinted for .69 seconds and ran out of stamina for 420 hours. I walked across what seemed to be a lake but i cant swin because im a ♥♥♥♥♥. there was a path on the lake then all of a suden barney cums up behind me with a mighty roar. so i go balls on the walls running for .68 seconds and then im there walking while barney goes balls on me. i turned around and i screamed like ♥♥♥♥♥ and so my mum had to♥♥♥♥♥and see wat happend.

												This game is actually really fun.Regardless of what may or may not be going on with the developers, the game seems to work fine and it has had updates since the devs have supposedly left, so I guess the game is being maintained by ghosts or something.Now then, gameplay.Gameplay is alright, you waddle about as you do in the regular theHunter, it is a shame that you waddle at a painfully slow speed unless you run which you can do for all of 5 seconds every minute or so.You find little boxes filled with gear and there are lots of nasty things out to get you.Sound simple? It is!Staying alive is very difficult because everything kills you.That's a nice pink plant, oh wait no, it's killing me, oh look a herbivore, hello herbivore, oh it killed me that's great.That's pretty much the whole game, there is a level system but I don't ever see myself maxing it out.This means the game can get painfully dull if you don't set yourself objectives, you know the sort of thing, find a certain gun, kill so many of a certain dino, attempt to go up the mountain.But wait there's more!There's multiplayer, now I've only played on non-pvp public servers and it's pretty cool, you'll see a group of people just destroying t-rexes like they're nothing, then you'll see them all get taken down by a triceratops.GraphicsThey're niceThings that I don't likeYou can't swim, you're on an island with rivers and stuff and you can't bloody swim.YOU CAN'T SWIM ON AN ISLAND.IT'S AN ISLAND MATE COME ON THE FASTEST WAY TO GET FROM ONE PENINSULA TO THE OTHER IS BY WATERIT'S NOT EVEN LIKE YOU DROWN YOU JUST STAND NEAR THE WATER ALL CONFUSEDThe freaking not pterodactyl, stupid bird thing that just swoops at you, glitched out looking like it's stood up, absolutely awful to look at.The spawn system, you spawn rougly 60 seconds from where you die, which is good and bad, you die to a raptor that's fine you'll get him, you die to a rex and say goodbye to that server.All in all a decent bit of fun 7/10 actually good.

												DETAILED PROS AND CONS - TL;DR PARTS HAVE THESE THINGS [ ]Pros:- Looks pretty. Really pretty.- Runs on a toaster at 60 frames, even if it says 3 ghz processor my buddy can run it fine on low with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop.- DINOSAURS.- Rewarding when things go to plan.- [Dinosaurs have all of their internal organs mapped out and different weapons will have different effects in the sense that you probably wont penetrate the skull of a T-REX with a bow.]Enemies have lungs,heart,spine,neck, all that good♥♥♥♥♥♥just like all the animals in theHunter and they respond accordingly. If you put holes in a T-REX's intestines, he is going to bleed out very slowly. If you damage it's legs it's going to move slower. The more blood it loses the more it is stunned and once it is really not feeling well it'll likely try to run away to the safety of others T-REX-es.- [Tracking system of theHunter, including the ability to find DINOSAUR♥♥♥♥♥♥ ]Scan tracks with the PDA to get detailed information rather than just looking at them, but if you're a badass following them as they run away in fear (like me) you can just look at it and the finer details of the track are physically able to be seen on the ground (bright red blood for lungs/heart and darker for body). This also includes if the animal is fleeing or just roaming an area, or whatever, just like theHunter.- Dynamic experiences in the game can make for some very memorable moments. A friend and I were in a large open area on a huge volcanic rock formation when we heard raptor sounds on the other side. Suddenly spanned 10 meters apart infront of us, 4 raptors slowly started to walk towards us. We fired, they charged, had an epic showdown where my buddy almost got killed as 2 we did not see earlier decided to flank us hard along our right, which was covered by rocks.  Another time we both managed to stealth our way past a pack of T-REX(es?).- It seems [certain types of dinosaurs inhabit certain types of terrain], a pack of T-REX can be found in a valley and around it for a while, while we encountered many raptors in dense forest (p.s: spooky as ♥♥♥♥)- Variety of terrain, has swamps, valleys, large dark forests, large bright forests, forest clearings, large mountains, volcanic rock stuff, deserted settlements etc.- Map is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing big. And I mean, pretty ♥♥♥♥ing big.- Really nice atmosphere, rebuilt sound system from theHunter to give you a really nice experience with a world that feels alive (can see butterflies and dragonflies and all that♥♥♥♥♥♥ mice on the jungle floor at times).- [Can find datapads with lore and further story of the game found on them, mostly diary entries of characters that had spent their time there before.] Can usually find decent loot here and they're near settlements or camps and♥♥♥♥♥♥- (Opinion) Game isn't meant to be easy and you do have to learn as you play to know how to survive. I managed to get it down quite quickly since you can take from the mechanics of theHunter. It's similar to theHunter except much more rewarding to successfully evade your enemies, since they are essentially hunting you at times when you need to hide.- (Opinion) T-rex likes to nominate you for their space programCONS:- [Dinosaurs DO NOT ATTACK EACHOTHER.] Seriously this one was the worst to find out, big ole triceratops was rushing a T-REX I was hiding near and he just runs right past to have a sip out of the water. Worst ♥♥♥♥ing thing, I was expecting him to go FULL ♥♥♥♥ING BRAWL/BRO MODE. But nah, never happened. Hopefully this gets added in.- [Only FIVE types of dinosaur are in the game right now.] Hopefully they add more but right now they have Utahraptors, T-rex and Triceratops, Velociraptos and the Quetzalcoatlus. - [Not too many weapons in the game, as I've found all of them] (.44 revolver, .700 double rifle, .308 marksman rifle, the 12G pump action, the bow, the machete and the extremely rare .50). Hopefully more come in future.- AI pathfinding can SOMETIMES be a ♥♥♥♥. And by that, I mean the T-rex sees you, you go prone, and it just runs up to you and stands on your body where you can go crouch and fill the ♥♥♥♥er with arrows without it doing♥♥♥♥♥♥ Also utahraptors and velociraptors like to stop and have a smoke sometimes rather than attacking you (this is somewhat fixed but it is still there).- [NO ♥♥♥♥ING VEHICLES]. While I don't really mind that much since I played many hours of numerous walking simulators and sleeping games (modded arma 2, dayz, breaking point, EVE online) I'm probably going to get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at some point that I don't have some sort of lame vehicle or something. Let me ride a Triceratops, devs. Let me be a dino-rider and relive childhood. That'd be so ♥♥♥♥in' baller.- (Opinion) Not really a big one, I like hunting and all, but after the first encounter where you find out that most times raptors have the common courtesy of letting you know they're there before attacking, alot of the horror element subsides. This might be just me not being afraid of things because I'm a STONK HAIRY MAN and if you're a little ♥♥♥♥♥ (that's okay, some of us are) you might always see horror in this game aside from the first encounter.Now, I know tips are more of a guide thing but I honestly can't be ♥♥♥♥ed making a guide, I'm the god of hunting dinosaurs (not really) and I have better♥♥♥♥♥♥to do than write a guide. Still, I want to help so take these tips and don't quit early.TIPS:- DINOSAURS ARE TOUGH ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S. DO NOT FIGHT T-REXs ALONE WITHOUT LOTS OF AMMO AND A GOOD VANTAGE POINT. DO NOT FIGHT TREXs WITH FRIENDS WITHOUT LOTS OF AMMO AND A GOOD VANTAGE POINT. 6000 KG OF SCALE ARMOUR AND REPTILE♥♥♥♥♥♥ DON'T DO IT.  Fight raptors all you like though. If you manage to spot them first and you want to fight, see how many there are. With starting gear and not much experience you could probably take down one, then once you know where their weak spot is at the front take on more and more, depending on how capable you are with aiming. - In regards to the last tip, fighting them is the best way to learn how to kill them. If you manage to bring any dinosaur down and he's alone, take a screenshot of the kill page and look for vital spots to try shoot at next time. Be careful, raptors are rarely alone. - Use stealth. It's the only way you'll survive to find a shiny rifle and ammo, aswell as some camo clothes and all that dandy♥♥♥♥♥♥ You'll learn more about dinosaur behavior that way.- Always assume that the highest % guess of health from blood sprays is what the dinosaur has. A friend of mine was tracking a T-REX for quite some time, thinking it had basically none left but it had a high end scale % he didn't quite take into account.- This game is not supposed to be easy. I mean it is for me, because I'm so cool, but if  you're a quitter, you shouldn't buy into this game. It will take time to know what you're doing unless you have a friend guiding you that knows whats up. The challenge is what makes the game rewarding, and thats what I really really love about this game.Anything you want me to address let me know, will update review as the game is updated.			"

												This game I see has got alot of negativity, mostly from those who havent played the game more than a few hours and rage quit after getting killed a few times. There is no doubt that this game takes a while to get used to, even I used to get extremely frustrated at not being able to locate settlements with weapons. But once you start to learn thestructure of the map and the mechanics of the game, and you start to learn new skills and stratagies, this is an extremely fun and exiting game to play solo and with friends. The concept of theHunter: Primal is great, the graphics and enviroment is breathtaking and overall this game truly does deserve more attention. I highly reccomend this game to anyone who loves survival, dinosaurs, action and of course having a great time.For those who are just starting out, here are some useful tips:Survival: The Hunter Primal is all about killing dinosaurs, finding gear and most importantly, survival. You may find the best gear but if you don’t know how to survive and keep it, it’s pointless. If you come across a dinosaur that you are not equipped to fight, you must hide. The best way to stay undetected is by crouching instead of walking if you hear something, and lying in thick bushes if something gets too close… Around the map, you can find health canisters which you can use if you are struggling for health. So if you have one and you need it, don’t save it, use it! When you come across a cliff or steep drop, you should never take the chance of just walking off to get where you want to go, you will most likely just fall to your death…  Killing Dinosaurs: Utahraptors: To kill these vicious beasts, it’s all about hitting them in the heart. You can hit them as many times as you like anywhere else and pretty much nothing will happen. To hit their heart, you must hit them directly in the front center of the body. Hits such as in the back of the spine or in the lungs (which are in the center of the side body) are effective too. It is recommended to use a weapon such as a pistol or shotgun against these. Velociraptors: These turkey sized predators can really mow you down if you are not careful, there is no set way to kill these, all you have to do it hit them and they will die… Using a machete or axe is by far the best option when fighting these things, although be prepared as they can come in packs of up to 12… Tyrannosaurus Rex: I reccomend NOT attacking this alone! You should always bring a friend along. (by playing online) If you choose to take on one, be sure to bring powerful guns and plenty of ammo. You need guns with at least the power of a 308 Rifle but a 700 Rifle or .50 Cal is recommended. When firing at this beast, you want to be hitting the heart which is located in-between its small arms. Triceratops: When taking on a Triceratops, you need to have a decent weapon with plenty of ammo, it is unlikely to attack you but you never know. When trying to hit it, go for the lungs, spine and heart. It is recommended to use a 700 Rifle or a 308 Rifle with plenty of ammo.Quetzalcoatlus:This flying dino can be annoying considering it can be hard to hit, the best way to take one down, is to shoot at its body as it attacks by swooping down on you. They are quite fragile creatures and can be taken down with as little as two hits from almost any gun. Settlements & Gear: Finding Settlements: It may seem hart at first, but finding settlements is very easy. When you start the game, you will get a “Map fragment” when you use that, you will be revealed a settlement on the map, all you have to fo is set a waypoint there by going on the map and clicking a point and go for it! Finding Weapons/Ammo: Weapons and ammo spawn at places called ""settlements"" these are marked by little symbols on your map. The best place to go is the settlement at the top of the volcano in the center of the map. This is the ony place you can find the .50 cal rifle, however it is still extremely rare. At this settlement you are likley to find shotguns and good camoflauge equipment.			"

												I like this game. I liked The Hunter a great deal too.I'd love to see more dinosaurs added, especially without feathers. Dino's in drag are not my thing. Especially since feathers are made from eniterly different protiens than ever found in any reptiles or amphipians. Something that coflicts with current daydreams/theory so is left out of the textbooks...Very vast, diverse and well rerndered enviroment. Drop dead beutiful scenery and FX. excelent framerates.I highly reccomend.			"

												Day 1Started up game expecting a Jurassic Park survival like feel/hunting dinos like in the hunter game.Spawned near a drop pod and noticed my settings needed to be changed. Opened up settings to turn sensitvity to 100% and change my sprint key to shift. Saved changes and i hear a sound of a Bongo-African Swallow. I take a look at invetory to find a bow and few arrows plus a map chip. The sound was getting closer and 69 raptors rekt me during the first 420 seconds of the game.Day 2Respawned at a location near my deathpoint so i head that way more prepared. Was walking so sprinted for .69 seconds and ran out of stamina for 420 hours. I walked across what seemed to be a lake but i cant swin because im a ♥♥♥♥♥. there was a path on the lake then all of a suden barney cums up behind me with a mighty roar. so i go balls on the walls running for .68 seconds and then im there walking while barney goes balls on me. i turned around and i screamed like ♥♥♥♥♥ and so my mum had to♥♥♥♥♥and see wat happend.

												Well, people seem to complain to no end in their reviews about bugs and that devs do not release new content. Take a look at how long I played this game, I haven't noticed any bugs but it is true that the devs abandoned the game a long time ago. I think what people are actually angry about is NOT the quality of Primal itself but the fact that devs simply left it even when it has a lot of potential!It was made by the devs of 'theHunter' as a side project and was as far as I know not even meant to be an openly available product on steam but rather something the devs made internally as a joke which eventually turned into an actual game. I don't play it much anymore nowadays but still have it installed on my hard drive, cause it is really an excellent game as long as you are fine with nothing more than walking around on an island with dinosaurs! Nothing more, nothing less. If you are the type of guy who expects more from a game like this I suggest to simply don't buy it. Atmosphere and sounds are amazing and the people I met online were all quite nice. It is perfectly fine for one or two hours every once in a while but nothing for serious gamers which expect to squeeze daily 8 hour gaming sessions out of it.See Primal like a snack you have during the day, not the main course..

												After being eaten through trees, stood on top of by triceratops', and spawning directly next to tyrannosaurs I am done with this game.Calling this a survival game is laughable at best. There is no crafting, there is no real permanent shelter or objective. You walk, crawl, and run around hoping that the buggy glitchy dinosaurs dont ignore the multiple shotgun slugs to their heads and kill you. The newest addition, quetzocoatalus, is the biggest annoyance of all. Spent HOURS collecting items, guns, and ammunition? Too bad. death from above one hit killer.Utahraptor, velociraptor, tyrannosaurus, quetzocoatalus, and triceratops are the only other living things in this game. Its a little pathetic that in 2015 a game developer has only 5 dinosaurs in their DINOSAUR HUNTING GAME.Saying this is release worthy is embarassing to the devs, and insulting to everyone who paid for early access. If I could return this piece, I would. Don't waste your money on it.			"

												The idea of this game sounded amazing, and as I really liked the original The Hunter, I didn't hesitated to buy this one. However, after like 2 hours, I already died too much. Most of the time, I'm grabed by those flying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s (Quetza), then released to fall in the ground, dead. Also been killed twice by T-Rex, even if I moved like a ninja.The fact is it's too hard to play with those flying beasts. I can live with T-rex and other. Already been able to kill several ones. But Quetza are really cheated. Wasted a lot of money on stuff, to no avail, lost it all after been killed. Just avoid this game until the difficulty has been ajusted.			"

Early Access Review
								Good game so far. I say since were still in early access and there are definitely going to be tons of more updates it is well worth my 20 dollars. Good and BadsBad first, -Very very very very low stamina bar. There is no way in hell a person can run for such a short time and have to wait so long for the bar to replenish. If I'm being chased, pls lord I need to book it. -For now raptors and t-rex and triceratops are fine but I'm hoping for more breeds to mess around with. God forbid I will one day get snatched by a pterodactyl out of nowhere.-Glitchy dinos but that can't be helped. I'm too busy runnin-Maybe an easier way to connect multiplayer? I was having trouble before but im sure it'd be simple, but hey lets make it even more simple???Good-Stunning Visuals-Stunning Audio-Shooot, everything else I'm pretty much enjoying.Looking forward to the progression with this game and I hope it goes far.

I highly reccomend this game to anyone who loves survival, dinosaurs, action and of course having a great time.For those who are just starting out, here are some useful tips:Survival: The Hunter Primal is all about killing dinosaurs, finding gear and most importantly, survival. You may find the best gear but if you don’t know how to survive and keep it, it’s pointless. If you come across a dinosaur that you are not equipped to fight, you must hide. The best way to stay undetected is by crouching instead of walking if you hear something, and lying in thick bushes if something gets too close… Around the map, you can find health canisters which you can use if you are struggling for health. So if you have one and you need it, don’t save it, use it! When you come across a cliff or steep drop, you should never take the chance of just walking off to get where you want to go, you will most likely just fall to your death…  Killing Dinosaurs: Utahraptors: To kill these vicious beasts, it’s all about hitting them in the heart. You can hit them as many times as you like anywhere else and pretty much nothing will happen. To hit their heart, you must hit them directly in the front center of the body. Hits such as in the back of the spine or in the lungs (which are in the center of the side body) are effective too. It is recommended to use a weapon such as a pistol or shotgun against these. Velociraptors: These turkey sized predators can really mow you down if you are not careful, there is no set way to kill these, all you have to do it hit them and they will die… Using a machete or axe is by far the best option when fighting these things, although be prepared as they can come in packs of up to 12… Tyrannosaurus Rex: I reccomend NOT attacking this alone! You should always bring a friend along. (by playing online) If you choose to take on one, be sure to bring powerful guns and plenty of ammo. You need guns with at least the power of a 308 Rifle but a 700 Rifle or .50 Cal is recommended. When firing at this beast, you want to be hitting the heart which is located in-between its small arms. Triceratops: When taking on a Triceratops, you need to have a decent weapon with plenty of ammo, it is unlikely to attack you but you never know. When trying to hit it, go for the lungs, spine and heart. It is recommended to use a 700 Rifle or a 308 Rifle with plenty of ammo.Quetzalcoatlus:This flying dino can be annoying considering it can be hard to hit, the best way to take one down, is to shoot at its body as it attacks by swooping down on you. They are quite fragile creatures and can be taken down with as little as two hits from almost any gun. Settlements & Gear: Finding Settlements: It may seem hart at first, but finding settlements is very easy. When you start the game, you will get a “Map fragment” when you use that, you will be revealed a settlement on the map, all you have to fo is set a waypoint there by going on the map and clicking a point and go for it! Finding Weapons/Ammo: Weapons and ammo spawn at places called ""settlements"" these are marked by little symbols on your map. The best place to go is the settlement at the top of the volcano in the center of the map. This is the ony place you can find the .50 cal rifle, however it is still extremely rare. At this settlement you are likley to find shotguns and good camoflauge equipment.			"

												Well, people seem to complain to no end in their reviews about bugs and that devs do not release new content. Take a look at how long I played this game, I haven't noticed any bugs but it is true that the devs abandoned the game a long time ago. I think what people are actually angry about is NOT the quality of Primal itself but the fact that devs simply left it even when it has a lot of potential!It was made by the devs of 'theHunter' as a side project and was as far as I know not even meant to be an openly available product on steam but rather something the devs made internally as a joke which eventually turned into an actual game. I don't play it much anymore nowadays but still have it installed on my hard drive, cause it is really an excellent game as long as you are fine with nothing more than walking around on an island with dinosaurs! Nothing more, nothing less. If you are the type of guy who expects more from a game like this I suggest to simply don't buy it. Atmosphere and sounds are amazing and the people I met online were all quite nice. It is perfectly fine for one or two hours every once in a while but nothing for serious gamers which expect to squeeze daily 8 hour gaming sessions out of it.See Primal like a snack you have during the day, not the main course..

												(I'm level 34) Spawns in.  Hears rex.  ""HELP!"" lol  Rexes still terrify me. 10/10Pros:Realistic simulationFunFast-paced action (unless your traveling in a heavily hunted server)Example:  Helping someone get rid of two rexes at once.  Running out of ammo and being the only survivor.  Even though rex walked over me about 2x.  (You don't die unless they are in attack mode.)Cons:Still somewhat buggy and glitchedQuetz rarely attacks except for surprise attacksQuetz attacking you can kick you from the server occassionallyExample #1:  My last game I had a Quetz surprise attack me.  I lost connection.  Update: (This bug has been fixed.)Example #2:  I spawned in after spending over 60,000 game dollars on .308 and .44; when I tried to look in my drop pod, it disappeared before my eyes.  Now I'm poor.All that aside, I still love this game.  Again, 10/10			"

												Great game, cannot defualt on it. The game isnt from everyone, it's definitly not like ark but more of a realistic survival game. It sucks that the devs abandond it, but hopefully one day there will me more content.Also, make sure you communicate with others in the room, as you dont want to die just for them to take all your stuff and it's actually more fun playing in a team than by yourself.7/10But not for everyone			"

													Been playing since early access with over 160 hours of exploring the game solo and with groups of up to 6 people. Overall I like the game. I’m not going to go in to the balance and state of the game as of this review because that changes from patch. Instead I am going to cover how I play the game, and some of the notable aspects that struck me. Side note, I have never played any hunting games (The Hunter or otherwise) and do not have an interest in doing so. I have yet to try any of the PVP but having played the original DAYZ mod for Arma 2… ya I’ll just stick to the PvE where the humans can’t ruin your day.	First off, the visuals started out very decent and just got better over time. Now in April of 2015, the weather effects are absolutely fantastic and wandering around the island is still breathtaking. And it’s not just grand vistas, it’s the attention to detail. The little PDA you use that shows what you are looking at in game is accurate when another player looks at your PDA for example. You can see the world reflect in other players eyes, the leaves from trees blow in a uniform direction to denote wind. It’s little things like that which impressed me.	Another interesting feature of the game is the sound. This is one of the few games where it actually matters. Almost any game I have played, I really could blair music or have a movie playing at the same time and not be affected. In Primal, everything is silenced but the game sounds. Even after you get comfortable with the game, the sounds are essential to knowing what’s coming and what it is. I found that having a nice subwoofer is one of the best early warning T-Rex detection systems available :-).	My third point is the most subjective but you are reading my review so you’re going to get my opinions. In my opinion, the game is beyond my patience and skill to play solo and enjoy; it’s too hard. I found I had much more fun with a small group, even if it was just one other person (WITH VOICE CHAT). If I did not have friends to play with, I probably would have abandoned the game after a few hours of exploring and being eaten. Not only can you be overwhelmed by dinosaurs but the supplies in the game are relatively scarce. This is not a complaint; I LIKE that things are scarce and that you are often down to a few precious rounds and if those fail, you are likely to die. But because there is that element of chance and that “being in the wrong place at the wrong time” aspect, the few people working with you can avert a total loss into a narrow escape or only a few deaths. Even after you are pimped out in the noble came and have whatever weapons you wanted, you are just as frail as you were when you landed and having the most powerful gun does NOT mean you are safe.	So overall, I am pleased with the game. You need 2-3 hour sections of time to really enjoy it when you hop on so don’t think you are going to play for 20 minute and be fine when you log on next, but I am happy with the time I have got out of it to date.

Early Access Review
								Ive got to say I truly enjoy this game. So far Ive found the graphics to be outstanding, the game community is very nice and very helpful and the game itself is terrifying! I mean that in a good way! Its just fun! I melds survival with exploration and tosses in a scavenger hunt as well! I would recommend this game and I look forward to future updates!			"

												If you're like me and you long to relive the glory days of playing Carnivores I and II on your PC, I would recommend this; but with the caveat, you will be bored. I don't mean like a commercial break between an episode of your favorite TV show, but more along the lines of watching paint dry in a humid environment. It just isn't fun past a certain point. If this game gets AI, weapons, and dinosaur updates, I'd recommend it; however, as it stands, only pick this game up if you are a desperate fool wanting to hunt dinosaurs or if you can get it on sale.

												First off I Like this game, LOVE THE CONCEPT, and as long as the devs don't take the money and run, and finish this game it could be EPIC. no its not like MINECRACK, there are already enough games like that. This is more of DayZ meets Deer Hunter, meets Dinosaurs. And might I add the Dinasaurs are actual size *edited after seeing the trex a few times its close to real size, not oversized. -IT HAS BUGS BECAUSE ITS EARLY ACCESS, and still needs work, but all in all its good.-Its not pay to play but you earn in game money when you get rank and can unlock and make in game purchases with ingame money... YAY no more dumping real money into a game!!!			"

												This is easily the worst game i've ever had the displeasure of playing. Putting aside the fact that it looks like absolute garbage compared to the trailers, the controls are easily the worst i've EVER had to attempt to use, and even after changing them to controls i'd be used to, it's still just so slow and clunky and uncomfortable to play. I spent the entirety of my time avoiding Utahraptors, literally just walking fast enough that they couldn't catch up to me, and not being able to do anything but continue walking away from them. I started out with a Bow, but no arrows, and i lost that useless bow as soon as i died from that Utahraptor relentlessly biting at me. The sprint bar goes down extremely fast, with practically no real speed bonus, and only recharges at an acceptable rate when you're standing still. I wandered around for about what i'd say was a mile, being attacked by several Utahraptors along the way, and saw nothing at all worth my time. No other dinosaurs, no weapons, nothing to interact with other than rocks and dino♥♥♥♥♥♥ literally just those ♥♥♥♥ing Utahraptors. Altogether, I'd have to say that i wasted $30, and i really wish that i could refund this steaming pile of dogshit. All i can really think is that this game was thrown together by a couple of Jurrasic Park wannabe-fanatics with 0 talent in 3D modeling and animation. Truly pathetic. 1/10			"

												Want to know what I loved this game. It had stealth, some guns and hunting dinosaurs. What could you ask for? How about actual working mechanics for guns! Constant and true hit boxes for hearts, lungs and what not! T-rex's that don't run straight to you when your crouched and have full lvl 5 camo and haven't moved or made noise in 5 mins! Quets were a nice touch. To bad they fly through everything, including the ground, then pick you up fly high enough and drop you to your death! Oh did I forget their is no counter for the bird either! Bow for a starter was good you could kill something, but now with only a machete you spend a hr to find a weapon then get promptly eaten by a Rex! If your reading this don't give this money grabbing company any cash. After their intial success with the pre-release it has gone down hill and not much fun for solo, not to mention pvp full of hackers. As for me and my friends any and all games from these producers will be scornfully watched and never baught into and i'm actually sick to my stomach for wasting the 15$ intially to buy in. You have been warned. Goodluck and hunt elsewhere!			"

												Unfinished Game. This game has the potential to be something great but whats keeping it from that possibility is the endless bugs, shady mechanics and or lack there of. This is a survival game without starvation,dehydration hell you dont even get to build a shelter or a storage box! The game is missing a few things but it does have some positives. The Ease at which you can die (which you should die if a T-Rex bites you), Graphic-wise this game gets a 8.5 outta 10! Being a multiplayer is a definite must to this type of game not only for the competitive but for the sheer difficulty of this game. However this game misses out on the the whole cook food,build shelter genre when it would clearly make it better i mean who wouldnt wanna kill and eat a dinosaur! Mechanics on the new flying Dinosaur could be twerked a bit not just in favor of killing the animal but a way to maybe put that machete to good use! This game has the right idea but just doesnt seem to follow through. When i saw i could buy items i got a little excited think yea i definitely would spend a little hard earn USD for guns and ammo, But  its not so and why when all you would have to do is when you die /land they are in the pod  with that crap machete (cause your a special prisoner kinda thing) ya know like his family is sending him commisarry, But its Guns instead of HoneyBuns. At the moment this game gets a 7outof10 with me.Please dont leave the game this way			"

												In theHunter: Primal you're exposed on a planet similar to our earth millions of years ago. The beautiful landscape askes to be explored. The motivator: Hunt dinos to level up and earn money, both to be able to buy better equipment before you respawn after a dino got you. Also there are multiple abandoned bases on the rather big island you play on and chests with equipment (guns, ammo, healthpacks, clothing).So far it's all nice. Unfortunately there are only 5 kinds of dinos: The small Velociraptor, the big Utharaptor, the Triceratops (the only herbivore), the T-Rex and the Quetzalcoatlus (flying). Encountering the dinos is well done: You might hear some raptors, but you won't see them, you move along, and still hear them, knowing that they're stalking you. But soon you will find out that the dinos are incredibly stupid in fights: Except for the flying dino and the T-Rex to some extent, they all can be easily killed with the starting machette only, if you keep moving along their flank and back.Frequent bugs like frozen dinos (e.g. a Quetzalcoatlus stuck in the air), Quetzalcoatlus flying through the terrain or T-Rexes who do their death-bite even if you're far away from their head further take away from the atmosphere the stunning land- and soundscape provided before.The unfinished game has a lot of potential, but it has been released from early access, thus i don't assume that this potential will be used. I don't recommend this game.			"

												I played for a while. The map size is definitely a highlight, well done to the devs for such a huge map.This advantage is also its weakness. It takes up to an HOUR to travel a fair distance, and with no other transport but your feet, there is no way to speed this up. On the way, you will probably get killed by dinosaurs.If you find a gun, you're forced to reload the game of risk of losing said gun, and it restocks ammo. Basically, you must restart your game to get ammo. Grinding, really.Using this logic, in order to PROGRESS you need to GRIND.Also, the game itself feels unfinished, it feels like an alpha or beta staged game. They need to develop the game more and find a new way of progressing without grinding.			"

												The game is very nice to look at and the animals are decent to deal with. But the devs made it perfectly clear this is a tech demo for The Hunter, their other game. This was never meant to be a full game, just tech demo for details and sounds that will make the other game better. Dont expect many DLC's because they arent coming.			"

Early Access Review
								By far the least buggest, most incredibly fun Early Access game I've played so far. The AI is actually really clever as the T-Rex was stalking around trying to find me and once it spotted me, it was freaking scary. Graphics could uses some work but my goodness the Dinosaur models are AMAZING! Gameplay is really good but I would like the ability to recover my health by either drinking the water or being able to open up the dinos and eat their meat, something like that would be great for a future update. All in all, this game is great for anyone who is getting bored with DayZ and wants a new experience in the world of Survival Games. Early Access of this game gets a 8.9/10			"

												This is a dinosaur survival game based on the popular hunting game theHunter. The game's engine is known for solid weapon simulation and detailed immsersive environments.  There is no crafting, you only need manage your health, clothing, weapons, and ammo.  Once you have leveled up with points accumulated from kills you can spawn in with better equipment and the game becomes more hunting orientated, less survival orientated. It feels less arcadey than ARK with a heavy emphasis on accurate gun physics. Be warned this game can be a bit of a walking simulator and despite being both beautiful and terrifying the AI leaves a little something to be desired. The game supports both cooperative and PvP game modes. theHunter Primal is definitely worth it in sale!			"

								Fun game so far. Some definite quality of life improvements would include: stackable ammo, option to pause game, markers for your corpse on every death (not just your most recent death), reduce sounds of mushrooms.It's only in early access. I'd imagine some more game mechanics such as missions should be added to give a person a goal to keep playing.Weapons would be nicer to come across a little more often. Items such as treestands, blinds, bait, would be nice. I haven't come across anything like that yet. Night vision goggles would be tight. Maybe stuff like avatar and weapon customization would be nice. Also if you die and can't get back to your corpse without quitting the game, you shouldn't lose all of your stuff. There should be some way to get it back. Another nice feature would be skills that level up such as endurance, stealth, accuracy, etc. You would gain points by killing dino's that could be spent on level ups.Anyway, just my thoughts. Having fun getting molested by Utahraptors. 21/10, would get molested again.			"

												Thehunter: Primal has all the potential to be a great, awesome game in many regards. You hunt and explore alone or with other survivors (multi-player) and are also hunted by the creatures of this game. Experiences can make you feel horrified if you forget your actually playing a game to some. What started out as a mega promising game fell to the wayside with no updates or patches for almost a year. A NEW DLC has been released with some new fixes along with a great mission to kill the Primal Queen T-Rex. You must first seek out the rare T-Rex and aquire its gland to lure the Primal ""Queen|' out into the open. She is must stronger than the normal Rex's found within the game.  New high tech weapons are gifted to the players skilled enough to bring down the Primal Queen.  A new survey for players was put out by Expansive Worlds asking numerous questions about future things that could possibly make the game better. New DLC's and such. There are some bugs still noticably found in the game that are said to be fixed soon. Hopefully the Devs are now onboard with this project permanently and can give us tons of new explorations, more creatures to horrify the faint of heart. The game deserves to be updated and new materials added frequently even if it means spending money on new DLC's by its fanbase. There are not many Dino games out there that are worth anyones time. This one has the potential to be a great one. Great game, needs some Dev love before it loses its fanbase and is lost forever. Time will tell if the effort is put into it. We hope so......			"

												This game was great in the pre-release (that's why it has so many good reviews) but now since its a full, complete game. The Devs add things that upsets me and many other gamers that play this game. I not going to give you the run down of all the problems this game has. If I did it would of became the bible of glitches, bugs and just awful decisions. I am only going to give you one problem and you figure out if you want to waste you money on this if its on sale. When you spawn in the game you only have a bow and a handful of arrows. This makes it hard to kill dinos in this game but not impossible. Now you have only a  machete that was made in china. (sorry china) So good luck with that and dealing with players with better guns than you because of the stupid progression system. By the way watch out for pterodactyl that grabs you and drops you off 100 feet in the air. The devs way of saying ""Thank you for purchasing our game""			"

								I LOVE this game! First, I like how you always have to watch your back.  When i first started playing the game i would be like ""What is that noise? I just ran for like 45 minutes to escape a raptor!"" The dino's never take a break. XDSecend, I am sooo glad about the non PVP servers. First, you can team with other people. Secend, if another player dies you can take their stuff. :PIt may take a little while to get used to the controls but once you get the hang of things you're hunting down T-Rex!This is NOT a scam like theHunter!!

												Primal is one of the few games that sincerely and beautifully implements the idea of dinosaur hunting; I'm not talking about some Turok style title where dinos are just a more exoctic kind of antagonist/cannon fodder for a player.  I mean the kind that truly gives a player the thrill of hunting these creatures, but also the feeling of being the hunted.  Bought it when it was still relatively new (had only three dinos; utahraptor, tricerotops, and t-rex), and it's made a few steps by adding two new species since.  Landscapes are beautiful, the game of cat and mouse is as exciting as it is nerve-racking...  Unfortunately, it seems as though Primal has been doomed to the graveyard of those other titles where the developer simply got tied up elsewhere, or (sadly) just stopped caring about it.  I haven't given up hope completely; if you've followed Stranded Deep, the game went MONTHS without any new updates, but the developers eventually came back to it, and have been working on it, as if showing remorse for the long period of neglect.  Perhaps Primal might share a similar fate, but perhaps not.  Definitely worth the buy, but only if it's on a sale.  It's fun for the first few hours, but the developers haven't given me much of a reason to dive back in again.  Fingers crossed though			"

								I really like the game so far. Dinos: I would like to see more dinosaurs added and they have added one since I got early access. I would also like to see more sophisticated dinosaur movement and behaviour. So far they act well, especially the Utahraptors, but occasionally, I have noticed that the Trex will get stuck against a large tree or a rock. I would be very excited if they can manage to make the dinos interact more. It would be awesome in the carnivores would hunt herbavores and Trex would fight eachother (excetera). Buildings: I want there to be more sophisticated ruins or buildings. There are towers and runied forts but there are no doors or you can't enter any of the old buildings. This bothers me because it makes no sense... Anyway, there has been consistent improvement so far so I hope this team keeps going :-)			"

								For an early access game, theHunter: Primal is satisfactory. Not the best, but certainly not the worst.The main draw of the game is survivng on an island full of dinosaurs which is a ton of fun. Although the dinosaurse's AI is mediocre at best, the thrill of being hunted by a pack of raptors or chased by a T-Rex is pretty terrifying. The scenery and sound effects are extremely impressive, adding life to a massive jungle world, which gives the illusion that the animals are talking to one another. Unfortunately there is not much to do but make your way across the island, hunting for loot while the combat and weapon options are limited.As it stands at the time of this review, I only recommend it if you have close friends to enjoy it with. That being said, if the development of this game continues at a reliable pace, theHunter: Primal has the potential to be a great game. "

Awesome.I had top of the line camo and weapons = loaded up and 10 minutes later i was dropped from on high onto the cold ground. No problm i thought - i'll head back, get my stuff and kill all of those flying dipsticks.

In the heat of battle i remember holding the right mouse button and clicking on the left and the game crashed. All my stuff gone.ok - no wories - buy some ok stuff and join an mp game. You could just sit in the forest by the volcano and be entertained by the human rain falling from the Quetzalcoatluseses flying above. I thought I hated them = man everyone does. Makes you think HOW this could have been added - testing ?? QA ?? Yeah right. It had SO MUCH potential = and now it is a planet sized chunk of crap.EDIT - The flying dinos are now limited to the volcano area - back to hunting i go :)			"

								I would easily give this game of the year award but atm, it crashes wayyyyy to often. I was hosting a game of 15 people and my client crashed. So many people get dissapointed when playing. It's a pain really, but IT'S WORTH IT. It's seriously so much fun that i've given up on all other games. Getting stalked across the landbridge by a pack of raptors, getting eaten by a t-rex that comes out of nowhere, taking selfies with triceratops that got their head stuck in a hill. What more can you want? Remember that you actually need to aim on vital areas of the animals. If you shoot head on you're likely to be eaten. I hit a raptor from the front 4 times with shotgun slugs, but it still ate me, but you can one-shot them with bow and arrow if you hit straight in the heart! Taking down a t-rex on your own is not impossible. They are afraid of walking down really steep hills, so if you find a ledge, it's easy to get a few shots on the rex to make it start running away, then you pick out your marksman rifle and take it down but this game is best if you play it with friends.Map knowledge is key. There some settlements spread across the map where you can find various firearms. If you find a settlement, write down the coordinates, which you can find in the hand computer.			"

								Most realistic hunting enviroment I've played in to date.  Awesome game physics and highly detailed landscapes and dinosaurs make for a thrilling hunting experience.  An air of caution to those easily scared. Do not play in the dark with headphones.The experience starts you off in a space capsule that lands on a planet filled with blood thirsty dinosaurs.  Your main objective is to hunt, kill and rid the island of these man eating beasts.  You start off with a bow and few arrows to tide you over unitl you eventually find crates scattered around the map, containing different weapons and ammo.  When encountering these larger that life beasts, I recommend you use the environment to your advantage.  There's plenty of undergrowth to conceal yourself until the perfect shot presents itself to you.As an early release for $19.00, you get more than you pay for.  You'll find the plush and vibrant island environment and a variety of three Dinosaurs, anough to contend with until further developement.  The targets include the infamous Utahraptor, T-Rex and Triceratops.  As developement continues, more dinosaurs will be added along with more objectives i'm sure.  This is a single/multiplayer interface where you can either go it alone, or team up with others.  Power in numbers!!And good hunting.....			"

No problm i thought - i'll head back, get my stuff and kill all of those flying dipsticks. I get back to my loot and 3 of them - 3 - started attacking - took out 2 - looked up - there was now 4 of them. In the heat of battle i remember holding the right mouse button and clicking on the left and the game crashed. All my stuff gone.ok - no wories - buy some ok stuff and join an mp game. You could just sit in the forest by the volcano and be entertained by the human rain falling from the Quetzalcoatluseses flying above. I thought I hated them = man everyone does. Makes you think HOW this could have been added - testing ?? QA ?? Yeah right. It had SO MUCH potential = and now it is a planet sized chunk of crap.EDIT - The flying dinos are now limited to the volcano area - back to hunting i go :)			"

Early Access Review
								I would easily give this game of the year award but atm, it crashes wayyyyy to often. I was hosting a game of 15 people and my client crashed. So many people get dissapointed when playing. It's a pain really, but IT'S WORTH IT. It's seriously so much fun that i've given up on all other games. Getting stalked across the landbridge by a pack of raptors, getting eaten by a t-rex that comes out of nowhere, taking selfies with triceratops that got their head stuck in a hill. What more can you want? Remember that you actually need to aim on vital areas of the animals. If you shoot head on you're likely to be eaten. I hit a raptor from the front 4 times with shotgun slugs, but it still ate me, but you can one-shot them with bow and arrow if you hit straight in the heart! Taking down a t-rex on your own is not impossible. They are afraid of walking down really steep hills, so if you find a ledge, it's easy to get a few shots on the rex to make it start running away, then you pick out your marksman rifle and take it down but this game is best if you play it with friends.Map knowledge is key. There some settlements spread across the map where you can find various firearms. If you find a settlement, write down the coordinates, which you can find in the hand computer.			"

								For an early access game, theHunter: Primal is satisfactory. Not the best, but certainly not the worst.The main draw of the game is survivng on an island full of dinosaurs which is a ton of fun. Although the dinosaurse's AI is mediocre at best, the thrill of being hunted by a pack of raptors or chased by a T-Rex is pretty terrifying. The scenery and sound effects are extremely impressive, adding life to a massive jungle world, which gives the illusion that the animals are talking to one another. Unfortunately there is not much to do but make your way across the island, hunting for loot while the combat and weapon options are limited.As it stands at the time of this review, I only recommend it if you have close friends to enjoy it with. That being said, if the development of this game continues at a reliable pace, theHunter: Primal has the potential to be a great game. "

Early Access Review
								I really like the game so far. Dinos: I would like to see more dinosaurs added and they have added one since I got early access. I would also like to see more sophisticated dinosaur movement and behaviour. So far they act well, especially the Utahraptors, but occasionally, I have noticed that the Trex will get stuck against a large tree or a rock. I would be very excited if they can manage to make the dinos interact more. It would be awesome in the carnivores would hunt herbavores and Trex would fight eachother (excetera). Buildings: I want there to be more sophisticated ruins or buildings. There are towers and runied forts but there are no doors or you can't enter any of the old buildings. This bothers me because it makes no sense... Anyway, there has been consistent improvement so far so I hope this team keeps going :-)			"

								Most realistic hunting enviroment I've played in to date.  Awesome game physics and highly detailed landscapes and dinosaurs make for a thrilling hunting experience.  An air of caution to those easily scared. Do not play in the dark with headphones.The experience starts you off in a space capsule that lands on a planet filled with blood thirsty dinosaurs.  Your main objective is to hunt, kill and rid the island of these man eating beasts.  You start off with a bow and few arrows to tide you over unitl you eventually find crates scattered around the map, containing different weapons and ammo.  When encountering these larger that life beasts, I recommend you use the environment to your advantage.  There's plenty of undergrowth to conceal yourself until the perfect shot presents itself to you.As an early release for $19.00, you get more than you pay for.  You'll find the plush and vibrant island environment and a variety of three Dinosaurs, anough to contend with until further developement.  The targets include the infamous Utahraptor, T-Rex and Triceratops.  As developement continues, more dinosaurs will be added along with more objectives i'm sure.  This is a single/multiplayer interface where you can either go it alone, or team up with others.  Power in numbers!!And good hunting.....			"

												Caution: This game requires patience. I'm not a patient guy. That being said, it is quite rewarding when you get used to the ideals of the game. I do agree with most other reviews which often say ""This game is basically still being developed and it shouldn't be a full release yet"" Because it's true. There are only five species on the island so some variety would'nt go amiss. A couple more herbivores too. What I'd also like to see is being able to construct some sort of shelter, I know it's included in a lot of other games now, especially those with a bit of survival in them, but this game is literally all about survival yet we wander about for the entire duration.There are bugs. Some are infuriating. For me I've been able to ignore them, and I'm still discovering the game. Overall this is a fun game, feels great when you get on top of the local meat eaters and the ability to team up with people helps too. Needs more content and a couple of dodgy bugs fixed. That's all. I hope within two months of writing this review there'll be a little more to chew on.Edit - It's been seven months. Devs have done nothing to update the game whatsoever. What once had the potential to become an exciting game has stagnated and melted away in the shadow or ARK and other such games. Go buy ARK instead, it actually gets updated.			"

								Great Game! Harldy any bugs for Alpha, those it does crash now and then (fortunately that's at the game menu when starting not half way through a hunt) It's a slow paced game but a highly rewarding one and the encounters with the Dinosaurs I'd describe as more frequent than the original Hunter game, and perfectly balanced between realism and entertainment.If you don't think properly when you start you may not enjoy the game, you cannot aimlessly roam on your own with a bow and expect to live. I teamed up with someone else so if we did encounter a Raptor before we got a gun, we'd both have a good chance at taking it down together. Gradually you build up your weapons and ammo, and now I'm roaming around taking everything out. The introductions of pvp optional servers give you more to shoot at for impatient gamers, but also dents your survivability as often people gift you guns in non pvp.I'd recommend viewing the forums for a 'base map' - there are 25 so far in the game and if you know where they are you can enter the game and run to the base in the hope of getting a big gun. I'm now kitted out in full camo gear, i have a sniper and scope rifle, and a shotgun. It's really, really fun, especially seeing the holes you can blast out the dinosaurs with the rifle. I'm totally impressed and what a bargain at 15.99 for the hours I've now put in (16), I can't wait to see what else is added as the game develops - a really throroughly good effort.			"

								If you've played The Hunter (no I'm not going to type it like this: theHunter), then this is basically The Hunter but with dinosaurs, and if the idea of that floats your boat, then by all means give it a go.If you've not played The Hunter before, then basically it's a hunting sim with dinosaurs. You get a large tropical volcanic hawaiian style island to roam and explore at your lesuire which looks fantastic. As with The Hunter they've done a great job on making the environment feel very natural and believable. Fancy a quick break somewhere nice in the sun? Then go for a hike around this island. Of course you won't be able to completely relax because the place is also inhabited by dinosaurs, which you can either try and avoid or hunt down. The current premise behind all this is that you're a prisoner/pioneer in the future who has been dumped on this planet and tasked with clearing it of dinosaurs. Evidence of previous pioneers is still littered and dotted around the landscape in places.To aid you in hunting you get a sort of hunters mate. A little electronic PDA style device that you can use to scan foot prints or scat or even dinosaur calls to help give you a idea of their directional location. It's not always 100% on the ball so you have to use a bit of your own judgment as well. By default, evidence of dino tracks are highlighted with glowing red markers making them much easier to spot in amongst all the thick vegitation. You can turn these markers off and rely only on your own abilities to spot the foot prints and mounds of dino poo. Trust me, even without the glowing markers, trying to spot even a 3 foot mound of poo is tricky, let alone a foot print in the grass. The PDA however will still chirp up and notify you when you do stumble over some evidence of dino tracks.So what weapons and gear do you get to hunt down these dinos? Well it's an odd assortment considering it's set in the future and that you have been specifially tasked with hunting down dinosaurs. You'd think they'd give you a suit of armour and a gun that could knock down an elephant, but instead you start dressed in a t-shirt next to a pod that contains a bow and a tiny clutch of arrows. Yes, they gave you bows and arrows to take down dinosaurs. I guess the folks in charge back on earth must have been reading the Turok comics in order to formulate their dino eradication strategy. As you move around the landscape, you will come across crates with other weapons, items of clothing and medi kits. Mostly you will find more arrows and bows, but there are also shotguns, pistols and rifles to be found. Annoyingly you won't always find the ammo with the gun, meaning you will have to decide whether to haul around a dead weight with you in the hope of finding some ammo for it. All items affect your overall weight, which in turn affects your movement speed and how long you can sprint for. Clothing items currently seem to offer no bonuses, it's just fancy dress right now. Another issue is that items will not stack at the moment either. So if you have 5 arrows and you pick up another 3, they will stay as two separate amounts in your inventory. Fortunately inventory space is not a problem right now anyway as there is almost no way you could fill it with the current weight limitations. However when you equip the 3 arrows it won't automatically then use up the bunch of 5 after you've used the bunch of 3. You will have to then equip that bunch of 5 manually too. All simple issues that will get sorted in time I'm sure.The weapons themselves for the most part handle well. The bow is a bit of a pain, as you need to aim it before charging it for firing and you can't do it in quick succession. Meaning if 3 raptors get on your trail and all you have is a bow, then you're dead meat. You might take one, but the other two will get you for sure. A shotgun fully loaded with slugs will even up the score some what. As with The Hunter all the beasties take location damage to things like heart and lungs etc and even if they do a runner they can still bleed out and die later. If like me you have no idea of the internal anatomy of dinosaurs, then taking them down with shots to the vitals will be more about luck and guess work. Currently there are only 3 dinosaur types in the game, the Triceratops, Utahraptors and the T-Rex. The dinos are not omnipotent and you can generally sneak up on them with reasonable ease if you stay low and stick to cover. They can of course also sneak up on you. A few times as I've been strolling along I heard a rustle from behind me and turned around to see a raptor sneaking up on me. If you see 3 snooping around behind you trying to pick up on your trail, then get worried. Avoid the T-Rex. Triceratops is a herbivore and is the best one to actively hunt down yourself without worrying that it's going to eat you instead.I haven't tried playing it with other folks yet, only ""singleplayer"", so I can't tell you how good the network code is etc. To play, you have to create a game and set the usual things like how many other players you want to be able to join in and give your game a password. So currently to play it single player just set the players to 1 and password it. In the 3 hours I played last night, I did not encounter any major show stopping bugs or crashes. It all seemed pretty stable to me. Playing it on an i5 with 8 Gb of ram and a GTX770, all on max settings and it all runs just fine.Right now the game is a bit content thin as previously noted. Only 1 island, 3 dinos, a small smattering of weapons and not a lot else. However of course I expect that to change as the game is delveloped. What is currently there though, is in a very playable state, and if hunting and exploring are your thing then this should provide you with a good few hours of enjoyment even at this stage. The Hunter is currently the best hunting game out there (shame about the microtransactions), so this game already has a good foundation in that respect. It's more or less really just going to be a case of waiting for them to develop the content with this one.What would I like to see going forwards? More islands with different biomes like windswept deserts and dunes, arctic areas, temperate woodlands and plains. More dinosaurs of course and interactivity beween the different dinosaurs, as I haven't really seen any evidence of that yet. More kit and perhaps a bit of minor base building maybe. All stuff that I'm pretty sure we'll see eventually anyway.			"

								This new error 16002 where you can't connect to the game is not good.  19 days not being able to play now so still thumbs down. Other than that I like the game lots of fun playing with friends.  No comments from the Devs in the forums also not looking very good.       (edit)   Well I had to edit my review finally after some updates I was able to play again.  There are still some issues that need to be addressed 1. in multiplayer if your not the host your shots are not counting when shooting animals.  So if you shoot 30 times into a T-rex and your friend shoots 30 times only his shots count.  Same with the other animals as well.  2. The shotgun has issues off and on with the different ammo types, have to take the shotgun out of the slot place it into inventory then replace it back into weapon slot.  Was killed because of this 3 or 4 times.  Also sometimes the shotgun doesn't want to fire not sure what is causing this but it does happen.  3. The power of the ammo doesn't seem to be strong enough at times one time it drops everything no problem.  Then other times its like you have to shoot for example T-rex 60 times to kill it point blank something wrong with that.  First came out I was able to get a T-rex with 4 to 10 shots not anymore.  4. The grouping of dinos odd load ratios.  Raptors seem to be in larger packs of 7 to 9 more often now.  Triceratops seem to be in groups of 3 to 6 .  If your unlucky like me at times you get the 3 and 4 T-rex at one time.  Most of the time can get 1 maybe 2 of them but then the other 2 get you.  The ammo stacking has made things alot nicer able to have ammo with no worries now.  Still kinda buggy at times with it but not as bad.  Now comes the weather I was dreading the day when the rain from hell would hit the game.  I do not care for the rain system had it in the regular thehunter game.  Is way too loud needs to have a way to lower the sound level.  Try playing this game with headphones in TS when it rains you can't hear anyone and it gives you a headache.  I haven't tried pvp yet first off I don't want to lose the clothing it took me days to find.  I really would like to have a second game profile so I could have one for the regular game play and one for PVP play. That way I wouldn't care if I lost what I had when in PVP etc.  Other than that I like the game nothing like the ROAR of the mighty T-rex .  Then the foot steps the screen shake then  the first sight of the Mighty Rex.  You hide where ever you can it walks past you then suddenly stops and sniffs the air. Your heart races you wonder do I shoot or do I stay still.  50/50 chance I say go for it.  I would now have to recommend this game now as I do hope they keep updating with goodies.  I say 8 out of 10  as it is now.   After more things are added I will see about updating my review and see if it should get a better score.			"

												I bought theHunter:Primal during its' Early Access phase but it sat barely-played for several months. I just happened to try it again last week and wow what a difference! This is easily now one of my favorite games (and I've never bought a hunting game before except for Carnivores many years ago). The updates seem to have fixed the issues I had pre-launch. This game is immersive with the graphics cranked all the way, and there have been quite a few times when I've actually felt dread (like when I shot and killed a Utah Raptor with the .308 and a T-Rex comes over the ridge to investigate and comes within yards of me on my belly cowering behind a tree). You don't want to die and lose the items you've collected (like improved camo-clothing, Marksman .308 with scope, shotgun with slugs, etc.).The island it beautiful and pretty big, the dinosaur AI seems great, there are more types of insects now, there are birds and I'd swear I've even seen a rat scurring around on two seperate occasions. I saw someone mention there were no graphic options, and there is, you just have to go through Options on the startup screen rather than through the in-game Options available when you hit the Esc key while playing. Someone also said there is no guide but it's there too...I absolutely do recommend this game and I don't think we've seen the last from the developers.Brian			"

												Starts out fairly hard, it's easy to die and it takes awhile to find the weapons you need to take down the big stuff.  It's a fun game if you can get past those parts. It's easier if you join a group and hunt together since you can cover each other. Shot placement is extremely important; try to hit them in the heart.  Well worth the 7.49 I paid for it on the Steam Summer Sale.  Now that I've got good weapons, it's hard to quit playing. I've had the game crash a few times but haven't lost my gear because of it.  If you die (and the server is still running) you can go back to where your body lies and gather up all your gear.  If you like a challenging hunting sim with dinosaurs where the hunter can become the hunted, then you will like this game.			"

												If you like hunting, buy this. If you like Dinosaurs, Buy this!!! If you like surviving, buy this!!! Basiclly buy this if you at least like one of the generes!!!This is much more better than the ""Money Grabber Game"" - TheHunter, for you'll have to pay like every 1-12 months on depending on what DLC you get. Plus the DLCs cost a lot and when I mean a lot I mean A WHOLE BUNCH OF MONEY!!!So that is why I like TheHunter: Primal better than the Money Grabber Game.                                                          P.    S.   You get in-game money and you don't have to pay for stuff in this game. You just pay for the game and play, hunt, and survive. You can go find stuff such as weapons, prey, and camo clothes. To find the Spec.Ops is at the volcano, but is very rare; but not as rare as the most powerful gun right now..... 700.Double Rifle.			"

												Honestly, after you get over the fact you die and you lose your stuff (Can grab it back because where you died has an Icon on the map) Its fun.Multiplayer is loads of fun and people are pretty helpful and generally save you like me quiet a few times when the T rex was pinning me down.I also heard there will be some DLC for it soon too, I died like 10000342 times but still enjoy it, go to the bigger castle looking like complexes to get guns. Most part the crates you see chilling throughout the map have ammo (Bullets, arrows) rarely guns, they have bows though.Stealth is your friend, don't run around or they will find you. Take your time getting to areas of interest, could be very rewarding.Yes the controls are terrible, yes they could have more dinosaurs (Probably will soon) But it is worth a try, I was not going to get the game because people complain in the reviews like hardcore.Its fun.YESTERDAY YOU SAID TODAY, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!?! JUST DO IT. -flexes-Vorlon			"

												Currently 'still' on the fense as to recommend this game or not. In its current state. No. Move on.Though there is some serious potential here to be a 'must buy' title. The fan-base has made serious recommendation to the developer and left the requested new content and improvement ball, in the developers court. My advice, wait until you see the dev's supporting new content and improvements. If not, then pass on this potentially great, yet not quite awesome  title.			"

												I just got this game and IT'S AWESOME! It's super realistic and intense. If you want instant action don't buy because this game takes time and patience, but I think it's worth it. It can be frustrating and anoying sometimes but thats why it's cool. I found a glitch with a herd of flying triceratops in a swamp. it was weird but thats only happened to me once. If you like to hunt (or be hunted) this is the game for you. You can track dinos with footprints, blood, and poop. So far the game is doing really good, and i hope that they will add more dinos and other things later on but for now its awesome. It's really fun and I think that it is worth it to buy.			"

								Dino's definitely need to be able to aggro eachother not just team up on the player. Also, some guns in certian situations seem unreliable. Yesterday i fired off 5 buckshot point blank into a raptors face. Instead of dying it ate me with the face it shouldn't of had anymore. Ofc also, a team mechanic or system would be enjoyable.. a way to party and mark eachothers way points etc. I also hope to see a building system introduced to the game and more ""survival"" aspects for the survival theme of the game. I realize this is a hunter game ,but these things would be enjoyable to say the least. Such as food.. water.. shelter.. traps.. etc. This game has many strong points tho and i enjoy it a lot.. I'm also excited to see how it plays out.			"

Early Access Review
								Even in early access this game feels polished. The dinos act how you would expect them to. They are challenging and feel natural. The environment is huge! so there is plenty of time to expore and get a feel for the place. You might not encounter a dino right away but the suspense really keeps you on your toes. Especially when youre in a dense forest and they are camoflaged so well (another reason I love the realism of this game).A few times I thought I had avoided a raptor then came face to face with one or more only to realize they were hunting me. When you hear them and cant see them you really get a sense of F**K I'm going to die.For rougly half an hour I had to camp in some ferns and wait for a female raptor to move away. I had to listen for a call to know where she was so I could scurry to more cover. In reality if dinos were real I feel this game nails it. I dont care that I had to wait half an hour to escape the raptor because it felt like she hunting me. Later I lured her to my hiding spot and murdered her in cold blood (she got a couple bites in the process). The thrill of killing a raptor is awesome and the kicker of getting to take a trophy shot is just the icing on the cake.There are definately some things I would like to see in the finished versions like more herbivors and carnivores of carivous sizes etc even pterosaurs would be aweome! Aside from what I want if the developers continue to provide polished content there is no reason not to get this game especially if you love dinosaurs.There is so much potential for this game. I can only hope they flesh it out with a greater variety of wildlife to make the island really feel alive (it already does but what I mean is more so). I am happy I did. I hope that with more people buying this they can push out more content faster. This game litterally drops you in the middle of no where with a bow and arrow a GPS tracker and thats it. For a game to do that it has to be good and this one is. I can't praise it enough. If you buy it don't expect a finished product but do buy it to help this game reach full release. Its awesome.			"

								Hi people.My first look about this game:I start the game and the first look is great, a very good world with many variants, very nice sound and a sensation of fear. I start to explore and i have my first dinossaur, a female raptor calling. Is great, but i only have a bow with 5 arrows. Ok, i need a rifle or something better to kill this lady, then i move 200m and i see a T-Rex, he make a creapy call and i try to get back slowly, but i have the lady in my back. Ok, i die... I get in again and in a few minutes i get my firt kill, a triceratops. This is a early version of the game, and we know is a lot of work comming, but now is alredy a good game.Problems:This game is great, but have a few problems.- The volume of the T-Rex call is very low.- When a dinossaur (triceratops) go for a hole in the midle of the clifs, he stuck in there and you shoot at 3m, he dont run and dont see you.- So many dinossaurs in the map (i realise is because we have only 3 species yet) is very dificult to move without step in a carnivor.- Not the call, but the noise of a triceratops (presence noise), looks like a carnivor in my opinion. The call is perfect.- To many crashes on the servers.I'm a big fan of TheHunter and now of TheHunter: Primal and for Expansive Worlds and all the people envolved in this game, thanks for this great game, nice work.(Excuse my english)			"

								Alright straight to the point: if you're into looting and surviving, this is the game for you. BUY IT! What really satisfy you: your looting gears, with variety of clothes and weapons. They will turn you into a badass dino hunter. Patience is required! What really screw you: you will get killed by raptors and lose your gears, you will fall to your death and lose your gears, you will be killed by other hunters and your gears will be stolen, and others will loot your gears when you died. Game features: aim first then shoot because it won't allow you to shoot from hip, you can't jump, there are only 4 characters (2 males and 2 females), guns are primaly spawned in settlemtns which you will have to travel there on foot, some times you will fall to death from unbelievable height.

												The developers quit  this game after a meager 5 dinosaurs and a few weapons were released. This game is dead and all the illusions of having a realistic dinosaur hunting sim go with it. Now, they could have at least released a statement saying ""hey guys we quit, bye"", instead they managed to put down this weasel masterpiece. ""We all love Primal here and we hope that in the future we’ll be able to bring in more updates to the game and maybe even new content, but right now the primary focus of the team is on the flagship product of our studio – theHunter. This doesn’t mean we’ve abandoned or given up on Primal, but please expect less frequent patches and communication in the near future. You can be assured that we’re reading and keeping track of all feedback, and we’re also planning to release the occasional game update from time to time. Please stay tuned!""Don't give these shams your money, the game is dead.  "

												I have played the orginal Hunter for many years now on and off since it was very new and in beta phase, and it always brings me back. Sadly, the same can not be said for The Hunter Primal. The graphics are great and alot of the animals look real enough (I dont know fully as I have never seen a T Rex in the flesh) but its let down by a very clunky old style engine, It is what The Hunter was using in the original beta from the feeling. The Animals charge you, then sort of mill around doing nothing for 2-3 seconds before running off and charging again. My other couple of gripes with this that annoy the hell out of me, is the weapons and gear factor, unlike The Hunter you dont have an account with all your gear saved to it. Its what you had on you when you last logged out, This is fine, apart from when it bugs out and you lose what you have, Or worse yet, due to personal hosting, If you die and are running back to your corpse to get your gear, and they decide to log out. Bye bye gear. Meaning you start from scratch again and have a near impossible task of trying to open some containers with ammo and weapons in. Its crazy you have to be level 10 to even buy your first gun. The Quetzalcoatlus are far too OP, they are a nightmare to try and kill and bug out constantly, with a werid flying animation. The Dino noises can be heard from so far away that they sound like they are on top of you when actually they are 500 metres away. My honest advice is to save the money you would pay for this, go to The Hunter, pay for a 3 month bundle and play that, its so much more fun, its not hunting dinosaurs, but a bear can make you just as dead as any T Rex.

My honest advice is to save the money you would pay for this, go to The Hunter, pay for a 3 month bundle and play that, its so much more fun, its not hunting dinosaurs, but a bear can make you just as dead as any T Rex.

												This game is great and all, and looks stunning, but there really isn't much content. Updates come out very rarely and there are only 5 dinosaurs in the game. This game  has a lot of potential to be even better if the devs start really getting to work on it. And not to mention, the game's optimisation is amazing. Overall, it's a great game to play, it would be even better if it had more content.			"

												The game is alright. I've played some deer hunting games like this before and it's on par compared to them. The video graphics are pretty good. Although I would be pretty mad about paying full price for this game. Got this game in a bundle package from bundlestars.com with 5 other games for fewer than 5 dollars. It’s a good 5 dollar game but a suck♥♥♥♥♥30 dollar game . I did recommend this game to my cousin already.			"

Early Access Review
								As a fan of theHunter this game is great! As an early access title there is still not much to hunt, you have the choice of 3 dinosaurs all with unique AI and attitudes. What this game does really well is the sense of how epic these animals truly are, going up against a T-rex alone is truly a deathwish most of the time, you're going to need some perfectly placed shots to take it down. PVP servers also add to the chaos, with full-loot pvp you can trust no one in this world and it leaves for a very Jurassic Park-like survival game. The loot system is very dry and could be improved and of course dinosaur selection can be expanded but I'm sure that will come.Overall 8/10 and easily a 9 by release.			"

												Great game. One of the best and most realistic dinosaur hunting sim ever. Great graphic, advanced and realistic A.I., dynamic weather and day-night cycle. Spectacular environment and an iteresting backstory that you can discover in details finding abandoned documents. Dinosaurs are scientifically and anatomically accurate. Even if there are only 5 species (yet), they are really balanced (Triceratops: herbivore population, very common. Tyrannosaurus: apex predator. Utharaptor: medium sized pack hunter. Velociraptor: small but dangerous, really funny to fight a pach of them. Quetzacoatlus: flying scavenger and small animal hunter). A must-have for anyone.			"

Early Access Review
								I say a positive recommendation because this game has great potential. Beginning with nothing but a self made bow and 5 arrows, you must trek across a massive island hunting and being hunted by two types of prehistoric dinosaurs, utahraptors and the mighty t-rex. These are not the only dinosaurs, there is also the ever illusive triceratops. This is my only real criticism, with such a huge amount of background available, there are only three trackable, huntable, lethal dinosaurs to be found in this massive island. That being said, the game is tense, rewards exploration and if you're into big game hunting,the game doesn't get much bigger. Less so however is the inclusion of modern paleantology, the dinosaurs in this game don't have feathers for instance. But I doubt if this really matters much, the game gives the classic hunting dinos of Jurassic Park feel. Lots of fun.			"

												A  vrery, very, very enjoyable and intense dinosaur fps, great graphics with low requirements. The game starts out slow but once you get some weapons and ammo. When it comes to multiplayer, you are most likely better of using a hardwire connection because once you get over about 4 people on one server then you get some lag. When fighting the T-rex primal you are going to want to have a group of about 6 people and a base with three story tall towers to kill the thing, overall a great game. 10/10 Would machete a T-rex again.

												After almost 20 hours I realize what this game is trying to do, it's a fine game, but not more than 5 dollars in fines.You're Roland in jurassic park 2, a hunter that got so bored with deer he became bald and decided to hunt dinosaurs.A dinosaur shooter can have you replace the dinosaurs with pokemons, or zombies, it won't feel much different, you shoot the small once, the big twice. However this is a hunting game, with dinosaurs. Hunting games have its roots in realism, covering mechanics of smell, wind, weather, anatomy, bullet calibres, camouflage. These features all play a part in your success of hunting the prey. In other words, shooting everything in the face won't work out when your'e facing an animal with the skull thickness of armor plating on a T51 tank and the capability kill you before you finish reloading a magazine.The game doesn't give many tools, because it wants to be a survival game, they expect people to come in, know how hunting games work, and apply that to survivalism and dinosaurs, when most people think this is killing floor with dinosaurs, myself included.A big realization of the difference of this game is, how your prey will almost always outrun you when its health gets low. This occurs almost all the time, provided that everyone spawns with a knife at level 1, they run faster, hit harder, and have more bodies than you.So what do you do to succeed, you run, you hide, you scavenge other players bodies, and abandoned outposts for weapons. Because in this game, access to weapons doesn't mean it gets easier, it just allows you to make more mistakes. A player can use a bow and one shot a triceratops if you aim for its heart and because ammo is limited, it is encouraged to do so.You hide in the woods, listen for the noise and stalk the pack, finding one triceratops by itself muching grass, by watching the foliage you figure out the wind direction, staying downwind, so it can't detect you by smell, you crouch up to its side of the belly, drawing the bow, aiming for the spot behind the joint of the foreleg, a direct hit pierces its heart and kills it instantly, while the kid that plays call of duty is shooting it with a 50 cal, 11 times on the crown of its skull doing 1% total damage. If you miss, you aim for its lungs, then its intestines, because it won't run as far without proper respirations, and it will bleed out if you shoot it in the intestines.I hope this helps you understand this game better.

Early Access Review
								I felt the same sense of immersion and enjoyment as a kid playing Carnivores 2 on the family win98!Getting hunted down by a pack of raptors, hearing them chirp back and forth to one another,knowing they are hunting you. The feeling of accomplishment when you take 5 minutes to crawland inch closer to a raptor, just to get a perfect shot with your new .308 rifle. Playing with friends, coordinating a crossfire on a triceritops, unleashing a hail of bullets. Taking a group pic and laughingabout how awesome it was. Then running when you realize we used up most of our ammo and that aT-rex can heard our little cannonade. Seriously though, this game is amazing.The game has its core features down, and it's alot of fun. Me and a few friends own the game now, and its always a blast to play together. I'll admit, it has issues like crashing and missing features,but the devs are releasing a patch at a pace of about once per week, and are listening to community feedback.Since I started playing the game the devs have already fixed my biggest gripes about the game,which is new to me on a game thats still in early access.Thank you Expansive Worlds! Thanks for all the enjoyment The Hunter and Primal have brought, and for your listening to the community, as well as continued updates! "

												I cannot recommend a game that was built as a side project by the devs of The Hunter, and then seemingly abandoned by them a few months later after they milked the steam community for $20 something dollars.  We only see updates once every few months now and they dont fix the fundamental problems of the game.  This is listed as a survival game, that they are 100% correct on.  They dont give you enough ammo to survive on so you either spend all your time trying to sneak around the dinosaurs which usually end up sniffing you out no matter how well camoflauged you are and you end up wasting your precious ammo on trying to kill them because the devs dont add enough ammo in the boxes they spawn in that you are supposed to use to keep yourself stocked up on.  There are numerous bugs and glitches that they need to fix and in order to survive you usually see people exploiting them just to get enough ammo to survive, that or you spend all your time throwing yourself off cliffs to ""buy"" ammo which is only purchasable in your death screen.  There arent enough dinosaur varieties in the game, especially herbivores and you never see the carnivores interact with the herbivores, they completely ignore each other for the most part no matter what is going on in-game.  There are a few ""crown"" or good camps that drop decent gear so expect to do nothing more in this game but running between those camps trying to outfit yourself enough to take down a rex and getting eaten many many times in the process.  If I had a dollar every time I screamed at my pc: ""Devs, fix your game!""  I could replace my current setup with a triple SLI'd Titan GTX PC and go pick up ARK instead and run it at ultra and 60 fps.			"

Early Access Review
								While the game has a good concept (which is why I bought it) there are a lot of issues.To start - you start with nothing but a machete, and you're supposed to go around finding better gear, but there is NO GOOD WAY TO STAY IN STEALTH AROUND DINOS. I can't hardly find my way up the freakin' volcano to the research center to get better gear without being killed by a dino that shouldn't of seen me. Prone does nothing, crouch does nothing, moving slow does, guess what? NOTHINGThen there's the 'store' to unlock and buy better starting gear. There is nothing telling you how to level, there is nothing telling you how to earn the stuff to purchase things (such as the bow) from the store. I can only assume that you have to kill dinos and get the trophy ones to gain xp and coins, but again, if found it IMPOSSIBLE to do this without the proper gear, which I found IMPOSSIBLE to gain.There's also the fact that this is labeled as a survival game, which I indeed am in love with as a genre. Here's the thing, this isn't a survival game. This is a 'run around like a chicken with it's head cut off, falling off a cliff and dieing multiple time as you attempt to get gear to kill stuff' game. There is no crafting, there is no 'good' way to get the improved gear, you can't build a camp of any sort for any kind of protection. It's run, kill, run, kill, loot if you can, and try to SURVIVE the dinos, but there is no way to actually do this. It's not a survival game because you have to survive, it's a survival game if you have to survive WITH THE MEANS TO DO SO.Lastly, maybe this game isn't just for me. I'll be honest here and admit that. I think I would enjoy it with the ability to craft better items, maybe some resource gathering? BUilding up a base camp for protection, make me need to eat and drink, or at the very least, GIVE ME GEAR AT THE START THAT WILL ACTUALLY HELP.With these things being said, I'm giving it a down vote for the time. I understand it is still in development, and I understand that it's probably got a long way to go. The thing is that at this stage, I don't see an appeal to it, and don't recommend it to anyone that's looking for a fun game that they can acomplish something with. I'll revisit it in the future some time and see how it's going then, but for now, I'm deleting it, and not planning on checking in for a few months, hopefully it becomes worth the 20$ soon!			"

												A little glitchy, but nothing terrible, easily fixed. This game is a great game if you enjoy survival with a twist. There aren't that many ""dino"" survival games out there, and this one is probably as good as your going to get. The lotting is awesome, but it's not too much to make someone overpowered against dinos. It's a great game for YouTube, especially with some buddies, and it's playable whenever, even for a quick session. Overall, not the greatest game, but I happen to really enjoy it, and it adds a cool twist to a normal hunting/survival game.			"

												For me, this is the best dino game to date! I love playing it, its a little hard on single player but that also makes it fun, and its a blast in mp. The graphics are great, physics are great, AIs are great, the team that runs it is great/amazing, I really cant say enough good things about the game and devs! This and thehunter, in my opinion, are two of the best games out there, they are both very well developed with a team that is constantly adding updates, new features, and killing bugs. I am trying to think of a few cons to add to this, but i currently don't have any, except I do really miss the original raptor skins, and while the new ones are nice I would still like to see the old ones sometimes! The thing about this game that i know receives criticism is that there is a lot of walking around, and if your not properly equipped, getting killed. It just takes a little bit of planning and if you can find a group of people that's the best, but when you start out you will probably die a lot while you learn the game, and this is totally ok!			"

												Beautiful art done in this game.  Very nice to look at.  But, it is pretty much just a hunting game.  You have to find weapons from crates to fight the dinos before they eat you, that is the extent of the survival mode.  Would have been an awesome game for me if they had included the actual survival/crafting stuff into the game.  Would have been easily my favorite.  But I am just not interested in just a hunting game.			"

												Not anywhere near ready. It looks somewhat fine - the environment that is, but here it pretty much ends. The dinos movements are stiff, and besides the dinos have a very strange way of behaviour. Worst of all is probably the fact, that you do not earn credits - probably unless you kill a dinosaur, which is might hard, if not impossible. Wait before you buy this game - trailers make it look like an awesome game, but it is not anywhere near ready.			"

Although I was lucky to get this cheap out of a bundle I feel bad for the people that invested money into this alpha quality game.I will think twice in the future before I buy/invest in a game from this company.

Early Access Review
								In its current state the game is good, but not great. Its in Early Access and the devs are adding more dino types and game play tweaks so it should improve. Also the devs are active in the forums which is very good. The one thing that, for me stops it from being very good is the survival aspect, all this involves at the moment is just not being eaten by a dino. You are being asked to 'survive' but without any crafting abilities. So add some basic crafting elements, like crafting arrows from trees and dino feathers, health packs from the islands fauna and even teepee type structure made from dino skin and sticks, this would allow you to create a spawn point for the player. Expand on this and get your team to build some teepees together, then you've got a team camp to start your hunting from. If this kind of thing was added the game would be superb and should be on top of every dino hunters list. There are loot chest around the map which contain guns and ammo, but this feels like a 'cop-out' from providing any kind of true survival game mechanics.EDIT: and whatever you do, dont, and I mean REALLY don't, under any circumstances mention the word 'ZOMBIE' mod in the forums because you will get Phlamed by the games narrow minded FANBOYS.

The muliplayer is so much easier to setup in thehunter for thehunter primal you have to open ports etc so not alot of fun if you dont own the router. I wish they had an offical server or something as well.However the graphics arent bad and the dino AI is ""ok"" pretty much run and go prone and you will lose any dino that was formerly attacking you.

												While this game was really fun at the start, it got boring because how little the developers updated the game from the release, which was about 5 months ago. This game has gotten repetitive over time, and is not fun to play anymore. I'd rather have my money back instead of wait for another 12mb update.(EDIT) The game has basically been abandoned by the developers. There's a small bit of content released every... 2-3 months? Pretty sure that's accurate. Anyways, the last major update added a ""queen tyrannosaur"" into the game. So, it's an okay game that you can always come back to. Worth around $10 instead of its current price.(ANOTHER EDIT) Bleh... Don't even care about the game anymore. Hasn't had a single good update in about a year. Don't waste money or time, you'll get bored fast.			"

And they know you're there before you do, so if you get near one you die and thats how it is. a complete waste money, seriously dont waste 20 dollars this. Movement speed is so slow on a huge map with few supply drops and the same dinos over and over again. And theres litteraly nothing to do other than to be there and walk around realizing that your machete is better than shooting dinos in the face which makes exploring and finding weapons pointless and useless which made me wonder what there was to do and why even play.... The advertising is a lie.  Bad game, bad bad bad bad			"

												I really do not like to leave negative reviews on a game since I am a positive person overall, but this time it is different.First of all, I have played theHunter when it was a pay to win broser based game. Even though I did not buy anything I had a good time looking for animals, discovering maps (they are huge), and hunt the ones I had permission to. I spent around a long 20 hours with the game and was happy when it moved to Steam. However I did not buy it because I felt I would not play it.Then came theHunter: Primal with the genre combination of Survival/Hunting. I felt excited, I like both Survival and Hunting games and this could be the one game that I would love. The dinos made me even more interested and after a few days I decided to buy the game with a friend (I got it gifted since I had no cash FeelsBadMan). Well, let me tell you, this game, this one wannabe-masterpiece, was my biggest disappointment ever. This pile of junk could be the best walking simulator of the year. ""B... But why?!"" you might ask. Because this game is: Is not a survival game  - You literally have to rack up 60 tons of ammo and weapons before being able to solo-kill a ""Big"" dino, and you also have to track it down (While doing that the chance you die is up to 90%). You have no hunger levels, no thirst levels, only some stamina and your finite inventory slots with the most boring gameplay ever.  Is more boring than the Rock Simulator 2015 could've been  - You literally have no clue of what your purpose is, no point to play. You only, stack ammo, track, shoot, die, stack, track... and so on.The game ran well on my computer not counting the times when it randomly crashed. I meet the requirements to play the game but it did not go well. Not sure if they fixed it now though.PROS:- Can be fun with friends for some time (around 2 hrs)- ???CONS:- Bad graphics- Boring gameplay- Crashes randomly- Tons of bugs not being fixed- Small repertoir of dinosaurs- everything else.My rating would be a hardcore 2/10 - The only good thing in the game was the roleplay we did with some friends. After killing two dinosaurs we got bored though. Not recommended to anyone, I would like my wasted time back. Buy the original game instead, at least that is kind of worth the money.			"

												If you have an interest in dinosaurs and shooting games, this is a definate purchase for you. I have played since early access and the game has improved slowly and steadily, to the point where there is a decent amount of content.The learning curve is very steep for new players, even for a seasoned player losing all their gear and starting from scratch can be difficult. Don't let this put you off as the game offers many rewarding experiences once you get your bearings. You start off with a machete and must explore and loot settlements and chests to find gear. Once you have a few kills under your belt you may buy items from the store which strictly uses in-game money, there are no microtransactions.You will die often to begin with but with practice you can drop every dinosaur with a few arrows and then theres the other weaponry, which are all diverse and good for different purposes. Pistol, machete and .308 rifle are good for smaller dinosaurs, whilst Shotgun, .700 double rifle and .50 sniper rifle are good for big prey, like T-Rex.Killing every dinosaur is rewarding not only mentally but earning XP and money too to level up and buy items. When you kill your first T-Rex alone or with others, it's a very good feeling, and leaves you wanting more. Overall I recommend this game to those who are patient and can apperciate a good looking game, where stealth and aiming your shots plays a huge role. As I said before, if you are into dinosaurs in any way, shape or form then this is a must buy. Please don't let the bad reviews put you off, there has been significant patching of the issues mentioned in them. The game is very enjoyable as of writing this.9/10			"

												Hello, my name is Blackmagix95, and this is my review on TheHunter: Primal. I been playing this game ever since it was early access, and judging from my experience with the game, I recommend this game ONLY to people with a lot of patience and a sense of intelligence. Besides, most of the bad reviews on this game were made by players who played less than 30 hours or gave up on the game because the developers were barely adding content, even though they were working on new games like Mad Max or Just Cause 3. TheHunter: Primal is also nowhere near a survival game. It is more of a hunting stimulator, but with dinosaurs. If you really want a dinosaur survival game, go to freakin ARK. Last thing I want to see on the game's community discussions is more ARK favoritism and hateful rants.     Anyway, when I played the game at launch, I did had some terrible experiences with TheHunter Primal, but eventually I managed to learn from my mistakes and applied them to my skills.It is true, this is game is hard for new players but it is part of the learning process and requires patience. Once you begin the game, it is recommended that you find a group of people to hunt with, especially if one of them has experience with the game, but ASK FIRST. It is also important to put time into the game in order to have a basic idea on the game's mechanics and to understand the strengths/weaknesses of certain guns/weapons, the dinosaurs and their AI functions/behaviors, the hunting advantages/disadvantages in certain environments, and what parts of a dinosaur's body is best to shoot at. And lastly, do expect to walk a lot; the map layout is pretty big and there are some momemts where you don't run into many dinosaurs. That is where patience and intelligence is needed. If you can't dedicate the time to learn from the game, too impatient, or lack basic common sense, DON'T BUY THIS GAME. I used to join groups when I was a noob, but now I can solo-hunt with just a bow, a .44 magmum revolver and a machete/hatchet. Also, there are a lot of guides made to help new players out, and most of us pro-players are willing to provide tips/tricks for the game. Take advantage of them. Who knows... perhaps someday I may run into one of you new players. Do expect me to hunt naked since I got rid of all of my noble clothing to get more inventory space for stuff. DON'T DO THIS STUNT UNLESS YOU UNDERSTAND THE DINOSAURS. YOU WILL BE DINNER!			"

This is a good thing in my opinion as it adds another layer to ""the hunter"".For those of you who are thinking of buying this, play ""The Hunter"" first, it's free to play and it's a hunting simulator, so if you are not prepared to spend literally hours walking and tracking creatures sometimes without spotting anything for quite some time, this game is not for you.Try the hunter for free before dropping money on this game because they are essentially the same game. Just one has dinosaurs and no microtransactions, which is awesome.			"

Early Access Review
The game is in an really early state.Good points: Huge and beautiful map but clearly empty Dinosaur modelisation GPS system useful and intelligent Good sound designBad points: No Stereo makes you walking around to search chest/dinosaur Dinosaur animations jerky Dinosaur AI hilarious A lot of ergonomic simple things becoming complicated  Rate of loot/dinosaur totally random Artefacts/No running bugs depend of your computer 20$ early access is expensive Only 3 dinosaurs Not enough interest (No craft, no build, no point, no special area...)You have to know what you buy.I will change my recommendation. It depends of updates.Here's a little clip I have made:

												I went into this game after watching Jacksepticeye play it and i had high hopes for it: a dangerous planet full of dinosaur life and you must hunt while scavenging for suplies and survivng. While it sounds good on paper and sounds like it would be like the iOS game, Carnivores, this game is sadly a tedious attempt at a great game. Where Carnivores had good hunting strategies, sudden death as always a fear, fast travel, and a way to find your prey, this game lacks most of the listed. It is merely a running simulator, where you can literally press Q to automatically walk. The hunting system in the game is interesting to say the least. If you pick up on your prey's trail, you can actually track them on your device through their footprints and whatnot. The area is pretty well designed to say the least, giving the impression of a vast, open, and terrifying open world, but that is not the case. There are hardly any dinosaurs and the combat is done so♥♥♥♥♥♥poor its nearly impossible to kill any of the dinos. Not to mention walking around waiting for something to happen can get pretty tedious after a while. All in all, i would not recomend spending your money on this game. If you want to, then by all means go for it. Its not a terible game, but it will become boring.			"

												This game is exactly like ""Predators"" without Adrien Brody, Predators, or Lawrence Fishburn in a role that seemed a bit beneath him really.  Also, that ""Man of Steel"" appearance must have just been for his kid's college or something, am I right?I learned how to fly rather quickly in theHunter: Primal.  All you really have to do is walk into a field and try to remain hidden, then the big lizard birds do all the rest.  Tip: Hide in a tree until you regain bladder control.  8/10  (minus 1 point for making me open my router config.  Lame; and minus 1 point for making me feel small.)  Will play again.			"

												Update.  Time has passed the game is still around still a fun decent game to waste time on things are decently balanced . It is by no means a great game, but it is fun to run around with friends and go hunting. Please note this is not a crafting survival game  this is a hunting survival game. I do however suggest grabbing it on sale.  Have fun on the hunt !			"

												First off I must say that I've got to say that when I got this game it costed £5 on sale and a friend had bought me it. That said, this game is so bloody awesome! Is fairly scary as well. Playing with friends makes it better and slighty easier. But still hard enought to make it awesomly scary. I wouldn't pay full price for this game though, £10-5 is about the price range I'd pay.7/10 The standard price lets it down.			"

												I felt like I should write a review for this game.  First of all, I had a lot of fun playing it when it was first released.  The devs promised a lot more content, so I stuck around for a while.  I really love hunting games, and this game gave me dinos.  The AI at first was okay I guess, but barely realistic.  When the devs messed with the AI, the game became sort of broken.  Nothing was hard to kill anymore, even the trikes are stupid easy.  After I killed a rex with a bow, I got bored.  Almost 100 hours of mostly fun game time, though.  When this game becomes a three dollar sale, go for it.  Just know that it is very unlikely that this game will go anywhere.  ARK: Survival Evolved is taking over as the Dino Niche game for now.  I have that game, too.  It's much more fun, imo.  However, I can't REALLY say that I dont' reccommend the game...I can just say that it's not worth the current retail.  It's largely unfinished, and there are just too many bugs to make it a solid game.  Hope this helps.  Giving it a thumbs down over all, but wish I didn't have to.			"

Early Access Review
								Entered the game for the first time and decided to just run around to see a dino before playing seriously.After about five minutes of running around picking up rocks and scanning piles of dino-poo, I finally heard something unusual and turned around to see the male Utahraptor I had been tracking sprinting right at me.  Took me multiple times to figure out how to fire my bow but after four arrows and me crying like a little girl I finally killed the damn thing with a sliver of my own health left. ...Except I wasn't expecting the female to be right around the corner.  I managed to duck into the roots of an old tree fast enough to avoid being detected right as it ran by.  After accepting that my pants would be forever soiled I decided to play it ballsy and take on another Utahraptor with only a single arrow.  Three minutes of getting myself lined up later, I finally took what I thought to be my last shot before dying a violent death... Except the raptor dropped almost instantly.  Shot through the heart and got an insta-kill.  I'm not even mad that my butt got torn off by a T-Rex several minutes later while trying to find more ammo.  Worth it.Game needs some serious polishing still but shows a ton of promise for an early access game.  Would recommend.			"

												I am mixed with this game, overall the graphics and scenery is extraordinary. The combat system can be bit glitchy but is overall good, there are bugs with drop pods still which is very dicouraging for me since i spent most of my saved up money in the game and have to get it back by hunting more dinosaurs. There is bugs with spawning with no equipment at all, which sucks if you have a pack of dinosaurs around you. Id say i give this a 7/10 it would be a 9/10 if the bugs were fixed.			"

												This game is very good, stop comparing it to ""Ark Survival Evolved"" They have different teams, different engines and the aim of the game is different, give this game a chance, it is still early days for it im sure in the future they will have around 50 different dinos like the Brachiosaurus, Stegosaurus and even some swimming dinosaurs like the Kronosaurus, this game is great in terms of graphics and atmosphere, and you feel so satisfied when you kill a dino or find loot and the annoyance of when you die is very good, this game is great, if you dont like it, that is your problem but hate is not an option.

												It's quite decent compared to what ""The Hunter"" sounds like.+Friendly Community+Easy to learn+Supplies are easy to come by+Always someone willing to help you (atleast on regular none pvp servers)+no paying for permits like in the hunter-You can often die cheap deaths, LIKE 2 TREXES AMBUSHING YOU AT THE SAME TIME!-Little content gets added over time-LITERATELY IMPOSSIBLE to play alone-I'm not one to care about graphics, but for a game that was released in 2015 offically, up close the details of the landscape are horrible. (Playermodels and dinosaurs do meet standards though)Im willing to give this game about a 7-8/10.It has its share of problems, but it is quite fun once you establish a group and improve your aim.

												Hi Everyone! I bought this game 100% random & out of bordom to find something new to play. Both me & my friend bought the game, downloaded it and started playing @ the same time. A few good things about this game is that 1.) it will keep you busy and curious looking for new items to make you a better and more effective hunter. 2.) the hunt can quickly get difficult to keep you on your toes and making sure you are making every shot count.. but there is also some cons I have ran across while playing the game thus far, Like simple bugs in multiplayer as well.. But nothing too bad to really effect your gameplay too much. there is a leveling system in the game as well as a store in game asking you if you would like to buy items you can get in the world with coin that you get for hunting down and killing dinos! the thing that I find painful and boring is that there is no other way to travel.. Basically you will be walking and running.. Hiding and etc.. CONSTANTLY.. No fast travel, No swimming & no cars etc to help you get around faster and your stamina is horrible.. But, with a game that will have you constantly running I think they should make it last longer than it does.. Also something that really bothers me in this game is the fact that it is a survival hunting game, But yet you don't have to worry about food, shelter or etc.. so the game is NOT so in depth.. it's straight to the point here aim and take your shot and claim your beautiful new trophy, That is the 1 and only point to this game! if your looking for a more realistic and more in depth exsperince this game may not be for you, also there is no ability to build or craft ANYTHING.. and there is not really a big variaty of weapons here either.. But honestly it's something to play when your bored. so, the main question you may be wanting to know here is: is the game worth the $29.99 asking price... NO! Save your money.			"

												After playing this game for  quite some time, its time for me to update my review of it.The graphics and evniroment in the game are very very nice, in fact so much so that I have logged in at times just to get screenshots to use as desktop wallpapers. If you have a machine capable of reliably running this at the hightest settings, do so, its amazing!The gameplay is a mixed bag, there are issues like very low stamina and  lack of being able to swim for even a few feet or climb anything that put a lot of undue hardships on the player and kills what is otherwise a really nice immersion factor.The search for better gear is a bit tedious too and could have been handled a bit better.The actual hunting part of the game is quite enjoyable and is a nice mix of  fun and fear. The multiplayer modes are what you'd expect, PvP and PvE are both playable altho the hosting setup can be a bit buggy at times.The dinosaurs models are all very nice, altho the developers seem to have a feather fetish, and put them on damn near everything. The Dinosaur AI is.....well, OK at best and notably arfy at worst. At their best, the dinosaurs act like you would expect them to, nd its sometimes fun watching them from afar. I've seen a T-Rex seemingly following a heard of Trikes, and watched Utah raptors interacting with each other in a manner that seemed realistc. I would LOVE to see some actual dinosaur on dinosaur predation though, that would add immensly to the gameplay. On the other paw though, the dinosaurs seem to have senses and abilities that defy physics at times, able to climb terrain that they should not be able too, and detect things that they simply should not be able too see/smell/hear at times and be totaly blind to things they should be able to see/smell/hear at others. An animal the size of the quetzalcoatlus (as modeled ingame) should not be able to fly with a man sized object in its claws. They also have supernatural stamina, unlike the player, and can and will run clean across the damn island when wounded. Any animal that bleeds out to a noted point of say below 20% health should not be able to run for any notable distance....EVER! On the whole its still a fun game to play but the asking price is way too high. this is at best, a $20.00 us dollar game. Get it on sale, or part of a bundle and then its worth it.I would reccomend it conditionally, get it on sale, just don't pay full price for it. "

												Okay first thing I'm going to say, do not buy this game if your after a true hunting experience! It's far from that at the moment.I'd say this was more survive and try to hunt...mostly find a dino, shoot a dino, run from dino and then shoot it again. However for some reason I really enjoy this game, don't get me wrong it doesn't look the best in the world and it really doesn't play the best in the world, but if your wanting to play something that's relaxed and fun this is it. If you've got friends to play with you in game then you'll have even more fun!Go on...kill that REX!			"

												The idea was good, but the delivery not so much.For a hunting game, the handling of the gun is no where near good. Must of the time you can only shoot one bullet by 2-3 seconds.... and I talk about hand gun here. No change in behavior when a dino get shoot. You cannot stop theyre attack.The bird kill you one shot. Most dino have too much Hp. Dont get me wrong, they are dino, but with 2 shotgun at pointblank range, we only manage to scare away a triceratops... who just don't charge...  They are big coward. (and don't think about tracking them you will surely die from a bird attack or just never see him again)A lot of frustration await you if you buy this game.Yes this game can be save, but it will need a lot of polishing.Me ? Im done with raging, going for a next game. "

												Well now that it's not early access, it still kind of sucks. Honestly, if you're looking for a good dinosaur survival game, this is not one you should purchase. It has some ups and downs, like any game will, but this game is just not fun. You run around trying to find better crap, but die trying because all you have to defend yourself is a machete. By the time you're able to purchase the next weapon (a hand gun) you will have probably invested more time into the game than you should of. Unless you really feel that this game would be fun to you, save the money.			"

												The developers clearly spent their entire budget on the environment and the scant 4 dinosaurs the game actually has.  This becomes apparent as soon as you start the game or get a gun (which takes way to long).  The wepons themselves are incredibly lackluster and the animations are absolutely terrible.  Basically, this game is a walking simulator/xp grindfest with 4 dinosaurs in it.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this game.  In fact, your better off playing its predecessor The Hunter or any other game from the genre for that matter.			"

												Hi Everyone! I bought this game 100% random & out of bordom to find something new to play. Both me & my friend bought the game, downloaded it and started playing @ the same time. A few good things about this game is that 1.) it will keep you busy and curious looking for new items to make you a better and more effective hunter. 2.) the hunt can quickly get difficult to keep you on your toes and making sure you are making every shot count.. but there is also some cons I have ran across while playing the game thus far, Like simple bugs in multiplayer as well.. But nothing too bad to really effect your gameplay too much. there is a leveling system in the game as well as a store in game asking you if you would like to buy items you can get in the world with coin that you get for hunting down and killing dinos! the thing that I find painful and boring is that there is no other way to travel.. Basically you will be walking and running.. Hiding and etc.. CONSTANTLY.. No fast travel, No swimming & no cars etc to help you get around faster and your stamina is horrible.. But, with a game that will have you constantly running I think they should make it last longer than it does.. Also something that really bothers me in this game is the fact that it is a survival hunting game, But yet you don't have to worry about food, shelter or etc.. so the game is NOT so in depth.. it's straight to the point here aim and take your shot and claim your beautiful new trophy, That is the 1 and only point to this game! if your looking for a more realistic and more in depth exsperince this game may not be for you, also there is no ability to build or craft ANYTHING.. and there is not really a big variaty of weapons here either.. But honestly it's something to play when your bored. so, the main question you may be wanting to know here is: is the game worth the $29.99 asking price... NO! Save your money.			"

I met 3 other guys and teamed up. We made it through hunting small packs and avoiding rexes. It turns night and fog rolls in as we tread through the lush jungle and then about 8 or 9 raptors attack us! We killed 7 and the other 2 left. 2 members died that night.

												First off I must say that I've got to say that when I got this game it costed £5 on sale and a friend had bought me it. That said, this game is so bloody awesome! Is fairly scary as well. Playing with friends makes it better and slighty easier. But still hard enought to make it awesomly scary. I wouldn't pay full price for this game though, £10-5 is about the price range I'd pay.7/10 The standard price lets it down.			"

												I felt like I should write a review for this game.  First of all, I had a lot of fun playing it when it was first released.  The devs promised a lot more content, so I stuck around for a while.  I really love hunting games, and this game gave me dinos.  The AI at first was okay I guess, but barely realistic.  When the devs messed with the AI, the game became sort of broken.  Nothing was hard to kill anymore, even the trikes are stupid easy.  After I killed a rex with a bow, I got bored.  Almost 100 hours of mostly fun game time, though.  When this game becomes a three dollar sale, go for it.  Just know that it is very unlikely that this game will go anywhere.  ARK: Survival Evolved is taking over as the Dino Niche game for now.  I have that game, too.  It's much more fun, imo.  However, I can't REALLY say that I dont' reccommend the game...I can just say that it's not worth the current retail.  It's largely unfinished, and there are just too many bugs to make it a solid game.  Hope this helps.  Giving it a thumbs down over all, but wish I didn't have to.			"

												After playing this game for  quite some time, its time for me to update my review of it.The graphics and evniroment in the game are very very nice, in fact so much so that I have logged in at times just to get screenshots to use as desktop wallpapers. If you have a machine capable of reliably running this at the hightest settings, do so, its amazing!The gameplay is a mixed bag, there are issues like very low stamina and  lack of being able to swim for even a few feet or climb anything that put a lot of undue hardships on the player and kills what is otherwise a really nice immersion factor.The search for better gear is a bit tedious too and could have been handled a bit better.The actual hunting part of the game is quite enjoyable and is a nice mix of  fun and fear. The multiplayer modes are what you'd expect, PvP and PvE are both playable altho the hosting setup can be a bit buggy at times.The dinosaurs models are all very nice, altho the developers seem to have a feather fetish, and put them on damn near everything. The Dinosaur AI is.....well, OK at best and notably arfy at worst. At their best, the dinosaurs act like you would expect them to, nd its sometimes fun watching them from afar. I've seen a T-Rex seemingly following a heard of Trikes, and watched Utah raptors interacting with each other in a manner that seemed realistc. I would LOVE to see some actual dinosaur on dinosaur predation though, that would add immensly to the gameplay. On the other paw though, the dinosaurs seem to have senses and abilities that defy physics at times, able to climb terrain that they should not be able too, and detect things that they simply should not be able too see/smell/hear at times and be totaly blind to things they should be able to see/smell/hear at others. An animal the size of the quetzalcoatlus (as modeled ingame) should not be able to fly with a man sized object in its claws. They also have supernatural stamina, unlike the player, and can and will run clean across the damn island when wounded. Any animal that bleeds out to a noted point of say below 20% health should not be able to run for any notable distance....EVER! On the whole its still a fun game to play but the asking price is way too high. this is at best, a $20.00 us dollar game. Get it on sale, or part of a bundle and then its worth it.I would reccomend it conditionally, get it on sale, just don't pay full price for it. "

However for some reason I really enjoy this game, don't get me wrong it doesn't look the best in the world and it really doesn't play the best in the world, but if your wanting to play something that's relaxed and fun this is it. If you've got friends to play with you in game then you'll have even more fun!Go on...kill that REX!			"

								This is a really fun game. I enjoyed hunting the dinosaurs, exploring the map, and surviving. But some weird glitches and errors can accure although it is Early Access. The game could use a little more fixing & a new anti-bug program and ofcourse new dinosaurs so here are the following names of the dinosaurs they could try to add: Brachiosaurus, Pterodactylus, Dimorphodon, Rhamphorhyncus, Parasaurolophus, Stegosaurus, Gallimimus, Compsognathus, Microraptor, Troodon, Spinosaurus, Spitter Dilophosaurus, Styracosaurus, Mussaurus, Pteranodon, Dodo, Deinosuchus, Saber Tooth Cats, Pachycephalosaurus, Ankylosauurs, Hypsilophodon, and the most rarest dinosaur of all, the Diablous Rex. As my good review, I would say I recommend this game and yes, it does have some bugs in the game.			"

								Really enjoying this game, always was interested in a Day Z like game but zombies are realitively easy to deal with. Having to deal with 5 raptors stalking you and avoiding trex's however isn't so simple. This game requires some patience to learn, and it's all about being stealthly.I'm enjoying the pvp aspect of it the game as well, and for those of you who aren't into that you can disable the pvp altogether and enjoy the co-operative nature of the game. Definitely grab the four pack with friends.There's nothing quite like silently walking through the forest, running into another team of players and hell breaks loose. Half your team is dead, the other team is in the same rough state, and from all the gun shots you attract 3 raptors and a trex on what's left.The game can go from relaxing to very tense in just a matter of minutes.Yes I wished there was more dinosaurs, yes there are bugs, but it's a very enjoyable expierence and they went with the most interesting dinosaurs first. I would expect more species to come in future dlcs which I will happily purchase.			"

												{ A big pre-review what to expect in the game }First time i bought this game i quited in RAGE just because i didnt understand it. But after giving it 5th try i saw LOVE in my eyes. This game is so hard but so rewarding when you do your first kill of a Raptor, Rex or any other dinos in the world. Sneaking following trails with your ipod-map (not sure what to call it really lol but its your best friend) is so scary sometimes when you can hear a REX or Raptor closing in.This game is all about survival in a land where dinos rule land and air. So being a hunter you are also the hunted. This game is by no reason EASY it shuldnt its all about survival in the unfriendly island as a hunter.You start by landing by a pod randomly each time on the island. You start only with a machette and a uncovered map. So the first goal is to search for hidden chests in old bases or randomly placed over island. Do note that you will not allways find a weapon or ammo. Somtiems its just a map fragment or cammo clothes.If you are lucky you will find pistols,  rifles, bows, small bit of ammo and even health if you are lucky. The most important many seems to forget is that there is cammo clothes. They can make big impact how long you can survive. Crawling with a cammo can manke life changes many times when predators are close by.The only negative i have to say is that I dont understand why you cant jump up on cliffs or any other stuff like on bases roof? I would love if there was some sort of safe areas where you could SAVE your loot and equipments. Now you have to quit game for it to save it. Safe areas could also be used to discuss with all other human hunters in your game. Plan a REX hunt or any other specified animal. This could then be setup by a ADMIN if there was such controlls.End words, you get the most out of this game by playing online with friends. Singleplayer can be SAFE but its way harder. The forum community shines. So dont be affraid to ask anything. GFx: 9-10SFx: 8-10Gameplay: 7-10 (why cant you JUMP?)Scary YES worth it YES. Recommended all the way. Go for it!.. I still sleep with eyes WIDE open after hearing loud footsteps lol  :)			"

												Ok, so this game as an early access game was super impressing. It was new with a surprisingly familiar feel to it, and was superior to most other dinosaur games of that time. But several months after being available at the store, it was soon revealed to be ""finished"" and was somewhat abandoned with a lousy variety of 5 dinosaurs. It is true that during the early hours of the game are great fun and a good challenge, even to the seasoned gamer (unlike myslef XD) however after a few hours of similar game play, wandering through the forests with nothing but a machete and getting killed by the same sodding species of dinosaur (the Utahraptor) I truly grew bored. I would definitely reccomend ARK Survival Evolved over this game. It is truly a greater experiance and provides better gameplay. 6/10			"

												I think this game gets a bit too much hate. I personally think it's pretty good, but I can sure see where some of the complaints come from. The game isn't updated by the devs (at the current date of 12-11-16) which can be a big negative. Pros:- Good graphics, they look nice and pretty, and some of the scenery is pretty great.- There's a wide weapon variety to use to hunt dinosaurs down with.- The game also sounds well. You can easily tell the direction of dinosaurs, and identify which they are.- Multiplayer works well and is fun. Teamwork is highly recommended due to the dangers the game has. I've also had no issues with lag or bad pin.- The game is also quite welly optimized. I had no frame drops in my time playing it.Cons:- As of 12-11-16, the devs are no longer adding content, but they have done a bugfix update a few months ago.- There's a low variety of dinosaurs to hunt. I'd say the game needs about 3-4 more, and then it would be enough.- 1 map isn't really enough for the game. It needs 2 maps at least, althought 3 would be quite nice!I think this game gets more hate then it needs. I got this game for 10 dollars. It used to cost 20 dollars. At 20 dollars, this game isn't worth it, but at 10, I think it has aroud enough to justify the price tag.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a really fun game. I enjoyed hunting the dinosaurs, exploring the map, and surviving. But some weird glitches and errors can accure although it is Early Access. The game could use a little more fixing & a new anti-bug program and ofcourse new dinosaurs so here are the following names of the dinosaurs they could try to add: Brachiosaurus, Pterodactylus, Dimorphodon, Rhamphorhyncus, Parasaurolophus, Stegosaurus, Gallimimus, Compsognathus, Microraptor, Troodon, Spinosaurus, Spitter Dilophosaurus, Styracosaurus, Mussaurus, Pteranodon, Dodo, Deinosuchus, Saber Tooth Cats, Pachycephalosaurus, Ankylosauurs, Hypsilophodon, and the most rarest dinosaur of all, the Diablous Rex. As my good review, I would say I recommend this game and yes, it does have some bugs in the game.			"

								theHunter itself was a game I enjoyed due to the relaxed (but at times so intense) gameplay. Then there was this. I like Dinosaurs. I like theHunter. This is just beautiful. The scenery is wonderful; I stood amazed at the moons before having my head torn off by a featherunnydino thing. I'd really recommend this to those looking for something relaxed, but then again ever so intense.. I cannot wait to find a T-Rex!  "

												I think this game gets a bit too much hate. I personally think it's pretty good, but I can sure see where some of the complaints come from. The game isn't updated by the devs (at the current date of 12-11-16) which can be a big negative. Pros:- Good graphics, they look nice and pretty, and some of the scenery is pretty great.- There's a wide weapon variety to use to hunt dinosaurs down with.- The game also sounds well. You can easily tell the direction of dinosaurs, and identify which they are.- Multiplayer works well and is fun. Teamwork is highly recommended due to the dangers the game has. I've also had no issues with lag or bad pin.- The game is also quite welly optimized. I had no frame drops in my time playing it.Cons:- As of 12-11-16, the devs are no longer adding content, but they have done a bugfix update a few months ago.- There's a low variety of dinosaurs to hunt.

Early Access Review
								Really enjoying this game, always was interested in a Day Z like game but zombies are realitively easy to deal with. Having to deal with 5 raptors stalking you and avoiding trex's however isn't so simple. This game requires some patience to learn, and it's all about being stealthly.I'm enjoying the pvp aspect of it the game as well, and for those of you who aren't into that you can disable the pvp altogether and enjoy the co-operative nature of the game. Definitely grab the four pack with friends.There's nothing quite like silently walking through the forest, running into another team of players and hell breaks loose. Half your team is dead, the other team is in the same rough state, and from all the gun shots you attract 3 raptors and a trex on what's left.The game can go from relaxing to very tense in just a matter of minutes.Yes I wished there was more dinosaurs, yes there are bugs, but it's a very enjoyable expierence and they went with the most interesting dinosaurs first. I would expect more species to come in future dlcs which I will happily purchase.			"

												Ok, so this game as an early access game was super impressing. It was new with a surprisingly familiar feel to it, and was superior to most other dinosaur games of that time. But several months after being available at the store, it was soon revealed to be ""finished"" and was somewhat abandoned with a lousy variety of 5 dinosaurs. It is true that during the early hours of the game are great fun and a good challenge, even to the seasoned gamer (unlike myslef XD) however after a few hours of similar game play, wandering through the forests with nothing but a machete and getting killed by the same sodding species of dinosaur (the Utahraptor) I truly grew bored. I would definitely reccomend ARK Survival Evolved over this game. It is truly a greater experiance and provides better gameplay. 6/10			"

												You think the original theHunter game was good? Then you should try this. You like kill stuff... Like dinosaurs... It's cool, trust me. I mean who doesn't like dinosaurs? They're awesome. Okay, but seriusly. I love the game! Good grafics, cool looking dinosaurs and you just gotta love the scenery. It would be cool if they added more dinosaurs and maybe some more weapons, but over all this is a great game and I recommend this. Can sometimes get annoying when everything in the game tries to kill you. 9/10			"

												{ A big pre-review what to expect in the game }First time i bought this game i quited in RAGE just because i didnt understand it. But after giving it 5th try i saw LOVE in my eyes. This game is so hard but so rewarding when you do your first kill of a Raptor, Rex or any other dinos in the world. Sneaking following trails with your ipod-map (not sure what to call it really lol but its your best friend) is so scary sometimes when you can hear a REX or Raptor closing in.This game is all about survival in a land where dinos rule land and air. So being a hunter you are also the hunted. This game is by no reason EASY it shuldnt its all about survival in the unfriendly island as a hunter.You start by landing by a pod randomly each time on the island. You start only with a machette and a uncovered map. So the first goal is to search for hidden chests in old bases or randomly placed over island. Do note that you will not allways find a weapon or ammo. Somtiems its just a map fragment or cammo clothes.If you are lucky you will find pistols,  rifles, bows, small bit of ammo and even health if you are lucky. The most important many seems to forget is that there is cammo clothes. They can make big impact how long you can survive. Crawling with a cammo can manke life changes many times when predators are close by.The only negative i have to say is that I dont understand why you cant jump up on cliffs or any other stuff like on bases roof? I would love if there was some sort of safe areas where you could SAVE your loot and equipments. Now you have to quit game for it to save it. Safe areas could also be used to discuss with all other human hunters in your game. Plan a REX hunt or any other specified animal. This could then be setup by a ADMIN if there was such controlls.End words, you get the most out of this game by playing online with friends. Singleplayer can be SAFE but its way harder. The forum community shines. So dont be affraid to ask anything. GFx: 9-10SFx: 8-10Gameplay: 7-10 (why cant you JUMP?)Scary YES worth it YES. Recommended all the way. Go for it!.. I still sleep with eyes WIDE open after hearing loud footsteps lol  :)			"

								 I'm sorry to say that this game is truely a joke. I purchased this game for a friend and myself only to find out that neither of us could log in past the intro.  Neither of us have had any issues with other early access games we have played. Its as if i took $40 and thru it in the trash can. I understand  we need to expect bugs in the game but to pay for a game you cant even launch is fraud in my book. We both have made sure that everything was up to date on our computers before making this statement. I will make sure i never purchase another game on steam before i do alot of research.			"

												The developers abandoned this game.The developers thought they were good with just 5 dinosaurs in the game:-Utahraptor-Velociraptor-Tyrannosaurus-Triceratops-QuetzalcoatlusI won't lie. I bought this game in early access, thinking the devs would actually care about this game since, unlike their free to play disaster of a game theHunter (where you had to PAY FOR A HUNTING LICENSE) this game was actually liked, and brought in money. The concept was really great, the visuals weren't too bad. But in the end they just quit. Not long after it became early access were they finished. Probably because they got enough money and called it a day.Don't buy this game. It feels as half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥as it did during early access			"

												This is a strange one, its difficult, frustrating and downrght annoying but can be compelling and thrilling at the same time.  I have however wasted many hours in the persuit of avoiding large dinosaurs intent on eating me.  The worlld is beautiful with a cycling day, rain, storms, fog etc, you can spend hours wandering around the huge island with lush landscapes just admiring the view if it were not for the nasty reptiles hunting you.  And they do hunt and smell and follow and flank.  All very clever stuff.  It is not a finished game and needs more to do, more dinosaurs and a purpose but I love it, it makes me thing, anyone looking for a shooter type experience will not find this enjoyable, its slow paced, guns and ammunition are scarce and even when you do amass weaponry, dying - which you do frequently, will be lost and you have to re track to the point of dying to retrieve, another game in itself.  I can understand why its not universally liked but what it doies it does well, occasional blips and the odd bug but nothing serious and stable as hell on a lan.Highly recommended as is but in anticipation of more dinosaurs to come and NOT chargeable dlc please.

Early Access Review
 The Hunter: Primal Early Access Review  Positives	- Dinosaur's are highly detailed,fitting Sound and movement animations ( since last patch)-Terrain is absolutely beautiful (set to max resolution)-The majority of the community is friendly, and willing to help out a hunter in need of assistance.-The Terrain is large and comfortable size, your stamina recovery rate is just perfect to make sure you can run and keep an eye out for predators.- Weapon sound and animation's are spot on- gives you a customizable option to wear selected camo such as Merc Spec - Ops, Noble Gear, Settler gear etc.They've included feathers on the dinosaurs (which personally i have really enjoyed as it gives them such a unique look like no other dinosaur game has done, like the Utahraptor has an amazing look thanks to the Feather pattern. negatives	- Have encountered a few pesky,annoying bugs.-If you fall in the water, you cant swim out and you have to helplessly watch yourself drown...-Game has crashing issues, however they are working towards fixing that and so far there has been a drastic improvement.-Some dinosaur spawn point's are glitched - Take for example i joined a game and had three T - Rex's in the area, I did not survive as expected.-inventory space is quite small, hence you will have to be very careful as to what you keep in your inventory because take for example if a t rex is charging at you from a distance you will want to start shooting at it with your scope, but when he gets closer you would like to switch to iron sight but you may have a full inventory space so you would have had to drop it..-Some dinosaurs get stuck in the terrain, which is rather unfortunate in my opinion. My Summary	i am going to write from an honest point here, i think the game is absolutely brilliant, The Dev's love the community and are willing to help the community in any way. Playing with other hunters is a must do, because sometimes you can get yourself into a really sticky situation it's always best to have someone watch your back.Some situations can be so intense for example hiding under a bush when a T Rex is standing right next to you.Or the absolutely wonderful feeling you get when you find a .700, or noble gear for example.Even walking halfway across the map to meet up with your fellow hunter just gives you this great feeling of relief and joy.For an early access game, i say this is a MUST PLAY! so go on, get the game - support the devs they really do deserve the support!Thank You			"

												This is quite possibly the worst 20 dollars i have ever spent on a game. I have reasons why i don't reccomend this game.1. as soon as you spawn in and get your machete you think your fine. wrong you walk 50 feet and raptors kill you.2. thier are only 5 dinosaurs in the game and all of them except 1 cant be killed with the machete.3. the developers do not give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about this game anymore thier has yet to be any content changes since i bought the game 6 months ago.4. this game is filled with bugs to were dinosaurs hit you from ridiculous distances and dinosaurs getting stuck.5. your stamina is pointless you swing a machete 3 times and your guy gets tired. you sprint for 5 seconds and you guy gets tired.6. you just got done fighting a T-rex and climbing a volcano to a base and whats your prize hmmmm ♥♥♥♥ing nothing just same old♥♥♥♥♥♥that you already have.7. why is this labled a survival game when their is no thirst, hunger, injury, or weather effects, i want to feel like i truly need to survive.These are just a few reasons why i hate this game. Now onto what the game is good for.1. the environment of the game makes you actually feel alone just hearing the growls of raptors you can't see.2. it was a good idea making a challenging game that encouraged you to take risks and hunt danagerous dinosaurs.3. the use of team work in this game is important always have a buddy never go alon i like that aspect.unfortunaley these are the only good things about the game yeah i could say it looks good if it were 2012 but its no it looks average, but no i do not reccomend this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game			"

My Summary	i am going to write from an honest point here, i think the game is absolutely brilliant, The Dev's love the community and are willing to help the community in any way. Playing with other hunters is a must do, because sometimes you can get yourself into a really sticky situation it's always best to have someone watch your back.Some situations can be so intense for example hiding under a bush when a T Rex is standing right next to you.Or the absolutely wonderful feeling you get when you find a .700, or noble gear for example.Even walking halfway across the map to meet up with your fellow hunter just gives you this great feeling of relief and joy.For an early access game, i say this is a MUST PLAY! so go on, get the game - support the devs they really do deserve the support!Thank You			"

												Trust me... I have played 100+ hours... It is no way a finished game and all the other reviews here will say the same.I could forgive all its faults as I have had a fun time messing around with this if it wasnt for the fact there is litterally no end game. WHAT AM I DOING HERE?			"

												Seemed like a simple fun game. But movement is so slow, and it lacks a lot of content. There is also not a lot to it, multiplayer-wise. It had a lot of promise though and I really like the feathered take on the raptors. Shame.			"

												The game and its developers are a big disappointment. It is by no means close to being finished yet has been designated as such (so they can begin charging for further development or drop this project and go on to another one ?)Lesson learned - 1) do not buy Early Access games, 2) Do not buy any games from this software developer (Expansive Worlds, Avalanche Studios)			"

												At first i was really excited about this game. After a while it seemed the developers don't really want to spend alot of time on the game. It's more like a cashcow for their 'baby theHunter'. The amount of content is so small, that it would fit better as a DLC for theHunter. This is one of those games that i'd call 'a waste of money'. Too bad, because it has alot of potential if it had full attention...			"

												I feel like with this game they couldn't decide whether to go along the survival route or stay on the hunting side of things. There's not enough resources or craftable items to make this a survival game but there is also not enough loot drops to make it a hunting game. Poor in my opinion. So much potential and they wasted it. It just comes across as laziness. Can be a laugh to play with your friends a couple times but the map is too big with great expanses of foliage, with raptors everywhere, to meet up easily and not enough weapons to make your way to your companian. I don't recommend buying this game.			"

												Worth $5.00 for sure. Its just like in real life. Track, seek out, kill, then go home or in my case uninstall.  Something to do though for that kind of money. Graphics are decent. No exciting loot drops, not really a survival game (nothing to build), other than being killed by a wild dinosaur. There are minor goals with the game, go here and there, play tag with drops the people who put you there. Not really disappointed with this game but you can tell its not a winner. I had more fun with The Stomping Ground. At least you could drag people around and laugh at them. Over all, go play ARK, way more content for the good dollar. "

												Very fun game.  AI is unique with how each dinosaur tracks and attacks you.  Always short on ammo, forcing you to change up weapons and learn how to use everything.  Scenary in the game is beautiful.  Helps to have good speakers to hear all the different sounds, on more basic speakers it is too easy to mistake rex and trike.And......oh BOX!!!!!!!! ~runs to it~			"

												♥♥♥♥ing terrible. Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. Your character starts with an improvised machete and the stamina of a newborn kitten. You then walk around very slowly (or run for about 5 seconds before your stamina is exhausted and takes forever to recharge) in a dull, lifeless environment to find dinosaurs. When you find them, you need to use your improvised machete (possibly made from discarded plastic scissors) to swing 4 or 5 times at them as they dance around you, before losing all your stamina. At this point you're forced to join them in their dance, as neither of you can really do anything to change the situation, you bring limited by the poor tools at your disposal and them being limited by the cripplingly stupid AI.I award you no points			"

I came, I saw, I killed queens.I can't say that I strongly recommend this game, but that doesn't mean that I don't recommend it at all. For those who are interested in hunting, tracking, dinosaurs, and cooperation read on. The game is far from perfect and at times there are graphical issues that I do feel shouldn't be a part of a 'finished' game. When you use 'x' to free look for example, you can see through your character models body. It isn't a terrible issue that makes the game unplayable by any means, but you can't help but feel like that was something that the developers just decided to leave as is, instead of cleaning up the code and flushing it all out. I've also felt this unfinished feeling when a raptor charges me only to get glitched into a rock or the surrounding environment.The auto run feature, which you use by pressing 'q', is an amazing implementation and I wish more games would incorporate such (listen up DayZ devs, I'm shouting in your direction). If you like dinosaurs, the hunting experience and are able to handle some wandering around across a pretty large map this game is exactly what you are looking for. It is difficult, however, so be forewarned that nothing about this game is easy...especially if you are after the queen rex. I spent about 45 minutes hunting my first rex with a buddy of mine and this was both a stressful and satisfying experience that most games don't offer. The actual feeling of accomplishment upon taking down such a large and terrifying creature was worth the pain staking game of peek-a-boo we played while implementing strategical shots to the beasts vitals. I personally enjoy the hell out of this game. The display chart of where you hit the beast is an exceptionally well done & very rare feature of the shooter genre. You want to go for the vital organs as headshots on dinos don't do too much damage. Remember how they have tiny brains? To top off the chart, it shows who did what, how many shots you each hit the dinosaur with and where. (ex: the lungs, the kidneys, the heart, the spine, intestines, liver, body shots, etc.) and then it continues to break up the stats into a nice percentage read out. For example with the t rex we took down, I dealt 88% of the total damage and was able to see my shots highlighted on an x-ray chart of the dino, likewise, my buddies fired shots that hit and overall damage (22%) were displayed. You then get to take a screenshot of your accomplishments for all to see. You are able to determine your location and meet up with other players via the GPS that you spawn with. Yes, you can place markers on important locations and yes there is a distance displayed on all your squad mates so you can spread out and cover more ground. As you roam, keep the GPS equipped in your left hand and search for others dead bodies and loot spawns. The GPS is also an incredibly valuable tool with which you will be able to track dinosaurs and recieve updated information about them (their species, their sex, etc.) You will also be able to tell how damaged a beast is that you have already wounded, what % of life they have left and where you hit them.The weapon selection/dino variety is limited (I believe that there are only five dino species at the moment, all of which are aggressive, even the herbivores) and this is something else that makes the game feel slightly unfinished  -- lack of content -- You can find clothing that increases your ability to hide (ghilly hats, shirt, pants, etc.) but again, there aren't many customization options for your character. There are a few attatchments you can add to weapons, only optics related: red dot, scope with zoom, etc.  No suppressors or compensators, extended magazines, flashlights, etc. A couple weapons I've used so far include the .308 single shot pistol, the .700, the shotgun with slugs ammo type, the .308 rifle with scope, the riot shotgun, the assault rifle and the anti .308 along with the bow and arrow setup. I know that a .50 cal sniper rifle is in the game, but I've had no interest in using it after having the .700.There are dinosaur calls used to attract certain breeds and you can use dino eggs to cover your scent. You will find mushrooms littered throughout Eden, but be cautious as they can lead to death!Two of last things I'd like to touch upon are the graphics and the audio of this game. The vegatation/forestation is epic. The night to day transistions are graceful and seem wonderfully natural. The dinosaur models are quite detailed. The weather effects are something to pay attention to as the rain/fog cuts your vision. It becomes crucial to be able to listen in the distance for the raptors calling to each other and planning their attack(s) or to hear the mild thunder of a Rex off in the distance looking for prey.Final Word:Pick the game up when it is on sale, don't expect a ""Triple A"" experience, and don't play it alone. If you aren't into dinosaurs, hunting, or co-op don't bother.			"

Early Access Review
								Game has potential and i love theHunter original game, however at this point its not a good game its a how long untill you die game.  Graphics look great like the original, sounds are cool and imursive which is what you want.  The gameplay not so much.  You start off with just a bow and 5 arrows in a world that currently only has tricerotops which act like deer when you get close and tyranasaurus and raptors.  Now thats all cool and dandy but the fact your suppose to find better gear in this huge world with only 5 arrows to start and your surronded by these predators makes for very not fun gameplay.  No matter where you spawn there willl be either a raptor or trex near by, no joke.  also one major bug ive noticed is when you attack a raptor pack (yes i said pack they are never alone) if they kill you that same group will stalk right to you when you respawn. NO JOKE, try it attack one group die and start walking and you'll noticed there is a group stalking you.  If  you had better gear id accpet that but 5 arrows folks thats it. Also attacking is not easy you can shoot your 5 arrows into a raptor and he still will not go down, which make self deffense very hard to do when hes attacking.  And running away lol come on be realistic.It has Potential but at this point its more frustrating then fun, i'm still giving it a positive review because i have high hopes for it, and i know what they did with the original hunter so *fingers crossed*			"

												I honestly wanted to be able to recommend this game, but I just can't. Not as it is right now.The level system is an interesting concept, even though it's only a means of artificial prolongation, however... You need to be level 10 before you can even buy a pistol, which means you're stuck with a bow until then, and I had enough money to buy 15 pistols by the time I was ALLOWED to buy one (even though I also feel the pistol is over priced for what it offers). ""But you can find guns in crates and sparse ammo"" True, that is something you can do, but as it stands right now over almost 12 hours I've encountered more T-rex than ANY, OTHER, SPECIES, PERIOD. (And 90% of the time there's been one OR TWO T-rex in one of the limited areas where a gun is likely to spawn.) Currently, the rex tanks bullets from anything like a massive sponge. Shoot it in the brain, heart, lungs, intestines, doesn't matter; takes 30 or more shots to bring it down. Add with that the extremely clunky mechanics or firing and it does nothing but frustrate the hell out of you. They also camp on your body after killing you and if you're close enough to hear their footsteps then they're already walking towards you. They haven't noticed you, yet, but they will. Even walking they move faster than you, try to run and they'll see you, lay still and they'll walk up and stomp you to death; so you can forget about going back to your body to get your gear. - The level system needs to be rebalanced, badly.- T-rex are entirely too hard to kill, a dozen 12 gauge slugs to the chest, at least half to the lungs and heart, doesn't even phase it. Same with buck shot and .308, currently they just soak whatever you throw at them and refuse to die until you've emptied clip after clip into their organs. (Though I will admit I haven't tried the .700 or .50 cal yet, mainly because I'm not allowed to even buy one...)-There are only 4 species currently, and of those expect to see more T-rex than any other species hands down. In order of frequency, from most to least, I encountered: T-rex, Utah raptors, Triceratops, Velociraptors. They both need more variance and need to rebalance how many there are. I've run into 2 T-rex in one place at least 5 times; that's just silly. - You move so slow. SOOOOOOOOO slow. Stamina runs out very fast, regenerates rather slowly, takes you forever to get where you want to go only to run into a T-rex and die instantly. Well, not instantly, it SEES you instantly, then you empty every single round you have into it, face, chest, intestines, whatever tickles your fancy; then it eats you. - Audio, especially the rain, cuts in and out frequently. Textures also act very weird, mainly trees when they're on the edge of rendering distance. Trees looking like they're made out of netting is the best way I can describe it. Once you get close it fixes but during play it's no bueno. There are a lot of negatives about this game right now, it's glaringly obvious how unfinished it is, and that's fine. It's early access, that's what you should come to expect, but it is NOT worth buying in its current state unless you are an incredibly patient person. The game looks pretty good, it might give you some feelings of nostalgia if you played Carnivores when you were younger, but that's about it. (There's also no trophy room, like we had in Carnivores, and I feel like that would be a great addition.) I've tried really hard to like it, and been nothing but frustrated the entire time. Most of this stuff can be fixed, and hopefully it will, but like any early access game it's a gamble. It feels like a pre-alpha at the moment with the horrendous balancing and lack of content. If you like the game as it stands and think I'm being too harsh, I'm happy for you, you're a more patient person than I am, but I experienced 11 hours of frustration and maybe 30 minutes of enjoyment.TL;DR: As it is now, I strongly feel it's not worth buying. Wait until it's more polished, if it ever is, and since you don't know if it will be that's why it's not wise to buy into it now. It's extremely frustrating and there's a distinct lack of anything resembling entertaining content at the moment. Save your money for when it's more polished (again, if it ever is) or go spend it on a game which won't make you want to throw things out the window.UPDATE: Still poop. Only now it's ""officially released"" poop.			"

COD noobs just expect its hardcore dino slaughtering like Primal carnage or Orion . its not. its patient and realistic hunting with realistic movements , i must admit tthere are a few bugs in the game but they will be fixed! and if u say 5 dinosaurs is not enough? your crazy just absolutely crazy and probably havent even killed  1 dinosaur bigger then the velociraptor yet.

												Do not pay attention to all the non-recommends. The developers are patching and fixing bugs as they go along. Excellent, UNIQUE, game play. This is part of the reason it gets bad reviews, its not what people are use to. One size fits all difficulty, best gameplay experience, join open games. Port forewarding internet play. This game probably is not worth 60 dollars, however it also does not cost that much. Buy, Join, Play, then constructively give criticism to the developers for a much better gameplay experience.			"

												Spend twenty minutes walking at a snails pace around a big, admittedly gorgeous looking but largely empty island looking for loot boxes so you can grab a bow and arrow. The arrows unfortunately are too weak to kill anything and you will be killed by a triceratops. And then any progress you might have made towards getting any equipment that actually lets you play the game will be reset when you close the game.			"

								FPS Dark souls, with dinosaurs! Make sure to grab your only bow and 5 arrows! (I played on a closed server to try and learn things my self before bothering with online.) In a world, where you can only run for 5 seconds, and it takes 30 minutes to regain full stamina!What kind of game has a space dop pod....an amazing GPS/animial tracker device, and gives you a ♥♥♥♥ing bow to start with? And ♥♥♥♥♥♥ A.I. where dinos can be seen across a field then somehow they start B lining it towards you as if they would be able to actually see you that far away.Needs updates bro.			"

The game is great! Tons of potential. Minimal bugs. Fun to play with friends.Servers are much better than dayz/arma. people actually act like people and play together.Good graphics. Good sounds. Fun gameplay. Dinasaurs are awesome.CONS:needs more content. Play with people. alone I would not be as into it.Worth it now? maybe.For sure worth it after a few patches and more content added.			"

												This games gaphics are so great it will blow your brain out of your skull. This is one of those game that stands out 5 different dinosaurs! (T-rex, Triceratops, Utahraptor, some flying one, and Velociraptor.) I got this game because this a perfect combo graphics, dinosaurs, and surviving. I cant wait to see what happens to this game in the future!Since its no longer in Beta it seems a litte empty. The should at least add dinosaurs and fix bugs. Well they are fixing bugs.The game is great. But the price, eh. Lower the price please.I like dinosaurs....			"

								Great fun walking around looking and exploring, and then you meet a dino, and you die. Restart, walk around, find cache with loot, meet dino and die. Would be good if devs implemented crafting, and building into the game. But msot of all, make it easier to kill dinos. 3 arrows to the head of a raptor should be more than enough to kill it.I don't recomend this game as it is now. Not even 3 gunshots kills the raptors...			"

												Survival isn't easy at the best of times, even less so against ravenous Dinosaurs. So don't expect an easy ride here.There are a number of complaints I'm seeing in the review that suggest to me that most people are out of their comfort zones with this game.I'll say this; This game is awesome and compelling but not the sort of thing you should expect to be great at right away!When I first began I got mauled by a T-rex within about an hour. Then I met the Raptors and got eaten alive. Slowly but surely I got the hang of the noises they make, their movement patterns and how to use my inventory effectively.I treated it like a Rogue-like and got better as I went on, I'm now playing on a file where I'm armed to the teeth and still going after several hours of surviving! It feels great to have gotten to this stage.I don't usually do this but I'll lay out a few pros and cons for this game as there are a few things I feel could use some polish to really put the cherry on this tasty Dino-cake;Pros:1) Huge, lush, GORGEOUS environment with varied lighting and weather.2) Intelligent, smoothly animated Dinos with unique features and weak points.3) Easy to use inventory system4) Feathered, (almost) accurate dinosaurs! At last!5) Raptor selfies! (Trophy shot option)Cons and nitpicks:1) Some dodgy sound transitions, especially when approaching the beach. The ocean sounds don't fade in very well.2) Online features could be better implemented. Not a huge problem for me though as I prefer to play solo anyway!3) NOT ENOUGH DINOSAUR SPECIES!! Come on guys, this is my main complaint.I love this experience as it is but seriously; ONE herbivore type? Hell just stick some un-killable Sauropods in there if you must but please add some more to the roster. T-rex and two types of Raptor is challenging and cool but again a bit more variety would be nice.So, in conclusion:This is a great survival game if you can cope with its tough difficulty curve. It's a genuine pleasure to master it but time and patience is required; for tough-guy shooty action, look elsewhere.I can't think of a better single player Dinosaur experience on Steam at the moment and my only reall issue is with the severely limited variety of Dinosaurs in the game.Add some more herbivores and perhaps one new mid-sized carnivore and this would be a must -have.[EDIT] With reguards to 'Game breaking bugs' people have found so far, it's poor form for a dev to have left so many in there at release. However, my review doesn't mention them as I have had the good fortune not to have encountered any of them in my playthroughs!This review is my opinion based on my experiences playing the game, if you don't like it, that's cool. You'll have to excuse my ''Glass half full'' attitude.			"

												Gets the dinosaurs right. Otherwise, as boring as real hunting, except your are undergeared, and gear you find is totally random and sometimes has has weird level requirements. Like at level 1 you can use a .308 bolt action rifle (if you find one and .308 ammo), but you can't use tactical boots.Another bummer is no steamworks vpn. Having to open firewall ports for co-op is tired/old-n-busted/lame. They should Spend less time on coming up with witty acheivements and more on implementing steamworks vpn.			"

												Let me start by saying that based on what i can tell about this specific title it's a bare bones EA title that was labeled as finished prematurely. The game is for all intent and purposes D-E-A-D! The reason i say this is due to the fact that it was released as a supposed ""finished"" product before any of the promises were even made, updates are almost non-existant, any bugs from when it was EA and labeled as finished were never fixed, in addition to the fact that the amount of content in this game is 5 dinos and a massive forest.Granted the world and the dino models are beautifully done, and i admittedly haven't played much of this specific title it is good as a generic time waster while waiting for an update on steam to download. Other then that, you're better off spending money on stranded deep or even the isle then this one.			"

												This game is alot of fun,especially with 3-6 or more players. However, when there are that many players competing for the sparse amount of ammo it presents an unwanted competition. I suggest creating another way to obtain ammo,(other than dying or commiting suicide). Either by reward or allowing players to use their EG's to buy it. Increasing the amounts of ammo found in boxes would help. I, and all my friends that play, have dropped the .50 cal because there isn't enough ammo. A token or or some other unique pouch, case,crate etc. to allow a player to create ammo would be a bonus.Happy Dino Hunting......Lancelot1			"

								The game is called theHunter: primal, I play the orginal game, theHunter, was really thinking game would invovle actual hunting some dinos, kinda like Jurassic Park 2, dangerous as hell but still hunting.However, this game involves very little hunting, you start with a longbow and have to crawl around hoping that you stumble upon a crate with a firearm, although, even then ammo is pretty rare so even then you cant do any proper hunting since on your own you have a hard time taking out anything  besides the smallest dinos, and a solo roaming dino here and there. This shouldnt be called theHunter, since there is very little actual hunting in it, theSurvivor would be a better name.If that is your cup of tea, go ahead, you might like it, I got fooled by the name and thinking it was like the original game, a hunting game.

												I do not recommend getting this game as it is now. However if its on sale definatly check it out and to support the developers. (Its also a lot better to play with friends)The only thing I really dont get is that this is a full release, but really it should still be in Alpha.Alpha is mainly the additions being added to the game.Beta is mainly the fixing of bugs and glitchs from those additions, etc.It seems like the devs are doing both of these at the same time in a scatterbrain sorta way.Pros:-Open world-Great Graphics-Amazing Sounds-Easy Controls-Nice dino animations (can be a little glitchy at times)-Co-op and multiplayer is fun and smooth (depending on host)Cons:-Many bugs-Can't swim-Cant climb/Jump-Cant build/place anything, not even traps-Only 5 dino types in the world-Weight system is very limited (leaning more towards realism)As for the content in the game so far, its quite playable but limited in the variety of dinos to hunt.there are lots of different ""biomes"" and areas to explore in the world.I would love to see more herbivores added as there is only one. The ratio is 4:1 (5:1 counting pvp) so be very cautious this is a survival game that relays on your senses and judgement for life or death. Tip:If its storming out, wait it out. A T-Rex came charging at me full speed and I couldn't react becuase visability was so low. Nearly had a heart attack.Verdict 6.5/10Playble, fun online and rewarding (when you finally get that T-rex down)			"

Thankfully i got it from starbundles for 0.40 euro and im still sad that i spent my money on this♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I do not recommend getting this game as it is now. However if its on sale definatly check it out and to support the developers. (Its also a lot better to play with friends)The only thing I really dont get is that this is a full release, but really it should still be in Alpha.Alpha is mainly the additions being added to the game.Beta is mainly the fixing of bugs and glitchs from those additions, etc.It seems like the devs are doing both of these at the same time in a scatterbrain sorta way.Pros:-Open world-Great Graphics-Amazing Sounds-Easy Controls-Nice dino animations (can be a little glitchy at times)-Co-op and multiplayer is fun and smooth (depending on host)Cons:-Many bugs-Can't swim-Cant climb/Jump-Cant build/place anything, not even traps-Only 5 dino types in the world-Weight system is very limited (leaning more towards realism)As for the content in the game so far, its quite playable but limited in the variety of dinos to hunt.there are lots of different ""biomes"" and areas to explore in the world.I would love to see more herbivores added as there is only one. The ratio is 4:1 (5:1 counting pvp) so be very cautious this is a survival game that relays on your senses and judgement for life or death. Tip:If its storming out, wait it out. A T-Rex came charging at me full speed and I couldn't react becuase visability was so low. Nearly had a heart attack.Verdict 6.5/10Playble, fun online and rewarding (when you finally get that T-rex down)			"

Early Access Review
								Yes, I do recomend this game but there are a few thing's that are coolGoodFun to roam around with some friend's and lootGreat graphics in my opinonLove the theme.It's fun all around.Bad-The Utahraptor's alway's seem to stay in the same area that your in. I know that they can smell and everything. But it doesn't really help sitting in a tree Prone for like 30 mins just to walk around and do the same thing.-The T-Rex seems to be a ninja some time's just randomly knowing where your at.-I like the bow and everything but it' not that good. I can see that you dont want it to be too OP. But when you first play the game and the raptor's or the T-Rex's are right next to you it does not help. Please at least give is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pistol with the bow so we have somthing to fall back on. -When some one disconects it shows the annoying black screen and wont let you play until they disconnected fully. -Some time's when you pull out your PDA, or look in your inventory it will crash your game.-Also one more thing to add is that I dont think the stamina recharges fast enough when your walking I get where that's coming from but still. I could run around stop for about 20 seconds while walking and be able to run again another mile.I still love this game even if this happens. I have the highest of hopes for this game. Can't wait and see what you guy's do next.			"

												Save yourself $32 CAD, and go buy Ark: Survival Evolved.theHunter: Primal was released before the defined date by the developers. The intentionally cut the game short to release ""version 1.0"" which only has five dinosaur species. It honestly sounds like the game isn't getting anymore major patches either.Defeinitely disppointed in the developers.Pros:DinosaursActual hunting mechanics. Shoot a vital organ? Does more damage. Too many bad shots? You ruin the trophy.A very realistic game. You need to camoflauge, and survive against the dinosaurs. They'll also actively look for you through scene.Multiplayer is generally a friendly community.Cons:There's no more major updates as it looks like. Which effectively kills the game.Each ""pro"" factor mentioned above is fun for about an hour or two, until it gets boring.The game can be fun if you play multiplayer, otherwise you're going to get bored quickly.Progression system sucks to begin with. You are given a makeshift machete, and will have to die repeatedly, maybe getting a kill in to progress. You progress by killing dinosaurs. If a dinosaur takes too much damage, it will run. It will run faster than you, and thus your melee attacks will render you incapable of getting a kill, halting your progression before it starts.Would not recommend. I did a first-impression to the game if anyone is interested.

												I got it on sale and still feel like I wasted my money. You spawn with no weapons. If you die, you'll be even worse off than you were before. It's still pretty glitchy and graphics are about 10 years behind at best. The game is designed to be played as a multiplayer game. You can host your own game and play alone if you'd like. Statmina runs out after about 100ft or so. Really? Why is it that nobody ever does their homework when making these games. I feel like most healthy people should be able to run at least a mile without walking.  Don't let me talk you out of getting this game though. Go waste your money and try it for yourself.			"

I figured id wait and check up on the updates.  But the updates stopped coming. It left early access, and  the devs walked away. I feel a bit cheated out of my money, but oh well. Stay clear of this game. Invest in something  better.  Like a  cheeseburger. Or a Taco. Or a kikstarter game. No jk those are terrible.  Like  this game.			"

												There really should be a third option for whether or not you recommend the game. That third option should be 'Meh'.  I do enjoy playing this game but I find myself spending more time retrieveing my corpses than I do hunting. The Devs really should fix the level requirements for purchasing weapons when you die, for example, the first hunting rifle you can purchase requires level 30. Hence, spending most of your time retrieving your corpse to recover any decent weapons you've already found. I really don't see myself playing this game long enough to hit level 30 as it is now.			"

												Yes this game has bugs, yes this game has glitches. But its still in development, and as far as i know, hasnt been dropped by developers. One of the only downside to this game is the lack of content; dinos and weapons. the lack of dinos makes this game a little repetitive and quite boring if on your own. But this game is great with friends, you get the thrill and excitement of having a t-rex hunting you down, but the boring travelling or stalking parts are contered by being with mates.   Dinos become less of a problem as you learn to be able to escape and evade them, and once you have learnt where to shoot certain dinos, all weapons become very good, and not underpowered as some people mention.Overall, this game is worth the £7, especially if you have friends who will join you. The thrill of managing to stalk a trike, and the accomplishment of killing it with a single arrow will makeme smile any day. And the ability to hide under a Rex's or Utahs nose without being killed is a nervous ordeal which makes this game play incredibly enjoyable. and not to mention the lush surroundings and fliping creapy calls and growls from certain dino's.

												I played for about two hours and got killed zillion times. You can't enjoy the game if it keeps killing you every 10 minutes. How it goes: at first you have your machete and you walk around with it. Then you see a dinosaur and you die. The End. Ok, that's what's going on most of the time. I do managed to kill one utharaptor with my rusty machete, and then i bought bow. And I was thinking ""oh my, at last i can shoot at things!"", but then i had to exit the game (lunch time) and when i ran it again - my bow was GONE. It seems if you have something, you must use it right away to earn more money. Yeah... then i tried to kill another utharaptor with my machete so I could buy another bow, but i just died, died and died... If you're theHunter or Carnivores fan - I DO NOT recommend it. Avoid it at all costs. But if you have masochistic needs... go on, buy it. Graphics and sounds ar nice. Yeah, those are really nice. 4/10			"

Its so tense laying on the ground at the edge of a tree line looking out onto a big opening and seeing a Tyranosaurus slowly step by step getting closer and closer, do you shooot ? do you run ? or do you lay still??? this game is constantly making you think and I for one LOVE how they achieve that, the online playis also very good teaming up with other players to track dino's down together.

												I started playing this game a few weeks ago and began liking it. The game is enjoyable in single player or multiplayer and the progression of items and levelling provides incentives for progression. The difficulty is a strong draw for me (though other players may not like intense difficulty). However, the numerous string of bugs that have gone on unfixed (after reading well before I started playing) is frustrating. Of note the recurring issues I experienced were: inventory items not saving, level progression not being saved, frequent game crashes/false starts. More frustrating however is the reaction the devs have to constructive feed back - no responses/acknowledgements nor plans for fixes. The patches target minor glitches that rarely negatively impact the player base -or- increase content. Content increases aren't a bad thing at all, but when there are no published plans or discussions for fixing major game issues it's a problem because it indicates that fixing major issues is not a priority. Further, it appears that efforts to discuss these issues are censored from their discussion forums as numnerous posts I have made (and others read) were subsequently deleted within a day of writing. The posts were professional and constructive in nature and contained no derrogatory language.Note: The discussion forums are moderated to not allow negative discussion of game facets (even in a professional and constructive manner).

												I have played this game fpr awhile now and I have decided it was worth my money. There is no sub fee or any way to use real money to become better then others. There are only 3 dinasaurs at the moment but they all provide a challenge. The utahraptors travel in pack usually. Sometimes you'll find one alone. The Triceratops wont attack unless you get to close or attack it. And they are hard to kill. The T-REX is difficutlt but not impossible. When dinasaurs get hurt badly they run away or attempt to. Thats what the T-REX did it ran because it was near death. I almost killed it but didn't happen. The game has around 6 or 7 guns. You do have to find all your weapons and when you die you do start over but its a survival game. I rate it a 9/10 in early acess. I will update this later.12/19/2014-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So i'm back! I started playing this game again and I have to say they added a lot of new things. You now get currency when killing dinosaurs and you also level up. Now you can buy items depending on your level and the dinos you've killed. They have also added quite a few dinosaurs and it feels just like the hunter now.2/4/2016-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------			"

Of note the recurring issues I experienced were: inventory items not saving, level progression not being saved, frequent game crashes/false starts. More frustrating however is the reaction the devs have to constructive feed back - no responses/acknowledgements nor plans for fixes. The patches target minor glitches that rarely negatively impact the player base -or- increase content. Content increases aren't a bad thing at all, but when there are no published plans or discussions for fixing major game issues it's a problem because it indicates that fixing major issues is not a priority. Further, it appears that efforts to discuss these issues are censored from their discussion forums as numnerous posts I have made (and others read) were subsequently deleted within a day of writing. The posts were professional and constructive in nature and contained no derrogatory language.Note: The discussion forums are moderated to not allow negative discussion of game facets (even in a professional and constructive manner).

												I have played this game fpr awhile now and I have decided it was worth my money. There is no sub fee or any way to use real money to become better then others. There are only 3 dinasaurs at the moment but they all provide a challenge. The utahraptors travel in pack usually. Sometimes you'll find one alone. The Triceratops wont attack unless you get to close or attack it. And they are hard to kill. The T-REX is difficutlt but not impossible. When dinasaurs get hurt badly they run away or attempt to. Thats what the T-REX did it ran because it was near death. I almost killed it but didn't happen. The game has around 6 or 7 guns. You do have to find all your weapons and when you die you do start over but its a survival game. I rate it a 9/10 in early acess. I will update this later.12/19/2014-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So i'm back! I started playing this game again and I have to say they added a lot of new things. You now get currency when killing dinosaurs and you also level up. Now you can buy items depending on your level and the dinos you've killed. They have also added quite a few dinosaurs and it feels just like the hunter now.2/4/2016-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------			"

												A wonderful gem of a game that is allot of fun to play. A mature aproach to hunting is required to benifit from the true elements of this game. Some claim the developers abandoned the game unfinished. That is not true. The game is in its finished state and is perfectly fine the way it is. It is better to leave it alone than to ruin a game with over development. Appreciate the fact this game will run on any pc and looks gorgeous. Its fun to just explore and take photos as it is to hunt dinos or humans. The PVP or PVE option will accomodate those who enjoy having thier stuff still in inventory should you quit and rejoin later. This is a wonderful game that is a true classic deserving of your collection. Everyone also google search "" A gun for dinosaur.mp3 x-1"" and listen to it before or during your first game. Happy hunting.			"

								This game is pretty cool at the start, but i find it annoying how difficult it is to stay alive for a while, ive been killed few times by a T-Rex and mugged by some Raptors.....THEY GIVE YOU A F****** BOW/10 ARROWS, you have to find guns in the Crates around the map. which i'm sure randomly spawn, if you see a T-Rex just ♥♥♥♥ing run unless you got some firepower, Raptors... well you ""can"" kill them with your bow, but i ran out of ammo quickly and died. Yet to Encounter more Dinosaurs. So i won't stop playing it.At first its more like you're the one being hunted, until you get some good guns (if you live long enough)So far ive only played by myself, and i'm pretty sure with some friends like 3 or more you can survive with some effort.+im pretty sure some of the features in-game are from The Hunter, like (Dinosaur Droppings to Help Hunt them, and the little Device you use to Identify the Poop and find crates)Overall you really need to play with people and/or Friends to get your moneys worth(you can do it by yourself), Yet even still i did enjoy most of it!!My Review is Mixed, i'll Thumb it up because its not bad....but playing alone is pretty annoying "

								It's the best game I've played dinosaur so far, the graphics are excellent, the controls are easy to handle. It is one of those games that you always keep alert because at any moment could appear a dinosaur and kill you, which is an advantage that has the game because thanks to that the people who play it are not bored, besides this the thrill of finding weapons and objects that will help you survive what also excites the player. We all expect more variety in terms of the dinosaurs but that's something the creators already have planned.			"

												Positives;Hello all, Firstly I would recommend this game to anyone, I have so much fun its crazy, I've meet alot of great people and had alot of fun with them,(not like other on-line games), You can either sneak around and search for loot boxes and dodge the beasts (isn't easy) or you can go straight out and track, hunt and kill, or shoot what ever you see and trust me, finding a beast to shoot at is easy as there is plenty around, while looting you dont always get what you want but it can't be too easy can it, I mean we are hunting Dinosours after all, lol. Secondly, The story line is easy, you have been sent there to clear the land so it can be colinized,(simple hey), I've played over 100 hours and I still havn't been all over the map so there is still plenty for me to see, Usually I'm to busy hunting to explore but that would depend on your mood at the time I guess. As you progress though the levels you can buy bigger and better guns (which isn't needed but makes for some fun), Unless your a bad shot like me,lmao. Cheers to all who make the game possible as I will play till I can't. also there is pvp mode, player verse player, if your into that. The game it self is an open world so you can go anywhere you want and I just love it.Negatives;There has been some issues in-game but have been worked out (well for me there all good now after the new patch). So yea, buy it, play it, survive it, hunt em, kill em, lol. Cheers.			"

												This is kind of a whird game. There does not seem to be much to do besides run around, get gear and hunt dinos. Other players as well. It's pretty fun if that's all you want to do is attack random  dinos. It's pretty funny when your buddy gets picked up by one of the flyers and screaming. If your looking for any kind of story, this game is not for you. But, if your just wanting to to run around and hunt dino and people, it's a fun time!			"

												Great overall game, runes decently not too many bugs. Its pretty basic you kill dinosaurs with your friends and try not to be killed in the process. Good game, and has the potential to be great, just excpect to throw away a few pairs of pants if you buy this game ;) .			"

								First Impressions:The ambience and scenery are nice, though they could admittedly be a bit better and more realistic.  At present there are only three dinosaurs with two more coming...not exactly a wide variety.  In addition to more dinosaur types, I'd like to see a survival element added to the game (hunger, thirst, etc.) that could be toggled on or off since some hate mixing and matching hunting and survival.  The stamina bar runs out a bit too quickly for my taste as the average human being can sprint longer than say, two to three seconds.  With all of that said, the idea of hunting dinos is a rather appealing notion and I can't wait to see what else gets added over the course of development.  The price will increase at launch, so either buy it now or wait for a sale if money is tight.

												As early access, this game was great.  Updates kept adding good things to the game, like new weapons, better dino behaviors and looks, the leveling system, etc.  It was shaping up to something good.  Then they decided to declare it done and release it... and added quetzalcoatlus.  Quetzalcoatlus is just buggy as hell, ridiculously overpowered and aggressive, hovers over everything and anything of importance, and it clips through the ground to pick you up, making it impossible to shoot at it as it comes down to swoop you off [you have a limit of how far you can aim up and down].  Just... avoid it.  Avoid it at all cost.  If you do feel adventurous, then wait for it to be on sale.			"

												I liked this game but it is not as good as it could have been this is what the game needs.Crafting.velociraptors, trex and utahraptors should hunt triceratopsutahraptors,  should be scared of trexadd ankelosaur it should have much health and much damage and trex whould hunt it.add more flying reptails(like pteranodon)add water creaturesadd more dinos(like ankylosauros with much health)add more biomes(like desert and artic)Predators should hunt herbivores and some should be scared by bigger dinosaurs and some herbivores should be scared of some predators and such.Multiple types of each dinosaur.Veachicles(like boats,submarines,cars,armored cars or trucks,some sort of planes and such.)Nicknames in teams.More weapons.npc hunters/settlers.story(and ability to win)maybe different eras(like ice age and other dinosaur eras)way bigger map.islands.dinosaur fights(like trexes that fight each other.Natives that live on primal eden.A super dinosaur. A dinosaur that has been made in abs in primal eden from the time manny humans lived there... Tyranosaurus Deus a mix of all dinosaurs and with the brain of a human that there is only one of. Score would be atleast 1 bilion. This would be a challenge and have all of the best trait of each dinosaur and maybe also become invisible and blend into each enviroment but it would be a little visible also all dinos would be afraid of it and it woudld be atleast 20 meter. Even trex would run when this 10 ton beast would walk and the earth would shake. Please add this stuff.I still like it but as i said it could be way better.			"

Usually just slow walk strafe around enemies.On top of this there's no guidance at all, you need to be online to play solo, game runs pretty♥♥♥♥♥ etc.			"

Early Access Review
								Love this game! lots of friendly players (as long as you dont play PVP ofcourse!), and lots of unfriendly dinos! to be an early acces game i think its incredible and still has lots of potential!it can be a little too tough start, when you have no camo clothes (so every predator sees you insanely easily), and a bow, but as soon as you understand how things works and whatnot its awesome!Ofcourse its a lot more fun to play with friends, since its kinda hard to communicate ingame (except writing in chat) and sometimes you just dont have time to write that a pack of raptors or a T-rex in coming straight for us and how to attack or where to hide.The one most annoying thing tough, is that there arent alot of game hosts, so when playing with friends there can be hard to find servers with space for all of us. The other problem is that the game crashes a bit too often (there are weekly and sometimes even more often updates so i think this is gonna disappear)So far i have 28hours on record and even though it have some crashes and whatnot, i think its awesome and are continiously recommending it and trying to get more friends to buy it, because ""The more the merrier""! + u can sacrifise them to dinosaurs by throwing rocks at their position moahahahahha!8/10 (not 10/10 because of crashing and to few hosts)10/10 if taking into considering that its an alpha and under development.

												Hunt, Explore, Survive? More like Die to invulnerable dinos, Wander aroudn the same area, and have zero threat or challenge untill a flying trex comes down a mountain and lands on your face. A quick push out of a game, cheaply done in a VERY small amount of time, the EA lasted like four months in total, theres only 5 types of dinosaur in the game. There is zero ""surviving"" in this game, you just run around with weapons and either die to a dino, or kill it. There is no hunger, no building, no crafting, no traps, thers NOTHING! The amount of bugs is insane, flying Trex, yeah seems legit to me. I cant believe this company is pulling this and I will never support them again. There is no ♥♥♥♥ing content in this game, you wander around an island and shoot♥♥♥♥♥♥at dinosaurs who kill you 9/10 times because of zero balance, AND THATS ALL THERE IS TO DO. They promised it was P2P and that there wouldnt be subs or micro transactions, thats because they planned on releasing a half done game and calling it done, and then releasing weapons and dino DLC packs to once again nickle and dime their ♥♥♥♥ing customers, what a ♥♥♥♥ing joke I cant believe I fell for this scam.

								Like the graphics and the sub tropical setting but I'm not too thrilled about becoming raptor chow every five minutes. Another thing I would suggest is to let players keep the inventory they died with in the multitude of Utahraptor attacks.....it would give players a bit more of a fighting chance as the game goes along because there seems to be raptors EVERYWHERE......and they are sneaky devils. Also maybe when a player DOES happen to kill off a raptor.....let the dead be a distraction for a minute or so to give said unfortunate player a chance to get away and heal. and PLEASE please please try to figure a way to get into the trees as a way of escape.Other than the afore mentioned issues ...I would recommend the game for anyone that has ever dreamed of Jurassic Park as a hunting reserve.....hehehehe			"

								Don't worry it doesn't have the same micro transactions as theHunter does. It's a one-time payment with no purchasing of guns in a store for real money. The game in its current state seems alright. It has some connectivity issues and some crashing. These are to be expected in an early alpha build. There are only 3 species to hunt atm, Triceratops, T-rex and Raptors. The AI seems to be iffy at times. They will stand around taking shots before they start attacking you or they will just out right not see you sometimes. But when the AI works it's terrifying. The raptors hunt in packs, both the T-rex and raptor will stalk you. The survival aspect isn't much yet. You don't have to worry about starvation or thirst. You can't craft weapons or anything yet. You basically survive by not being eaten. But they could extend on this as time goes on. If you are the least bit interested in a Dino hunting/survival game give this game a shot.  "

								Do not buy this game, if you love running and gunning, spraying and praying as you go. This is a squat and stalk game. Ammo is scarce and you only get a primitive bow to begin with. Did I mention you spawn in bright yellow pajama's ?  That being said this game has more immersion than most. You get carried away in the great ambiance of the jungle. The sound is amazing. The first time you get surrounded by a pack of raptors, or hear the booming footfalls of the T-Rex as it approaches the bush you're cowering in and lets out a screen rattling roar. It's enough to get the adrenaline pumping through your veins. As you learn the subtle clues of what is in your area and where they went you actually feel as if you are hunting game that can hunt you back. There is great satisfaction in out witting a pack of raptors and coming away victorious . As far as still being in early release this is by far the best looking early release I've played yet. It already feels very polished and runs very smoothly. I honestly expected to spend a lot of time tweaking the graphics in order to get the best FPS. Yet this is not the case at all. It already has the feel of a properly optimized game. I have played big name games that felt way less polished. And the Dev's actually read your feedback and forum comments and not only respond but patch the game when something new they've put in makes the game not what the community wants. That is a first. Of all the early release games I've tested errr. uhm played this is the first where you feel the Dev's care about the players and aren't just rolling their eyes at us.			"

								For many years i've always wanted a game similar to Lucas Arts' ""Tresspasser."" THP is the closest sans the narration by Sir Richard Attenbourough (John Hammond), w/c lent a brilliant eeriness to the environment. Primal Eden is so like Site B in Trespasser, but much improved and with more realistic dino behavior. The gameplay is much simplified and more user friendly in THP. It only needs more dinos like the Brachiosaur or Ankylossur. Love this game.			"

												230+ hours experienceI started playing this game early February during early access with some friends and we had an absolute blast playing this game. I have had more fun playing this game than I have playing any other game. When we first started out we were crapping ourselves with every noise we heard and were just about crawling from base to base. When we found weapons, the fun exponentially increased as we were able to kill our first raptors and eventually hunt our first T-Rex. But, even though we had weapons we were still at the mercy of the dinosaurs.We eventually had a shot at the PVP gameplay, with... mixed results. It was incredibly fun to play because the only way you could tell if someone was near you was by physically seeing them or hearing their gunshots. Playing PVP really kept you on the edge of your seat as you never knew if you were in someones sights and you didn't necessarily want to fire your gun in case you alerted people to your prescence. And hearing gunshots was just as terrifying because you can tell people are close, but you had to try and locate them using surround sound and the loudness of the gunshot. Although it was frustrating to lose your equipment, as my friends and I have lost the best gear several times, being killed by players or the dreaded cheater... The PVP experience was another amazing aspect I enjoy to this day.To complete my review, my feelings toward this game are that it is the best gaming experience I have ever experienced. But due to lack of care and the greed of the developers it has somewhat withered away behind other games such as ARK, (I do not plan to play ARK. Riding dinos? Really?!). Anyway, this game had the potential of becoming something much more that it was initially planned to be, but the developers have seemed to ignore the game and the community which has led to a LOT of flak from the community and players.My #1 suggestion would be to keep updating the game with patches and more content, but this seems to be out of the question. So I think the BEST option for the continuation of this marvelous game would be for the developers to open the game to modding in the Steam Workshop. This would mean more great content and patches for the game without consuming the time of the developers.			"

												Game is overall nice. However for some reason, my game will not play any audio for the game. Even though the game is heavily dependant on sound, I was limited to only sight. nice game but more needs to be added. such as a starter weapon or some sort. More animales to be hunted on a larger map. now I would like to recomend this game to people however i cannot due to the possable audio error that I have. Paying $20 is not worth half the game. Either get a fix on this problem or watch the sales drop			"

												I liked this game but it is not as good as it could have been this is what the game needs.Crafting.velociraptors, trex and utahraptors should hunt triceratopsutahraptors,  should be scared of trexadd ankelosaur it should have much health and much damage and trex whould hunt it.add more flying reptails(like pteranodon)add water creaturesadd more dinos(like ankylosauros with much health)add more biomes(like desert and artic)Predators should hunt herbivores and some should be scared by bigger dinosaurs and some herbivores should be scared of some predators and such.Multiple types of each dinosaur.Veachicles(like boats,submarines,cars,armored cars or trucks,some sort of planes and such.)Nicknames in teams.More weapons.npc hunters/settlers.story(and ability to win)maybe different eras(like ice age and other dinosaur eras)way bigger map.islands.dinosaur fights(like trexes that fight each other.Natives that live on primal eden.A super dinosaur. A dinosaur that has been made in abs in primal eden from the time manny humans lived there... Tyranosaurus Deus a mix of all dinosaurs and with the brain of a human that there is only one of. Score would be atleast 1 bilion. This would be a challenge and have all of the best trait of each dinosaur and maybe also become invisible and blend into each enviroment but it would be a little visible also all dinos would be afraid of it and it woudld be atleast 20 meter. Even trex would run when this 10 ton beast would walk and the earth would shake. Please add this stuff.I still like it but as i said it could be way better.			"

												As early access, this game was great.  Updates kept adding good things to the game, like new weapons, better dino behaviors and looks, the leveling system, etc.  It was shaping up to something good.  Then they decided to declare it done and release it... and added quetzalcoatlus.  Quetzalcoatlus is just buggy as hell, ridiculously overpowered and aggressive, hovers over everything and anything of importance, and it clips through the ground to pick you up, making it impossible to shoot at it as it comes down to swoop you off [you have a limit of how far you can aim up and down].  Just... avoid it.  Avoid it at all cost.  If you do feel adventurous, then wait for it to be on sale.			"

												Hunt, Explore, Survive? More like Die to invulnerable dinos, Wander aroudn the same area, and have zero threat or challenge untill a flying trex comes down a mountain and lands on your face. A quick push out of a game, cheaply done in a VERY small amount of time, the EA lasted like four months in total, theres only 5 types of dinosaur in the game. There is zero ""surviving"" in this game, you just run around with weapons and either die to a dino, or kill it. There is no hunger, no building, no crafting, no traps, thers NOTHING! The amount of bugs is insane, flying Trex, yeah seems legit to me. I cant believe this company is pulling this and I will never support them again. There is no ♥♥♥♥ing content in this game, you wander around an island and shoot♥♥♥♥♥♥at dinosaurs who kill you 9/10 times because of zero balance, AND THATS ALL THERE IS TO DO. They promised it was P2P and that there wouldnt be subs or micro transactions, thats because they planned on releasing a half done game and calling it done, and then releasing weapons and dino DLC packs to once again nickle and dime their ♥♥♥♥ing customers, what a ♥♥♥♥ing joke I cant believe I fell for this scam.

												I'm not much of a review guy but I'll give this a go, and sorry in advance for a very crappy reviewWhen I first saw this game I fell in love instantly, and seeing as it was an early access game I ignored most of its flaws. I won't lie, I enjoyed it a lot the first few hours. But as fast as I heard about the so called ""full release"" I lost hope completely. I mean it's pretty clear that it's an unfinished game lacking a ton of content. Sure we can expect that glitches and bugs will get fixed in future updates but if they have no plans of future content such as survival aspects and new dinosaurs I wouldn't recommend it.			"

Early Access Review
								THIS GAME HASa immersive game world superb graphics great soundnice gameplay great creature modelsBUT THIS GAME DESPERATELY NEEDS  a easier way to get into multiplayer games with friends and less crashing whilst in games that are in progressSome community as well as player servers. Be wary all people buying this game that all player multiplay servers die / cease to be when the player who created the server leaves the game. Not good when you have put a lot of time into a game on a server. There is no game save or save on items found.players need a way to traverse water to waist height or ability to swim in the water. What is the point of water if it acts like a wall ?  a better way to obtain and maybe craft some weaponscraftable camps or shelters to heal and hide or just to be safe and chat with fellow playersbinoculars > obvious reasonssome sort of shop > but make it like team fortress and not a complete rip off like the hunter isif this game goes the way the hunter did i will neg the review instantly. more clothing wandering around in a bright yellow t shirt and half length french pantaloons spolis the mood / immersion. Also everyone right now in game seems to be wearing the same....dullMaybe some sort of save of some achieved game items. Whats the point in joining a server then building up a weapon arsenal only for the person who created the server to decide to take the server down resulting in you losing everything ? You then have to start from the very beginning again on a new server. Its frustrating and not your fault when this happens. But it feels like you are being penalised.More Dinosaurs. There arent many at the moment			"

												If you want a WORKING multiplayer dino game with actual replay value get ARK.

								Don't worry it doesn't have the same micro transactions as theHunter does. It's a one-time payment with no purchasing of guns in a store for real money. The game in its current state seems alright. It has some connectivity issues and some crashing. These are to be expected in an early alpha build. There are only 3 species to hunt atm, Triceratops, T-rex and Raptors. The AI seems to be iffy at times. They will stand around taking shots before they start attacking you or they will just out right not see you sometimes. But when the AI works it's terrifying. The raptors hunt in packs, both the T-rex and raptor will stalk you. The survival aspect isn't much yet. You don't have to worry about starvation or thirst. You can't craft weapons or anything yet. You basically survive by not being eaten. But they could extend on this as time goes on. If you are the least bit interested in a Dino hunting/survival game give this game a shot.  "

								As you can see I have little time in-game, I wil tell you why.I spawn, instantly notice a beautiful game, not just with looks but total immersion, sound and sight.I find a box, nice some rounds and some med kits.Notice mountian/volcano, go for a small walk up said hill.Find a lovley base at top, with some clothing and two 12g shotguns, but no ammo, damn.Path leads to dead end, head back down, not the way I came, just incase I am being followed.I then get to a massive tree, like huge, notice other trees, appreciate the effort gone into the wildlife etc. in the game.fine a hide-ie-hole in one of the big trees, I think its awesome, so cool infact I step inside.Look around, nothing, go back outside.I am confronted by a T-Rex, slowly backed into said hide-ie-hole.He leaves, I try to mak a break for it, notice a tail hanging from a bush, look round.Bam, Raptor to the face.Honestly the best introduction to a game.

								Pros-Amazing scenery, graphics-Dinosaur AI is fantastic (Raptors hunt you down in packs)-Not too hard to find weapons-Giant Map-Has some player customisationCons-Buggy (first day in early access, will get better)-only 3 types of dinos (will get more)-only a few guns(will get more)All in all, i would recommend this game. While there are some bugs, It's very playable.  While the dinosaurs are pretty hard to kill, that's to be expected, considering the skin of one is almost an inch thick, plus the bones are thick as well.It's possible to kill the UtahRaptor with just one arrow (through one lung even). I would rate this game a 6/10 at this stage, considering it's its first day. I expect many updates from the Dev team, and this game to get much better. "

								This has so much potential to be a truly great game but it has quite a ways to go, which I will get to. The atmosphere is fantastic even though I've spent most of the game alone trying to reach other survivors. You can sprint but it's loud so you have to desperately take your time and on the rare chance that you do meet up with someone, the feeling is great because you are two, now. The map is large but not infinite, allowing you to reach other players if you can survive the trek. It can be scary at times, when you're crouched next to a bush hearing something far off coming closer. Trying to guage where it's coming from. And how many they are. Very tense moments, like the first time you see a Rex from far off. The game does change a bit once you find a gun or two. I know it's a hunting game but when all you have is 5 bows, you aren't hunting anymore. You're fleeing to the safety of other players and the slim chance of good luck along the way. There are things that I love about this game. The 8 year old in me that still loves dinosaurs more than anything else loves the bejesus out this game. But there are some issues. The crashing is still bad. That is going to need to improve quickly. It's hard to develop a rhythym when players are constantly getting dropped. I'm on win8.1 and I'm not lagging. But it still crashes all the time. The other big issue and I swear it's not because I'm bad, but the aiming mechanism is awful. Bow""hunting"" is nearly impossible. The guns are a lottle bit better because you don't have to draw them back but it still ain't great. The game gets choppy to the point of death. And then you respawn all the way across the map and have to sneak, crawl, and walk a good 4000m to reach the other players. The game has a way of spreading you all out .So. It has amaing potential but right now, developers, this has to get better. Like, $20 better, if you catch my drift. Please don't let this die.			"

								To the survivor who isn't dead yet...The forest was dense, very dense. The grass itself was at my waist, the bushes a sprawling wall of green and the trees...I feel so small on this planet. Small and insignificant. My first feeling is fear, I could almost smell it on myself. The sparse yellow outfit I was provided feels severley unquipped for the rigors of this harsh world. This was only  compounded by the fact that they felt it was suitable to equip me with a wooden bow and some arrows...have they ever crouched in a bush, the yellow of their outfit stained a filthy brown as they♥♥♥♥♥♥themselves in pure and utter terror, my bodies defensive response to a T-Rex not 3m from me, its nostrils flaring as it snorted the air...I'm surprised it didn't smell my fear let alone my pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Then again, there was a pile of its own♥♥♥♥♥♥just beyond us. Yes. Fear is all I know of this planet. I clung to that bush for dear life, even when the creature disappeared over the ridge, I sat crying at the bush. Time just went on by...and god knows what other creatures of death. I eventually slinked back to my landing pod, my one and only small measure of secuirty and safety. I write this now at the peak of the volcano...that was quite a trek. I haven't seen a dinosaur since that moment with the T-Rex. Despite this fact, every step, every step forward is pure terror. I can't see anything yet I hear EVERYTHING. The rustles, the groans and screeches, the distant roars...this place, I just...back home life is as many people would expect, happiness, friends and families. These are the norm. Here, on what I've dubbed a Green Vegetated Hell I only know fear, you will only know fear. You will never see them, you will just hear them. You will never out run them, they will just catch you. You will never survive...they will just kill you. Your no Primal Hunter. You're the hunted. You will learn that or you will die. Its not you surviving, your already dead. They just haven't found you yet. Trust me. They will find you.From a survivor who is deadAlright guys, first things first. Yes this is an early access game, remember that. Always when buying such games. Lets get into this.For an early access game this game is in quite a good state and stands on very promising ground to deliver an exceptional title. I love my survival games and ones with dinosaurs, vast maps and huge forests just grab my attention. This is definitely the best survival dino game I've played. There is definitely limited content to the game atm. There are only three dinos in the game atm and as of this moment I'm still unable to play multiplayer. Depspite this, god I've had some fun. Yes that first little letter is some roleplaying but that is honestly my first experience in the game. I survived for quite a while, imo anyway lol. This game is very beautiful, absolutely huge and completely terrifying early on. You're so insignifcant its not funny. You're hopeless against their attacks so all you can do in sneak and slink around gathering supplies and creating an arsenal. So during this time you explore much of the terrain, see much of how the dinos act as you sit there and watch. You survive. Barely.So rather than blabbering I'll list some pros and cons.Pros/Awesome stuff:Dinosaurs...big onesHuge and I mean huge map that is intricately detailed and beautiful. Love it.Presence. This game has presence. It has atmosphere. You're so small and helpless and you know it. This is done through the environment, the detail of it all, the atmospheric sounds of you creeping through the bushes, the call of all the dinos and the terrifying attacks of the dinos.Tracking a wounded dino...pretty fun in such a hostile environment. Killing it is even better.Its muliplayer capability is huge, I can't wait to get into some games. To track a T-Rex with a team and take down such a beast, definitely looking forward to it.The fact that your not the hunter, your the hunted. Never forget that, everything can change instantly. The enormous potential this game has. Giant sauropods roaming through the forest, a stampede of herbivores as they are chased by a T-Rex, the potential is just endless.Theres more and I could go on but you get the idea.Cons:I think weapons are a little too weak. Shot a raptor 4 times in the head with a bow, didn't die. Five shots with a shotgun...this game isn't meant to be played solo, the damage is proportional for groups of players not solo players. Remember that always.Not too much to do atm. I don't see this as a con as this is early  access its to be expected but people need to be aware of the state of the game atm. You need to be informed of such a thing. Not much to atm BUT down the road, ♥♥♥♥ yea.The stamina system, your like a morbidly obese person. Can't run much and you can't run far. Needs to change. Trust me, if you had a T-Rex on your♥♥♥♥♥you'd make Usain Bolt look slow. Btw you can't outrun one lmaoThats all I really have a problem with if you could call it that. Just things that you WILL encounter and perhaps need some changing.Things I'd like to see though:More dinosCrafting of any sort. Weapons, backpacks, houses, !!TRAPS!!! like deadfall traps etc etc, would be cool.Ability to capture dinosaurs. Would be cool. To capture a dinosaur. On the island there is what used to be a base surrounded by wooden spikes with two towers...I'd make this place into a dino arena. Thats just me lolI'm unaware as to the variety of weapons available but perhaps a larger variety. Tranq guns, lmgs, flamethrowers.In the crafting systems have skinng possible, ability to use their carcasses.Yes I know this is a title from a company that makes hunting games, yet this game can be turned into something a little but more than a 'hunting' game. If that is simply the end game scope for this game, simply bagging kills then that would kill the game for me. It would be such an anti-climax. This game has huge potential. Please don't waste it.

								Really fun....chasing down tricerops with a 12 g shotgun only to run into a T rex, I went down in glorious fashion.Hit detection seems really well done. I have killed a velociraptor with 1 arrow to the spine...I have also been killed by a raptor that I shot 5 times with arrows but just hit random spots...I like it.P.S. Dont go crazy with the shotgun once you get it....if there is a T rex around ....he will come running			"

								Top Notch! This is the best dino game that has been out for years. It has incorperated the surival system into to it very nicely, it makes the sense of finding a cache or camp/settelment rewarding. The looting system is implemented very well making it easy to grab and run and the GPS tracker ""SettlerMate"" makes navigation and tracking a dream.The dinos are difficult to kill which they should be, tracking dinos is also very immersive due to the fact that you may find tracks from a different Utahraptor then the one your tracking, also dino could be tracking you at the same time (bloody T-Rex). The Map is huge as well which is amazing, a lot of room for tactics on the hunt. The landscape has a very unique feel to it with plenty of places to hide if being tracked. The plants are spot on and the dangerous plants add a glorious mechanic to the game.The Cons are you can't swim yet, the Dino AI needs a bit of work (got tons of pics of T-Rex smiling for his close ups). The pathfinding needs to be refined around obsticles and no real character customization at the moment. The sound of T-rex walking sounds like a drum not a dino stomping around.ALL IN ALL IT HAS ONLY JUST BEEN RELEASED SO HANG ON. "

								A lot of people are saying guns are underpowered, i have been instantly killing triceratopses with 1 bow shot to the heart, they aren't underpowered, you just ened to take in the fact that you need a good shot.PROS-Simulation of where the organs in dinosaurs are seems real-Guns seem very nice-The Camps are really good and useful with finding guns and equipment-Game is really enjoyable, if you dislike it just play with friends and hunt t-rexs, will make the game more funCONS-Sometimes if you are lying down and a t-rex comes to you it stands there until you kill it or disconnect and re connect-Game is a bit buggy (it's in EA to be expected)-Not enough diversity with dinos and guns (it's in EA to be expected)			"

								The graphics aren't the best, but there are some really stunning vistas and it has the potential to be something I'd play every day if they get the balance of the game right. If they take the focus off the player on player, and make it more about hunting the actual dinosaurs, I'll be alot happier. This is something I'd play alone, or with friends. I'm not into the whole Day Z experience, of working really hard on something then someone comes and robs all your hard earned stuff.If they add more dinosaurs, some herd based herbivores, and get some more survival aspects in there, this will be top notch. At the moment it is very unforgiving. You start with a bow and 5 arrows, which has not been enough for me to bag a raptor, as of yet. The problem with the raptor being the ""easy"" prey is that they travel in groups. Once they get some more dinos in, I will be more inclined to play.As of yet, I'd say hold off and wait for some much needed content, unless you want to jump on a populated server and run the risk of being camped by someone lacking thumbs.

								So. Here it is, a game review I can actually be bothered typing out. TheHunter: Primal is an early access title, still in alpha. But, from the first couple of minutes I played in this game, a few things became clear: 1. This had potential, A LOT of potential. 2. It is suprisingly tense, you find yourself wandering through dark undergrowth straining to hear any sound of impending doom.3. I could play this for hours, with or without friends.4. Pricing is great for an early access.Ok, so they were just a couple of things I noticed, it is still very buggy, but the gameplay and atmosphere made me completely forget it was early access.Final Verdict: 10/10 - EPIC			"

								As a lover of TheHunter, I have to say I am dissapointed so far with this. TheHunter is a game that you can take slow, enjoy stalking prey and bring your own weapons to the field. What I loved about TheHunter is I can play by myself if I wish, and all I have to do if I need to pause game is bring up menu screen.... I understand during multiplayer this cannot happen BUT I do NOT play multiplayer. Being able to pause is very useful with a toddler and a baby in the house. Now my huge gripe... as I see so far, this game is totaly NOT solo friendly. I have played for hours, have found many backpacks and such to open, and all I get is a bow. I had a shotgun for 2 seconds before a Trex got me. So now all I have is a bow, and a couple arrows. First, after running around for 15 mins I see no dinos.... at all. The only animal that wont instantly attack me runs from me. I got a lung/heart shot on it with a bow and it ran a quarter of the map and never died, shot it two more times before I gave up. Doc would be ashamed! The second dino which I can kill, runs in packs..... and then the third dino all I see in desription is, dont hunt it alone..... So Tri/dont take down easy dont hunt alont, Raptor/runs in packs dont take along, Trex/dont take alone... I mean come on!!! Many other small issues so far, like arrows not combining when you find them. I still have yet to harvest my first kill... even with lung/heart shots... I just dont know..... I do however recomend TheHunter for people who like slow paced hunting games that are semi realistic.			"

								Like the graphics and the sub tropical setting but I'm not too thrilled about becoming raptor chow every five minutes. Another thing I would suggest is to let players keep the inventory they died with in the multitude of Utahraptor attacks.....it would give players a bit more of a fighting chance as the game goes along because there seems to be raptors EVERYWHERE......and they are sneaky devils. Also maybe when a player DOES happen to kill off a raptor.....let the dead be a distraction for a minute or so to give said unfortunate player a chance to get away and heal. and PLEASE please please try to figure a way to get into the trees as a way of escape.Other than the afore mentioned issues ...I would recommend the game for anyone that has ever dreamed of Jurassic Park as a hunting reserve.....hehehehe			"

								Fun for a while. Pro's: - It's truly terrifying when a Trex is standing right over you and you're lying down in some bushes or a pack of Raptors are circling your hiding place and all you have is 5 arrows. - The general foliage graphics-wise is not bad at all but there's a LOT of reused graphics over and over. - I've seen the creature designs from other dino games which were awful but they put some effort into these 3 dino's. The Raptors look a little different from each other but they're still raptors. - Water: The water graphics looked pretty clear and you make small waves when you walk through water. Cons: - I am sick and tired of being spawned right in the middle of a pack of raptors or a Trex is only 40 yards away. As soon as you try to leave the area, they magically know you're there. Even if you DO get out of their line of sight, they know exactly where you stopped to hide and will NEVER leave the area. You have to hope you can low crawl forever through some bushes but guess what? Even if they couldn't see you, they will follow you to the end of the earth. In other words, you either jump off a cliff and die or they kill you as soon as you try to run. - It's you against EVERYTHING. By that I mean, if you have 1-2 Raptors hanging outside the tree that you're hiding in and a Trex comes around, they will both team up to find you. The Trex doesn't scare off the Raptors. - No melee weapons. - You could walk right up the side of a fallen tree but a small rock stops you from walking forward. - No jump. As in..you can't jump up onto rocks or up cliff edges to get away from Raptors. If you can go there, so can they. Need:- Tree blinds or the ability to climb trees for a better vantage or better attack angle on smaller dino's.- Jump- Melee attack weapons- More types of dino's- Caves along cliffs and along the coast for hiding or shelter. - campfires for cooking meat taken from dino's to eat for health. - A damage/fear limit for the dino's. If you hurt one enough, they will run away but in reality, if you put an arrow directly into a Trex's eye, it should run off for a short time for you to get away. Conclusion:It was fun for a couple days but after killing multiple raptors and my 2nd Trex, it got boring.			"

												More horror than hunting, this game is mindblowingly frustrating to new players, having no way of knowing what to look for or where to go, but once you get a decent weapon and know where to look out for enemies, the game becomes an addictive hunting sim that you may find yourself coming back again and again to. I was a fan of the Carnivores titles as a kid, and being rather disappointed in Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn, I found some joy in this game, bringing the mighty T-Rex and the cunning Raptor back to their horrifying glory. I will say, there are only 3 main dinos in this game (T-Rex, Triceratops, and Utahraptor), with some irritating Quetzalcoatlus that really serve no purpose than to keep you on your toes in open spaces which were mostly safe before its introduction. There some others (I say some, I can't really remember any others besides Velociraptors, which are just mini utahraptors that hunt in larger packs), but really there is a lack of content in this game. The amount of content present doesn't honestly matter to me, but if you want a game to sink hours upon hours into then you might want to wait for a Steam sale or try looking on Gee Two Ay (why does this review system censor♥♥♥♥♥) for a discount (I personally don't recommend Gee Two Ay for indie games, as i always like to support the developers as best I can). If you want a ""clever girl"" simulator that you can run for your life in with friends, I definitely recommend this game.			"

								For many years i've always wanted a game similar to Lucas Arts' ""Tresspasser."" THP is the closest sans the narration by Sir Richard Attenbourough (John Hammond), w/c lent a brilliant eeriness to the environment. Primal Eden is so like Site B in Trespasser, but much improved and with more realistic dino behavior. The gameplay is much simplified and more user friendly in THP. It only needs more dinos like the Brachiosaur or Ankylossur. Love this game.			"

Classic these days.I don't recommend this game to ""consumerist gamers"" who devour games in hours and get bored fast.This is a game for the dinosaurs fans. It doesn't have a great replay-ability value, but you can always have a little fun with friends or even alone just exploring.			"

ITS NOT ANYWHERE NEAR FINISHED.There are only 3 species of dinosaurs as of now, but Im sure they will add more.The sounds are amazing, and for an early access game, it looks stunning.I saw a Tyrannosaur walking in teh distance, and its model flowed smoothly. I enjoyed seeing it.I kinda wish the Carnivores would go after the Herbivores. Would make it a bit more realistic.Over all, I enjoy this game and I hope it gets the updates it needs to become the spiritual sucessor to Carnovores.			"

												Buggy, glitchy, imperfect, but yet entretaining.You really have to give the game a chance, at the start it can be a bit frustrating since you are disarmed and basically any dino is deadly and wont give you achance to escape once detected, but if you continue exploring, looking around asking for help you will eventually get to enjoy it, it can be very relaxing to walk around the island to check the view while tracking your next prey.You will have to be quiet, advance slowly and aim carefully for the kill, track the prey, cooperate with others. The biggest problem in the game is the tendency to eventually spawn and find out your weapons/level was lost either because your game crashed or simply, you exited. It can be frustrating.This game deserved more polishing, even so as it is I cant complain, it does its function, to give you a fun time.The game is most of the time a ""walking simulator"", you won't just spawn and get guns to kill dinos left and right, you have to explore, find settlements and beg to god you get a useful gun. Its a lot of fun and it deserves more updates, but for what it is, I got more than my money's worth			"

												i dont like this game at all. i wouldnt recomend it becsuse after the first 5 minutes it starts to get really boring. Theres no crafting saving building or anything that would make it more fun for the consumers. It looks fun initionally but when you actually get in theres no end objective. is there a way i can get my money back "

												Love the game. It's a simple game. You're a slave sent down to eradicate the primal life forms on a deserted planet. There are five different dinosaurs that will actively hunt you. You must go from base to base acquiring guns, ammo, and supplies.My wife and I play this game all the time. We have a blast teaming up on the dinosaurs.			"

								I have really high hopes for this game. Its been to long sonce a good Dinosaur hunting game. I think Carnivores was the last series thatw as damn good.But remember THIS IS EARLY ACCESS. ITS NOT ANYWHERE NEAR FINISHED.There are only 3 species of dinosaurs as of now, but Im sure they will add more.The sounds are amazing, and for an early access game, it looks stunning.I saw a Tyrannosaur walking in teh distance, and its model flowed smoothly. I enjoyed seeing it.I kinda wish the Carnivores would go after the Herbivores. Would make it a bit more realistic.Over all, I enjoy this game and I hope it gets the updates it needs to become the spiritual sucessor to Carnovores.			"

												Buggy, glitchy, imperfect, but yet entretaining.You really have to give the game a chance, at the start it can be a bit frustrating since you are disarmed and basically any dino is deadly and wont give you achance to escape once detected, but if you continue exploring, looking around asking for help you will eventually get to enjoy it, it can be very relaxing to walk around the island to check the view while tracking your next prey.You will have to be quiet, advance slowly and aim carefully for the kill, track the prey, cooperate with others. The biggest problem in the game is the tendency to eventually spawn and find out your weapons/level was lost either because your game crashed or simply, you exited. It can be frustrating.This game deserved more polishing, even so as it is I cant complain, it does its function, to give you a fun time.The game is most of the time a ""walking simulator"", you won't just spawn and get guns to kill dinos left and right, you have to explore, find settlements and beg to god you get a useful gun. Its a lot of fun and it deserves more updates, but for what it is, I got more than my money's worth			"

								 Great game from am obscure publisher that mainly makes hunting games. The game runs great on my rig at maximum and looks fantastic. The dinos movement is realistic and they look like massive predators. Guns handle well, and sound realistic.  Though there are a few things i would like to see implamented.1)Base/Camp building. Setting down tents for storage, and perhaps sonic emitters to keep away dinos. Wooden barricades to keep out pesky thieves. Trips wires and more.2) A more informative/User friendly UI and Inventory. Perhaps a grid inventory system.3) Group creation on PVP servers.4) Hunger/Thirst implamamentation. Right now they have the workings of DayZ but it seems half hearted like they dove into the genre because its popular not because they know exactly what there doing. I could be wrong and it could be a big surprise hit. But for right now its a decent game, and fun to watch friends be mauled and shook around like a chew toy when the Rex catches their scent.			"

												I think all the harsh claims about 'unrealism' are little over exaggerated.  You are trying to hunt a dinosaur for goodness sake! (Maybe all these 'realism' people are too used to hunting defenseless Bambi's in real life who don't fight or hunt back?) This isn't Kansas, Dorothy! Quit crying ""Lions and tigers and bears! Oh my!""My only complaint is the allowing of people who don't make the kill get experience by harvesting without some sort of permission system.. too many groups are made to exploit this flaw.It's a nice gaming concept and if this is too 'early access' as some whine about, it's only going to get more refined and enjoyable.

												I have 46 hours logged on this game, so I can't say it's terrible. But I'm always wanting more from it, not just variety in dinosaurs but in gameplay aspects. There's nothing beyond get a gun and kill dinosaurs. You can skulk around and maybe ambush a few while prone, but that's it. Shoot and kill. I'd rather them put items like wood to build a tree stand, smoke bomb to escape a raptor attack, decoys to ambush dino's from a distance. I say these things because they seem feasible within the engine. I'll comeback to the gam every few months and go at it for a day or two, then get bored again. Bottom-Line: If it's less than $10, pick it up. You're fist dino encoutner will be exhilirating. The second will be your practice trials. The third will be taking on a trike probably. And finally you'll take on a rex. After that, the gmae is over.			"

Early Access Review
								Has been playing this game most of the day now. If you like a realistic hunting game with dinosaurs, then you will like this. It looks good and has the right atmosphere, that make u feel that u are there. It also makes you sneak around a lot. The ""cons"" in this game, seems to be minor bugs that will be fixed anyway and the ""pros"" has already been mentioned. As soon (and they will) as more life is put into the game, I can't ask for more. Here is what I to see:1. That species roam specific areas, that are realistic to them. So you don't meet the same all over the map.2. I hope to see some function, that makes you feel you have an objective. Like to hunt a specific dino or with a certain weapon.3. Veteran or Alpha dinosaurs, with a nickname. Killing this is like killing a boss. It has to be rare. (1 per server).4. Hunger/Thirst/Temperature/Wounds <- Else it is not a survival. 5. Dinosaurs has to be affected by other dinosaurs. A raptor has to flee from a T-rex. Triceratops from all carnivores and so on.6. Meaningless critters and insects. I know they're there, but we need more. The more life, the better the feeling.7. Herbivores that is just there for the viewing and gigantic size, like Diplodocus or such.8. The ability to make shelter, a fire and roast the meat, that u also has to be able to harvest. <- I know this one might sound a bit far fetched, but that would really upgrade everything and give u a purpose for the hunt.9. The simple ability to JUMP! Even if it has no purpose, but the psychological feeling of having that freedom really boosts the gaming experience. Imagine if you didn't have the ability to reload (like in old games), but by giving u the option to suddenly choose and reload at the right time, changes the game a lot. So a simple jump would do.I can't really say anything bad, as all my need has been fulfilled, even in alpha. The above is just hopes and wishes. The negative stuff I can say is just bugs that will be fixed anyway. I have waited since childhood for someone to make a god damn game like this, and now I have it! "

												This game has an awesome trailer , yet it never seems to deliver the hype. This game has some poor  mechanics, such as using the ""C"" button to sprint. It also seems like you spend more trying to find a dinosaur and let's face it - we want to find the T- Rex, nothing else. I would stay away from this, unless they implement more dinosaurs into this subpar game.			"

												The game was good that you can explore the world, hunting dinosaurs, get more weapons, but there is some problems about this game. There no controller compatible, you can walk all the way that you have to find the weapons of course when you start the game, you don't have guns but the only weapon you have is just a knife. The dinosaurs are hard to hunt them because they move really fast, when I try to kill them they go around me and its really hard to kill them. That's my review I'm not saing its a bad game but its a good game, my rating is 7/10.			"

												Very good game! Its a bit hard for me since i am a coward and run from everything but ifu are like some peeps i know killing dinos will be a piece of cake (a friend once mah-cheh-teyed a rex)! Many weapons to use and many bases to loot. Just never go to the volcano alone!			"

												Good game. Would be nice if some more different dinos where added.As of 1/22/2017 like the updates to the game, but I am having an issue with the game stopping working almost every time I play it. If this problem is corrected the game is still a lot of fun. I lot a lot of gear today because I had been killed and spawned back in then the crash.....no fun.			"

												I have 46 hours logged on this game, so I can't say it's terrible. But I'm always wanting more from it, not just variety in dinosaurs but in gameplay aspects. There's nothing beyond get a gun and kill dinosaurs. You can skulk around and maybe ambush a few while prone, but that's it. Shoot and kill. I'd rather them put items like wood to build a tree stand, smoke bomb to escape a raptor attack, decoys to ambush dino's from a distance. I say these things because they seem feasible within the engine. I'll comeback to the gam every few months and go at it for a day or two, then get bored again. Bottom-Line: If it's less than $10, pick it up. You're fist dino encoutner will be exhilirating. The second will be your practice trials. The third will be taking on a trike probably. And finally you'll take on a rex. After that, the gmae is over.			"

												Game used to be good, then they made it so you have to earn a bow in game instead of starting with it, instead you get this s h i t machete which can't kill anything so you never have enough points to buy anything. This game was good, not anymore.			"

								So far I've died 3 time, Twice by those dam Raptor things and the third I fell in the water and drowned but I love the game it's quite a change to have to sneak around looking for weapons and stuff and not get killed in the process  than just running around and shooting every thing that moves like a lot of people are doing these day with The Hunter just to get their Hunter score up			"

								Until there's a means to play an offline, singleplayer game I really wouldn't recommend this.  Though access to the internet is not a problem for me, I am not a fan of purchasing a game and then being unable to play it because an update breaks the ability for the game to connect, or similar nonsense. The concept is awesome, and the gameplay itself, while it can be improved, would be good enough in my opinion to warrant the price, provided what I said above wasn't an issue.  Currently there is no true single player game here, as you are still required to connect to a server even when playing in a world confined to one participant.  Connection loss is a real pain because apparently, things like supplies and items' positions are dictated server-side, meaning while you may end up reconnecting to the game should the connection falter, whatever items were in your immediate vicinity (like, for instance, a crate of supplies I spent a good 30 minutes trying to get to) will disappear.Hopefully updates come along which enable more consistent play.  As it stands I am too frustrated with losing my sense of progression to keep playing.			"

								Day #1I find myself on what appears to be a very hostile planet. Equipped with only a bow and a few arrows I set foot to search this strange planet.What was that? Sounded like a growl... Impossible... Raptor? But I only have a bow surely this is too weak, I must make a break for the lab! Good maybe I will find something stronger to take out this Raptor and claim my spot as king of this inhospitable planet. Great game, has some what of a story to it, fun to explore, would be even better with your friends. Being early access there is lots more features to come, you won't be disappointed.			"

The game its self is also not what it states it is (survival game hunting dinosours). Good game IDEA with HUGE POTENTIAL but bad developers.			"

They are everywhere, and they apparently can't be killed when they are coming for you.  It just makes it no fun at all.			"

								They say that DayZ is the Running Simulator, well... welcome to Walking Simulator 2015, or Archery Simulator 2015 cause thats the only weapon you'll ever be able to use. The concept of this game is amazing but theres just some issues. Such as  *Other weapons are nearly impossible to find, even once you find that enjoy finding the ammo. *Most dinosaurs take so long to take down. (Well atleast with the bow)*Anytime you get near some crates theres always a T-Rex waiting to anally♥♥♥♥♥♥you.*The stamina in this game is super low, you can only run for about 5 seconds till your guy just gives up. If an italian plummer can run for hours, why can't a hunter run for atleast 20 seconds.So do I recommend this game?In its current state its more of a mix because I love the concept of the game, but in its current state I would just wait till things get nerfed/fixed.

												I do like this game but i have a few issues with the game1. give us something better than a machete2. fix the spawn. I cant tell you how many times i have spawned in right in front of an Utahraptor3. add a difficulty setting. Make it so i can spawn a world with just one type of dino or something along those lines. to me the game seems way to hard. i have rage quite a lot one time i was tracking a trycaratops i had droped to like 10% health and out of no where a pterodactyl came and took me away. I get the game is supposed to be hard but make it so if i just want to go track and kill some dinos with out fear of getting swooped up or gang banged by Utahraptor i can it would make the game alot more enjoyable for people like me4. This one i just an idea add a crafting system and base building i think that would be cool5. This is another idea for the people how think the game is to ease add a food and water bar you have to keep upthanks for letting me vent i hope to think about some of those ideas :)Also 7.3-10 would recommend			"

												Was looking for a dinosaur-themed game to tide me over until the hype of Jurassic World would get some more dinosaur games going. I liked the premise of this game and finally convinced myself to download it, hoping it would fulfill the dinosaur-hunting void in my life. I played this game for about 6 hours before finally rage-quitting. I found the game very frustrating. At times I would be insta-chomped by a tyrannosaurus or pack of utahraptors without any chance of using my weapons In other lives I would be running away like crazy or staring down at a weak little velociraptor thinking about how nice it would be if I had ammunition and could therefore kill the dinosaur before it killed me. The ability to go back to your death-location and recover your weapons was nice, except that the game's respawn point was so far away from where you needed to go. The five minute walk to recover your weapons felt like an hour. All I wanted in this game was to kill dinosaurs. I couldn't care less about the ""survival"" aspect of the game. I finally did kill some utah raptors and velociraptors, but the amount of effort I was putting was not worth the reward. I thought about recruiting my boyfriend to play with me, but with the size of the map and the spawn points and death-respawn and all, there is no way we could have physically gotten close enough to each other to play cooperatively.If you want a dinosaur-themed game, invest $1 into Orion:Prelude and satisfy your dinosaur-killing urges. And now the trailers for ARK:Survival have come out and I am now in counting down the days until I get to kill dinosaurs AND ride them.			"

ALL ITS A CRAP... u guys know the game  have a bunch of glitches and  IM PRETTY SURE THAT ALL EARLY ACCES TESTERS WHO GAVE U FEEDBACK WOULD LIKE AN FREE DLC OR  AT LEAST ANYTHING... cuz  devs please... just a "" Thank u for all the feedback""   ?????????  i mean whats the diference between us and the new players????? we didnt get anything unique or something??????   DONT BE SOOO FREAKIN  TIGHT  F F S ! if  anyone played the firsts months when utahs were green  and only 3 dinos, u could see some hardworking devs , they were fixing some glitches and bugs, also adding some dinosaur beheavior like utahs running when a t rex were near( i can say i lived to tell that , LOL IM ALIVE  but my character died haha)   i was inside a tree shooting utahs and them all of them ran away,,, hear the stomp and said♥♥♥♥♥♥IM DEATH !, but  it was  a Amazing surprise cuz didnt read the patch notes at that time, u use to hear the rex roar at distances, now i cant or maybe they are glitchet!,  Rexes seems to be the most quiet dinosaur on game now.... cuz u only hear his stomping.... utahs were DEADLY AND I MEAN DEADLY, now they are so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dumb, thats okey 4 me cuz  i can farm them , but sometimes it feels like ♥♥♥♥♥♥ boring and no challenge at all like the beginning in the first months,  they are adding content without fixing all the previus content so it seems like they are HUNGRY FOR MONEY  they are working fast but with low quality of the product ,  long long long time ago they were working a bit slow but  giving us a nice experience of the game...  DEVS  F F SAKE  fix the game and if ur going to make it a full release START FIXING ALL THE GLITCHES ! and sorry for any grammar mistakes .  english  isnt my mother language			"

												Where to start in 100% honesty. I have over 100 Hrs put into this game so I know my stuff folks. I love Dinosaours, I love guns, and I love open world gaming. So that had me from the start with this game when I read the description. So many problems I don't even know where to begin describing them, the worst is the damn ""Lost Connection to host,"" while you've died with a pack filled with goods. Straight up rage quit stuff right there. They should have it bounce to the next best connection worthy host, like most games (Just host your own). Not to mention the Dinosaur AI is horrible, they fall through objects, walk through them, you name it. The framrate drop in certain areas causes you to be killed because you can't aim the gun properly. I have an extremely powerful computer there's no reason this game should be that badly optimized. Yes there's Flying Dino's that are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ just hide in the trees or shoot them as they come at you. They're very annoying and I agree though, that they should be dumbed down in population.              But for some reason I keep playing? Why? Because I only paid $20 for this game that's given me quite a few laughs, scares, excitment, fun, and some new friends along the way. Really what do you expect from independent game companys that start out ""early access."" I mean for ♥♥♥♥ sake people, have you not learned from DayZ that this stuff is a work in progress, and really the only way to make any of you happy is to have a flawless game with nothing to complain about for the price of two meals from Mcdonalds? Get over it,  it's not perfect, but it's good fun. If you don't like it, you don't like it. There's tons of issues with the game, that overtime I hope they'll patch and work on. Until then, happy hunting everybody and don't let all these negative reviews bring you down. They make it sound like drawn stick figures being chased by a ♥♥♥♥ing Dinosaur made from Gomotion. Get real.			"

												The game could be SO much more, but seems to be a neglected side project instead.Roam the land and search for gear, weapons and stay alive against deadly carnivores or silently stalk the herbivores of the island for the ultimate hunting experience. It's a hunting game in prehistoric times made by theHunter.			"

												For me the game is fine, I haven't encountered any gamebreaking bugs so far and I don't know why everyone is hating the devs for abandoning the game.  Could it be better with more dinos to hunt, more weapons and accesories? Sure it could updates are always welcome.Is it abandoned in an unplayable state?  Hell no, it is very fun and delivers what I expect from a hunting game. "

												This game is just aweful. Imagine DayZ with dinosaurs, cool right? Wrong, this game is just so poorly put together it is unbelievable. You start the game off landed on some ""Primal"" planet. You are given no objective, all you are given is a crap machete and a thumb drive or something. This thumb drive gives you the location of something... sometimes. Honestley I don't know what its for; sometimes it gives a location sometimes it doesn't, its emotional I don't know. So your ""goal"" I assume is to hunt things, judging by the way THATS THE NAME OF THE GAME! But all they give you is this crap machete that does♥♥♥♥♥♥for damage and drains your stamina. OH, did I mention theres stamina; this takes longer to regen then stamina in Darksouls. There is this huge map but it is impossible to explore because you move slower then the snail that won worlds slowest snail! It isn't like that matters anyways because by the time you get anywhere something will have found you and killed you. These Dinosaurs have more spatial awareness then you as a player could ever hope for. I know what you're thinking, ""But that's more realistic!"" ONE: What are you a paleontologist or a time traveler how do you know how dinosaurs work, and TWO: That's fine, but you can have that if you give your player nothing to defend themselves with. There are weapons, I assume, I only found one gun and bullets for others. Just like in DayZ you have to just wander until you find something, the differance is that in DayZ there are clear locations that suggest loot. Here it's just strait RNG, maybe you'll fine a box out in the middle of nowhere, maybe you wont. Maybe you do find something, it most likely won't have any weapons, just ammo to taunt you. I guess there are like bases that have a better chance of finding something but I could only find one. It's not like it matters that you find anything because guess what as soon as you die, you guessed it, you lose everything. Equipment, ammo, guns, rocks (oh yeah you collect rocks too, I don't know) and map progress... sometimes. I honestly do not know, sometimes you lose your map progression sometimes you don't and there's the random areas that are just reviled. There is a credits system that gives you money for killing dinos, but you never can use it because you can never kill anything. This just feels like the Taco Bell equivalent of a game, they just gave up. There is a game here, somewhere, but it just feels like they had an idea and then immediately just went “meh”. It feels more like an early access game, then most early access games do. This doesn't feel like theHunter it feels more like thePrey.TL;DR: It's like DayZ with dinos, only s**t.			"

Early Access Review
								Nice graphics, great sound effects, and an interesting tracking system. Shooting mechanics on this game are realistic, but I think the bow and arrows need a little bit of work. The gameplay is pretty immersive. I nearly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants after a T-rex quickly snuck up on me while I was trying to get loot from a storage crate. I really enjoyed the time I've spent on this game so far. I've been waiting for years for another game like carnivores (except improved greatly), and I really think this game has the potential to fill the gap in the market for a quality dinosaur survival/hunting game.Since this is an early release, there aren't many dinosaurs to hunt, and there are just a few graphic glitches that I've come across. A save option (or a hive that saves your gear/progress like DayZ) would be great, and I'm sure they'll implement something like that in the time to come.I hope this game gets more publicity and traction in the gaming community because this game would be very fun to play with/against larger groups of people.

												Was a good game prerelease.  However with the the totally unrealistic  balance of predators to prey no claims of a serious hunting simulation can be made.    Most of the animals should be herbivores not carnivores.  I knew thay intended a March release but five total species with four of them being predators is just wrong.  Also the developers just squashed any hope of any further development.  In their latest post they said they would only be working on patches and would not be devloping it any further.   (See there April 1st post release round up).  In addition they said that the current sorry state of the game exceeds their original intentions.       I have backed several early access games and this is about the worst. (The Stomping Land takes that honor).  They took advantage of peoples assumption that early access games are to help fund devlopment.  They went from early access to release in six months.  This was basically having people pay to beta test.  This is a common complaint about early access but I have never seen one so blatant about it.			"

												After having tried out The Hunter, and finding it to be wholly unsatisfying with its pay to hunt system, I took to The Hunter: Primal. At first the game seemed to have its core player in mind with prommosed content and no in game puchases to speak of. Throughout its development however, the development team has done little to stay ahead of the abusive douping and scripting undertaken by a portion of the player base. These issues made it impossible to play on public servers whereupon the need for a private lobby was pramount to actually enjoying the game with friends. It saddens me that this game is being, for all intensive purposes, abandoned shortly after its official release. I hope that this does not become a trend in game development where the content is shunted after its faithful beta supporters were made so many promisses.			"

												Instead of everyone complaining, I have some helpful things to say about the game. I would just like to state that first, the Q's can easily be killed, I killed one in one shot, they can easily be avoided and dodged too, and with the newest update they aren't really a problem anymore, but when you find them still a threat. I think this game could be huge if you update it lots and prove everyone wrong about it. The quality of the scenery is amazing, the sounds are too, there's birds and butterflies flying around, at night it's really sketchy and different, there's crazy storms that happen. I'm a big fan of this game and I have a few suggestions that I think other people will like. Definitely add the ability to swim and jump... those are pretty basic skills for people who just dropped in on pods. I also think you should add crafting, such as traps, and cutting wood, it would be so scary to try and harvest wood sometimes when you need to and who drops into this environment with no survival skills am i right? I feel as if there is a low field of vision, like you can't see dinos farther than a certain distance which makes no sense when you should be able to see them. I'm not sure why none of the dinosaurs attack each other, but I think it would cool if say a T-rex ate a Triceratops, and then after little raptors come in for a meal, because they're scavengers. I'm sure you're working on a lot of things already, but if you aren't I would like to see more guns, and silenced ones, maybe a stash for your items and overall deeper character and skill customization and possibly some vehicles or something cool. Being in a storm made me feel like there should be natural disasters, such as a tsunami, hurricane, or especially a volcanic eruption! But OVERALL, the number 1 thing that I would like to see ASAP, is more dinosaurs because I feel as if I don't run into as many dinosaurs as I normally would like to. Plus that there is literally 5 dinosaurs right now, the T-rex,velociraptor,Utahraptor,triceratops and the Quetzalcoatlus. You should add more flying reptiles and aquatic dino's such as the Spinosaurus, and maybe the Crocodile. I realize that you can only place dino's that are in the same time era but I have some suggestions for some must have's. The Pachycephalosaurus, Ankylosaurus, Stegasaurus, Brontosaurus and Pentaceratops. A few more random ones I would like are The Giant Sloth, Allosaurus, Iguanodon, Pachyrhinosaurus, Herrerasaurus, Scipionyx, also some omnivores such as the Abrictosaurus, Avimimus, and the Chirostenotes. Now I feel like if you guys updated a lot, and you see what I mean by these paragraphs, that this could be a game everyone loves. But if you flop on it like everyone thinks, someone else will take this awesome idea and make money off it. I'm sure everyone would love if you kept us posted on upcoming updates or things you're working on. Much love and thanks for the read, sincerely an avid fan!			"

Early Access Review
								Good game, and for future reference. After the first play through, I came to a bug which for some reason it odd. My game ends up crashing for some odd reason. I'm using an AMD Radeon HD 6310, Windows 7 OS, 4gigs of ram and would love to know if it's my specs or if it's just a bug that is crashing my game. Overall 10/10 but just a few bug fixes would be nice.			"

												I absolutely loved the game until the release, as u can see i have many recorded hours of game play but truly the release has beyond killed the game, you will find ammo and guns 2 expensive 2 continulessly defending yourself apon the mosh pit of the dinos, you will find pvp no one plays bc of how damn hard it is 2 get and keep gus, ontop of all that they release a bull♥♥♥♥♥♥Flying dino with 1 shot, in all respect dont waste time or money in playing this game it will surely die soon bc of these new effects, surely i will not return 2 the game untill guns/ ammo prices are greatly reduced or ammo spawning being legitimate for pvp servers as i i normally played was pvp which currently now is impossible via player base and ammo scarcity bc of the price and rarity. it was a good game but now is dead 2 me in all aspects of the word, sorry the truth hurts, and im sorry i talked many of my irl and game friend community 2 waste their money on it			"

												Played this game quite a bit, last session being a 10 hour stream on Twitch.Enjoying the game a lot so far. The dinosaurs can be really terrifying, especially when you are alone. Once you have a group and some guns (with ammo!) the Velociraptors and Utahraptors become fairly easy to kill.The Quetz birds are still very dangerous since they grab you and drop you (one of us got 'chain killed' by the birds at least 4-5 times hehe). They are huge and dangerous and really bring an added element of danger (death from above) when you are walking around in open areas.Of course the T-Rex is death on two legs as always and requires a good group effort to take down (or powerful guns, e.g. .700 rifle or .50 sniper).For more relaxing and hunting type of gameplay you can focus on the Triceratops, since shooting those means wounding them 10 times out of 10, so you end up having to follow their tracks and blood trails for follow up shots to kill them. They are not dangerous at all (never had one attack me) and the biggest danger hunting those comes from not paying attention to, or attracting due to gunshots, the other dinosaurs.My two main things that I hope to see improved in the game though:Better AI and dinosaur movement - they are sometimes a bit robotic, e.g. they run to a spot and then freeze for no reason. This makes it a little easier to kill them, but they are still lethal and can do lots of damage to you, especially if you play solo.More dinosaurs! - Sure there are 5 ingame now, but I am hoping they will add more dinosaurs. I'd like to see a mix of both docile (like the triceratops) and lethal ones.. both large ones and small ones!Overall though the game is really fun, especially if you play with friends!			"

												They MUST add more dinosaurs actually there eare 5. it was fun at the beginning bcus we tought that it would have more but it is starting to get boring, just hunt the same dinosaurs in a small island just with triceratops, uthahraptor, velocyraptor, tyrannosaurus-rex and Quetzalcoatlus. You guys should make a DLC that adds a bigger island and more 10 new dinosaurs, and some hunter lodges where you could respawn. And, you know, make it be more like theHunter BUT (WITHOUT) PAYING EVERY MONTH. PAY JUST ONE TIME, AND PLAY FOR EVER. TheHunter is the best hunting game ever made. But that bullsh!t of paying every month makes it suck. Please add a dlc like i said, everyone would like it a lot more, you guys know that.			"

												I know the games official release has recieved a lot of flak for the bugs and the new flying dinosaur, but even with these things the game is still massively fun. This has to be the best dinosaur game I have EVER played. Not many games can do it like this game does. The game shifts from survival/horror as you start out with only a machete and have to defend yourself against raptors and other predators. Then it shifts to hunting/adventure as you find more weapons and start to hunt your first dinos. Then finally, once you think you are the most experienced player in the game, you get killed by a T-Rex or a Pterasaur or maybe even a ambitous pack of hungry Velociraptors. And you shift back into survival horror as you hide from the monsters that lurk in the jungle.I agree the game is FAR from finished and I think they should have stayed in pre-release for at least another month, but the truth is if you love dinosaurs, you will love this game.I bought this game 3 days ago and I've already clocked over 24 hrs into it. It is rediculusly addictive and atmospheric.Verdict:6/10 - Gameplay10/10 - Replayability Value9/10 - ImmersionIs it fun? Is it worth $25.00?Yes.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is fascinating, and by far the best game I've played, but it gets boring get quite fast. If the original  ""TheHunter"" was not a subscription  based game, I would play it, and it is a bit misleading, since it  specifically   says,""Hunt - Explore - Survive The most realistic prehistoric survival game ever created. Featuring a huge Jurassic environment populated by horrifying all-stars such as T-Rex, Triceratops, Utahraptor."" I misread it as you can be the dinosaur, but my mistake.And personally, I would have preferred more dinosaurs and a chance to BECOME the animal, but more or less, very interesting game.  This game isn't really for dinosaur  enthusiasts, since you are killing your 'precious' children, but more for the people who dream of slugging a raptor in the head.:::ALSO:::I do know this is a early access game, but I still, completely, believe the creators may make it a micro transactions surrounded games, which will make me extremely angry if they do so. PLEASE, LISTEN TO AL EAST HALF OF US, SINCE WE CAN HELP YOU!			"

												Love the concept, the art is very nice as is the atmosphere.  Don't like the idea of searching for guns and hoping you find ammo for said gun, while everything is trying to kill you.  Understandable that everything is gonna be trying to kill you in this situation.  I like thehunter original, I like this game as well, but I can't reccomend this game as a hunting game which is what I was looking forward to.  I was hoping this may have been more like Carnivores with a trophy room, a better way to get weapons and ammo, a base would be nice.  I hope the devs read this and consider some of these things.			"

Early Access Review
								If like theHunter and were a fan of the old Dino hunting game Carnivores then you will love this game!!!3 Dinos so far; Tryannosaurus Rex, Utahraptors, and the peaceful Triceratops.5 weapons; The bow, .308 Rifle, 12 GA pump-action shotgun, .44 Handgun, and the devastating double-barrel .700 Rifle.With 9.3 sq. miles of playable area you'll spend countless hours exploring and checking out every inch of this gorgeous world. All and all, for an Early Access game this is really well put together. There's hardly any hardcore bugs in this as well. For $20 you aren't dumping out a lot of money and with such a successful dev team this game will be moving along fast! (after the dev's Christmas vacation of course). Oh and it highly encourages team-play. No one likes going out against ferocious dinos alone ya know? And if you want someone who knows the ropes to come hunting with you feel free to add me if you decide to purchase :) I'll gladly help get you familiar with the game. "

Early Access Review
								Pros:Pretty great graphics for early acces.Has a good concept.Dinosaurs look pretty good for an early acces.Cons:Takes to many bullets just to kill a Utahraptor.Weapons are way to hard to find.Dinosaurs are extremely hard to find.Lots of glitches but thats not much of a problem since early acces.Only 3 types of Dinosaurs for such a gigantic world.Sprint button only lasts for like 10 seconds and takes about 30 to regenarate-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------About the first 10 minutes of playing the game i was already bored out of my mind because there is literally like no dinosaurs. After about 16 minutes into the game i finally here what seems like a Utahraptor. Turns out there is more than one and for me being alone with only a bow of course i died. That obviosly wouldnt have happened probably if i was with friends. 30 minutes in the game i finally find my first gun. But with no bullets. 40 minutes in i find 6 bullets out of 4 crates i check. As i was getting the ammo i see the ground shaking and then stop. i click out my inventory to see a T Rex right behind me somehow not noticing. I go prone and try to crawl away and it kills me.I know this game will be really fun after a couple updates. I suggest you not get it right now but surely in a few months			"

Early Access Review
								Can't jump. Can't run for more than 10 seconds. Very very very slow view/mouse cursor sensitivity. (I had to turn my in game sensitivity up all the way, still not satisfying) Finding a mushroom(recovering health) is like winning the lottery, except half the time you don't even need them. No melee attacks at all. I haven't even found a gun after an hour of running (walking) around this giant empty island. You find a package(random supplies) every 5-10 min of traveling, sometimes even longer. Raptors DESTROY you if you run into a pack. There is no escaping with this horrible stamina bar. They expect you to stop moving and sit there for 10 seconds while your stamina recharges... even while you already have a raptor chewing on your a$$... what is that about? You suggest hiding in bushes and trees.. never works. Never even came across a T-rex. I heard a Triceratops, but it was surrounded by 5 raptors that thought I was a better meal.. Where's the fire? Where are the basics to help me not get destroyed by wildlife? Why can't I start off building something I can retreat to when I'm the one being hunted? Where are the traps? Am I supposed to wander around looking for stuff on a giant island filled with predators until I die? Where are the resources? Where are the items I can use to create weapons/armor/structures/items? Where are the key elements to survival that make me want to actually play this game? Where's the creativity to make your game unique?This game has a lot of potential, it is nice to roam around for a while. Although, it seems like there are too many elevated areas in my opinion. Since I can't run very far and I can't jump, I am forced to go around most places just to get back up. This isn't very exciting since I'm not really finding anything useful on the way other than piles of dinosaur dung... Overall, the map is great but it get's annoying. This game to me really has no structure right now.. The fact that they have implemented a screenshot system for the dinosaur you kill over objectives and gameplay really annoys me. Who cares about your dinosaur kill....this is about surviving not showing off who killed the same model dinosaur.. I do not recommend buying this game anytime soon until you read or see videos on updated gameplay with ACTUAL objectives, such as making camps/structures, implemented.I understand this is an ""early access"" game, but I was seriously disappointed with how my first experience went. I will be checking up on updates in the future. I do have hopes for this game. R.I.P my $20.00(For early access, this game should only be $5 or $10. $15 tops)			"

												Don't take this review too seriously...It's as if someone attempted to make yet another generic early access dinosaur game, Except that all that was focused on was the dinosaur 'animations' and models (which admittedly aren't that terrible), and not the fun aspects of to be expected of  Hunting  dinosaurs?TL:DRIf you are a freakishly obsessed dinosaur enthusiast, don't buy this gameIf you like realism, don't buy this game.If you like hilariously broken dinosaurs, and dying to invisible forces, and feeling useless you may be in luck.Firstly the 'Plot'(This is my own estimation, going on evidence gathered whilst 'playing') You are a random prisoner (who I will refer to as Bob for the purpose of this review), who has been dropped down to the uncharted surface of a planet known as Primal Eden, which from satellite scans appears to be home to  an advanced civillisation of reptillian humanoids  dumb (but dangerous) dinosaurs. Bob is lucky, as he is the prisoner that has been chosen for today to try and terraform and populate the surface of primal eden on his own. Now, if you were a fancy space-age civilisation of humans, you would send down someone well equipped to deal with any dangers that may be present on the surface of the possibly inhospitable planet, wouldn't you think?No, your standard starting Bob is equipped with a crude machete and white trainers. You know, to kill all those triceratops and T-Rex?Onto the subject of actual game playThe A.I is pretty 'mediocre' to put it lightly (the dinosaurs frequently rotate on the spot, don't aknowledge eachothers existence and sometimes randomly run of when they attempt to 'attack you' they come back later by emerging out of the ground.)The weakest spot on a 'Utahraptors' body is its♥♥♥♥♥♥ and not its apparently missing brain or heart.Jesus the tyrannosaurus has also been witnessed, walking across the surface of the 'sea' only to smite my character down with an invisible attack that caused me to fall out of the world and into the hellish recesses of the low-res skybox.Also, watch out for the angry chicken dinosaurs that hover a few centimeters above the ground.

												Love the concept, the art is very nice as is the atmosphere.  Don't like the idea of searching for guns and hoping you find ammo for said gun, while everything is trying to kill you.  Understandable that everything is gonna be trying to kill you in this situation.  I like thehunter original, I like this game as well, but I can't reccomend this game as a hunting game which is what I was looking forward to.  I was hoping this may have been more like Carnivores with a trophy room, a better way to get weapons and ammo, a base would be nice.  I hope the devs read this and consider some of these things.			"

This game need more objectives2. Guns are very hard to find compared to losing itSince its still on early stage of development, Its better to wait until it receive more content and improvement.			"

Early Access Review
								Basically you're trying to be eaten by dinosaurs as rarely as possible, so you can sit your character down in a bush, go to bed and the game will play itself overnight.After a read through the manual and 20 minutes of walking, desperate to track down some dinosaurs to avoid, I had been presented with no trace or sound of anything dinosauric, and had found a single crate containing 2 health potions. My adventures were eventually brought to a white-knuckle climax when my path was blocked by a body of water too watery for even my heroic pioneer to consider. He could sprint for only 5 seconds before succumbing to exhaustion, so perhaps he was not the most bouyant of heroes.Fortunately there's an auto-walk key, so I can be off manicuring my toes while my hero wanders the terrain in search of house-sized carnivores he doesn't want to be anywhere near, happens across loot crates left in tree stumps by mischievous leprechauns, gets eaten by the carnivores, pretends he's lost any SPAS-12s he could've received from the leprechauns and starts all over again, all with the press of a button!One of the most convenient games on the market.

								DO NOT BUY THE GAME !!!NO SUPPORT !!When die u lost all and spawn Miles away, really boring...Spawn without Weapons or beside ♥♥♥♥ing T-Rex, When Trex is coming only Chance to lay 10 min and wait that he is gone, when u move u dead, Boring, no chance to run away, no support nothing changes.....After 3h Gameplay and 20 Boxes , i only have Bow and Ammo, but  no Pistol or Gun, StupidSAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO EAT WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND !!  BETTER !!!Lange Wege , in Kisten bis jetzt nur Munition, laufe schon seit 3 Spielstunden und ca. 20 Kisten immer noch mit Pfeil und Bogen herum.  Als Survival wäre es super wenn man sich ein ""Lager"" mit Verteidigungsanlage bauen könnte.Gameplay: Spawn genau neben T-REx (toll), Spawn nach 100m 3 Raptoren (supertoll und wieder Tod)Spawn sagenhafte 2,5 Stunden in dewr Gegend rumgelaufen endlich Pistole gefunden, während Pistole ins Inventar - 2 Raptoren (wieder tod) Spawn ewig weit weg vom Sterbepunkt.

												This game in the beginning was good, but now its trash. They stopped caring for the game. they dont add new stuff that the Community wants to see included like simply a way to get ammo WITHOUT DYING. just a tab in the menu to order an ammo trop within 250 m of your location would be nice so we can hunt freely. then in the survey they ask if we would pay for DLC. i said heck no. infact i want a refund for this game, its abosulte♥♥♥♥♥♥now. they added 1 new queen t rex. but to even fight the ♥♥♥♥er you need to kill trexs collect sacks and place in spawn of rexs. 1. how are we gonna even have enough ammo for rexs if hardly enough spawns. lucky if you get 10 .308 ammo. increase ammo dropped.or add a way to get ammo without dying. hell make the pods the ammo station. on a scale of 1-10 i rate this a -15 worst game i have ever played and tried to enjoy. they work on theHunter, tell you what, Cabela's hunting games got you beat in normal hunting. by a 100 lifetimes. work on primal. but even ARK got you beat in that department for survial, The hunter is a simple Hunting game with dinos. its nothing unique. i would not pay for dlc, you simply should update the game, or start a workshop and approve stuff from the community. and include it so you have to do not a thing.

								This game looks good, but as of now I would not really consider this much of a game nor is it worth $20. There are only three types of dinosaurs right now, raptors, t-rexs, and triceratops. You essentially get a bow to start and just walk until a dinosaur kills you. you can kill the dinos (difficult to do as the aiming is bad) and find other weapons in the game (far and few between), but there is no story and no progression. They say they went to beta to allow for users to decide which way to go, which likely means they have no idea why they made a dino hunting game in the first place other than that people will buy it. They have other theHunter games out there and my guess is the only way they are going to add more dinos is by making you pay for each new one. That is an assumption, but I have no reason to believe they will change their pricing model for this game. Like I said before this game is not even really a game. There is no story, there is no reward for hunting dinos, and you are not likely to win against one. Do I want a dino hunting game? absolutely, do I want to spend 20 minutes walking only to be somehow surprised by a trex comin out of no where and eating me, then starting a walk all over again? not really.edit:I wanted to explain this game more deeply. I still stand by my words, but that being said I think I was going at this game the wrong way. When looking at this game I was looking very much for a Turok style of go in and destroy a t-rex gun ablaze, run like hell so it doesn't eat you type survival game. That is not what this game is made for. This game is a trial in patience. You are hunting dinosaurs, but you are trying to hunt them like as if they were in the wild. You have to look for dino droppings, footsteps, and the like. It will take you a while to find one and when you do it will be tough to kill.Still this game does very much still feel like you were dropped in jarassic park 2 and expected to die. Not like you and the boys grabbed your favorite guns and beer and went out for a dino hunt. So now that that has been said would I recommend this game? No, not my cup of tea. If you enjoy hunting, but also enjoy the comfort of your living room, then you would probably enjoy this game.			"

								Give me a few asian kids as an art team, (they don't have to be older then 12 with basic maya and mudbox knowledge)some doucheeee-bag coder that spends 22 hours of his day jerking off, 1 hour sleeping and 1 hour working and a creative director that plays with his dong while skyping the dev team and i can recreate this type of experience for everyone to throw money at! YAYYY!Oh and we should get the guy who took a huge dump from jurrasic park one , to leak on twitter that he is a huge fan of this game, then pay black market asians 2 bucks an hour to post fake reviews for the game so we can sell it better.Idea for the latest review can be: If Jeff Goldblum plays it, thats good enough reason for me!And while we rake in thousands for a few years work and share it between the whole team, Our best pals on youtuberehashing the game can earn hundred of times what we make in months just by playing it for a few minutes! and that is why the people who play it, HATE THEIR lives and it really shows in this game...-If you want to play it alone I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS it gets boring after 2 hours tops.-if you want to play it with mates. I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS, enless you like spending hours and hoursjust to find each other only to have bugs kill you and make you respawn again randomly in the world.-If you want to play it for the pvp I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS> its a failed hunting./survival hybrid pve was a stupid idea to begin with.-if you want to play it for pve I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS (you can prevent any disanaur from attacking you by walking over a heap of stones and walking in circles on the stones, or by walking around a tree)Worst developement for a simple game idea EVER This is like the plan 9 from outer space of games.I wouldn't be suprised if edd )=ucking wood himself is funding this project.Disgusting.

												So, I\'ve had this game for a while but never played it. Decided to for the first time today, and I have to say I\'m severely disappointed. I\'ve read reviews where they say you start with nothing but a machete, yet I started with absolutely nothing. I would pick up rocks, and my inventory would be taken up, but show nothing in it aside from the clothes on my back. There\'s no in-game menu to adjust graphics, which has been a must-have option since 2004. There\'s no sprinting or running. The game launcher doesn\'t close the first seven times you click Exit. For someone just coming into this series, there\'s no tutorial or guidance to make sure you understand the game. Overall, with the slow development, lack of content, excess of issues (not just bugs), and the fact that I wandered for about 20 minutes, only made it about 3 miles, and encountered absolutely no dinosaur life, I can\'t imagine how there are any positive reviews. Even though this game no longer says it\'s Early Access, it\'s really pre-alpha. I\'m not even sure they should\'ve released it.			"

												No.I keep trying to play it, but things i hate:Player server closes when trying to get to your gear.I can fire real firearms 100x more accurately and efficiently. It's like they gimp weapons to the point of uselessness other than a toothpick for t-rex ( i am talking about the lack of aiming or movement of the weapon).The pump shotgun bugs out when i try to raise it to fire. Very infuriating when being hunted and surrounded by 4 Utahraptors.It's a lot of work just to get friken eaten. I refuse to hack the game to play it.Needs more Dinosaurs. Only one is a vegetarian, and he likes to trample you into red mist powder.Needs more to do: like maybe crawl around getting achievement items, quest items, or things do sell so maybe you can actually start out with gear.At the moment, it's just a crawl around and get eaten simulator, but i have to admit that the environment is nice and there is a thrill in the activity.

								So far so good! Think DayZ with Dinos in a really pretty world. It's Early Access, so think BETA, some bugs to work out, definitely some balance issues...dinos are crazy hard even 1v1 vs a Raptor.I have only attempted once to take one down and that was after a few hours of exploring and getting my gear. And I failed so hard. Lesson learned: I ran from the next one.Pro Noobie Tips: Press ""LeftMouseButton"" on Poop, Tracks when they appear in fron of you and Sounds and/or ""!"" when they appear either in your PDA (Settlertracker thingie). It will tell you the dino it came from and approximate location. Crouching/Prone is your best friend when you suspect a dino, you will camofluage into your surroundings, just prone away from them...don't try to take one on as soon as you jump in, this isn't Call of Duty. You need to explore, get better gear/weapons, and use some tactics. Remember, Raptors usually aren't alone, they WILL call their friends over if close by.There ARE[/b] PvP SERVERS and they are pretty funny, because usually right after someone kills another player (PKing), a dino is close by to finish off the ""bandit"". Yes, it's full loot. IF YOU DIE: Try to run back to your death, you can loot your body for your items back, however, if you wait too long OR another player loots it before you get there, you are SOL. Last piece of advice, if you spawn near the mountina, try to climb it, I never found any dinos up there, BUT there were crates AND some ""lore"". I hope to see CRAFTING added to the game. As well as the ability to restack my items in my inventory. OH, and I WANT TO JUMP! And be able to DODGE and SWIM! Make it happen!Oh last thing: if they add crafting, just small things...make a camp tent, traps, etc. We need binoculars also please!Good stuff, you'll enjoy it, just don't try to play it like Call of Duty and you'll be fine. Stalk, gather, hide, wait for your prey.Good Luck! "

												I'd like to start by saying that this game still has massive promise. And while it can become something that can be on par with ARK: Survival Evolved, at the current rate it'll never get there.The Devs of this game started off magnificently with introducing us to a brand new dinosaur hunting game that hasn't been properly seen since the days of Carnivores. They started well with trying to keep us up to date and happy with pumping out content as best they could but then things took an absolute turn for the worst. Content slowed, they no longer listened to their player base. Left MASSIVE amounts of holes, bugs and exploits in the game with no remedies in sight. Optomization never came either, thus leaving the game a Call of Duty-esque dino shoot-em-up riddled with hackers in the PvP games or if you're the PvE type, leaving you to forage and walk for hours and hours on end to obtain enough ammo to hunt a single animal. Not to mention the other gear needed to stay alive from the relentless zergs of Velociraptors, Utahraptors and unGodly amounts of T-Rexes roaming everywhere with laser vision that you stand NO chance of hiding from. Phew. Winded. Anyway. All in all, this game started great and literally went down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pretty quickly. Now, take allllll of that. And add in the fact that the game's own Devs stated, that they would no longer be replying to TheHunter Primal's playerbase via forums and would no longer be updating the game regularly so that they could return their focus to their mediocre Pay to Hunt flagship game TheHunter.In summary:Crappy weaponsCrappy weight systemCrappy loot systemCrappy spawn systemCrappy DevelopersMediocre dinosaur populationCarnivore overpopulationBugs, exploits, dupes, hacks and no optimizationCrappy DevlopersCrappy DevelopersCrappy Developers And lastly, crappy developers who have NO idea what they're actually doingSo! Don't get this game. Like at all. Ever. Go buy ARK: Survival Evolved. Those Devs know what's up, listen to their players and pump out content like pros and actually fix their mistakes. ARK has absolutely 0 complaints for me. TheHunter Primal gets a 2/10 from me and minus 10 points from Slytherin while ARK gets a 10 from me and plus 10 points to Gryffindor. Don't buy Primal. Buy ARK and profit and enjoy a more challenging game with better aspects, better players, more content and even more coming soon.			"

												This game requires heavy use of Java, if its not installed it wont runn correctly. The fact that the game requires heavy use of the amount of java strings is just pathetic. Does the game run under Windows 8.1 64 bit, no it doesn't. Works fine with the 32 bit on Windows 7 but not 64 Windows 8.1 When it loads for you the first time and the screen goes black and stays there, that is your sign from me telling you this game is faulty, time to get your money back.

Early Access Review
								This review is of 12/23/2014 - early access - I'm sure you have certain ideas about the game play, however, let me tell you what it really looks like. You get dropped in a forest. Then you walk around for about 20-30 minutes, yes, just walking... looking at a map. Foliage is like Skyrim, nice to look at. No mobs, no nothing. Once in a while you see a box appear on your map. You wander over there, get the contents (yeah, more arrows to kill a 18 foot T-Rex, how about sending me an assault rifle?). At some point you see a Triceratops which immediately runs away from you. You're starting to wonder why you're wasting your time on this ""game""... then there's a T-Rex out of nowhere behind you. One bite and you're dead. Wow. Multiplayer must be better, right? It's the same. Only difference is that it's more frustrating, because every time someone logs off from the server the game literally pauses and announces it with a big, black screen that you can't exit until their connection has timed out. Keep in mind, this is early access... but for what it is right now, don't bother paying money. It's essentially a graphics demo.			"

								Noooooo.I love the Hunter, despite my constant ♥♥♥♥♥ing about how bloody expensive it is. A friend an myself play it quite frequently and we said after our first outing that if they released a Dinosaur version we'd buy it imediately, and we did.Hooooooowever...This isn't The Hunter anymore, it's ""The 'running away from a velociraptor at a gentle jogging pace whilst the lizard follows you and doesn't quite manage to bite your♥♥♥♥♥♥off' Person"".The game has this horrid fixation on being a DayZ ripoff, except (thank god) that the PvP is optional. This means that you start with a bloody longbow that gently inserts arrows into Dinosaurs in a sudo-acupuncture way instead of a proper gun of your choosing.The Velociraptors do add a nice tension, but they're far to abundant and are everywhere thus, the main focus of the game is not bumping into them, not hunting.My only hope is that, since this game isn't subscription based like The Hunter, that modders will rip it open and redesign it to be more like The Hunter, but with dinosaurs.In conclusion, WHAT ON EARTH WERE YOU THINKING?!?! Avalanche made a great Hunting simulator that was genuinely enjoyable, and would have only gotten better with Dinosaurs, but instead they decided to jump on the DayZ bandwagon with this god awful thing.Check back in a year and see if it's better, as of now, keep walking.

								DayZ with dinousaurs.Early access gameplay may change etc...Liked: Atmosphere, graphics, sound, dinousars, t-rex encounter the ground shakes and it just gives you an epic feeling, multiplayer with pvp or coop. Disliked: When somebody loses connection everybody on the server gets blackscreen and a window popup where you have to wait 12 sec (gamebreaking).Loot is very scarce and most items except .700 rifle is useless. The clothes do nothing and the shotgun/sniper is worse than bow. When trees are coming in to viewdistance they looks like invisible and made up of dots.Dinousaur AI is pretty dumb especially T-rex.Few dinosaur species and numbers.Map feels like a giant wasteland with zero interesting places.Inventory system is horrible you can't split or combine ammunition. You can't swim.You can sprint for 10 seconds then you have to walk for 5 minutes to do it again.No Vehicles.Many issues are from The hunter engine and that have been out since 2007. If they haven't fixed the issues since 2007, I doubt they would fix them now.Do not buy this game, the developers are interns that the company/studio don't pay for.This is a dirty cash grab that uses free/low paying workers to work on an easy formula with an already made engine.

								I am saying no only to the early access. I have now played enough to make an informed review. I have killed Utahraptors with a single arrow. I have also had them take 5 rouns from a 44 magnum AND multiple rounds from a 12 ga shotgun and still kill me. I have gone +20minutes withought even seeing a single track of a dinosaur then had 4 Trex appear in less than a 400m radius, I play TheHunter, I know how the gun mechanics and vital organs system works. I also know that the balistics in that game are fantastic. This game not so much. I played with my wife for 2 hours straight sneaking from camp to camp collecting guns, ammo, and gear hiding from dinos not taking a single shot. then when we decide we are ready and geared up we tried to take down a Trex. 7 rounds from the strongest gun in the game (the .700 double barrel) and 6 rounds of 12 Ga slugs. The trex turns and runs away like nothing happened. That being said people claim to have taken down rex's with just a group of 3 armed with only bows. So imagine my frustration with this game. Make it tough for us to get good gear fine. But dont make someone walk around for hours so they can die to the first dino they actually try and hunt.  3/10 for Graphics, sound, and you genuinely feel nervous when you are trying to hide from a predator hoping it doesnt find you.

But the point is, i played for like 3 hours and could only manage to find 1 gun .....  it should be a game with more action and not walking 20 minutes to reach a crate and then dont find a gun but only arrows, and then you start to walk again 20 minutes to the other crate, where's the fun here ?  Serious i tried hard to like this game, the porpouse its cool and everything but i don't have patience to waste 20 minutes just walking to somewhere and don't have nothing when i reach.Summarizing- Graphics Good- Game Lacks of fun, too much walking and less fun			"

								I gotta learn not to trust all the steam reviews I read...  Some people are impressed by so little that it led me to buying this...It should be noted for ANYONE wanting to buy this, it's a walking simulator... All you do is walk, with very little stamina, trying to find weapons, to shoot dinosaurs with.  The dinosaurs are incredibly tough, and your weapons probably won't do much...  Given that its early access i will come back in a few months and see if I change my review, but as of now, not worth spending the money on...  There is no ""fun"" as it is right now, and without fundamental design changes it won't be any fun regardless of early access or not...  I was skeptical as the other game by this company has a scam ""f2p"" model as stated by multiple reviews, but my wish for a cool dinosaur game made me buy it anyways, regretted it deeply...			"

								Why NOT to buy this game:If you have friends that live farther than 100 ping away, you can not play the game together.There is no dedicated server, only listen servers ran by players.Single player automatically starts a listen server on your machine.You have to port forward to play games together, which you do not have to do in most current steam enginge games.The developers do not have plans to implement dedicated servers.The game is buggy, constantly clipping through walls etc.There is no jump, half the time you're continually running into a wall, or stuck on a piece of the world that makes no sense.The price is pretty high for what's in the game. Currently 3 types of dinosaurs and one big map. Sure there are a bunch of guns, but that's only if you find them.You can only run a short distance, i can understand this, the game isn't ver hard so the put limits on your to pretend it's hard.Graphics are sub par, and somewhat blurry. I played on the highest settings at 70 FPS and the game looked like a dino turd.This game has potential, obviously some people like it. I think it needs another 6-12 months before it will be playable.			"

												- This ISNT a survival game even though its in survival section- Description of this game states its survival, once again it ISNT- Devs made enough money so they just walked away form it. Suck it suckers.First off this game is false advertised ""Step into a huge Cretaceous world (24 km² / 9.3 mi²) where the very environment will test your survival skills to the max. This is the planet of Primal Eden. Help us reclaim, subdue and eradicate the savage wilderness so that we may plant the seed of civilization in its place""NOTHING is going to test you survival skills to the max, and that is because runing around sneaking past dinosaurs isnt survival, and that is the only thing you will do. Literally, the only goal in this game is to find weapons and kill dinosaurs, it has nothing to do with survival, you cant craft a thing, build a base or anything other than killing and sneaking. You literally have 3 things to do in this game, sneak past dinosaurs you cant kill, kill dinousaurs you can kill, and look for more weapons, thats it, survival my♥♥♥♥♥ ""help us reclaim, subdue and eradicate"" this makes people think"" hey sounds cool, like, I will get to build a base and ""plant a seed of civilization"""" no you wont do any of this things, they just wrote it to lur you in.  ""The most realistic prehistoric survival game ever created"" - do these people know the definition of survival game?? this is one big fat lie, and on top of it they abandoned this game and customers cose they have fat enough wallets by this point.......

								What I am writing its not a review, its my game session as soon as i bought the game, but if any of you is indecisive about buying the game it may help.1º I started the game, walked for around 100 meters heard a roar and got killed by a T-rex.2º I start the game pick up a bow and 10 arrows, so i start searching for bags to loot with my GPS, when i hear some screeches coming close, i lay down in a bush and see a Utahraptor I start shooting arrows at his belly, after 3 arrows he found me but i got him! I move down to the place i died, i see the T-REX really far away, but he seems to notice me and starts roaming near where i was so i just get away from him, i find a Rifle and 10 bullets, i shoot another Utahraptor that runs away from me, i start chasing him, only to find his poop saying he has around 30% health and his on the running, i keep trackin his tracks but without luck, so i just leave , i get to a place that looks like a radio station, when i see 2 Utahraptors rushing to me, i hide inside a tree trunk just to get the female Utahraptor bug out infront of the tree and stay there quiet for like 5m, so i gave up and tryed to kill them both, i shoot the female, and the male got me after.My 2 playtrough i survived 1 hour and 11 minutes, and walked for 7040 meters.While i did enjoy it, i cant recomend the game, i bought it because i want to support the devs, and because i like to see the game grown, i am the type of guy who enjoys coming here and trying the game once in a while to see how much it has evolved, so this is a nice game for people like me, because at the moment this is a game of great promise.Pros -Solid ControlsReally good atmosphere, with nice graphics and the dinosaurs sound great.The multiplayer is funPay to play without micro transactions ( this was said by the devs)A team with alot of experience on hunting gamesRuns great on a medium specc pc, so does look pretty well optimized.ConsA little buggy, as to expect from alpha, i had Trexs sitting on me without killing me, stepping also does nothing, dinosaurs rushing o watery areas and getting stuck,  or sometimes when a dinosaur is lured to you and even when he doesnt see you he may bug out and just camp you not allowing you to go anywhere.Lacks content, few guns, only 3 types of dynos the map is a little to deserted, plenty of dinos but atm scavenging equipment isnt all that much fun.Even so, so wait for the game to be more polished, while it is fun, if they deliver what their promising, this game will be a blast, but right now, only join if you want to help the devs test the game, or follow the development of the game.

								This game has a lot of potential. When I first seen screenshots and what the summary of the game said, I was imediatly excited for it because it brought back ideas of Carnivores. I loved that game and I've been wanting something like it, and this is a pretty good recreation of sorts but with more elements. I won't say that it's easy, far from it, but I will say, if the Devs listen (wich they are as far as I'm seeing) this game will be amazing. I'll go over a few things that got me all giddy inside and things that make me kinda ticked.Pros: There's defiantly qute a bit to this game and it has a lot of nice things to it.-Sounds : The sounds in this is amazing, absolutely astounding. Love it. -Visuals : The game is pretty, it's gorgeous and the dinosaurs look cool too.-Tracking System : I'll say that I'm new to theHunter ""franchise"" but I just adore the Settlernav. It shows where an animal is going or aproximate area as well as time when the ""track"" was left. And you can use it to put waypoints on the map as well, and I found out that if you're playing with a friend and they got a map fragment that shows a closer settlement thing, they can set a way point and you can see their waypoint they set so you can meet up.Cons: There's quite a bit that's kinda bad about this game, but they're fixable.-Wepons : EVERYTHINGS UNDER POWERED! Me and a friend shot one Utahraptor, point blank in the head and chest, with five arrows, 6 .307 rounds, and 4 .44 handgun rounds... Everything's way too under-powered and that's really upsetting when you can't take down a raptor running at you to save your-self.- Raptors : The thing is after we tried killing the raptor, me and my firend had no ammo and had to run... or shall I say walk away from the raptors. If you walk in a strait line, it's impossible for them to get you because their attack is "" RUN. STOP. BITE. REPEAT."" They need to be given actual attacks like pouncing and biting as they go. What animal stops THEN bites. None, they keep attacking. They also should have less health than they do now. They're fragile yet strong creatures. they should not be able to take a small army's worth of ammo to the head and keep going. No!- Aiming : Ok, this one may be my computer, but when ever I aim. My entire game lags... or should I say, my character lags. The dinosaurs go the same speed, but I lag and can't follow them to actually get their spine because that's one of the few places you can actually get them with decent amount of ammo (like 3 arrows). Also, as I'm lagging, the wepons CONSTANTLY moving down, I have to quickly keep moving my mouse up to be able to even hit it somewhere. And the Holding Breath mechanic doesn't really work because the guns going down all the time. By the time you get a decent shot, you let out and you gotta start all over again. It NEEDS RE-WORKING!- Server Set-Up : Ok, I'm onto the little things now. A nice little dedicated server set-up would be nice, but I'm sure the Devs are working on that too.- Dinosaurs : They said they're planning on more dinosaurs. But When they actually do, decrease the population of the raptors. They're oozing from the crevases of the mountains... And you can't get away from them, there's no chance to get them off of you so you can go get better things. They harass you untill you give up. You can't distract them when they're attacking as well because there's no pebbles or anything laying around to make them get off. There's a few pebbles in the marsh but that areas infested with raptors too. when something starts going after you. There's no chance at all to escape.- Raptor calls : They sound way to much like lions... I want something that sounds a little diferent than an animal of our time.- Trike feathers : The feathers on the Triceratops look freaking rediculous. The animals compleatly feather-less besides that mowhawk of feathers. It looks dumb. Add a layer of thin feathering then yeah, that'd be cool.IDEA: Might add to it.- Pterasaur Hunting : It'd be pretty awesome if you could hunt pterasaurs like birds of our time. Add in rahmphorincus' by the coasts. Make like a call, chuming and bird shot too. That'd be sick.- Dino Interaction: I would love to see dinosaur interaction. Like being able to see a pack of raptors or a rex bring down an herbivore and munch on it, and be able to stumble on a kill and be able to tell when and what actually killed the animal and start traking from there.- A little cabin of sorts for like saving yourself from the dinosaurs or a save point and able to purchase wepons and gear with the in game currencey and store.Conclusion.I would like to say I recomend this game, but I don't entirely. It's much too soon for it to be any real fun for a long time. The only way you can get from point A to point B in the game safely is prone crawling to it. It takes years. Running should be increased too instead of running 4 paces and can't anymore. But if you want to watch a game grow, expand, and recive tender-loving-care that I'm hoping it'll recive and like dinosaurs and initial testing of games, putting in your imput as well, get it. But for now, untill things get better sorry ""theHunter: Primal"" I don't recomend you.[I'll update as the game does. I REALLY WANT to love this game. I really do and Devs, coming from a dino nerd. Don't mess this up, please. Don't just add in 2 more dinos. Add in like 10 or 20! Make the HUGE map you made feel alive instead of feeling empty of any and all life besides you and the walking Mini-Tanks that are the Utahs. Please nerf them.] "

												First thing is please ingore the negative reviews espically on the ""nothing but walking"" bit. This game is thrilling and to survive can be a challenge. The beginning is a pain to play but once you loot a better weapon or learn how to use the blade correctly you'll survive. What negative reviewers fail to realize is, YOU DO NOT WANT TO RUN INTO DINOS, it's a freaking survival game. However you can try to find them if you learn to use the tracking.How long can you survive? That is the question. Five dinosaurs is a fair amount for game to hunt, but at the same time lacking. Now one thing I'm shocked about (proabably patched) is I haven't seen any flyers... Might be a good thing tbh. Also something else about this game is exploring, there are hidden goodies if you can find them. i.e logs. From the couple of hours I've put into it the diffuclty of the game goes as follows, easiest to hardest. Velociraptors: Decently easy to kill with the standard blade. You can one hit them, but if you are being attacked by a pack, they may kill you.Triceratops: Will take some time to take down, but they hardly attack. Unless you upset it.. then watch out for the horns.Utahraptors: These will kill you easily. I've notice they have different skin colors (could be my imagionation) and like the Velociraptors they will hunt in packs. You can scare off one if you can learn to dodge and fight with the balde, but if you want to *cough* hunt it... I suggest learning to use the bow or get the rifle.Tyrannosaurus Rex: Use extreme caution and RUN THE F*** AWAY! Unless you have decent hunting gear on you and with friends. I highly recommend you do not attempt to take it down alone, unless you are very skilled at stealth. Although the death animation is just funny.Flyer: ??? I have no data to give you on how to fight it. I would assume if you hear the flapping, look the the skies and try to kill it before it grabs you. Hunting can be a fun sport (I come from a family of hunters), and I was suprised they applied ""vital hits"". It's just like acutal hunting, quickest way to kill it, aim for the heart!I don't know what else to say about this game other than SURVIVE! Although I would like to seem more dino species in the future.			"

								Walking simulator 0.1 might be a better title, since that is how I feel when I play the game.First of all it is a beautifull game on a large island. The dinos are beautifull.Well other than that, I did actual only see t-rex and non of the other animals anywhere though I walked 10km on the map. I saw many t-rex dinos and they are extremly deadly. However I did manage to survive an attack by hiding in a tree and laying still for 5 minutes while i could hear the t-rex walking arround outside with its big heavy food steps... After a while I thought it is gone and i slowly crawl away and thought I was so lucky to survive.. However the t-rex spotted me and I could hear it come running for me and then I got killed again.Other than that the game is about exploring. I would say it is a kind of survival game and not much a hunting game since there are only 3 animals so far, and it do require you to find som good gear to be able to do anything... This take alot of time and well the game feel like a ""walking"" simulator more than everything els.ALso the story of the game is rather strange. You walk from a-b to hunt dinos, but you have to find boxes of stuff here and there on the map before you can do so. To be honest I do really not understand WHY there in the first place are boxes here and there in a dino world without humans. Im aware there have been other people there to hunt and stuff like that but it still think it is very strange boxes are scattered over the entire island, it simply do not fit in.I hope this game will add many more animals for free and NOT release DLC's with new animals.Also i sincerely hope that the game will not become like ""the hunter"" where you are limited to only hunting a few animals and if you want to hunt more or see another island then you have to pay for it.In general i do not like the game it is simply very borring.. But ofcourse it is in development so lets see how it will evolve.I will maybe write a new review in the future.			"

Early Access Review
								TheHunter: Primal is still quite clearly in early access.There are several issues with the game at the moment, not least of which being the AI, as a lot of people have noted before me. I will give you a short list of the things that are a bit weird/bad in this game:- Raptors are unable to attack you from behind if you simply walk away from them- Raptors act in very weird ways when you have your back faced against them, such as do not attack you, will try to, but are not able to or will just stand next to you and do nothing- Ai pathfinding is quite bad in a lot of cases, causing you to find triceratopses climbing mountains or t-rexes stuck in trees.- Pathfinding is especially an issue when the dinos are chasing you, stopping randomly and making 90 degree turns out of the blue or running around in odd patterns and not directly coming straight at you.- Raptors sometimes absolutely ignore you, even if you are literally standing right next to them.- Dinos often completely ignore the fact that they are being shot at and will not notice you until you have shot your 10th arrow into them.- The dinos will often freeze if you just hide in a bush and they come looking for you, causing them to get stuck into their idle animation indefinitely until you come out of the bush.- Multiplayer barely works.And here is a list of just general things I've noticed in the game:- Weapons do very little damage, HOWEVER this is not a problem and I hope the devs do not buff the weapons, at least not too much. This means that actually killing things requires you to know their weakspots, often this is not the head. This means that you really can't really mow down dinos with guns and have to instead wait for a good moment when you can get a clear shot at their heart, for an example.- Sprint is horribly short and the cooldown for it is horribly long. You can run for about 30 meters and you have to catch your breath for about a minute.- It feels very silly having to stand still for 20 seconds when you run out of ammo to let that raptor you shot claw you to death, maybe the game could use some sort of melee weapons, anything to make it feel like you are actually fighting back, even being able to use your fists would be nice, just give me something to make it feel less like I always just silently have to accept my fate whenever I fail to kill something and run out of ammo.- dinos do not attack eachother. Since when did t-rexes let triceratopses just chill right next to them?- Inventory stuff is a bit broken. You cannot stack smaller stacks of items to create one bigger stack. 1 bullet weighs as much as 20 bullets.- A HUDless mode would be nice, there might be one in the menu, but if not, adding one would be really cool. Although the current HUD is very unnoticeable, which I do appreciate, a HUDless mode would be even better.- You can lose all your items if you suddenly lose connection to the game server, which sucks,Even after all of that, I do really like the game. The sounds are excellent and it is very intense to hear that t-rex stomping behind you while you are hiding in a bush. The game manages to make some really memorable moments happen in its random world almost constantly and I mean that in a good way, not talking about just glitches. If I played this game in junior high, I think this would have been one of those games where me and my friends would just talk about all the crazy stuff that happened to us in this game during lunchbreaks. The gun sound and feel phenomenal, I don't think I have heard better guns in games before, granted I don't know too much about guns, but the guns actually feel like they pack a real punch and aren't just cap guns. The tracking mechanics work great and it is really cool to track down that raptor you shot and which is now running away. The world, albeit a bit bare, looks beautiful.However, even after all that good, I will say I do not recommend this game at its current phase, even though I have myself enjoyed it immensly. This is due to the fact that it is not right now a very good game, due to the bugs and balancing issues, a fun game (in my opinion) maybe, but a good one it is not. However if you are able to look past all the bugs there is a great game in here with an even greater atmosphere where you can easily lose yourself for hours. "

												This Game ROCKS! Absolutely worthy of being a ""complete game""Well balanced, visually stunning(when you're not deep in the jungle), and completely worth the money. As with most games of this genre, survial/hunting, it takes time getting use to. Don't start playing if you're just gonna get frusterated and angry(use dark souls as a litmus test).Personally, I didn't find a gun until hour 10, but that was for a lack of stealth and understanding. If you stay low and hidden, preferably with a buddy, you can easily play the game for hours.In short, ignore reviews that have less than 40hrs gameplay, it takes a few days to understand and appreciate what The Hunter Primal brings to the table.

  Had to change the Review from thumbs down to thumbs up... because even with its flaws, the game is damn addicting and relaxing	well, i say it how it is,the game has a lot of potential, but sadly its a mess full of bugs and glitches. + huge gaming world, some nice visuals, a few good weapons and you can change your clothes+multiplayer actually works, even thought there arent many servers and the playerbase seems to be rather small.- the graphics engine looks dated, many video and animation glitches, the gaming world is very big, but the amount of dinos is pretty low. - sometimes you walk like 30 minutes without seeing any lifeforms. - dinos can get stuck, walk up glitchy trees...- variety of dinosaurs is also very small. i would love to see many more specieswhen i take a look at the forum, it seems like the developers abandoned the game already. hopefully im wrong and we will be seing new content in the future.the problems that the game has could be fixed within a few weeks, with fixing bugs and glitches, adding much more wildlife, but at the moment it doesnt seem like anyone actually cares anymore.TL;DR: with a few changes it could be a masterpiece, but its already very addicting			"

												Overall, a pretty good game, however I feel that alot needs to be added in terms of behavioural traits of the dinosaurs - not once have I come across a silent T-rex in my times of watching tv shows, documentaries, and series and witnessed one myself. I also believe that the basis of when a dinosaur is shot should be a more realistic outcome that what is in place now; I get that this game isnt out of beta or whatever, but still, for future reference. A more realistic outcome may be that they gain a limp/become slower when shot, because in real life, if something is shot, their stamina/whatever is shot is damaged considerably, especially if it is with a high-caliber sniper rifle atleast 20 times. I get that dinosaurs are alot tougher to kill than your average bear or elephant, but they dont require 20 .700 bullets to take a single triceratops down.To add to this, I do believe that the pack-size of certain dinosaurs could be tweaked too. I was lead to believe that T-rex's were solitary, not travelling in packs of 3-5. This element is something I would look into alot because it makes it alot harder for newer players to kill a dinosaur-not that t-rex's are hard enough to kill already- never mind stay alive.In addition, I believe, personally, that a goal is to be added so that the game isnt just leading to the survival of you and your team mates. Maybe personal/team quests could be added, or maybe objectives or something to add an element of challenge towards the game, and not just your ""generic dinosaur sandbox-survival"".Another thing, a positive, is that this game is very aesthetically pleasing. They fixed the aliasing so that this game is less of a headache to play, and not one thing was out of place. The game itself is very artistic and beautiful, and so i give credit to that.Anybody that wishes to buy the game I want to note that this game is still in beta, and so you may have to wait until the game you're lead into believeing is complete is actually polished. They are very frequent with the updating, so i doubt it would take very long to do this. This game would be well worth the money if it was out of beta, I bought this a while ago when it was on sale, so if you get the chance i suggest you buy it then.To sum up:POSITIVES-Aesthetically pleasing-Still in beta, more things to be added.-Good array of weapons and clothing.-Advanced detail in terms of terrain and terraforming.-Dinosaurs are well-textured and can sometimes change depending on their age/gender.NEGATIVES-Pack sizes too large with certain dinosaurs (T-rex's, Triceratops')-Map maybe a little bit difficult to traverse (not a big issue)-hit's need to be more realistic.-maybe a little bit too pricey.**Please note, I am aware that the game is still in Beta. I'm just stating some things that could be added**Overall, a good game and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.			"

								I don't know how far behind in progress this game is but currently it's unplayable for me and friends. The graphics are dead awful, i can't seem to have it run smooth either even on low graphics. It's quite sloppy due to the fact that everything is in progress (including putting a password on a server.). Would i reccomend this game? I don't have enough knowledge to tell you but from what i have gathered, No. Too laggy, seems pointless when you begin, it has alot of missing important features (including changing the graphics INSIDE of the game instead of OUTSIDE). I cant even rate it because it's nowhere near finished.			"

								Probably the worst game I've ever played. The game has no objective and you die every 10 seconds. Whenever you pick something up it seems like you immediately die. Then, whenever you go to get your items back the dinosaurs camp over your pack. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME OR YOU'LL WANT TO KILL YOURSELF FOR MAKING THE MISTAKE OF WASTING YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME. I'd rather play Barbies treehouse.			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.Eat.			"

												The:hunter primal is a game about surviving on a dinosaur island for as long as you can. the game is multiplayer and is quite enjoyable for some people,myself included. You either love it or hate it.Gameplay: i recommend re-binding most of your keys when you start the game because they are not ""normal"" in terms of what you'd expect in a first person shooter.  The gameplay consists of walking,finding loot,see/hear dinosaurs,and shooting dinosaurs in the heart. It can be very very repetetive and boring sometimes,but you get to look at the beutiful world of ""primal eden"" in all of it's glory. there are 5 dinosaurs in the game: The T-rex,triceratops,utharaptor,velociraptor and quetzacoatlus. most of the dinosaurs can be really hard and frustrating to kill,but when you do you feel like a boss.This game can go from astonishingly beutiful to plain down scary,one momment you look at the beutiful sunset ,the other you hear faint stomping growing louder and louder, it is at that point you are standing 6 feet away from a t-rex face to face...then you get eaten.You can customize tha graphics in the launcher and not in-game.I really recommend this game to all of you dinosaur fans !   i rate it 9,5 out of 10Excuse my poor spelling skills because it is 03:04 in the morning and i am tired and cant think straight! :)			"

I did the right thing and youtubed game plays of it before I bought it. Thought it was alright... Then a t-rex decided it'll just jump out in front of me and kill me. Thats fine, it's early access and there will be bugs.Second play through, no boxes with starting loot, thats alright, one in the distance. Get there (somehow without dying) only to get a ♥♥♥♥ing bow and handgun ammo. YAY! I can now shoot these 100% useless bullets with my 100% useless bow. If only I could, then atleast I would've had a fighting chance with the 3 raptors that came and demolished me.I usually don't give out a third chance, but I for some unknown reason, gave this game the benefit of the doubt. I spawned in a vally, near on in the center of it, surrounded by raptors. I gave up. This game is either made as a scam to have people give them money for a game they whiped up in a day and say it's ""early access"" OR this is some sick joke made up to see if their game can make national news because it was used as an excuse as to why they went on that mass murder-spree.I would continue clicking the 'No' button, but that won't accomplish anything, Just like the devopers who created this♥♥♥♥♥♥they thought could be a game.

								Game looks nice, but is unplayable at the moment. You lost connection to server every 30 sek and there is no offline mode.It's a shame, because the game has a lot of potential. The time between two disconnects is indeed fun. Far more than the other TheHunter-Games, in my opinion, who are not my cup of tea. Hunting an Dinosaur has nothing in common with hunting a defenceless deer. In many situation you become the prey.I hope that they will be more dinosaures and more weapons in the future, and that they give us the possibility of swimming and more important jumping.Save your money and wait.

Also adding more dinos and making a campain how you got to Eden and being able to go back up to space to avenge your people that died in Eden and go up to a space station and raiding it to get loot to get back to Earth to learn why they did this to your family or to you.

								Wanted to try this for weeks, held off but finally got the game. Looks great and has potential but after over an hour of trying to play- I only actually got to play about 5 minutes.First time I ran it it ran fine, nice looking world, graphics are nice, smooth fps.Found 2 crates and got the 308 rifle, killed 2 raptors and then the third one killed me, I start over and the screen goes black and says someone disconnected.Only lasted a few seconds but then happens again and the screen was black 5 minutes before I alt tabbed out to find the game not responding.Start new game - pick a server- load in, play a minute then screen goes black again- game not responding.Reload the hunter primal- no hosts found, try to start my own then game freezes again.Already tired of all the issues thats making it unplayable for me.Would get a refund if I could. Guess I wasted $20 and will just have to wait for updates.Shame as it looks to have potential.			"

								My time on Hunter: Primal a difficult time. I got in the game, my first encounter was some grass eater dino or what it's called, Dinos is not really a thing I now much about. I follow it for a while and untill it took me to a weary thick jungle, there I heard some weird sound and that something was moving between the bushes. I moved around for a while hoping that the sound would go away, I knew that it was something in great numbers that my tiny♥♥♥♥♥♥bow wouldn't stand a chance to defeat. 2min later I heard something roar and 3 raptors moved in attack mode straight to me... My second time playing, I thought that I should stay away from the thick jungle and try some other place, maybe more open. That's when my GPS thing start to pick up some loud noice, I follow the GPS coordinates to the sound. After a 300m walk I heard big footsteps I thought to my self ""I'm screwd, ain't I?"" And betwin the trees a big T-rex walked towards me. I pulled my bow and start to fire me arrows, but the T-rex was pretty much careless and just continued to walking towards me. I became T food. I finally found it, a chalange that I can go for, that T-Rex head will hang on my wall, I named him Glen. I know I can take out Glen, I just need to be more carefull and better equipped then just a bow, so I started to scavange for a while, I eventually found a shotgun and ammo, but Glen was stalking me. No matter where I go hes there, it mocks me, I know that. It barely tries to kill me anymore, it just stept on me, or just smack me with it's head, no it didn't eat me, it punched me with it's nose.After some time I found a box with a new map location... It looked like a globe or an atom the icon... Could it be? YES, science! Science can probably help me, I know they can, is there something science can't do? So I had my new destination, towards the science station. After my great journey to science, I could't belive it, Glen was here to, he was looking for me. I took a run for it to the science station, I could hear Glens big footsteps behind me, looking for me. I can't die here, I didn't walk 10 000m to die now. I run, I hide I need to get there, science must have left something good behind for me to take. When I finally arrived, I found two boxes, ""finally, what could be in here?"" I got the first one and opend it and found a shotgun... Well, this could be good, I read the ammo description and noticed it was was specially for big dinos. GREAT, I went to the second one and founda a magnum, this should work to I guess, if I lay down when I shoot I could take him on a mid range. I bucked up and headed towards Glen, he should have left some tracks after him, and he's weary loud to. It didn't take long till he start to roar so my GPS could find the posision the sound comes from. And there he was, Glen, my nemesis, the dino that have made my life to hell here on this planet, I will have my revenge! I found a good hiding spot in a bush, I pulled out my Magnum and aimed carefully on his side neck. If I get a good hit, he should bleed weary much there. I pulled out my first shot, but Glen didn't seem to care weary much. I pulled on more, he looked to the left with no care... WTH, I fire it again, and again and again and again. I fire him 16 times and Glen just didn't care. Then I took my shotgun and fired it. Glen reacted, Could this be it? His weaknes? Glen walked towards me, he knew I was somewhere around, he bypass me, I fired a shot on his neck, he turned around and start to stand over me. My heart start to beat weary loud, I have never been this close to him without him killing me. I couldn't tell if I did any great damage to him, but he walked pass me again later, and I found my chance, I gave him a shot on the side of his head. And I shot again, and again... After 10 round on the same spot, I couldn't believe it, he was still standing, after so much fire power Glen is still standing. Glen left after I feelt my defeat, and found some blood on the ground he left, I took my GPS and scanned it... No... how is it possible? The blood scanned showed that Glen still haves 99%hp left! It's not possible, I.... I... I don't know how to kill Glen... I... I need him dead, I have to see him dead now! I will continue fighting, I will have his head on my wall singing a fun jingle over my fireplace! Some day I will see him fall to the ground, if it so take me my entire LIFE!!!10/10 would Hunt for revenge again!			"

								This game is very fun and exciting to play. The aggression system that the dinosaurs use is very unique compare to games I have previously played. There are a few bugs that happen in the game, but so far nothing game breaking. It can be worked on a little more in terms of the stamina system goes. Other than that I am thoroughly loving this game. Check out my youtube channel as well to see the fun I am having! www.youtube.com/diablo2lordd I am very excited to see how this games continues to develope.			"

								Wait for new content before buyingMain Problems-Raptors are to hard to kill and appear to often-Travelling is a pain-When ""fighting"" a raptor (which is what you are doing the whole game) you don't die instantly therefore you don't feel very tense, just annoyed as it slowly kills you, plus when you hit it in the face it won't die-Dinosaurs can sense you way to easy making it difficult to escape or traverse the landscape			"

								Fairly basic game, seems like it took around 5 whole minutes to develope. The controls are complete garbage. Games now should not take multiple key presses to get one function to work. This game has massively delayed controls. Secondly, hiding is a complete issue, as the clipping of dinosaurs is almost completely no exsistant. Also, the map seems as if a child of really low intelligence made it. It has steep cliffs, and your character can't climb most hills, let alone you get massively damaged if you manage to slip on one of these. Oh, another thing, there are tons of islands on the game, non of which you can visit as your character can't swim and is paralized for several seconds apon touching water.This game is poorly programmed, poorly developed, and seems as if it were another game made by Sergey Titov, except that War Z was better programed when it was first released, and that says alot.

												This game is most certainly complete, unlike what other reviews are saying. The mecahnics all work, the dinosaur AI has been vastly improved from what it was, and the number of bugs have been greatly decreased. The Hunter: Primal is a game filled with content and the developers were (and still are) consistantly patching the game and it will continue to get better.The most important thing to say about this game is that it is NOT for everybody. This is a game that requires time and effort to excel at and most people will get angry or give up when they first play. It is a survival/hunting game where you kill dinosuars. why would it be easy?The thing I like most about this game is the suspense. You start out in an unfamiliar island, armed with only a bow (or now a machete) and you have to survive long enough to find better weapons and become the hunter, rather than the hunted. There are heart pounding moments when you are crawling through the jungle trying desperately not to be seen by a pack of raptors hunting you or when you first hear the stomping of a T.rex as it approaches you and subsequently eats you. The Hunter: Primal is best played with friends. Trekking across the jungle to team up with a buddy and hunting and killing a T.rex is a great feeling and it takes a lot of what can be stressful moments away if you have a friend to be with you.  In review (get it) this game is fantastic and it only continues to get better as the developers update and improve it. It will take some getting used to and has a steep learning curve but if this game style interests you (and especially if you have buddies to play with) it can be played for hours on end. Plus who doesnt love dinosaurs "

								I was looking forward to this game until I played it..... First off, you can only run for a few seconds at a time and then it takes forver to charge back up, this gets very old very quick.  Next you are so underpowered to fight any of the dinosaurs, ""It really grinds my gears"" as Peter Griffen would say.  However, if you want to walk around in a forest all day with the only highlight being able to find a piece of dino poop; then this could be the game for you.  For the majority of gamers out there this is how we will remember this game... A big T-Rex sized pile of poop.			"

												The Hunter:Primal Is an Amazing outtake on hunting. Where you play as a pioneer sent down from space to 'cleanse' his permenant record of crime. With the dinosaurs being powerful and you being, well, weak. Its hard to survive at first. and teaming up to take down big game. It sets a semi-accurate example of what life would be like if humans were actually hunting dinosaurs.			"

												Look at my hours. They speak for the review. That is mainly COOP hours.All I have to say is look at my screenshots and my dozens of Youtube videos to get your own opinion. I still recommend it at any price. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX4p-_9SVg9Pbhj4s6clnlWUcfF87f84rSo this is almost a year later than my first review when I was a super noob. What do I say? I still say it is worth playing and going through all your achievements. If you don't pvp and need someone to kill to get them then just ask me and when I have time I will help you get those too. This is a hunting simulator. It is for patient and mature minded people but anyone can have fun if they just opren their minds and have fun with it.I think it is $9.99 now. That game is well worth the price. There are games that are selling for more that are utter crap and this is not one of them. If you take notice to what detail is in the game then yo would certainly appreciate it more. Did you notice the T-Rex has a tounge and licks his snout occasionally? That is detail they did not have to put in. If you have a low spec machine it will run like it is a low spec game. That is not the game's fault. It is made for a higher spec PC and gaming lap-top. Happy hunting !!!Happy Hunting !!!			"

Or let you make somewhere your camp so you can leave inventory before you go on a hunt , in case you get killed. even with that being said I still love this game.			"

												its a pretty fun game, but the fact that the developers abandoned the game after only 5 dinosaurs and a limited ability to do anything except to creep around, makes the game simply a one trick pony, if thats all you are looking for, have fun, otherwise turn to something else.UPDATE: so the devs go back around to updating the game, i went back and gave it another chance. it seems most of the bugs have been worked out, except for stealth dinos every once in a whle.

												December 15th 2015: ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME, so full of bugs, bad spawning point and ♥♥♥♥ off, Just buy a game like ARK Survival Evolved.I played as a solo player so my evaluation might not apply for multiplayer.  My first impression is that this game is a hunting game where 99% of the time, you're the prey. Of the three types of dinosaurs that you can hunt, the tyrannosaurus is to player what he is to a ant. The utahraptor make you feel uneasy when it's alone and it get worse when they're in pack. The triceratops goes from ""easy prey"" to fast as hell when you manage to hit it, and you have to follow it to the gate of hell to hunt it down. This game is not a survival game, as the only threat to  your life are the dinosaurs and the water (because you can't swim). There is no consideration about sleeping, eating, drinking, infections and other hazard that we love to overcome in survival game. I didn't notice fall damage, especially when I fell from a huge mountain. Of course, the game is in early access so I'm sure the game will be a blast with a interesting start like thatPro:-Beautiful environment-The settlements seem to show potential for safe haven or some history -The dinosaurs are very well done and their behavior are interesting Con:-The shooting system is not great, especially in a tight spot-The basic bow is pretty useless no matter what you are hunting and to get better weapons, you have to search for hours. And even with better weapons, you need to use stealth like I never had to in other game.-The inventory does not combine similar items together, like arrow or bullet.-To have a true hunting gear, it's all up to luck and hours of search for almost nothing-There is no crafting-The variety of dinosaurs needs to be increased.

												A really good dino survival game! Scary and enticing! You will die every 10 minutes! But thats about the only good things about the game. Players (IF YOU CAN FIND ANY) are annoying and are asses, the dinos are completely annoying because you can't do anything about them unless you have the♥♥♥♥♥♥in the game, or if your in a very well coordinated group. you can't really ge anything good because dinos are everywhere near the good stuff and you would get killed going anywhere near anything good.

I do not recommend playing alone - always more fun to watch others get chomped by t-rex while you run away and surive :)).			"

												The Hunter: Primal is an amzing game. I love playing this game with my friend, but, the stress of not knowing when you might come accross a raptor is horrible. The game overall is really good, but there are a few things that I think could be improved. First, it is nearly impossible to find guns. My friend and I went all around the world looking for anything, guns, arrows, and ammo. But not once in the countless crates i've opened have i come accross a gun. I think the spawn rate of guns needs to be increased. Also the raptors are dumb. They run right by you and then look around like you dissapeared(Which can be good). But overall, i think it is a really good game.			"

												Ok this is my first review so stick with me here.The hunter primal is a hunting game where you have to actually get off your backside and stalk the enemy there is none of this guns blazing so if you are impatient don't get it and if you do you've been warned so don't come here kicking and screaming after 2 hours of gameplay calling it s%%t there are pro's and con's like with all games of this caliber yes the devs could put more into it with updates new dino's and new weapons, they should also do something about the amount you can carry.you dont need real money to buy the better gear it can all be found in game or you get in game currency when you kill the dino's but you'll only get to use that when you die and trust me YOU WILL DIE!you are being hunted everything wants to kill you and on the pvp servers its twice as bad.if you like games where you hunt in the means of tracking the prey then stalking it actually aiming and saving ammo and getting that good shot in the head or heart top drop the ""trophy"" or shoot it in the lungs legs or wherever and follow a blood trail then this is for you.if you cant be bothered to wait around save ammo and try to find the biggest trike or something then dont get it.hopefully the devs will put more into it but there is a big emphasis on hopefully the devs will put more into this			"

								Has the potential of becoming a true gem. Curious how it's gonna turn out.Graphics - 9/10Dino textures are top notch, world looks great, same texture quality as theHunterAudio - 10/10Best part of the game, adds huge immersiveness to the gameHearing those raptors allmost plotting their plan.Gameplay - 7/10 Needs some fine tuning. Lesser amount of dino's; it would be nicer if the T Rex was a rare sighting. Sometimes they even spawn next to eatch other. Raptors in pacts. And Tri in herde. More dino diversity, but that's probably on the agenda.Points of interest should be worked out a bit more. So, final verdict. This is early access, but if all game releases would be like theHunter: Primal, there would be less complaining. It's more than a succes. Some minor bugs.			"

								So far, I feel like it may be exeedingly incomplete. But, my experience may also be influenced by my computer specs. The trees looked like giant cones from only a small distance, and as I got closer the turned into real trees. The ground was covered in bushes that were surouned in grey polygons and I could hardly tell what I was walking on. I had no idea where I was supposed to go to get weapons. I could walk right through the pod I assume I came out of. I would like to hear some audible naration at the beginning at least. I hit control and ended up swimming in the groung or something. The controls were not really explained at all when I started playing. Also, starting up the game did not close the opening window that you would hit ""Play Game"" on. So it left multiple windows open. I reallly hope to see the game a bit more playable; I was reallly excited to play a hunting/survival game and it was not really playable on day two. Again, My experience may have been influenced by my personal computer. I really hope to see this game excel and become a long, hardly ending, fight for survival game. I want to run through the woods, hide in a cave for shelter, and Hunt dinosaurs for food lol! I really dont even care about a campaign  personally.			"

While it's true that that the dinosaurs AI has room for improvement, it easily makes up with an awesome environment (kudos for the soundtrack) and the importance of it, somewhat realistic play and a genuinely stressful environment (you start walking and begin to hear sounds of Utahraptors circling you).

								Game plays pretty well. Feels good, graphics are great, and it is scary/hard as hell at first. Like a survival game should be. After you get a weapon the little carnivors are not such a issue!As far as the excitment goes it is always a thrill to hunt a Raptor just to figure out it has a pack of them that is actually hunting you. Once you run, they will fallow your scent. This is why I LOVE IT!!!Game is limited as of now. Not many guns, animals, things to do (besides survive) but that is what I love about it!When the game developes more it should be amazing. Bigger company behind it so hopefully they can fix things such as the balance of sprinting/stamina or how the animals will get stuck on objects when trying to attach you... still a great game as of now!

								The game is definitely fun and you're on the right track if you like dinosaurs.  It is sort of similiar to thehunter but with more of a survival aspect.  The rush of getting hunted yourself is really awesome.Downside to the game appears to be the devs.  I play lots of other alphas and the devs for this one tend to keep quiet more.  You don't feel like you have that constant communication like you do with beasts of prey.  Also their support is very slow.  I opened a ticket with them and it took well over 24 hours for them just to respond.So far the good outweighs the bad though.  We'll see how this game goes.			"

								My first impressions of this game is that it is great and has awesome potential.  I love the atmospherics sounds, the feeling of am I the only humna alive on this planet, and the dinosaurs sounds.  Playing with my headphones on I was walking along when I thought I could hear a vary faint thump thump thump  in my ears.  As it grew louder I fell to the ground on my belly and waited.  Sure enough a T-Rex came over the hill and walked passed me within about twenty feet.  It paused and sniffed the air before giving a little roar and moved off.  It was a breath-holding experience.  Once it was far enough away I sneaked off. Fantastic!			"

												This game is an absolute atroccity and should be taken down from the store. the devs are scumbags, don't listen, released the game out of ea out of the blue despite being nowhere near finished and they don't update it at all. they have abandoned this game despite having huge potential and was executed quite well, it just never got completely finished. please don't support this kind of behaviour by buying this game. stay away and just buy ark survival evolved if you are looking for something similar. I myself used to be excited getting home and logging onto steam just to get some more loot, hunt some more dinosaurs or maybe survive the bloody birds. now I stare at this game in despair and look at what it has become and what could have been.

												Not recomended, I hinestly wasted my time with this game.  I bought it because it seemed cool and interesting, but it is clearly shown that there was little to no thought into would make this type of game great.  Didn't really run well on my computer either. Although that isn't the games fault,  the graphics and action were not enough to have been running so slow on my system.   The games damage system seems to me to complete erratic and unpredictable.  Was looking forward to a diverse number of dinos and there was only 5 different species.  It is so utterly difficult to level up to be able to start with a gun, albeit not a good one, that it madee me want to pull out my hair.  "

												I'm going to keep this short, sweet, and to the point.Ok I bought this game the day after it entered Early Access. It was like Dec. 16 2014 or sometime around them.I am reccomending this game for these reasons-Fun with friends-Can meet new friends-Terrifying dinos-Pretty good graphics-Nice atmosphere-frickin' dinosI am warning you about this game for these reasons-Rough/awkward movements-Basically abandonded by the devs-Few weapons-Horrible PvP (Havent played in a while but last time I did it was unresponsive)-Linear gameplay-At times too easy-Not very many species of dinos-Bugs. Bugs everywhereWrap Up: This game is very buggy but has its moments. The dinos always cause a sense of fear especially the Utahraptors' calls and screeches (sent shivers down my spine many times)The team competitions can be pretty fun and being able to snipe raptors from a long distance seems to never get old. Would I reccomend it? If you are willing to deal with slow devoloping and awkward controls then yes. Buy this game.			"

								Very fun and realistic game. It actually matters where you shoot the dinosaurs, for example if they got shot in the long they could try to escape but quickly die due to their injury.Yes, I know this is early access but I'd like to make a suggestion. As of now, 12/27/14 I think there are way too many t-rex's. Every time I spawn im killed by a trex within a few minutes. If not less trex's then make it harder for them to catch you, like giving them poor eyesight and scent.Other than that I think its a great game and i cant wait to see what else they add.--EDIT--Devs have abandoned the game, which has very minimal content and much less than was promised.

												I have no idea what the others are talking about, but this game is beautiful, the atmosphere is tense, and although there are only five dinosaurs, the world does seem quite full. My girlfriend loves dinosaurs, so we got this game to play, and I was very skeptical at first, and doubted the content it possessed, ready to demand a refund. After portforwarding so we could do a private game, we were plunged into a canyon, cut by a river. I tried to reach her and immediately, I was greeted by a set of teeth that belonged to a raptor. I got destroyed. Keep in mind this is five mintues in. I tried to go back to my corpse to get my items to then again, be greeted by an abnoxious raptor. I hid in a bush while it looked for me, and I heard the ground being stomped on. I thought ""Great. I am f*****"" and I was. A T-rex stepped over the bush I was in and looked at the little rapor, and I FIGURED they'd fight to the death. I was wrong. They teamed up and scanned for me together. After waiting for what seemed an eternity, the duo left and we continued our journey. Which ended in us getting trapped by the same T-rex, and we jumped to our deaths. 10/10 I love it.			"

								    This game is a lot different then i thought it would be when i purchased it. I love the graphics and dinosaur designs. There are more cons than pros in my opinion, at the moment though. I know this is early access but at this point in time your character walks incredibly slow, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the fact that running doesnt boost your speed that much, and the lack of stamina to begin with, just makes out for boring gameplay. My last complaint is the dinosaur AI. you can simply walk away from a Utahraptor without it harming you, and the voices of the dinosaurs repeat very quickly which makes it sound cheesy.      theHunter: Primal does have a lot of great things coming its way though if they can pull it off. But for what it has now is good enough as a dinosaur game by far. If you're a dinosaur fan and enjoy a beautiful open world, i highly recommend this game. I think its definitely worth it, especially if you want to support. "

								TheHunter: Primal takes everything good about TheHunter and makes it more awesome. You still have the slow ramble through the wild while you look for beasts, listening for their cries, tracking them, and trying to sneak close enough to get in a good shot.. only now you're tracking dinosaurs. And they can track you back.My second time out in Primal Eden I came upon a Triceratops. After startling him I followed his trail for a while before I realized the growling behind me wasn't just part of the general atmosphere. Diving into a bush saved me from a Utahraptor who walked by and presumably kept tracking the same animals I was. But when I made to leave the safety of the underbrush, another Utahraptor brought up the rear. I froze.. but it was too late. I became his lunch.Great game, I'm going to play it for a long time. I get giddy when I remember this is in beta and it'll be even more awesome as time goes by. I hope for a lot of dinosaurs to be added in.Oh, and unlike TheHunter, there are no memberships or micro-transactions. You buy the game and it is yours, and you find what you need through luck and perseverance.			"

								In this game you are air dropped into a world inhabited by dinosaurs where you try to hunt and kill them for sport.You start off with a bow and a handful of arrows and must make your way on foot using a hand-held computer to find better weapons and gear, as well as track dinos.There are currently 3 types of dinos in this game: Raptors, Triceratops, and the T-Rex.  The other threat are poisonous plants.As far as I can tell - you do not craft or build anything in this game.Pros:- The map is massive - I'm guessing it's probably about the size of Maui.  - The flora is nice looking.Cons:- The bow is almost worthless.  The odds of taking out a raptor is very slim.- If you sprint - you run out of stamina after 20-40 yards/meters.- If you exit the game, you will lose all of your weapons, ammo, and other gear.- you cannot cross water that is knee deep (or deeper).Overall:In this game:  You walk thru the jungle.  When a raptor attacks you, you shoot at it with whatever weapon you have on hand (only vital shots count).  If you killed it, you scan the kill in your computer (yay points).  If you did not one-shot the raptor, you die.  If more than one raptor attacks, you die.  If you encounter a T-rex, you die.  This is a walking/hunting/dying simulator. "

												I want to preface this review by stating that the game can actually be enjoyable in small doses with several people. The game has a plethora of issues between glitchy hitboxes, glitchy textures, glitchy movement, overpowered dinosaurs, underpowered weapons, a shortage of weapons, an incredibly large distance of aggravation for t-rexes, and a map that is simply too big to explore at the snails pace that you move.A huge game issue for me is simply the fact that after dinos are hit often enough they run away at a speed you can't match. As soon as they exit the camera it's almost as if their health resets. This is an infuriating mechanic for a game with the objective to actually kill things.An important thing to note is that firearms or a bow is almost required to kill a dino, and they are found few and far between.Ultimately, this is a game with a lot of potential, which was overall wasted.

The scenery is phenomenal, and the game play is pretty smooth.  Although the raptors are annoying, and the occasional t-rex spawn trap ruin things from time to time, it wouldn't be nearly as fun without those surprise elements! The game will needs work in areas but is overall fantastic!  Well worth it to me, but maybe not if you've never hunted or had any kind of patience to stalk prey and defend against predators constantly.			"

												Was walking along when I first started the game. Got told to go to the Volcano. Ran into a Utahraptor, killed it with two arrows. Felt like a beast, then continued north to find a T-Rex. It didn't go as nicely.11/10 Will continue to get turned into neat poop piles.EDITED:I havent touched touched it since the ""Full Release"" update. Nearly nintey hours of gameplay, learning to differentiate the sounds enough that I could avoid dying too much, figuring that you kind of need to be effective with every weapon in case you get ammo boned, even one instance where a friend popped up Cheat Engine and changed the Utahraptor spawn to near triple. Fortunately we had a log and ammo. Unfortunately, forty utahs later we were almost out of ammo and there were still more raptors. But that was beside the point. The point is of those near nintey hours I put in, a third was walking, some was being dead and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥cause my stuff was essentially gone (usually it was a rex or a pack of raptors), and the rest, close to half of it, was legitimately fun gameplay.Then Avalanche took off and left us all with our asses in the wind.

												It's like all the other reviews said, it had a lot of potential.They promised a lot but delivered the most minimum amount possible and I sincirely doubt they'll update again.In the 2 hours I played so far I have literally seen all the dinosaurs, all 5 dinosaurs.I got this game really cheap but even then it's not quite worth it since the mechanics are sloppy, too few dinosaurs and tracking doesn't work most of the time. Co-op is hardly co op since you have to walk a few kilometres to find your friend IF you survive or play long enough to either find weapons or make enough money to buy nice weapons upon respawn.If you want a dinosaur game check out Ark, it looks a lot more promising so far!

												This is actually my first review of a game (I believe), so I'll try to be very honest.I got this game in a bundle, and was thinking that this would be similar to Savage Lands, or Rust or any other game like that. Instead, I got very happy when I found out your main objective is to HUNT DINOSSAURS, which sounds and should be extremely awesome and fun. Instead what you get is a barely playable piece of garbageware.There are several things wrong with this game, but I'll start with the few that ARE good:- For the size of the island and the amount of things it renders, it runs very smoothly compared to other similar games, that are usually terribly optimized for PC;- The dinossaur models look really nice. They did an awesome job modeling these creatures;- The sound plays a very important role, which is always nice;- Multiplayer hosting is very easy and straight forward;And that's basicly all there is good to it.Everything else is pretty bad:- You can't run 50 metres without running out of stamina. Remember that you are playing a game where you fight dinossaurs, often bigger and faster than you, and you cannot run enough to dodge their attacks. I read the forums, some people view this as CHALLENGE, where I just view it being abnoxious, because the very moment you find yourself at the wrong end of a dinossaur, you're done for.- Did I mention that the stamina you use for running is also the same stamina used for attacking? That makes a hit & run strategy completely out of the question. you either hit and die or run and die a little bit later.- The fact that you can't run makes playing with friends extremely annoying, since when you die, you respawn nearly a mile away from a friend, and walking takes alot of time.- Your initial weapons are pretty much useless. Regardles of how much you manage to dodge the dinossaurs and attack, the moment the dinossaurs feel like they're getting too hurt, they run away instantly. This makes sense, and I can imagine it would lead to extremely fun moments where you'd race against the dinossaur or stalk him to his nest if, you know,  you could actually run.- Regardless of the dinossaur's difficulty, they're pretty dumb. If you circle them by the tail they'll just endlessly turn with you. Ocasionally they'll try to run forward and turn around to gain some space, but if you go after them you'll get them by the tails again.- There are smaller dinossaurs in the island that are actually killable. I figured they'd be for early-game, for people to hunt down these easier dinossaurs until you progress and unlock better stuff to kill the big dinossaurs with. Big F-ing nope. They attack you, take life easily from you if they're in a group, and give you nothing at all if you kill every single one of them. Not a single G.- The game is very undecisive when it comes to movement in various terrains. You aren't allowed to jump, but you can take fall damage from very small falls. You can climb up mountains that almost make 90 degrees with the ground at regular speed as if it were nothing, but good luck trying to go back down. Yeah, apparently all the dinossaur dung on top of the mountain made your feet slippery, and as soon as you touch the ground to climb down again you'll instantly slip and fall to your death.I could go on for several more points, but I feel like these are the main decisive points on why I recommend people to avoid buying this game. I have played bad games on Steam and never wrote a review on them, but I had to for this game, for the simple reason that it had everything needed to be a great game, and in the end it feels more like a slap in the face for ever buying it.4/10 - in need of a serious revamp.

												Pretty graphics, nice sound athmosphere and the map is huge and well done. Lot of weapons already available and few munitions. Dinos are real killers and taking them down is a real long run.Well, that's all for the good points.Reality is that the game is empty. Map too huge, have to run like crazy to get first  nearest weapon (if of course you don't get kill first trying to save your♥♥♥♥♥from a dino with your basic chop-chop).Dinos themselves are cheaply animated. Attacks mainly consisting in charging, turn around, charging again.Nothing to do except run for guns/ammos then kill a beast then go back first task.Let's be honnest, the thrill keeps on for like an hour or two then you get yourself bored to death...

												I bought this game in a bundle for 6 euros along with 9 other games and i have to say i feel cheated. If i would split the price between those games and assume this game cost me 0,60€ i would still feel cheated, yes this game is that bad.Whats bad? You can only run for like 6 seconds and even that is risky cuz you need that stamina to swing your machete at stuff. You die a lot, not because the game is hard or whatever but because you just won't find any weapons to deal with those big reptiles and i refuse crawling on the floor because the walking is slow enough already. Oh and those nice sound effects, i could literally hear every dinosour on the Island even if there was not one in a radius of 5 kilometers from me. Oh yeah and if you buy this game let me tell you the epic way to NOT die because of raptors, they charge and you walk sideways, epic AI leads to epic fights (insert sarcasm here).			"

												This game is unfinished. It's glitchy and the interface is clunky. For instance, to change ammo types you have to open the equipment menu, drag the old ammo type off the gun, and drag the new ammo  type onto the gun. One of the first items I found was a shotgun sight that refused to be attached to my shotgun. There are only five types of dinosaurs. And only one map. While Perfect Dark offered us tons of bodies and heads  to customize your character with in 2000, in theHunter here are four (badly rendered) characters to pick from. I'm not even sure what this game is trying to -be-. I mean, a typical FPS would offer more weapon and enemy types. An action-adventure game should have mechanics for climbing trees, catching yourself as you begin to fall, and require you to catch food. A survival-horror game would involve puzzles, build tension, and have some sort of goal beyond shooting dinosaurs for XP.			"

												Glad I didn't pay full price for this game or I would be furious.This is a $5 game at best in it's current state.This game should still be early access it's far from being done. It's a great concept but really the mouse movement is broken, no POV options, hit detection seems to be broken and movement/control in the game is just not what you would expect from a finished product.

												I'm pretty torn on this game.  You're thrown into a new world through an escape pod and left with a machete and a map chip to help guide you through an expansive world.  Your apparent objective is to hunt down as many dinosaurs before succumbing to your inevitable demise.  Once you die, your equipment and your body is left to be eaten while a ""family member"" is spawned at a random place nearby.  If you want that equipment back, you basically have to trek through the jungles and mountains to regain your possessions or search for more boxes of goodies scattered throughout the lands.  The pros of this game are that you get to walk around with dinosaurs, enjoying the view, and taking the time to learn the long-lost art of tracking down game.  You can spend hours doing this.The cons are plentiful.  There aren't many dinosaurs.  You'll only get the 5 types of dinosaurs advertised.  It can get pretty repetitive hunting down the same dinosaurs over and over.  There's not much variety in that sense.  To make matters worse, the AI for the dinosaurs are pretty bad.  They each have their own way to move, which of course makes sense, but they tend to move directly towards a waypoint.  If you run out of the way, they will not change their path.  They'll arive at the waypoint, then turn around to recalculate.  This doesn't make the game any easier, because the T-Rex will kill you, but the realism takes a hit in that sense.  To add to the cons, the game is not fun when you're playing it alone.  It's all fine and dandy while learning how to do things, but once you figure out the main aspect of the game it gets pretty boring.  I can only play long enough until I die, and then I shut the game off.  There are no missions or no primary objectives.  You just kill dinosaurs and hope to harvest them for points.  You collect the same objects over and over, and then go out and use them against only a few of the dinosaurs.  The rest of the time, you're tracking for hours looking for the one that you wounded while avoiding the ones that are just too hard to kill or more likely to kill you in one blow.  You need multiplayer to make this game enjoyable.And my biggest buzz kill is no controller support.  I never liked keyboard/mouse games, especially when I have a perfectly good controller that can execute all of the small list of tasks available to the player.  Your guy can't even climb, jump, or swim, so there's nothing complex behind slapping on a few instructions for a controller.Overall, I say it's a well made game that I enjoyed for some time and would recommend for others to play, but like the dinosaurs it doesn't stand the test of time.

												12/17/2014: So far I'm loving this game. I've played about 6 hours as of writing this and I've played solo as well as with friends. I will say, if you're looking for a terrifying experience, play solo. With the lights off. With the bass on the speakers way up. And put a glass of water next to you.The gameplay feels little clunky and rigid, but it's an early alpha stage of the game and there's only 3 types of dinosaurs at the moment, but for what stage this game is in it looks beautiful, the sound effects are terrifying, and it's not a run and gun once you get gear, but you MUST evade dinosaurs at all times or you're probably going to die. They're clever and violent.Aside from the expected buggy nature of an early alpha game, I would highly recommend this game. 9/10UPDATEUPDATEUPDATEUPDATEUPDATEUPDATEUPDATEUPDATEUPDATEUPDATE!UPDATE 3/3/2015: As a full release game, there isn't much that has been added to the game and there's a serious lack of variety in dinosaurs and vegetation. There's a barely existent backstory, no driven purpose, and it feels like it was rushed to release with a promise of more material based on how well the game does AFTER ""Full"" release. That's a very poor marketing choice and practically screams ""Bored, now! Here's this thing we made. Now get bent.""The game can't do well if it's left unfinished by community standards, but promising to finis- errr, ""add more"" to the game if it does well despite that fact is foolish and near-sighted. It cannot do well in its current state and I am thoroughly disappointed in the devs for rushing it to release with so little content.			"

								Graphics are excellent if your PC can handle them lots of incidental, animations happenning all the time. Unfortunately I am still on the learning curve and coupled with a few bugs, e.g. half the time I start a game my player is locked facing one direction so if I want to move left I end up moving sideways, cant sprint either, so just walk along casually with a t-rex chomping at my back, I am sure if this is not specifically related to my installation it can easily be fixed, annoying getting killed by something I cant even see ! Not had too much time on this because of the direction bug, but all I managed to find was a couple of rocks 1 mushroom and a lot of teeth in my back. Cant even punch in this game, the thing that is eating me just munches away while I stand there holding up my GPS device like a tv remote.  That said I think bugs aside, there has been a lot of hard work put into this game, I am sure with bugs fixed it will be highly reccomended.  "

												This game is finally what I've been waiting for since Carnivores 2 came out on PC ages ago.  You hunt dinosaurs, not deer, in a big world with plenty of weapons full of immersion.  The sounds are amazing and can really get you tense when a T-Rex is around.  However, at its current stage, the price is a little bold.  They've done pretty much everything right to please me, but the lack of dinosaur species and lack of interaction between the different species that are there makes the world feel . . . well . . . empty.  Especially when I only play solo.  However, the game is only worth like ten to fifteen bucks at its current state.  If the developers can bring in more species (not all of them needing to be carnivores either) and program them to realistically interact with each other, than I would rate this game a 10/10 because seriously.  Dinosaurs!			"

The leveling system quickly becomes unnecessary as the loot you find quickly outrank what you can purchase in the store.

								In this game you are air dropped into a world inhabited by dinosaurs where you try to hunt and kill them for sport.You start off with a bow and a handful of arrows and must make your way on foot using a hand-held computer to find better weapons and gear, as well as track dinos.There are currently 3 types of dinos in this game: Raptors, Triceratops, and the T-Rex.  The other threat are poisonous plants.As far as I can tell - you do not craft or build anything in this game.Pros:- The map is massive - I'm guessing it's probably about the size of Maui.  - The flora is nice looking.Cons:- The bow is almost worthless.  The odds of taking out a raptor is very slim.- If you sprint - you run out of stamina after 20-40 yards/meters.- If you exit the game, you will lose all of your weapons, ammo, and other gear.- you cannot cross water that is knee deep (or deeper).Overall:In this game:  You walk thru the jungle.  When a raptor attacks you, you shoot at it with whatever weapon you have on hand (only vital shots count).  If you killed it, you scan the kill in your computer (yay points).  If you did not one-shot the raptor, you die.  If more than one raptor attacks, you die.  If you encounter a T-rex, you die.  This is a walking/hunting/dying simulator. "

								Open world, no hand holding dinosaur hunting game. Even though its still being created and updated, it has a nice level of polish. Animations look great, and the enviroment looks nice. Dinosaurs are scary, due to how easy they can kill you, but also scary in a  realistic sense because they dont always find you. Join a player vs. player server and basically play ""Hunger games: Dinosaurs are here too""Some of the most suspensful moments in this game are the moments when you dont even push a key or move the mouse, and  a T-Rex is walking 6 feet away from you. Do you move away, or hope it passes? You only have 6 arrows and 4 magnum rounds. Its choices like these that really are special with this game. Your not overpowered with machine guns, and you move like a human carrying gear.Throw some headphones on, and you can really sink many hours into this game looking for better gear, and hunting. However to call the game a hunter game at times can be tough, might as well call it ""TheSurvivor"" because you feel powerless at times. You usually start off with a bow and arrows but their is almost no way to tell were the arrow flys when you shoot it until you see the little ""smoke"" effect it makes hitting the ground. Making it a bit frustrating to use at times unless you like 10 feet away from a raptor. Obviously if your 10 feet from a ratpor with a bow, your a dead man if there are 2  or more raptors which is almost the case, so prepare to die a lot.Likes:-Dinosaurs! (Only 3 for now, but its the most requested 3 I would say)-Open world-Not an easy game-Multiplayer! Play with up to 16 people as teams! Or play against other players! (2 types of enemys!)-Player vs player mode really is scary with both threats everywhere, only using your ears and eyes-Your little screen device will give you subtle hints on dino locations, but not enough to feel overpoweredDislikes:-The Bow is not well designed. Aim and fire and you dont see the arrow in the air, only were it hits assuming you hit ground and can see the ""smoke"" effect. Makes you say ""Were did the arrow go?"" a lot. Especially since this is a starting weapon, it makes it frustrating when the game also spawns you near 4 raptors. Would be nice if it worked like a crossbow with some kind of indicator of distance and being able to see the arrow fly to adjust aim.-Sound design can be better. Its not sounds themselves, but were the sound is coming from. The Trex stomping is an awesome sound, but it seems like it just plays, with little sense of direction. A lot of sounds could use a better sense of direction. I can tell its coming from behind me, or in front of me but not to the left right or center. -There is too much walking with not enough reward. The best loot (Weapons) are only at specific camps marked on maps while there are random pick ups across the map but they always have decent stuff. Why cant the randoms have good pick ups? Makes me only want to check out camps.Overall if you like dinosaurs, and dont mind open world games, I would for sure reccomend this game! It will require patience as it is set as a hunting game. So dont come in expecting dino kill streaks, since every kill counts in this game.Grab your headphones and prepare for dino suspense that you cant buy anywhere else.			"

								OMG!!!! I hate and totally love this game. It is by far the most intense, at times, game I've played yet. It does have some drawbacks though which I will address in a minute. First, i'd like to congratulate the dev team that worked on the sound and graphics. Some of the settings are absolutely spectacular. My brother and I just bought it today and I found myself staring at a couple of sunsets and a triceratops roaming down by the ocean. They're so life-like.The utahraptors...don't get me started. They were so hard to deal with in the dense forest I finally quit trying to get my stuff back. I was almost there once. I was traveling a little gully and saw a pack of them ahead of me say 50 yards away. Too late, I've been spotted. I laid down and worked my way over against the side of a rock wall as they approached. I can hear them hissing and that weird growling. One just walked right by me.  My God, they're everywhere. I can see their tails. Okay, my screen is red and I'm am feeding them with my entrails. I love this game.The pros are the intensity is insane. There are long stretches when nothing happens, but the never knowing when something is going to happen, especially at night makes the intensity more enthralling. The sound and graphics are top-notch. The utahraptors actually herded us up a hill where we had no choice but to take a stand against them. Very real feeling of dread. Between my bow and my brother's .308 scoped hunting rifle we won. My brother ran out of bullets. I'm going to cut this short because he's back and we're going to play some more.The minuses are the stamina. It runs out wat too fast IMO. Should last a little longer, but not too much. There's not enough wildlife yet. There should be a crafting system to build a place to make a homebase. Or perhaps a structure that can be used as one. That's it for now. If you like survival games, some long stretches of just looting and exploring followed by stomach twisting moments of chaotic mayhem where hours of hard work can be extinguished by one bite...this game should not be missed. Twenty bucks and my brother and I are hooked. In the immortal words of Axl Rose, welcome to the jungle baby...you're gonna die!			"

												this wasnt worth it, somehow i got comfused and bought the wrong game, but that was my fault, still when i bought it i expected it to be similar screamshoots, but all i saw was a chunck of low graphics, walked around a hour, what did i found? absoluty nothing, i died for no reason twice, not for hunger, or either being killed, if you consider on buying this or other survivial games.. i recomend the new one which is pre-realese... if you dont have enough money for both dont waste your money on this pathethic scam.

												Don't get me wrong, this game is addicting but it's really unfinished and they could do a lot with it. It would be a huge addition if they added some sort of hunger need, if they added crafting and made some of the items maybe more fair *cough* (machete)Food (hunger)Tools (building repairing etc)Crafting (for the tools)More melee weapons (knives, spears, even crossbows)More advanced animations for things (I would be impressed if they did that)And more wildlifeI really hope htey make these changes			"

												There's many things in this game that I don't like... the only thing is good is you hunt a Dinosaurs  (or rather the Dinosaurs hunt you).- the fact is u need to die first before u can customizing your Inventory is ridiculous.- Anything you bought like weapons, ammo etc will drop with your dead body when you die, so once you respawn you'll need walk long distance to the place you died to retreive your gear that is if you didn't die along the way or someone else didn't took your gear before you. So if you bought the Best weapons in the game, do your self a favor, always play alone and never let anyone joining to your game, or you end up buying expensive weapon for someone else.- You can only shoot if you Aim so no quick panic shot when the dinosaurs is close, not even with a shotgun which anyone know doesn't need to be aim in close quarter fight.- The fact is the right click to aim is a toggle instead hold to aim is ridiculous making sure you died if the first shot didn't kill the dinosaurs, coz in order to run you need to click the right mouse button again to release aim before u can run. Oh did I mention u can't shoot without aiming with right mouse button toggle?- U walk long distance to get a supply drop and what did you get? A bunch of ammo with no gun to use with, so guess what? U just have to kill the T-rex by throwing your ammo to the t-rex mouth with your hand, hopping one of those ammo will choke the Rex to death.- Huge map to explore but only 5 Species to hunt? ohh... my bad, is actually 6 species (that is if killing other player also count)I played the original ""The Hunter"" once which u hunt Deer, bear etc... is a good hunting game, I stop playing it bcoz is too expensive to stay subcribe. Comparing this game to the original ""The Hunter"", this game is a major fail. The developer really need to redefine the game system. Coz this one sucks.			"

												The devs for this game know how to make an addicting game, yet managed to give you the subtle middle finger in almost everything. For example, have a valuable pack with lots of gear? One of a couple things WILL happen. A: A pack of 3-5 Utahraptors will swarm you, and given the odd control scheme and feel of shooting in this game, you will have zero chance. B: You will be a couple (10-15) meters from a ledge and the game will suck you over the side to kill you. C: Some other form of the middle finger will kill you. Then once you respawn, you better have a lot of buddies by your side because you can bet you bottom dollar there will be 8-10 utahraptors between you and your pack. Refer to A above. Weapons have an amazing drop in power after only a few feet. Yet sometimes they seem to have loads of power to spare across the map. More than once I have one shot a triceratops from several hundred meters with a .44 and not hit any vitals, yet it dropped like a sack of rocks.The game often has issues on a lan. Sometimes everyone can join wihtout issue, some times no one can join. Two machines with the same config and the the following will happen. Some users can join one but not the other. All of this is without any real information other than generic cannot join errors so troubleshooting is a crapshoot. Despite having way over the top specs on both my and several of my friends machines, this game often has unexplained slow downs where the dinosaurs all seem to move in slo-mo. Then there is of course the all too common 3 people see a dinosaur thats standing 50 meters away, the other 10 people dont have it on their screen.Bottom line, for full price pass it up, if its on sale for 5-10 bucks and your looking for a buggy often incredibly frustrating yet somehow still often fun game, snag it.

												If your like a game that can ""scare the it out of u"", this is it.  I've player Alien Isolation - great game - but, Hunter Primal has it beat hands down.   Being stalked by, a T.Rex or hunted by a pack of Raptors and surviving it - well - pretty satisfying.  And, the graphics in Primeval world is mastefully done - great enviroment (u'll love the intense thunder storms).  I'd have to say that - Fear - should have been part of the game's title.			"

												I don't understand all the negativity surrounding this game.  If you are tired of playing games where you go from being a noob to very shortly dominating the planet or area you are playing in, then this is NOT the game for you.  It gives you very basic supplies to get started and you must actually work to level up and get access to the better things in life...like bigger guns.  These you will need.  Trying to take down a T-Rex alone and armed with only a blade...is suicide.  However, if you work with others and are not afraid of dying (once, twice, often) you can accomplish the impossible.  We (us four) took down a T-Rex armed only with machetes.  Although the big beasty did not die right away, we tracked her blood trail till we found her dead body.  The beasties will run when hurt and even die at a later time...lose the trail, and you lose the reward for killing this beast.  You will get some compensation if someone else finds the body and claims it.  Best part, you don't lose your level or money no matter how often you die (though the devs may change this at a later time...would be BRUTAL then).  This game has a tension that few can bring.  In this game your are not....I repeat, you are NOT the dominant species on this planet...and I for one ENJOY the hell out of that.			"

Early Access Review
								My first impression of the game was how amazing it looks, and the sounds get you really into it. Finding my first crate wasn't hard thanks to the map piece you spawn with, and soon enough i killed a couple utharaptors. The constant struggle to track animals and don't get killed make it both a hunting game and a survival game, but i think that's cool. The dinosaurs look really good, and if you've been lying in a bush and looking at a T-rex close up as many times as i, you know how terrifying they are. Just hearing the footsteps of the t-rex is enough to awaken all senses and make you hide in a bush to localize it. The way the T-rex and Utharaptors act is awesome, they track you if you run, or if they hear you walk normally, and follow your smell if you're not careful. However the Triceratops act a bit strange in my opinion. The guide said they might be agressive, but after MANY encounters both from far away and the point when they step on you, they all just run away, and then they run. Far. Really far. other than that the world is pretty cool, awesome with the volcano in the middle and bases that's been destroyed. Been playing the game with a friend for a whole weekend + 1 day after school (maybe 20 hours) and even though i get the best guns and gear, i have to be careful not to get overrun by a pack of raptors, which has happened a few times when i get cocky. Luckily i just have to go back where i died and pick up my stuff again (if nobody's stolen it, i played on a server with just my friend). Now we've done most of the things although we haven't cared to run across the map after a triceratops that's been hit, and only managed to kill 1 T-rex, but 20 hours of gameplay and more to come is more than you get from many other games that costs more. Now we're just waiting for the next patch with new dinosaurs. I recommend this game for anyone who likes survival games and wants a game for the weekend packed with scary moments, traces of adrenaline at times and beautiful graphics sprinkled on top.			"

Early Access Review
								As you can probably see from my account. I don't review games often. and when i do. It's probably just cause i enjoyed it and felt it was a good buy.However.This game...This game is fantastic. Even in it's current state. It's intese, It's immersive and quite frankly sometimes. it's terrifying. The stealth is a fantastic factor, the loot spawns, the PvE and the PvP are fun. and if your a hunter fan, or a dinosaur fan and would like a ""as close to realistic"" game, this is for you. Be prepared to die. ALOT. Raptors are relentless. Even if you encouter one on it's own. You better be a damn good shot and take it out or you're going to have 4 maybe even 5 surrounding you while you're on the move. T-Rex's are ruthless, Your only chance of survival is to stop drop and DO NOTHING. even then. Sometimes. It runs into you. and well. Squish.Pros : ImmersiveIn-depthUnforgiving environment/dinosaursgraphics are real prettyruns very stable (occasional FPS drop but nothing game breaking)No amount of gear makes this game ""easy mode"" Rifles? Arrows? .44 magnum? You still have to be careful where and what you shoot at.Good co-op experience + good solo experience i enjoyed playing alone or with others.Cons (subject to change)Combat (I dislike the requirement to ADS to even load an arrow/how slow ADS is)No possibility of hiding yourself from dino's (smothering your self in Dino poo, for instance)Once you have a raptors attention, they NEVER back down, I'm aware this is how they hunted in real life but it's practically impossible once they have an idea that your there because they convienently stop within hearing distance of you (unless this is just my unlucky experience)T-Rex doesn't seem to attack other dinosaurs, Or any dinosaurs don't attack other dinosaurs. Something i found quite frustrating.			"

								I purchased The Hunter: Primal about a month ago and so far I have loved the gameplay. I have had very little problems and the AI on the dinosaurs is great. However there are a few problems that I would like to address about  Utahraptor attack behavour and Triceritops movement glitches. The raptors seem to attack plays by sprinting at them from cover and killing them by biting them to death. Recent studies on Dromeosaurid (raptor) anatomy has shown that the most likely ambushed their prey from cover and then pinned it to the ground sinking their large sickle claws into the victim`s  back then started to eat the struggling prey alive. If this was implemented in the Utharaptors it would make fighting them harder and hunting with a buddy more important.			"

												I would recommend this game, although to start, it's overpriced for its current lack of content and it has a few flaws. However, other reviews go over most of these.The main problem is like I mentioned, the lack of content. The game could use a couple more guns, but mainly it needs more *dinosaurs*. After all, they're the focus of the entire game.I'd suggest adding a few more well-known but interesting ones. For example, deinosuchuses could live along the coastline and attack you if you got too close. Stegosauruses, Allosauruses, Coelophyses, and Gallimimuses for a start. I understand, of course, that it takes time to create and add something so complex, but the game could certainly use it.The current dinosaurs are modeled very nicely and their behaviour is pretty well-done, but it has some bugs.In any case, I'd recommend this game.TL;DR- more dinos pls			"

												Great dinosaur hunting simulation. This game is the best Dinosaur themed game currently on Steam.Pros:*Huge island to explore with lots of places to go and plenty of things to see and do*Realistic weapon physics with bullet drop*Very fun co-op with other people*There are no trolls, hackers or spammers online*No real money micro-transactions. Everything can be brought for in-game currency*No hunger meters or any DayZ-like hardcore survival junkCons:*Light on content, only 6 weapons to use and about 5 dinosaurs to hunt, hopefully the devs will add more in the coming months*Only two gameplay modes, PVP and Non-PVP, hopefully devs will add a Battle Royale-like mode or team base objective modes.*Lack of dedicated servers*In-game map always needs to be re-mapped every time you die and respawn. Why can't map progressed be saved?*Some dinosaurs take ridiculous amounts of shots and act like a bullet sponge before they die, unsure whether this is a good or bad thing but it can be annoying when you are playing by yourself.

								What a fantastic game! One of the main reasons I love this game so much is because of the way creators have depicted the way these dinosaurs look. Velociraptors in particular are fantastic, small, feathery and incredibly intelligent. Just the way Palaeontologist would picture them. However, that being said the game does have a lot of issues such as constant server disconnections, slow aiming reaction time and a some what annoying scenario where a player buys items e.g. ammo and then losing it all upon reconnecting from a disconnection without even using them. In saying that the game is again in early access and will undoubtedly fix the madurity of these issues and I for one cannot wait!A few things that I would love to see:More dino's obviously,Stegosaurus, Iguanodon, Parasaurolophus, Pachycephalosaurus  just to name a few herbivores.Something to compete with the might of the Tyrannosaurus. Giganotosaurus, Carcaradontosaurus and Spinosaurus all bigger would be a great accusation.Something in the sky and something in the water would be quite exiting.More weapons, clothing and other objects of appeal.A larger scale map.And finally as im sure everyone would love to see dinosaurs hunting something other than you!

												I got this game as soon as it was released,enjoyed it to start with but in the end it got annoying moving so slowly across the map being unable to sprint to a long time and starting with a bow and arrow then getting butt♥♥♥♥ed by everything within 10 minutes of spawingIn all accords if you have a few mates playing with you then it can be quite an enjoyable game once you manage to find decent weapons but this should NOT be considerd as a full release game, due to the glitches and the fact that only 5 species of dinos are in the game when they have a 24km squared map.. to me that does sound very limited..when the game was released it was worth the money as it was less than it is now but now they have increased the cost i would recommend people to stay away from the game untill the dev's decide to pull their finger out and make it a more enjoyable game....

												first of im bad at english.Before rellese i recommend this game but its was and is relly bugy. and they rellesed the game with a new dino that was the most bugy thing in the game. just wanted to say that this game wasnt ready for the rellese. __________________________________________________________________________________OLD REVIEW:(first im relly bad at english so sorry if you dont understand)1. this is a walking/runing simulator but i like it when i play whit friends just to walk on the wolle map.2. this is a great game for being in early access.3. this is more like an survival game then a hunting game, now you have hp, you cant run all the time and ther is dinosaurs all around you.4. this is things that i want in to the game: 1. more dinos, 2. better controlls (if you played thehunter you know how slow the controlls is), 3. boats, there is islands that you cant get too, 4. no p2w like thehunter is. that is all for me hope you can understand ;)			"

								Honestly just wish there were more dinosDay 1: spawn next to that pod and get a bow and arrow. Then i travel few miles. I come acros footprints. They were to dino that was easy picking. So i followed them and followed them and followed them so more and then came across its well fisces. I looked up and found the dino. I was nervous but i didnt attack cuz i didnt have the best equipment. So i looked for items and came across 3 boxes in one area. Then i turned around and there was a t rex right there. He didnt see me so i layed down. He than walked away. I thought to myself im not attacking it. But courosity broke loose. So i followed it. I lost track of it. I was scanning footprints and crap for about a min. Then out of no where it lookes at me dead in the eye. I thought maybe it didnt see me again but it did. It roared and was running at me. I was panicking and did not no what to do. I froze in place. Then it ate me. Spawn agian and get my bow and arrow. traveld to my die spot and saw him. I shot my arrow at it and it ran at me agian. I shot another 2 more arrows. Well enough it killed me. Spawned agian and go my stuff and treked to my body agian. it was there agian and i shot another arrow at it and of course it killed me agian. Rage quit and wrote the this review. I just wanted to kill a t rex.			"

												3 of 5 starsI have played their first hunter game and so was easily drawn to this idea/version too.+ side; great base idea, nice vegitation, lighting, weather, great size to map and a good dollop of atmousphere thats rare to find in a game. Sounds are very well done as are the animations of the animals. Weapons are of a high standard as normally expected from their games.- Not enough variation in the landscape with open grassland then jungle again, also needs more animals, weather and undergrouth variation, fog would be good fun for example. Weard short little messages that you find are badly written and do not make much sense at all. The T-Rex is a bit small in my opinion. Yet they will come with more content and they listen to the players. Yep, would recommend the experience esspecially with freinds, yet would wait for more content before buying it. "

Early Access Review
								What a fantastic game! One of the main reasons I love this game so much is because of the way creators have depicted the way these dinosaurs look. Velociraptors in particular are fantastic, small, feathery and incredibly intelligent. Just the way Palaeontologist would picture them. However, that being said the game does have a lot of issues such as constant server disconnections, slow aiming reaction time and a some what annoying scenario where a player buys items e.g. ammo and then losing it all upon reconnecting from a disconnection without even using them. In saying that the game is again in early access and will undoubtedly fix the madurity of these issues and I for one cannot wait!A few things that I would love to see:More dino's obviously,Stegosaurus, Iguanodon, Parasaurolophus, Pachycephalosaurus  just to name a few herbivores.Something to compete with the might of the Tyrannosaurus. Giganotosaurus, Carcaradontosaurus and Spinosaurus all bigger would be a great accusation.Something in the sky and something in the water would be quite exiting.More weapons, clothing and other objects of appeal.A larger scale map.And finally as im sure everyone would love to see dinosaurs hunting something other than you!

												As a gamer and as a game developer, I can say that this 'game' has potential. I purchased the game without looking at reviews and assumed that it was a nearly finished product or at least a product with finesse and spunk.Instead, I received a game that was under developed and felt more like a wimpy simulation, rather than a full-blown game with music, story, AI, a finished battle system and enjoyable play. I do not say this without taking into careful consideration that this 'company' is an independent studio run by what I would assume are University Students looking to expand their knowledge and ability to produce a finished project for their class - thus releasing it under the impression that it's a final product in the real world.Their companys name is ""Avalanche"", which serves as a dual purpose. A warning sign that their product is literally rolling down the hill to kill you and a studio who produces something with large intentions and ruining the experience a mountain climber might have whilst scaling a range and a large pile of snow falls to bury and disappoint the said hiker.THP is essentially a game with strong design aesthics, intelligent research on dinosaurs, very unique and nicely created dinosaur sounds (with glitches here and there), and a non-crashing base-program that allows a player to simulate hiking along a tropical island. The island is filled with wonderful and unique landscape design - that is to say, you can get lost but not in the sense that everything looks the same, everywhere.What they don't tell you is that the AI is very dumb. They target you with high intelligence and attack with insta-gib slices and force you to respawn. The trailers are beautiful, the cinematic-trailer is old-Blizzard quality, they have so much potential, but it's wasted on poor game development. There is no music, no lead up to fear. You simply hear dinosaur sounds, wield a crappy machette and hope your stamina bar fills up in time for you to attack any dinosaur. The servers are empty, you cannot find anyone to play with and get ganged up on by Utahraptors, which, mind you, all rend you or chomp at you and kill you in three or less hits.The game has items scattered among the world, the island is massive, the creatures are everywhere, but nothing feels enjoyable about the game. It's missing heart. It's missing story, the story you get a glimpse of through a trailer you might not even see. It's missing the feel of a what a game is. Instead, you're given a game that is underdeveloped and lacking in all fields. You waste your $20-30 on a piece of software that lets you run for 10 seconds and takes 3 minutes to let you run again, whilst not allowing you to jump when creatures attack you from the forest depths. Take your money, spend it on a dating sim, you'll get more out of it. Believe me.			"

												At first I didn't like this game. Its pretty challenging and can be a real♥♥♥♥♥♥off especially losing all your gear on a cliff... But that being said this game is absolutley amazing in sound (best played with headphones), teamwork (great community so far), graphics are astounding for the requirements (not the best out there but expected way less), when you make a kill it is way more satisfing than any game i played before because it so hard and shot accuracy matters big time. The size of this online multiplayer map is very impressive too. This game is a fav of mine****UPDATE*****Sick of seeing these reveiws that are so negative after the reveiwer has only an hour or two or 4 in.... They cant hunt and are more mad about their own lack of skills i'd say just need to vent. As of now I have 242.5 hrs into this game, It has problems yes... I paid 20 bucks for this game, thats 20 bucks ppl!!!!! people expect to get a game at the standards of others in the range of $70+ and yes there are better $70 games out there but not one about hunting dinos multiplayer online, and those $70 games get pushed back and back and then when you think it will be released push it back again (Rockstar). At least its playable while dev is ongoing! some ppl say it runs like crap on their comp, well my 2nd computer is dualcore amd mini itx @ 2.7ghz with a 1g radeon hd7750 runs native settings and runs this game at full graphics 60fps with minimal drops in frame rate and my card does not heat up so i'd say ppl have hardware issues other than this game seeing that card is known for running hot, and it doesnt in this game! You will not find a better looking and running game anywhere on any system for $20			"

												I would recommend this game, although to start, it's overpriced for its current lack of content and it has a few flaws. However, other reviews go over most of these.The main problem is like I mentioned, the lack of content. The game could use a couple more guns, but mainly it needs more *dinosaurs*. After all, they're the focus of the entire game.I'd suggest adding a few more well-known but interesting ones. For example, deinosuchuses could live along the coastline and attack you if you got too close. Stegosauruses, Allosauruses, Coelophyses, and Gallimimuses for a start. I understand, of course, that it takes time to create and add something so complex, but the game could certainly use it.The current dinosaurs are modeled very nicely and their behaviour is pretty well-done, but it has some bugs.In any case, I'd recommend this game.TL;DR- more dinos pls			"

												Great dinosaur hunting simulation. This game is the best Dinosaur themed game currently on Steam.Pros:*Huge island to explore with lots of places to go and plenty of things to see and do*Realistic weapon physics with bullet drop*Very fun co-op with other people*There are no trolls, hackers or spammers online*No real money micro-transactions. Everything can be brought for in-game currency*No hunger meters or any DayZ-like hardcore survival junkCons:*Light on content, only 6 weapons to use and about 5 dinosaurs to hunt, hopefully the devs will add more in the coming months*Only two gameplay modes, PVP and Non-PVP, hopefully devs will add a Battle Royale-like mode or team base objective modes.*Lack of dedicated servers*In-game map always needs to be re-mapped every time you die and respawn. Why can't map progressed be saved?*Some dinosaurs take ridiculous amounts of shots and act like a bullet sponge before they die, unsure whether this is a good or bad thing but it can be annoying when you are playing by yourself.

												loved the game up until the flying flappy birds release today!!What the hell? you messed it up big time.200 shots with .700 before i downed a flappy bird.......then die 7 times, then a rex appears at respawn......loose all your gear as your flung half way accross map on another respawn.Was this actually playtested? i'll happily shake the guys hand who managed to score a flappy bird kill with less than 10 shots with a shotgun and buckshot ammo.The game was fantastic fun, now all we do is listen carefully for flappy wings and trex stomps that sound very similiar..........oh......ermmmm......im dead again ffs.The hunting element has suffered drastically due this update, please make the flappy birds less apparant with next update, lessen the population and make the damn things shootable or bigger in size, with slight lag issues its near impossible to shoot the damn things.As for bringing out flappy birds on a full release, sack the guy who agreed to implemented such a flawed update on release day. lots of your players have issues with the game, fair enough but today you slit your own throats. What was a recommended fun hunter dino game (even with its forgiven issues) has now gone down the toilet with a rage, enthused flush.Congrats, score was 85% recommended (without stupid flappy birds) and now40% not recommended due to flappy bird implementation today!Damn mess up, such a shame :(Can't recommend the game as it stands today, they screwed it up bigtime!Thank you for making birdies a decent part of game, actually add to game now, hats off to devs :)			"

												This WAS great game for early access, The dinos are terrifying, the sound altho needs to be tweaked for location is amazing and the WAS forests lush! A raptor COULD be in the bush next to you or a Rex that happened to be not moving could be on the other side of a tree making you jump infront of your computer.  *Release review*Ai problems, 4 to 1 murderess dinos that only care about eating you and NOTHING ELSE!. Not nearly enough herbivores a smaller Raptor that is all in all pointless, The new bird is broken as heck. it will grab you even if its flight path misses or if something is in the way. The forests are stripped bare leaving you no place to hide but inside a tree and that barely works, I cant get over that this went form walking through a jungle fearing every step (in a good way!) becuase A raptor could hear you and literally jump out and scare the crap out of you. You find yourself hiding in a thick bush hoping the rex would walk by and feeling him crunch the ground next to you.. Now it looks like a retexture of Carnivors 1 with worse AI. I wanted to wait, in hope the devs would fix these problems before I made a new review but it looks like they are going to ignore what we want. I want to like this game because it was so well made,now.. its just bland and frustrating			"

								Game plays pretty well. Feels good, graphics are great, and it is scary/hard as hell at first. Like a survival game should be. After you get a weapon the little carnivors are not such a issue!As far as the excitment goes it is always a thrill to hunt a Raptor just to figure out it has a pack of them that is actually hunting you. Once you run, they will fallow your scent. This is why I LOVE IT!!!Game is limited as of now. Not many guns, animals, things to do (besides survive) but that is what I love about it!When the game developes more it should be amazing. Bigger company behind it so hopefully they can fix things such as the balance of sprinting/stamina or how the animals will get stuck on objects when trying to attach you... still a great game as of now!

								The game is definitely fun and you're on the right track if you like dinosaurs.  It is sort of similiar to thehunter but with more of a survival aspect.  The rush of getting hunted yourself is really awesome.Downside to the game appears to be the devs.  I play lots of other alphas and the devs for this one tend to keep quiet more.  You don't feel like you have that constant communication like you do with beasts of prey.  Also their support is very slow.  I opened a ticket with them and it took well over 24 hours for them just to respond.So far the good outweighs the bad though.  We'll see how this game goes.			"

								Somewhat con(s) I really hope the devs will include some kind of crafting/maybe even rudeimentary base or structure building system.  It would make teaming up much more fun, and give you more incentive to group up.  So far, I don't see anything of the sort listed in the ""what to expect"".  This does have great promise, and is fun as is, however I really think some more features should be in the ""upcomings"" to justify the pricing... Pros.  Being hunted by dinos and subsequently hunting them back, awesome :)  Yes, some other games have done this, but this one has a very immesive and more realistic feel to the approach.  I like :) But I'd really like to see some more complimentary features listed in what to expect :-/ Mayhaps I missed something.			"

								This Game is Listed a Survival Game. As it Trends toward role the one thing that bothers me is...Well the lack of current Survival features. This Game is incomplete Survival Game with some hunting aspects. Currently Death has little punishment. Dino A.I. Is shaky at times ,but most of the time it fares decently. The Game is in Early Access so many of the features aren't here yet. But this game has tons of potenial as a Survival game. Unlike many other Survival Games the PvE can be heart pounding. However in its current state the game esclates to easy very quickly Dinosaurs need to be feared not target practice. Overall i like its potential and it is fun to play ,but lacks many features before it can be a Full release game. Requires more Dinos.More Survival Aspects.Better Dino A.I.Party system.For starters.Would only recommend to those who desire a Survival Game with fun unique elements.			"

								this game is much alike carnivores but with a survival aspect to it, probably more like dayz mixed with carnivores with thehunter gameplay style but let me get to the aspects of this game.pros1. pay once play forever unlike the original thehunter... i still like that one2. gigantic open world.3. different terratory for each dino but dont expect every area to be clear of certain dinosours (i was exploring the lower terratory, which is raptor terratory, and found a trex that i ran into)4. realistic versions of dinosours ( such as feathers or spines which is a good turn around to realism... also dont expect the volociraptor to be 6 feet tall in reality they are about 2 feet tall)5. better graphics then carnivores... at least the old ones.6. you can die... which you can do in the original thehunter but is rare.now for the cons.1. dino's are stupid they will run right past you and give you a chance to kill them.2. tricy's run away and wont charge... maybe run you over but that hasnt happend to me yet.3. only four dino's the volociraptor, utahraptor, triceratops, and the trex. isnt that bad though remember its still early access.and thats about all i can think of the cons. Now there is a currency in this game but isnt like the original thehunter where you have to buy currency to get all the kickass stuff, you have to level up and inorder to get money and exp you have to hunt.

I can see this game going far as it has a great community and an active development team. Whilst it is still only in early access, and most of the content is still lacking, it is still a great buy.

								Great game to play with friends. It's definitely not an easy game though. You'll have to die lots and lots of times before you start to get good shots with the bow.Finding the caches of guns and ammo are tough since it seems there are lots of dino clumped up around these areas so I've opted for just using the bow and being sneaky. Between myself and a buddy we were able to take out the T-Rex with nothing but bows and lots of arrows even though we died a couple times in the process.Definitely worth the buy if you're into their series of  ""The Hunter"" games or just like survival games in general.

								Well the graphics are fantastic!!The dinosaurs AI are pretty buggy and you often se a t-rex stuck walking in to a stone or a tree.when i started i was very exited, but after a little while the exitement went over to dissapointment. i did not know there where only 3 dinos, so everytime i heard something i allways knew what it was. i would like to see more dinos, plant eaters too, so the island gets more populated and the wildlife is more like a savannah with lots of different creatures. some more common then others. and flying dinos!! oh man this game has so much potensial. i hope this game will blossom in to a fullgrown flower cause im shure the resault would be epic!!Pros: Epic Fantastic graphics!design of the island.dinos are scary and the soundeffects is good.very tense feeling cause you are allways watching your back.Cons:ONLY 3 dinos!! The island feels totaly dead exept for those 3 dinotypes.early access bugs in the dinos AI that takes away some of the thrills.Not possible to jump!! why not??			"

								I have to say, I absolutely love the feel of the game so far. Dropped in with nothing but a bow and no choice but to survive. You never know what is waiting around the next bend, what loot you might find, if any, and whether or not you can trust others. Nerve wracking in a good way. That being said the game isn't perfect, AI could improve as im sure it will, melee and jumping could also be an option. Swimming is going to be a must, and im sure equipment durability would add another layer to the game. Overall i'm impressed for twenty dollars!			"

								Not the most full time action packed game ever.... but it do have it's moments.You start with basic cloths and nothing else... but hey right in front of you is your drop pod! Lucky you.Inside is a GPS type hunter's helper that gives you the lay of the land, helps guide you to loot crates and locations, gives you information on tracks you may find and takes pics of your kills.Also a simple bow and arrows now you are ready to take down a T-rex. NOT!!!You then trek around a good sized island- not huge- but big enough to get lost. Use the GPS and map alot. :)You must watch out for one species of posion plant, dinos, rocks to throw and distract said dinos, mushrooms to heal and good places to hide.The idea is to survive long enough to find some camo gear and big guns. It takes around 3 arrows to drop a raptor but these bad girls travel in packs (I had six on me once.)You have a health and stamina bar but do not have to eat or drink, but you do need to find health spray that restores lost hit points.I died alot but each respawn was fun and the atmosphere felt real. Lots of ambiant sounds, and visually stunning.I have to say it is the best looking fauna in a game I have ever seen- It looks good enough you can almost smell the pine trees. Now, the sound is also well done. I found myself stopping because I heard a twig snap behind me and began stressing that a raptor had me. I cannot explain how good the sound fx for the dinos are- I had thought I lost a T-rex that was tracking me so I started moving out of the area when It roared and began to charge my way!!  The screen shook and the, ""THUD, THUD, THUD!!!"" of its foot falls made me beleive I had a several thousand kilo♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off Rex running up behind me. It was awSOME!!!And the models are too cool: They look every bit as good as that first time you saw Jurassic Park.The map is covered in a ""fog of war"" and I havent come close to reveiling the whole thing before I am eaten. They do eat you too... When you die you get the pleasure of listening to then chow down on you.Now the cons:They only have three species of dinos: T-Rex, Triceritops and Raptor.It is a bit boreing hideing and slinking around a forrest 90% of the time and running for your life 9% with only scoreing good loot -so far- a tiny 1% of the time.They need more sights to see and places to go and possibly holdout at.It is more sim than adventure but if the devs add some more dinos and give the players lots of equipment to survive- maybe some crafting and building... this will be on fun♥♥♥♥♥co-op game that will be around a long time!!!

Lets take a selfie. -Succesfully takes a selfie, mauled by raptor immediately afterwards.----------------------------------------So yeah, this game is a lot of fun. You are gonna die often. Like, all the time. And most dinosaurs wont even give you the courtesy of a warning growl until its too late. It still needs a lot of work though, and a lot of love. And more dinosaurs, most definitely needs more dinosaurs.			"

								If you've grown to love this games sister game theHunter as i have for the past 10yrs i think or since season 7 according to my hunter profile u'll love this game. One can't really begin to love this game as i said b4 unless u love it's sister game as this games a COMPLETE role reversal. In TheHunter it's u the hunter who is hunting deer, bear, rabbits, moose, elk, coyote, hogs to name a few of the species but in this game ya u might be there to hunt the dinosaurs that they have now but these dinosaurs are out to hunt u the hunter. This game u can either be the hunter or the hunted it just depends on what u see beyond the next bush or what u hear beyond the next bush. It could be a cocky velociraptor, a gentle triceratops or a down right nasty azz T-Rex ready to throw u around like a chew toy. I highly recommend this game if u've grown to love the sister game theHunter.			"

								Like Dinosaurs. Like hunting games. Like the fact there aren't zombies. This game rules.Played for like an hour and a half. First ten minutes of the game, rushing through the brush to a box, boom. Shh shh shh! What was that?! BOOM! Uh oh. Nope this train, run away behind a tree to see a t-rex come to a halt right where i was. SHH SHH SHH! Maybe he doesn't see.... ""You are dead"". He definatly saw me. And ate me from behind a tree. Second playthrough: Running down the coast, decide enough is enough and run through the forest. Triceratops. So neat! Keep going, find an outpost on the far side of a lake. Hear a noise, see a pack of raptors coming up on me, following my scent. Run out of stamina like a billion times trying to run away. Get to the outpost, raptor right on my♥♥♥♥♥ Loot a shotgun, bullets. Lay that ♥♥♥♥er out and take a selfie with it.Would highly recommend this game. It's not the most fast paced of games which is a nice thing. Until it becomes fast paced. Then run. You hear a strange noise? Run. You hear stomping? Run. You die? Don't go back to the body, the dinosaurs sort of just stick around the bodies. 10/10. Would recommend to everyone.			"

								For anyone who wishes to see the game in action, I have stated a playthough on my YouTube channel- http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXxFzuCthRqV3n6YM1rn_b9UlTGxAjbNQThe game is very impressive at this early stage, shows a great deal of potential. The amount of monsters that could be introduced to the game is a tantalising prospect. For now however, you may enjoy the hyena-like cries of the Utahraptor, the low rumbling of a hungry Triceratops (Which seem rarer than the carnivores) or quake in fear as the ground shakes under your feat at the approach of the beast.

								Honestly just wish there were more dinosDay 1: spawn next to that pod and get a bow and arrow. Then i travel few miles. I come acros footprints. They were to dino that was easy picking. So i followed them and followed them and followed them so more and then came across its well fisces. I looked up and found the dino. I was nervous but i didnt attack cuz i didnt have the best equipment. So i looked for items and came across 3 boxes in one area. Then i turned around and there was a t rex right there. He didnt see me so i layed down. He than walked away. I thought to myself im not attacking it. But courosity broke loose. So i followed it. I lost track of it. I was scanning footprints and crap for about a min. Then out of no where it lookes at me dead in the eye. I thought maybe it didnt see me again but it did. It roared and was running at me. I was panicking and did not no what to do. I froze in place. Then it ate me. Spawn agian and get my bow and arrow. traveld to my die spot and saw him. I shot my arrow at it and it ran at me agian. I shot another 2 more arrows. Well enough it killed me. Spawned agian and go my stuff and treked to my body agian. it was there agian and i shot another arrow at it and of course it killed me agian. Rage quit and wrote the this review. I just wanted to kill a t rex.			"

								All you doops out there who think this game is too hard then why would you buy it? It is a simulator in a world where dinosaurs exist....with two of the most lethal dinosaurs known to have roamed earth walking around it will tend to get hard....yes it is frustrating and gets your blood going, but that doesnt make it a bad game. It is a challenge and you have experience in a game to get good at it. So shut up, sit down, put your headphones in and play some primal......stop whining just because you suck at it.			"

								First lifeSpawned in, grabbed the bow/arrow you start with. Found some extra arrows and tried to get to higher ground. Heard thumping noises, as they got louder I realized hiding might be a good idea. Tried to hide in a bush and got eaten by a T-Rex. Even better because the game tells you that you're a convict sent to ready the world for colonization, and that if you die and your meat feeds the animals that's treason so your extended family will be charged and sent to the planet as well.11/10 would doom my family to be eaten by dinosaurs again			"

								Somewhat con(s) I really hope the devs will include some kind of crafting/maybe even rudeimentary base or structure building system.  It would make teaming up much more fun, and give you more incentive to group up.  So far, I don't see anything of the sort listed in the ""what to expect"".  This does have great promise, and is fun as is, however I really think some more features should be in the ""upcomings"" to justify the pricing... Pros.  Being hunted by dinos and subsequently hunting them back, awesome :)  Yes, some other games have done this, but this one has a very immesive and more realistic feel to the approach.  I like :) But I'd really like to see some more complimentary features listed in what to expect :-/ Mayhaps I missed something.			"

								Wish i could say this a fun game in its current state but its not. If youre looking for a nature walk sim, look no further. Ive spent the 2 hours ive played so far wondering through the woods looking for a gun ( have yet to find one, much less shoot one) You will spend hours looking for supply crates just to find out there is nothing but clothes and arrows in them. The people who play online are very clicky, if you arent already friends with them, they will offer you 0 help, and boot you from their server.Overall this game has an insane amount of potenial, but it currently lacks more than it offers.

								Love this game, its a blast. More or less you are dropped off on an island (primal eden) where you have to Surrvive by either working with teamates or soloing it, and Hunting dinos while searching for items like guns and camo to help you survive longer. There is nothign like the thrill in this game of Killing a T-Rex, must own game for any FPS fans, who also like the survival aspect of a game. Great Graphics!			"

								Amazing detail and very well made. apart from a few things - Sound has some issues when near waters edge seems to crackle/ Not play till very close - A slight lack of items to loot my personal opinion and there is a lack of tutorial but apart from them few things its an amazing game and a must for any game collection.

								Very Great game and a good challenge trying to survive. The game is sort of like a survival game with dinos and you can player PVP too if you want. It is a very good game in early access so it will be even better when it is fully released. I hope they add more good stuff like weapons and more dinosaurs and possible some crafting or repairing bases. In my personal opinion it is in the top 3 of all dinosaurs game for me.			"

								If you've grown to love this games sister game theHunter as i have for the past 10yrs i think or since season 7 according to my hunter profile u'll love this game. One can't really begin to love this game as i said b4 unless u love it's sister game as this games a COMPLETE role reversal. In TheHunter it's u the hunter who is hunting deer, bear, rabbits, moose, elk, coyote, hogs to name a few of the species but in this game ya u might be there to hunt the dinosaurs that they have now but these dinosaurs are out to hunt u the hunter. This game u can either be the hunter or the hunted it just depends on what u see beyond the next bush or what u hear beyond the next bush. It could be a cocky velociraptor, a gentle triceratops or a down right nasty azz T-Rex ready to throw u around like a chew toy. I highly recommend this game if u've grown to love the sister game theHunter.			"

												Was walking along when I first started the game. Got told to go to the Volcano. Ran into a Utahraptor, killed it with two arrows. Felt like a beast, then continued north to find a T-Rex. It didn't go as nicely.11/10 Will continue to get turned into neat poop piles.EDITED:I havent touched touched it since the ""Full Release"" update. Nearly nintey hours of gameplay, learning to differentiate the sounds enough that I could avoid dying too much, figuring that you kind of need to be effective with every weapon in case you get ammo boned, even one instance where a friend popped up Cheat Engine and changed the Utahraptor spawn to near triple. Fortunately we had a log and ammo. Unfortunately, forty utahs later we were almost out of ammo and there were still more raptors. But that was beside the point. The point is of those near nintey hours I put in, a third was walking, some was being dead and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥cause my stuff was essentially gone (usually it was a rex or a pack of raptors), and the rest, close to half of it, was legitimately fun gameplay.Then Avalanche took off and left us all with our asses in the wind.

												12/17/2014: So far I'm loving this game. I've played about 6 hours as of writing this and I've played solo as well as with friends. I will say, if you're looking for a terrifying experience, play solo. With the lights off. With the bass on the speakers way up. And put a glass of water next to you.The gameplay feels little clunky and rigid, but it's an early alpha stage of the game and there's only 3 types of dinosaurs at the moment, but for what stage this game is in it looks beautiful, the sound effects are terrifying, and it's not a run and gun once you get gear, but you MUST evade dinosaurs at all times or you're probably going to die. They're clever and violent.Aside from the expected buggy nature of an early alpha game, I would highly recommend this game. 9/10UPDATEUPDATEUPDATEUPDATEUPDATEUPDATEUPDATEUPDATEUPDATEUPDATE!UPDATE 3/3/2015: As a full release game, there isn't much that has been added to the game and there's a serious lack of variety in dinosaurs and vegetation. There's a barely existent backstory, no driven purpose, and it feels like it was rushed to release with a promise of more material based on how well the game does AFTER ""Full"" release. That's a very poor marketing choice and practically screams ""Bored, now! Here's this thing we made. Now get bent.""The game can't do well if it's left unfinished by community standards, but promising to finis- errr, ""add more"" to the game if it does well despite that fact is foolish and near-sighted. It cannot do well in its current state and I am thoroughly disappointed in the devs for rushing it to release with so little content.			"

								This is easily one of the best dinosaur survival games I've ever played!Great graphics!beautiful atmosphere and terrain the sounds are absolutely incredibleand of course there's DINOSAURS!!but with that being said I feel like this game still lacks quite a bit (I know this is still early access and I'm not complaining I'm just wanting to state what I feel should be improved on and added) :)you can't swim in waterit's easy to get hunted down and die by yourselfthere's really no plot to the game (except shoot dinosaurs)you can't build anything to protect yourselfand it lacks even more Dinosaurs!What I would like to see is the ability to swim, build houses/huts/forts or bases some kind of plot or end to the game, maybe some kind of special camo suit to wear to protect you from being seen, or something to keep the scent  off you and more weapons and dinosaurs.As I said earlier it is still early access so a lot of things could be added and changed but as for now I'm just stating what I think should be added or improved upon but I give it a 7.5 out of 10 it's still very, very fun! and I enjoy playing it! I would highly recommend this to someone who likes the suspense of getting hunted by our favorite prehistoric animals			"

												Not a bad concept. Out of everything I could say about it, the absolute worst is if you die, even with 6 1/2 ormore hrs play time, it's all gone. You have to start from scratch. Occasionally you can pick from your own remains and get what took you hours to collect so you won't die, but not always. One logic glitch and I lost it all. Beyond agrivating and pointless. I'm done with this, no win game. A waste of money.			"

								This isnt the game to survive alone. AI is very unforgiving and will hunt you down. 2-4 man is needed. from dodging 2 t-rex's to 8 pack of rapters this game is hunting you! Only hope of survival is to find your friend quickly and start hunting care packages. Learn shot placement as normal shots are not going to kill them. Only vital heart or double lung shots will kill immediately. kidney, single lung and stomach shots are semi-fatal but will not kill immediately. Leg and head shots are even more useless. To survive is to learn how to fight and pick your fights. This review is for PvE only. I dont dare imagine what PvP is like. God be with you...			"

Early Access Review
								This is a quick initial review after spending my first 1.6hrs in game, all opinions are subjective to change as the game updates as it is in Early Acess State.I had initially heard of this game from a youtuber by the name of DevilDogGamer, listening to him talk about it immediately peaked my interest. The thought of being dropped in a distant land full of dangerous prehistoric predators with the sole intention to turn the hunters into the hunted.  Dinosaurs have always been of interest, an while currently limited in the species type this game did not fall short of delivering an immersive experience.PC Specs - MSI 890FXA-GD70 mobo, AMD Phenom 2x6 1075T cpu, XFX 6870HD gpu, Gskill Ripjawz 8gb ram, WD caviar black 2TB HDD, Onboard Realtech HD audioRating - 8/10Pros:1) The game is beautiful minus a few graphical glitches I noticed here an there, nothing major however. Sometimes I would notice a few white slivers here an there as well from textures that haven't loaded. However with that said my GPU is dated an it still looked gourgous for the better part.2) Sounds/ambience - The audio for this game has so far been done in extremely good taste. The nature of this game forces you to constantly be vigilant and paying attention. You are being hunted after all, An with time the 3 different dinos become easily distinguishable between them. There is also the atmospheric background noise, as well as the terrain/movement sounds.  There was one sound I feel could use some improvement, which would be when the raptors are coming up on you. To me it sounds like a record player playing static and it keeps skipping, It's by no means a game killer but it does get kind of annoying after a bit.3) Each individual dino looks amazing and unique, I love that the devs took into account that many believe modern day birds evolved from dinos ( I agree with this but if you don't to each their own ). It's evident in the designs as portrayed by the feathers particularily on the raptor which raptor in itself means bird of prey.4) Tracking is easy for anyone, Your not going to walk up to a dino sign an sit an wonder for 10 min what it was. Each animal has its own individual sounds and tracks, it's very important to be able to decifer what exactly your chasing... or whats chasing you for that matter.5) Loot crates stand out, they show up nicely on the pda as well. With a bright orange color, an audio que and the pda dropping you rite on top of it they're hard to miss. I also found plenty of them, an while most had decent drops in it I'll get into my thoughts for improvements on them later.Areas of Improvement 1) First an foremost to few weapons, I haven't found a single firearm as of this post within the amount of time I have played. I get the survival with limited resources aspect an that this game isn't supposed to be easy, But with the number of crates I opened something other then another bow would have been nice. I did however find enough arrows the T-rex probably would have chocked on them if it wasn't ultimately a pack of raptors that did me in.2) Non-stackable items - I ultimately died from running out of arrows with my bow, not because I didn't have any but because my stack of 8 had run out and in haste switched to my stack of 3 which is no bueno with 3 raptors chasin ya down.  Pick a number and allow us to stack it up to that, doesn't have to be big i'ld say 8-10 if you'ld like to keep it limited.  3) some dino suggestions for the future - Stegosaurus, Ankylosaurus, Allosaurus, Pteranodon ( more so for ambience then to hunt ), Archeopteryx ( again for ambience ), Baryonyx.All in all it was an enjoyable experience and I look forward to playing it and progressing with it as it updates. This is the game many of us have been waiting for, and tho this is just the first lick of the spoon it's already hit my sweet tooth.  I would recommend playing with a friend, tho it could work against you as well depending on the type of experience your seeking. I will continue to update this as improvements and changes are made, this is just an initial review an thoughts of the game in its current state. "

								So i dont like to play multi player and i been playing this game single player. i love game like monster hunter. and who wouldnt jump at the chance to hunt dinosuarse. i spawn in i get a bow and 10 arrows. ok just like in real life i can make do with this. i crouch down to take it slow and get my branings. come over a rig and guess what t-rex (i will call her rexy) eats me one shot O K. ok respwan go else were. find everything but guns and weapons or ammo for my bow in any chest that i sreach thankly i got another bow and 10 arrows that should be fine. (now here it is worth noting i only knew of 3 dinos in the game Trex, utahraptor, and a herbvor) i hear like bird but it should like a velocirapor in jarssic park. i said no way. guess what they are velocirapors but the small ones not the 2 M ones we see in the movie, and they have feathers. i take aim as the start their atack runs. i miss o well it is an arrow they are reuseable (and yet again i am wrong once fired they are gone) but i get lucky killing 5 of my 6 attacker and the th flees and dies whch shortly after collecting my spoils i chase down. i have 1 arrow left and i cant find any guns or arrows. i stumble into more raptors with no health i just start running and i run into a 2 meter utah raptor it eats me on the spot. i rage quite no that i dont like the ame just alone it is tough. so after a few more trails and error i finally got hunting down in this game. and found where to get rilfes and can buy the .44 hand cannon plus ammo the game is a whole new ball game. this game is almost do or did. from that stroy you wonder why i lrecommend this game. it chageles you and your group to hunt and plan and really work just like a real hunt. and when your all alone it really changles you to think and feel the envorment. i am not top dog yet. but soon will be. it would be cool if you could build a base. or have buildings you can go into and rest while you plan and think about what you want to hunt. and more dino's but over all i love this game. and it takes alot ofr a game like this to win my approle			"

								This game still needs alot of work, but alteast now it goes to play the game, the crates contain a decent amount of weapons and ammo, still i think we should have the ability to climb up into the trees to hide from some of the smaller raptors, and it would be nice to jump.			"

								Its all about hunting Dinosaurs. No eating or drinking required. A lot of tracking and stalking and lining up that perfect shot to the heart. Its not a fast paced game by any means.You'll say 'clever girl' a couple times and just the general ambience of the island is enough to keep it interesting.			"

								As you can probably see from my account. I don't review games often. and when i do. It's probably just cause i enjoyed it and felt it was a good buy.However.This game...This game is fantastic. Even in it's current state. It's intese, It's immersive and quite frankly sometimes. it's terrifying. The stealth is a fantastic factor, the loot spawns, the PvE and the PvP are fun. and if your a hunter fan, or a dinosaur fan and would like a ""as close to realistic"" game, this is for you. Be prepared to die. ALOT. Raptors are relentless. Even if you encouter one on it's own. You better be a damn good shot and take it out or you're going to have 4 maybe even 5 surrounding you while you're on the move. T-Rex's are ruthless, Your only chance of survival is to stop drop and DO NOTHING. even then. Sometimes. It runs into you. and well. Squish.Pros : ImmersiveIn-depthUnforgiving environment/dinosaursgraphics are real prettyruns very stable (occasional FPS drop but nothing game breaking)No amount of gear makes this game ""easy mode"" Rifles? Arrows? .44 magnum? You still have to be careful where and what you shoot at.Good co-op experience + good solo experience i enjoyed playing alone or with others.Cons (subject to change)Combat (I dislike the requirement to ADS to even load an arrow/how slow ADS is)No possibility of hiding yourself from dino's (smothering your self in Dino poo, for instance)Once you have a raptors attention, they NEVER back down, I'm aware this is how they hunted in real life but it's practically impossible once they have an idea that your there because they convienently stop within hearing distance of you (unless this is just my unlucky experience)T-Rex doesn't seem to attack other dinosaurs, Or any dinosaurs don't attack other dinosaurs. Something i found quite frustrating.			"

								This was an extremely fun game, when you started up and learned how to do things it was exciting. even if you died a lot, you would come back for more.There was such a rush when you had to hide from a T-rex lurking about, not to mention the multiplayer when the people in the server worked together.But right now... unless some drastic change happens, then i would not recommend this game for you.I weep for the potential this game had, and still have if someone actually work on it.

												theHunter: Primal is a very fun addicting dinosaur hunting game. Playing with solo is a challenge and is scary but more fun with friends. So starting out without a intro but just a note on why you are there was okay but players will mainly skip the reading and get to the game. You are given a machete and a GPS chip to a location with no game-play teaching. Just go play and pray, The weapons are amazing however the damage doesn't seem to be accurate for the guns. Also having to aim to shoot is a pain a since the zoom zooms to far. The weapons should also accept the weapon class if from as well like compressed arros should work for a wood bow The random crates are nice and rewarding to find but find that the things you want appaer after you die 50x. Also storage crates would have been nice for ammo or things players don't need or store for later.The dinosuars look & act somewhat like they should. The small raptors are fast and attack quick. The big raptors will stalk before they attack. Triceratops are peacful but don't get close. The Quetzalcoatlus isn't much of a bother since its mainly in the sky but the T-Rex is the most feared in the game. The t-rex is the boss of the game. Killing it is near impossible and can kill with sneak. Avoid at all cost.There is no swiming machanic in the game so its all walking. TheHunter: Primal is a good game but does need a few more updates but its still fun to play. I can easily give this game a 6/10 score. With updates and new machinic this game can get a higher score but I can recommend this game.			"

												Ok this game whoa i gotta tell ya. Not perfect and far from it. Except for when you get into the nitty gritty and you realise it's better than Carnvore by like a billon times. This game has some wonderful visuals and it is not going to pound on your processors at all. Even with like 16 peaople playing with you. I run this game with a pc Lenovo Laptop. Specs. Processor: Intel(R)Core(TM) i5-6200u @2.30GHzInstalled memory (RAM): 8.00 (7.80 GB usable)System Type: ^$-bit Operating System, x64- based processorPen and Touch: Touch Support with 10 Touch PointsSo i'm good but not the best computer and i run this with everything up and no lag so i must say if i can play it you can. Thank you 32 bit game for being the way you are. This game is one of my prefered plays. If i get the chance to play i play. I have loads of fun despite the lack of Dinos. We all want more and maybe someday addon capabilities will take this game to the next level. Maybe.. this is a big maybe though,			"

								The basic game is pretty awesome. For an alpha, the map is uge, well designed, graphics are in global very good and the most important my computer can support nearly the highest graphic level (my computer is nearly a tractor lol). I'm suprised for this quality and I'm sure developpers will continue to bring good elements to this game.But, like in every good things there is a negative side : the black screen of ""loosing connection to the client"" not coming from you but from other players (personally I don't care if people lost connection ^^"" but...nevermind). Once that big black bad screen problem will be deleted from the game plus with some good new dinos and with other kinds of weapons that game has a big potential. Oh one last thing : I want to punch dinos in their face when I have no ammo ^^So, thank you developpers from Expansive World and Avalanche Studios!!!!!!! Keep going! ^^			"

								This is by far the best Dino survival game out there ..... ok I know its not really survival as such but when I play this game and get into the world (which look amazing!) you cant help but really feel like you have just landed on a hostile planet where everything is out to get you. So in that way for me its about survival but with that bit done this game is awesome! its what I was expecting from other games of titles I will not say, the AI is great the dinos look amazing even the sounds of everything going on around you at night sometimes you cant help but stand there and just listen to this world thats come to life. You also have a PDA that gives you a location to get to and along the way you come across drop pods for a chance to gain new weapons and ammo and also with the PDA you can also scan dino crap and footprints which will tell you how old it is and how far away it could be from you. This game manages to do things, make me feel things that so many other dino games have fallen short on and its only getting better with plenty of updates so on that note buy this game its a worthy investment of you cash and time.

The T-Rex is very precepitve and when crouching in a bush to hide or suprise attack a dinosaur, you end up holding your breathe anyways like it would keep your caracter from being discovered.			"

								This game has a lot of potential, and is extremely fun to explore and try and survive. One thing I would really enjoy though, is perhaps some caves which larger predators can not fit into, and not sure if this is already in there as I havent clocked up many minutes/hours. But the ability to climb trees, or a tree house in which to shoot from would be amazing! any way 9/10 at the moment, can not wait to see what gets added and how it turns out in the end.

								This is easily one of the best dinosaur survival games I've ever played!Great graphics!beautiful atmosphere and terrain the sounds are absolutely incredibleand of course there's DINOSAURS!!but with that being said I feel like this game still lacks quite a bit (I know this is still early access and I'm not complaining I'm just wanting to state what I feel should be improved on and added) :)you can't swim in waterit's easy to get hunted down and die by yourselfthere's really no plot to the game (except shoot dinosaurs)you can't build anything to protect yourselfand it lacks even more Dinosaurs!What I would like to see is the ability to swim, build houses/huts/forts or bases some kind of plot or end to the game, maybe some kind of special camo suit to wear to protect you from being seen, or something to keep the scent  off you and more weapons and dinosaurs.As I said earlier it is still early access so a lot of things could be added and changed but as for now I'm just stating what I think should be added or improved upon but I give it a 7.5 out of 10 it's still very, very fun! and I enjoy playing it! I would highly recommend this to someone who likes the suspense of getting hunted by our favorite prehistoric animals			"

								So i dont like to play multi player and i been playing this game single player. i love game like monster hunter. and who wouldnt jump at the chance to hunt dinosuarse. i spawn in i get a bow and 10 arrows. ok just like in real life i can make do with this. i crouch down to take it slow and get my branings. come over a rig and guess what t-rex (i will call her rexy) eats me one shot O K. ok respwan go else were. find everything but guns and weapons or ammo for my bow in any chest that i sreach thankly i got another bow and 10 arrows that should be fine. (now here it is worth noting i only knew of 3 dinos in the game Trex, utahraptor, and a herbvor) i hear like bird but it should like a velocirapor in jarssic park. i said no way. guess what they are velocirapors but the small ones not the 2 M ones we see in the movie, and they have feathers. i take aim as the start their atack runs. i miss o well it is an arrow they are reuseable (and yet again i am wrong once fired they are gone) but i get lucky killing 5 of my 6 attacker and the th flees and dies whch shortly after collecting my spoils i chase down. i have 1 arrow left and i cant find any guns or arrows. i stumble into more raptors with no health i just start running and i run into a 2 meter utah raptor it eats me on the spot. i rage quite no that i dont like the ame just alone it is tough. so after a few more trails and error i finally got hunting down in this game. and found where to get rilfes and can buy the .44 hand cannon plus ammo the game is a whole new ball game. this game is almost do or did. from that stroy you wonder why i lrecommend this game. it chageles you and your group to hunt and plan and really work just like a real hunt. and when your all alone it really changles you to think and feel the envorment. i am not top dog yet. but soon will be. it would be cool if you could build a base. or have buildings you can go into and rest while you plan and think about what you want to hunt. and more dino's but over all i love this game. and it takes alot ofr a game like this to win my approle			"

												After 18+ hrs of gameplay I'm safe to say that this game is great.It's not amazing, just great.You'll get ton of fun out of this for a couple of hours or so. The main reason why this game isn't that brilliant is the lack of content. I really wish the devs would put more work and effort on this game, it has just so much potential.There's different variations of equipment you can find, a few dinosaurs you can hunt, and a huge map to explore. I'd say the game is worth the price. Allthough I paid only like 2 euros for this game, I wouldn't have minded paying the full price.Simply put, the game is worth the price and it's most fun being played with other people.But, at it's current state I'd give it a 7/10, more to come if the devs decided to update the game somehow. <3			"

												theHunter: Primal is a great game in many aspects. I'm not lying when I say that, but the game still feels like a let down. It is an open-world hunting game in which you hunt dinosaurs on an exponentially large map. Hoever, that is the letdown. The map is far too large for an enjoyable experience. The game needs more content to hold up to current hunting games. I do not reccomend this game simply for lack of enjoyability.			"

								This Game is Listed a Survival Game. As it Trends toward role the one thing that bothers me is...Well the lack of current Survival features. This Game is incomplete Survival Game with some hunting aspects. Currently Death has little punishment. Dino A.I. Is shaky at times ,but most of the time it fares decently. The Game is in Early Access so many of the features aren't here yet. But this game has tons of potenial as a Survival game. Unlike many other Survival Games the PvE can be heart pounding. However in its current state the game esclates to easy very quickly Dinosaurs need to be feared not target practice. Overall i like its potential and it is fun to play ,but lacks many features before it can be a Full release game. Requires more Dinos.More Survival Aspects.Better Dino A.I.Party system.For starters.Would only recommend to those who desire a Survival Game with fun unique elements.			"

This takes all the best parts in TheHunter and adds more and more to it.I have never felt so terified whist playing a game than I have trying to take down a T-Rex on my own in TheHunter Primal!In TheHunter you did the hunting, in TheHunter Primal it goes both ways although mostly you are the pray and the dinosours let you know and toy with you!Like others have said if you are new to TheHunter games then try the free to play standard game to get an idea of the game play and then if you like it try Primal.This is early access, so don't expect perfection and there is not alot of content in the game yet but more is being added almost daily! (Well done Devs)All in all this is a BEAUTIFUL game with stunning graphics and game play that will get your heart racing!			"

Early Access Review
								Now I can't give a full review as I've only had about 7 hours into this game and my time with the game has been off and on for short periods of time. What I can tell you is that from the beginning, this isn't your average hunting game, but you know that right? You've already seen the clips from YouTubers and watched the videos here on Steam. So you know its a dinosaur hunting game, its in early alpha so theres bugs, and its a bare bones game. You got dinosaurs who act weird sometimes, although everyone is raving about how they look like what dinosaurs are supposed to look like (they've got feathers hurr durr). What I can tell you is that I've seen all of them, hunted them all (and been hunted by them, mostly this part) and its always an intense situation especially when you are alone. I'm a lone wolf so thats kind of what I do, but the game is about taking down the big buck of the land, the T-Rex. This is something I can only assume you'd need friends, lots of friends, and a lot of firepower to accomplish because T-Rex lives up to his reputation in this game. He can take a beating and still keep coming at you and only your buddies and your trusty .308 will help bring him/her down. As a loner though you don't have those luxuries, well you might have been lucky to stumble across a .308 and some ammo,  but I wouldn't suggest trying it alone unless you are certain you are a great shot. Also, like a proper hunting game, this game relies on target boxes that you must hit in order to maximize damage and bring down the beasts. And, much as you may have heard in science class all those years ago (or yesterday, whatever age you are), most of these creatures have a brain the size of a walnut, so your Call of Duty, 360, No scoping sniper skills won't get you anywhere in this game except in the digestive tract of a very appreciative carnivore. Instead you must rely on lung and heart shots, not saying a brain shot isn't possible (I've seen the videos of a guy take down a pack of raptors with only a bow and head shots, this guy was a pro... you probably aren't) so keep it safe, conserve your arrows/rounds and breathe and train your sights on the heart. Ok I got off track there, moving along. The dinosaur AI isn't the greatest here, before a recent patch (and I haven't confirmed its fix) but you would have moments where you were hauling♥♥♥♥♥across a field from a pack of raptors cause you didn't take your time with your shots and now you're out and along comes a might T-Rex to swoop in and save you like he did in Jurassic Park, right? Nope... they'd team up and chase you down together, probably resulting in a nice picnic between the two species as they discuss why your taste didn't live up to their expectations. Or, as I've observed, you can watch as a triceratops grazes on the grass when suddenly a T-Rex emerges and you finally get to see the epic battle you played out as a child with your toys, two titans clashing, who will win? Definitely not you, because the Rex would rather eat you in your 170lb boney frame than deal with the triceratops as it continues to eat in peace. Now, again, its alpha, there are bugs and they'll be fixed. But sometimes the AI gets it right and when it does, it adds soo much to the experience. For example, you can be travelling along, and you hear the roll of distant thunder, and you look out and see the clouds rolling in. It starts raining, gently at first then it picks up and the sounds of nature slightly wash out over the sounds of the pats of thousands of dropplets hitting the ground and lightening starts its dance across the sky (I don't mean to paint such a picture, but the atmosphere alone is worth the price. Watching a storm roll in while I was on the side of a volcanoe literally brought me to tears with its beauty, not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you) and all of a sudden you hear what sounds like monkeys chattering, only you know well that those aren't monkeys and its not background noise as they always, always make different sounds instead of repeating in a loop. Then you slowly crouch/walk your way up to high ground and you peer out into the forest and its hard to see because of the mixture of rain and darkness from the clouds and thats when you spot the first utahraptor. Then another and they slowly begin making their way up the hill in your direction. So panic quickly sets in as you only have a bow with a few arrows, so you ease back off the rock and keep your eyes in the direction you last saw them and thats when it happens... while the two were heading towards you while you were focusing on them, another two were coming up from the other side and started closing in a little faster. They screech and every single one of them zeros in for the kill and you never stood a chance. It could have just been my experience, it could be the way the game does it for everyone, but these moments get seared into your memory and give you a healthy appreciation that these things no longer exist. As for the big guys, triceratops is a bit of a wimp unless you corner him, then he will instantly kill you by trampling you. T-Rex, why not save the best for last? I've been killed a few times by them and its always a moment filled with heavy, heart pounding excitement. You absolutely can't win on your own (at least I never have), so when you see one, you immediately go prone and hope to god Dr. Alan Grant was right about his vision being based on movement. And as it turns out, while you back pedal slowly across the ground with the big creature closing in, you may just stand a chance as he isn't immediately attacking you but just smelling the area you were in. So you hold still for a few minutes, hoping he looses interest and that is when it happens. T-Rex adorns his troll face mask and immediately bites you in half, because he knew you were there the whole time. It may sound like I'm mocking this game, but I swear the bugs only get to you if you focus on them and let the deaths get you down. But if you take a moment to take in the atmosphere and the beautiful creatures that inhabit the island, you will realize that by the time the game gets flushed out (and they add the rest of the dinosaurs and weapons) that it was worth the price all along.

Early Access Review
								What a fantastic game! One of the main reasons I love this game so much is because of the way creators have depicted the way these dinosaurs look. Velociraptors in particular are fantastic, small, feathery and incredibly intelligent. Just the way Palaeontologist would picture them. However, that being said the game does have a lot of issues such as constant server disconnections, slow aiming reaction time and a some what annoying scenario where a player buys items e.g. ammo and then losing it all upon reconnecting from a disconnection without even using them. In saying that the game is again in early access and will undoubtedly fix the madurity of these issues and I for one cannot wait!A few things that I would love to see:More dino's obviously,Stegosaurus, Iguanodon, Parasaurolophus, Pachycephalosaurus  just to name a few herbivores.Something to compete with the might of the Tyrannosaurus. Giganotosaurus, Carcaradontosaurus and Spinosaurus all bigger would be a great accusation.Something in the sky and something in the water would be quite exiting.More weapons, clothing and other objects of appeal.A larger scale map.And finally as im sure everyone would love to see dinosaurs hunting something other than you!

												I can recommend this game barely if you love dino's.If you want a game that works...buy something else.The game has lots of good things but also lots of bad.The game crashes a lot when you die, leaving you with nothing and start over from the bottom of the map.It feels not completed yet.In my opinion. Pro's   - Scenery           - Weather           - Dino's look good           - no zombiesCons   - Still some bugs and glitches           - Servers crash all the time All in all i like playing it, beautifull game, but could use more tweaking and contend to be great.If you are a fan of dino's and hate cabela's idiotic rambo style shoot everything that moves...you should buy this game.Hunting together can be really fun.With the upcoming Jurassic World i hope dino games will be brought back from extinction.I still get a racing hearthrate when chased by a rex :P			"

												I want to say a few things... a) this game, although lacking in content, is extremely fun to play on your own and even better if played along with a cpl friends!  b) do not believe any of the negative comments about this game regarding it being a copy and paste and the gameplay... it has the similarities of some games, but everything in this game so far has made all of those similarities much better than anything close to it... c) the negative comments you read about the lack of content are all 100% accurate!  There is an O.K variety of weapons, equipment and clothing, but when it comes to the dinosaurs, they need more types!  The map is big enough to handle more dinos and i really dont underatand why the devs are holding back on that!  d) for a game that doesnt have the visuals of most of todays games, IT STILL IS MUCH MORE FUN TO PLAY THAN THE OTHERS THAT DO!  I hope the devs wake up and see that they have something bigger and better than most of the games in this genre... WAKE UP GUYS!  Me and my friends recently purchased a 4 pack and had others also buy in to it and we've had so much fun playing... if you look at my collection of games as well as the collections of all the people i play with you will see that we have been looking for something like this to pop up in steam for a while now... 11 hours of gameplay in only a few days with my buddies killing raptops, trikes, taradactles and a few uncommon t-rex's and all we have to say is... WE CRAVE MORE!!!!  Don't let the community down, this game deserves better than a 3 star rating in steam and if you only did your part in releasing updates more frequently(even if they were minor updates), you would draw much more attention and get the much needed respect for this unfinished game!!!!Dont abandon this game, please...

												I'm going to keep this short, sweet, and to the point.Ok I bought this game the day after it entered Early Access. It was like Dec. 16 2014 or sometime around them.I am reccomending this game for these reasons-Fun with friends-Can meet new friends-Terrifying dinos-Pretty good graphics-Nice atmosphere-frickin' dinosI am warning you about this game for these reasons-Rough/awkward movements-Basically abandonded by the devs-Few weapons-Horrible PvP (Havent played in a while but last time I did it was unresponsive)-Linear gameplay-At times too easy-Not very many species of dinos-Bugs. Bugs everywhereWrap Up: This game is very buggy but has its moments. The dinos always cause a sense of fear especially the Utahraptors' calls and screeches (sent shivers down my spine many times)The team competitions can be pretty fun and being able to snipe raptors from a long distance seems to never get old. Would I reccomend it? If you are willing to deal with slow devoloping and awkward controls then yes. Buy this game.			"

												Not recomended, I hinestly wasted my time with this game.  I bought it because it seemed cool and interesting, but it is clearly shown that there was little to no thought into would make this type of game great.  Didn't really run well on my computer either. Although that isn't the games fault,  the graphics and action were not enough to have been running so slow on my system.   The games damage system seems to me to complete erratic and unpredictable.  Was looking forward to a diverse number of dinos and there was only 5 different species.  It is so utterly difficult to level up to be able to start with a gun, albeit not a good one, that it madee me want to pull out my hair.  "

												Fun, Playable, Great optimisation, stressful and terrifying. A true dinosaur game! Although the lack of content may be its downfall this game is truly one of the best games ive played in a while. There are 5 dinosaurs that you may or may not quickly understand the concepts of and large array of available guns doing ♥♥♥♥ all or amazing amounts of damage. The map is huge. I mean HUGE. The stamina regen is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and you can sprint for around 10 seconds before waiting 20-30 to refill it. There are random points in the map where loot spawns and these places spawn different varieties of said loot. I would give this game an 8 or 9 out of 10, the only reason i give it no higher is purely the lack of content. (and stamina regen)			"

												I have no idea what the others are talking about, but this game is beautiful, the atmosphere is tense, and although there are only five dinosaurs, the world does seem quite full. My girlfriend loves dinosaurs, so we got this game to play, and I was very skeptical at first, and doubted the content it possessed, ready to demand a refund. After portforwarding so we could do a private game, we were plunged into a canyon, cut by a river. I tried to reach her and immediately, I was greeted by a set of teeth that belonged to a raptor. I got destroyed. Keep in mind this is five mintues in. I tried to go back to my corpse to get my items to then again, be greeted by an abnoxious raptor. I hid in a bush while it looked for me, and I heard the ground being stomped on. I thought ""Great. I am f*****"" and I was. A T-rex stepped over the bush I was in and looked at the little rapor, and I FIGURED they'd fight to the death. I was wrong. They teamed up and scanned for me together. After waiting for what seemed an eternity, the duo left and we continued our journey. Which ended in us getting trapped by the same T-rex, and we jumped to our deaths. 10/10 I love it.			"

												I'm going to keep this short, sweet, and to the point.Ok I bought this game the day after it entered Early Access. It was like Dec. 16 2014 or sometime around them.I am reccomending this game for these reasons-Fun with friends-Can meet new friends-Terrifying dinos-Pretty good graphics-Nice atmosphere-frickin' dinosI am warning you about this game for these reasons-Rough/awkward movements-Basically abandonded by the devs-Few weapons-Horrible PvP (Havent played in a while but last time I did it was unresponsive)-Linear gameplay-At times too easy-Not very many species of dinos-Bugs. Bugs everywhereWrap Up: This game is very buggy but has its moments. The dinos always cause a sense of fear especially the Utahraptors' calls and screeches (sent shivers down my spine many times)The team competitions can be pretty fun and being able to snipe raptors from a long distance seems to never get old. Would I reccomend it? If you are willing to deal with slow devoloping and awkward controls then yes. Buy this game.			"

												The fun you have in this game comes from how hilariously awful the AI and animations are. If I can give it one accolade it's that it's the best raptor dodging simulator on the market.			"

												I like this game. I like sneaking around looking for guns and ammo. trying to set up a good shot without being seen, or eaten.  I just wish it would save you at the exact spot you leave the game at. Or let you make somewhere your camp so you can leave inventory before you go on a hunt , in case you get killed. even with that being said I still love this game.			"

And it's so immersive. The audio/scenery is amazing. The dinos can be a little buggy sometimes but I have faith that the developers will continue to smooth out the kinks. I am hoping for a new dino to be released soon. This is my favorite game... by far.			"

												Fun, Playable, Great optimisation, stressful and terrifying. A true dinosaur game! Although the lack of content may be its downfall this game is truly one of the best games ive played in a while. There are 5 dinosaurs that you may or may not quickly understand the concepts of and large array of available guns doing ♥♥♥♥ all or amazing amounts of damage. The map is huge. I mean HUGE. The stamina regen is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and you can sprint for around 10 seconds before waiting 20-30 to refill it. There are random points in the map where loot spawns and these places spawn different varieties of said loot. I would give this game an 8 or 9 out of 10, the only reason i give it no higher is purely the lack of content. (and stamina regen)			"

												Pros: Its a solid game made for people who want a challenge every once in a while, it makes you re-think your approach into situations and it helps you overcome your Mario Bros. coin syndrome. The fanbase may not be so big but its good and charming nonetheless.Cons: You stand against ♥♥♥♥ing dinosaurs that will eat your very soul. Can turn you paranoid about the sounds arround you. The devs seem to have forgotten a little about their own game on the technical side. You'll learn to hate the looters.			"

												After reading all the hateful reviews and contemplating for about a week, I finally broke down and bought this game. I was not dissapointed. People on here complain about not seeing dinos ever and i just gotta say that they straight up could not have played it long enough. You walk straight and if you're not blind then you will see dinos. You dont spawn in with nothing, you get a machete and a gps. There's no team killing unless you're on a pvp server and honestly you shouldn't play pvp right off the bat anyways. Get guns and find an awesome group on a pve server and just have fun. Then maybe go pvp if you want to be a bandit i guess. Me and a group of 4 went on a t rex killing spree right when i started the game up. Couldn't be happier with the community. Happened to find a guy that gave me a .44 and i ended up being able to stay alive forever. Update: Read a few reviews where people said the devs ditched this game. They are wrong. I just wanted to put that out there because that one review stopped me from buying it a week ago. They have a few other priorities (Just Cause 3 and Mad Max) before they can put all their effort in this. They also sent out a survey the middle of december and asked what everyone wanted in the future dlc. Do some research. The games worth the price especially with FREE updated content within the coming year.Pros:-Great Community-Graphics are awesome-gear is not hard to find (NOT AS HARD AS DAYZ)-leveling system allows to buy gear before deployment (gotta be a high enough level but doesnt take long at all)-dinosaurs-nice selection of weapons-pve servers (I personally don't play anything but pve in this)Cons:-only a few types of dinos but they already announced more in upcoming updates so YAY-sometimes you might spawn on a cliff and it's tedious to get down but not impossible-some dinos glitch and dont die, they dont attack either but you cant harvest them for cash and xp (not a big deal)-pvp servers (makes no sense to me when its a hunting game that everything can kill you in)I will not put walking in the cons because if you have ever played dayz then you know true hell with finding loot.I honestly don't know why people give this game bad reviews. Maybe they just can't play survival games?It's in no way linear and completely open world. You can sprint if you simply find the right key binding so don't listen to those excuses. I understand I don't have much play time but trust me when I say it's probably the best dinosaur hunting simulator out there. I own multiple dinosaur shooters and this shot straight to the top after only a few hours. Given that I joined a badass server for my first time, if you have any problems add me and I'd be down to point out a few with great admins that kick pirate players (people that scavenge your dead body for your loot). That might be the only problem with some servers that i know of that can definitely hinder someone from progressing, but it's not that big of a deal. Look at some forums, find a group of chill players and try to make the experience better for yourself. Hopefully this review is helpful. If not. Your loss.8/10 there are a few bugs but not enough to say the game is♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Ok , first thing I need to get out is ignore all these reviews from people who have played around 30 minutes and posted a bad review because lets be honest their opinions worthless to someone looking to invest money and time into a game.Ive played this for about 40+ hours at the time im posting this and the experience has been amazing , un comparable to any other dinosaur games out there due to its realism and its focus on survival/hunting. The game has been ""Released"" which I think couldve been put back another 5 months of work personally but the dev's are updating this game regularly with new dinosaurs and weapons which all have their own advantages and downsides such as reload time and range which keeps a variety of hunters in the game , all with their own weapons of choice and play style. If you are un familiar with TheHunter dont rush into this too much and make sure you know what type of gameplay you will be thrown into. Fans of TheHunter like myself will find this game amazing , expecially with friends to do anything to survive and eventually gather the gear to start hunting dinosaurs your self.Overall : I recommend this game to every person out there due to a positive and supportive community towards new players and regular communication with the developers.  I see my self playing this for a long time after this and who knows how many hours i will lose when the updates keep rolling in. Good luck!			"

												Ok, before I get picky, this is a Hunt simulator. You will have to find prey, but you can and will become the prey too. As another said, it could use some polishing. If they'd polish and add to this game, I'd pay 3 times what I did... but they didn't and I didn't. It is still worth the price and then some for just the animals though. Cons: I wasn't liking the game for the first... 15 minutes as it got boring with nothing to cut with my machete and the landscape graphics... need work... there was a wave breaking a long ways from shore and 15 feet high... and plants/objects are often seen floating, the same tree graphics are used over and over. Then the... I think that noise is supposed to be grasshoppers doing the clicking noise when they fly, it sounds like a glitching object does in other games. Needs work there too. No jumping or swimming was a let down, but wasn't really needed. I did not encounter any game breaking glitches so all that said, not a problem.Pros: Now the up side is, the way these animals act is awesome and to me seems like they put a lot of thought into it. A T-Rex would look at me around a tree like my sisters dog does her snack toy. *I know the tasty snack is in there, but why can't I get it??* haha That said, it sucks cuz you know you are doomed without a better weapon. Then those raptors! A pack of 4 hunted me for 10 minutes. I made a mistake and ran for it. lol Like with dogs, not a good idea. The triceratops is what you'd expect, nice until you get too close or poke one with an arrow. Could use a few more types of animals, especially herbavores. All those carnivores would die of starvation quickly if all they had to eat were triceratops. Also, the t-rex / pack of rasptors ought to go for the bigger prey first. Seems silly to attack me when a perfectly good triceratops is not 10 feet away.Ok so, first game, first life for me went like this: Appear in front of a capsule, look around, try to figure out how to get stuff out of capsule, durr, get stuff, use map piece, play with machete.I then go around tried to cut stuff along the beach... nope, but found some nice shrooms. Hear a noise, look around and see nothing and continue...Hear a louder noise and spot 2 raptors coming toward me. I run for the water... ah crap I can't swim!I get to a nice spot where only one at a time could come at me, machete ready. First comes *dodge slice dodge slice slice slice* & it runs away... I'm at half health now and I get ready for the next! Similar results with dodging and slicing only I have about 20 some percent health. Feeling fairly invincible I follow and find one dead and take a selfie trophie shot... then find the other and accidently made it go away w/o a picture. Then on I go, following shiny chests toward that map location. I avoid another raptor, see a couple triceratops and oh look another chest! *approach*.I get about 25 yards away and I see a fricken T-Rex comming toward me 100 yard away! I hide behind a tree and keep on the opposite side as he comes closer. He turns and looks like he is walking away, but then he turns and spots me! Q_Q We played ring around the tree for about 5 minutes before I got too cocky and took a machete swing at him... he caught my arm. I died. Q_Q			"

												I honestly like this game. I admit it got bugs and there is a limit amount of dinosaurs types (5).But its a  hard survival game where resources are scarce and you are most of the time hunted and not the hunter. It's more realistic, you are no Rambo with tons of ammo that is able to ride on the back of a T-rex. You have are slower, weaker than most Dino's and you have to move with extreme carefulness.			"

It is the best of its kind.  They're releasing new weapons and new animal too.  Its fun to play with friends.  I do not recommend playing alone - always more fun to watch others get chomped by t-rex while you run away and surive :)).			"

												I would love to give this a thumbs up really i would. However i cant bring myself to do it. The game is very well done from an eye candy perspective and ive read some reviews that state it's hardcore. That is a huge understatement. Unloading four shotgun rounds into a raptor at point blank range and it doesnt fall is a bit OP in my opinion, couple that with the scarcity of gear in general makes this a bit more than hardcore. I think if the dev's would tweak this a little bit it has the potential of being a truly awesome game, till then it will remain in my dust rack. After playing for over two hours the thrill wore off.			"

												I have no idea what the others are talking about, but this game is beautiful, the atmosphere is tense, and although there are only five dinosaurs, the world does seem quite full. My girlfriend loves dinosaurs, so we got this game to play, and I was very skeptical at first, and doubted the content it possessed, ready to demand a refund. After portforwarding so we could do a private game, we were plunged into a canyon, cut by a river. I tried to reach her and immediately, I was greeted by a set of teeth that belonged to a raptor. I got destroyed. Keep in mind this is five mintues in. I tried to go back to my corpse to get my items to then again, be greeted by an abnoxious raptor. I hid in a bush while it looked for me, and I heard the ground being stomped on. I thought ""Great. I am f*****"" and I was. A T-rex stepped over the bush I was in and looked at the little rapor, and I FIGURED they'd fight to the death. I was wrong. They teamed up and scanned for me together. After waiting for what seemed an eternity, the duo left and we continued our journey. Which ended in us getting trapped by the same T-rex, and we jumped to our deaths. 10/10 I love it.			"

												12/17/2014: So far I'm loving this game. I've played about 6 hours as of writing this and I've played solo as well as with friends. I will say, if you're looking for a terrifying experience, play solo. With the lights off. With the bass on the speakers way up. And put a glass of water next to you.The gameplay feels little clunky and rigid, but it's an early alpha stage of the game and there's only 3 types of dinosaurs at the moment, but for what stage this game is in it looks beautiful, the sound effects are terrifying, and it's not a run and gun once you get gear, but you MUST evade dinosaurs at all times or you're probably going to die. They're clever and violent.Aside from the expected buggy nature of an early alpha game, I would highly recommend this game. 9/10UPDATEUPDATEUPDATEUPDATEUPDATEUPDATEUPDATEUPDATEUPDATEUPDATE!UPDATE 3/3/2015: As a full release game, there isn't much that has been added to the game and there's a serious lack of variety in dinosaurs and vegetation. There's a barely existent backstory, no driven purpose, and it feels like it was rushed to release with a promise of more material based on how well the game does AFTER ""Full"" release. That's a very poor marketing choice and practically screams ""Bored, now! Here's this thing we made. Now get bent.""The game can't do well if it's left unfinished by community standards, but promising to finis- errr, ""add more"" to the game if it does well despite that fact is foolish and near-sighted. It cannot do well in its current state and I am thoroughly disappointed in the devs for rushing it to release with so little content.			"

Co-op is hardly co op since you have to walk a few kilometres to find your friend IF you survive or play long enough to either find weapons or make enough money to buy nice weapons upon respawn.If you want a dinosaur game check out Ark, it looks a lot more promising so far!

												The fun you have in this game comes from how hilariously awful the AI and animations are. If I can give it one accolade it's that it's the best raptor dodging simulator on the market.			"

												theHunter: Primal is a great game in many aspects. I'm not lying when I say that, but the game still feels like a let down. It is an open-world hunting game in which you hunt dinosaurs on an exponentially large map. Hoever, that is the letdown. The map is far too large for an enjoyable experience. The game needs more content to hold up to current hunting games. I do not reccomend this game simply for lack of enjoyability.			"

												I know that the original hunter has more Content then this one but it certainly beats having to pay monthly just to renew your hunting license over and over again. As for primal I think its quite fun for a general hunting game.			"

												One of the only games that has had me literally scared ****less. Once spent 15 minutes cowering in a bush because there was a T-Rex nearby. Also nearly had a heart attack when I was sneaking through some foliage and a raptor appeared from nowhere and killed me.			"

												Quite disappointed by this game :- still very few species of dynosaurs to hunt ;- a lot of bugs (including the screen not adjusting properly, even after modifying the parameters) ;- the way of using XP is frustrating at the best and does not encourage to invest your time in this game ;- the graphics are, in my opinion, ugly ;- bad AI.When comparing this game to the other survival/dynosaurs games, I consider it being a waster of my money.

												They aren't supporting this game any longer. (Atleast for the moment) If you play by yourself, simply watch the first trailer, imagine worse graphics, and thats how the game is. Single player is like, a prehistoric dying simulator. Tons of fun.			"
