								Before its Official Launch, The game was very much in Alpha but giving Feedback has made lots of Improvement.The Developer was very active and Friendly. It was fun game testing and fooling around finding bugs and glitches.At one part, I found a bug where your Crossbow gun becomes a M16 Rifle which was one of the Developer partner left it ingame by accident.

Not for everyone but for those who just want to play and test for fun while looking for Glitches and Bugs and helping a Developer :D "

								Lots of innovative ideas here.Your weapon (crossbow) is like a character in other RPGs.  You can upgrade it.The first person tower defense concept is also interesting.  You control your defenses like a normal tower defense but you can use your hero to jump in where needed and push back the enemy.It also has RTS elements like resource gathering and building selection.It's not finished yet but its EA so that's to be expected.  It's easily worth the price if you like checking out new types of games and don't mind the rough edges you get with EA.			"

								So far there isn't much content, but what is there works and is enjoyable. The game starts out with your guy oing some talking to various people to get his weapon then first mission. The first mission is just a solo one with minimal hostiles and a few pieces of loot. After the first mission you get the option to hire a knight hero who can perform quests of his own (though right now its limited to one quest, which sadly is not repeatable) as well as assist you in the second main mission/map, which has you build up a base and push forward to destroy the two enemy bases. Not a whole lot of content, i spent about two hours on my first run getting that done. Second run maybe 20 minutes to do both maps. What is there mostly works, i couldn't get my soldiers in the second level to advance on the enemy positions, but between my hero and main character it was a pushover anyway. I'm giving this a thumbs up, my money was well spent on this and it looks like things are only getting better from here.Edit: Just editing to say the dev has fixed the pathfinding issue causing soldiers to not advance on the second map i had mentioned. Pretty fast fix on that.			"

								*I bought the game off his website so steam thinks my review doesnt matter*Now this game is by no means close to finished. It's very early and rough around the edges. And I understand alot of people dont like early access games, especially when they're this early on in development.BUT, this game is going in a very good direction. I've already had alot of fun on the first level of the game because of how fun it was to explore. I'd played the alpha and knew where things were, but there was no forest on the first level before. This time I was so caught up looking around the forest, I ran into about 3 enemies I already knew the location of all at once becuase I was too busy tunnel visioning at the enviroment.Anyways, I'll spare you my personal enjoyment of the game and just tell you what this game is like and the vision of where it's going, at least from my perspective. I'm not the Dev :PSo, this game plays kind of like a line war game, or tug of war some call it. If you've ever played the Epic War flash games, it's like you have your base send units against their units until you kill their base. You can give orders to your units of course, but the unit control is pretty straight forward. Advance, hold or retreat. Now I dont know how many different kinds of missions there are going to be. But for the most part to my understanding, you have to defend your base and build up an army to be able to go out and destroy theirs. There's usually hidden goodies laying around off the path between bases. This was the first mission in the alpha, and I was already going to enjoy the game as it was just like that.Now there's an open exploration mission (the new first mission) and honestly it was alot of fun just going to all the objectives and seeing what I could find between them and getting ambushed a few times. There's ruined buildings and there used to be a dungeon but I think that's down for maintenence at the moment as there's rocks blocking the door to the dungeon. There's been alot of small little surprises added every update that honestly make it pretty fun to play through all the missions each update. Now by this I dont mean ""wow an entire epic dungeon that wasnt there before"" in every level each update. Once there was a small dungeon added with a little orc guy patroling around which made it come to my attention, this time there's trees and hidden goodies laying around inside them.This game makes my inner nerd come out because of what it's growing into. There's currently only one type of hero you can recruit, the warrior, and as basic as that sounds, he has a skill tree and randomized stats when you recruit him. I cant wait to see all the different hero types and what all their skill trees will be like. I've talked to the dev about potential ideas alot before, so I'm probably more excited than I should be. There's alot of thigns he wants to do that I wont throw out there because people will complain if it doesnt make it in. It's mostly just ideas that would be cool if they made it in the game and whatnot. But I'm so excited to see how this game grows. But dont be a stranger, talk on the discussion board and see what all this game can grow into.			"

								I've just started playng this game, but I'm already impressed.  For too long, games have played it safe by remaining categorized in only one game type.  Heroes of Issachar is a creatively breaks down some of the artificial barriers between traditional game types to create a unique game type of its own.  This is an ambitious project and one that you would ordinarily expect to require the labor of a major game studio.  That an independent developer can make such a compellling contribution in this arena indicates that talented devlopers are alive and well in the world of indpendent game production.  I look forward to spending more time with Heroes of Issachar, and to future work by Blue Mana!  Well done!			"

								Game with alot of potential. Although I won't say buy it, I'd say keep an eye on it. Active developer, friendly and hardworking.Does whatever he can to make this a great game, although I personally think he took a big of a bite with his plans and gametype. But we'll see in due time.			"

								This is a very fun game in EA with a developer who cares deeply about its development. Give it a chance or keep your eye on it, because it's an ambitious project with its pieces coming together nicely.Also ignore the negative review from the guy who said ""srsly"" instead of seriously. My playtime is way longer than it shows and had an alpha before this was released. He responds to players and updates regularly.edit: I received this for free, I forgot to mark it.			"

								Just read one of the reviews and it was totally unfair. I have had this game for a while as the developer was kind enough to share it with me. Unfortunately I didnâ€™t rack up much time but the developer is clearly invested in this game and it has improved a lot since I first got it. I read a negative review that criticized it for not being finished.... EARLY ACCESS! Its not meant to be finished. Its got a lot of potential its a fair price so I would recommend giving it a try. I really like the concept. "

								At he current state, I'm sorry but I can't recommend the game.For me, the menu sounds are super annoying. Sprinting is extremely fast wherease walking feels to slow for me.In the crossbow menu, I can't read the key combinations needed for mounting or equiping stuff ... it's just appearing as a graphics bug.Physics are super weird (shot a wolf -> if flew off like i just put some explosives right underneath it and blew it up)The game world itself looks sterile (only played the first map so far). 1 kind of house ruins, 2 kinds of tree models.Enemies also seem like a ""rare resource"" in the first map... just a hand full of monsters to fight.Maybe this will be a good game some time in the future, but currently it is not imo.

								The first-run experience couldn't have been much worse.- Sloppiest keybinding management of any Unity game I've played. I'm assuming it's a Unity game since it uses the standard Unity game configuration app + launcher.- Overly long, pretentious, and boring Blue Mana branding intro that can't be skipped.- Immediately upon starting the game, camera is in a constant spin. Unplugged USB gamepad, re-checked key bindings, yet no joy.Update: Fixed the camera spin by unplugging another USB controller that had been connected, so the game is playable now. Still noticing minor annoyances such as ponderous NPC dialog that can't be sped up or dismissed and keypress prompts that don't match actual key bindings. Might be a diamond in the rough, but still too rough to recommend.			"
