 How bad IS this game?I was previously part of the Development Team that created this game, we were previously working on a game called Project Decay. This game basically followed the trend of sh*tty simulator games trying to suck money out of you. I got this for free from MoWah, a friend of mine who also was on the team. It has no future, no enjoyment and definitely not worth any of your valuable money. Do not buy this game, PLEASE.			"

								Oh su funi and random eks di eks di. Okay, the fun's over. Absolute rock bottom. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind stupid ways to have fun. I even found Goat Simulator (at least slightly) amusing, because - say what you want about it, but it clearly included some work being done, the city was filled with easter eggs, stuff to do, there were achievements, workshop support, etc. The developer is claiming that this is not trying to be Goat Simulator, but I'm absolutely sure this piece of software tried to go the same way while completely missing the point, offering no fun, basically no gameplay and failing at being funny.The developer of this piece software completely misuderstood the point of Goat Simulator and thought that [insert random word here] Simulators are funny, because they are poorly made and you can't do anything there. Also making this type of ""simulator"" now is not even beating a dead horse, because the horse has been dead for half of the year, it's basically beating a horse skeleton now. I guess that developer decided to download Unity 3D and tried to put something together in it. Nothing against him, but you can clearly see he has absolutely no idea what he is doing. The menu is barely working, ""Exit Game"" button in the main menu doesn't work at all, other buttons in some game mods are bugged as well. Anyway let's get to the point. The game has four game mods. So let's do this, shall we?ClassicFirst mode is called Classic. The first thing you will notice is a mouse cursor visible while playing, but it goes away when you click the mouse button. Second thing you will notice is absolutely insane performance. I have about 10-15 FPS on this small map on the fastest settings. On a small map with some grass and few ridiculously small cows randomly placed there. I would seriously like to know the reason of it being more hardware demanding than Crysis. I have two theories. First is that the physics (this is using PhysX, or at least it was installing it) is badly coded, second theory is that it's because there are like thousands of trees on the edge of the map. If you go too far, you die instantly and go back. But I found out that if you hold W and you keep holding it while dying, you just get back up and you can continue with your journey for self-discovery. The cows are stuck in 2 seconds long animation and you can even see when they are reseting. You have some weapons, which are absolutely pointless anyway, because there is nothing to shoot with them, except the ground, which is something, I guess? If you shoot the cow, nothing happens. There are bullet decals, but they are levitating in the air, because cows have invisible square hitboxes around them. Another thing is that these guns are stock default Unity guns I had pleasure to see in another awesome piece of software known as Air Control, and trust me, I would like to be joking. There are few round collectables on the ground that can be collected that will make you move faster or will slow down a time. I remember them from Air Control as well, so I think these things are included in Unity, or maybe in its Pro version. Well, that's the first mode for you anyway, let's move to the second one.GrassYou... do nothing there, you can move the camera around and watch model of grass moving upwards from the ground. Su randum! Also there is a sketch of corn. It's not even modelled, it's just 2D picture with two colours used. Okay, that's the grass mode. This mode has bugged menu, because when I tried to click the button to go back to Main Menu, it didn't do anything, so I had to shut it down to be able to ""play"" another mode. Now let's skip to it!DubstepCuz you know, if you have no idea what to do, put dubstep there. In this mode there is just a very small map (with fence being the border) with some lights, dubstep music playing there and the cows rotating around. Comedy gold! The terrain is glowing and sky is moving. I guess it's hardcore party. There is one hipster cow that's not part of the crowd. This cow is flying, changing the scale, etc. I thought: ""Wow, developer can scale a cow model, impressive!""RangeI think that Range mode is supposed to be shooting mode, but to be honest, it doesn't work for me, so I guess it's broken. There is nothing happening when I load it. When I press Escape, I bug through the ceiling and fall on the ground and then... still nothing. Keys on my keyboard aren't doing anything and mouse as well, so I couldn't move and couldn't even move camera around. I guess you can use this mode as a wallpaper.So that's Grass Simulator for you! Su funi! ""But it's in Early Access!"", you could say and the developer is promising another features added in the future. That's right, but look, there are good and promising games in Early Access that are only getting better and then there is this thing which obviously will never be good, because the developer is lacking developing skills and the whole idea of Grass Simulator is stupid to begin with. I would like to be proven wrong, but I don't think I will. For me, the biggest problem with this software is that skilled person would be able to make it in a day and amateur in few days with help of some YouTube tutorials. The most baffling thing is that this is being sold for actual money. It could be okay as a some learning project for developer on some website where you could play it in the web browser, but it's not okay as a product on Steam being sold for actual money. Especially for 8,99€ (10% off). I find this price absolutely ludicrous and mocking all the people who bought this for full price, because you can get Skyrim for lower price when it's on sale. Last message is for bunch of internet ""comedians"" making the same tired jokes in their reviews - we've already seen it milions of times, so you are not funny nor original, also you're giving it bigger score (Mostly Positive at the time of writing this review) that could mislead some people into thinking that this is actually something good.

								I'm sure everyone will say something along the lines of grass is god, grass is life or some other stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥but I'm going to try and actually analyze this game and give you a real ""review"" of what ""Grass Simulator"" is. This is what I like to call a gag gift game, is it the next GOTY, no of course not. Is it odd and in some respects funny, of course. I don't recommend you purchase this game if you expect to get hours of entertainment or want anything aside from a few chuckles from time to time. This is a ""game"" if you can call it that, for a laugh. If you don't like seeing games like this then stop supporting them. I personally don't mind some lighthearted humour from time to time.Do I recommend this? Not to the general audience but if you have a few bucks to blow and want to WTF from time to time, have a blast.If you do want to see how this game is, I did a short montage showcasing what this game is about, funny moments.

								First off i don't know if I am missing something or the plus reviews are fakes.  Could go either way.  I normally NEVER review a game but after running this software (was no playing and definately not a game) and reading what other people say.  I loaded it up in every mode and for one I couldn't kill anything. I brought up the guns and blasted away But at point blank range it didn't hurt or even leave a mark on a cow or on the cutouts in the ""Shooting Range"" I ran around and it just ended after a few minutes in teh ""classic"" mode, in the shooting range your stuck in a building you can't leave, And in all the other ""modes"" I couldn't even move. Although on pause the cows did.    If you want to load a program that has no purpose. Other than I guess you can get enjoyment out of spinning cows while it is paused. Then this is what you want.  Personally i got the game for free and think i was ripped off.  "

								This game is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Why was it Greenlit? All you do as far as I can tell is walk around in the grass and maybe shoot a gun eventually. That's it. Nothing else. You walk around in the grass. It reminds me of an old default Windows screensaver, just walking around in a field. And maybe shooting targets. I don't know, I couldn't even get to that. I get terrible FPS on such a tiny game, but that might just be my computer. But I can run TF2 and DayZ better than this - both games I'd rather be playing.This game attempts to be funny, and to be a joke, but it fails at even that. It's a complete piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ not a game, not a joke, NOTHING!Maybe, MAYBE at some point in the distant future this game will be worth $10, but right now - not at ALL.0/10 I would never reccomend ever.

												The game has seven gameplay modes. They are:-Wandering through a completely empty grassy field that has NOTHING to do-A tiny shooting range with no scoring or other mechanics-Staring at a flat 2-D image of grass that gradually gets bigger-Standing in a field with cows that spin in place while one dubstep music track plays-Wandering through a completely empty snowy allley that has NOTHING to do-Standing in a field with static teleporting cows while one ""disco"" music track plays-Staring at a ""searching for online server"" screen that never goes awayIf you play the game for any slightly extended period of time the game glitches so that none of the modes work until you exit the game (even the exit game button stops working)This game is a joke that is not funny. I implore you: do not buy this game and encourage this idiocy. This is just crapping out something that only a cynical man would call a game and selling it as satire. If this game were a real joke, it would not be selling for ten dollars.			"

								It's not a game, it's not a simulator, it's just stupidity. Our? Because we voted for something like this and got it here? Or maybe somebody from Steam? Because they accepted this to their platform?I remember that people used to release demos like that in internet and ask others what they think about it. Mostly on some tutorial forums, to show some progress that some begginer programmer or somebody else made etc. but this isn't even something that can rated. Price label says it's 9,99€. For what? Early Access with almost nothing. Few shoots, some music that sounds like broken fishing boat and most ugly grass ever. It just takes to add ""comedy/parody"" to make it a whole different experience. Glad I got it like everyone, for free, because paying for something like this could be most stupid thing ever.			"

That's actually worth.....playing.Regardless though, I really can't help but wonder what the joke behind this game is. The idea makes no sense and while it sounds funny, it's really just boring.If the devs really wanted to make this worth a lot of people's times, they should had began development long ago and released the game when it was complete.As a supporter of the idea of a wacky and insanely strange game akin to Goat Simulator, I am really dissapointed.

												This review is split into two sections; the first section lists pros and cons, and the second section features a short review.Pros and ConsCons:Extremely badly optimised, if at all.Very boring gameplay.Very repetitive gameplay.Not compatible with all the resolutions it suggests it can use.Bad menu systems.Uses the default Unity launcher interface.Pros:The icon is cute.ReviewWhy does this software, that's right I'm calling it software because it's not even remotely like a game, even have the words ""grass"" and ""simulator"" in the title? It is not a simulation game at all and doesn't even try to be remotely satirical such as other popular simulation games such as Surgeon Simulator. Want to be satirical in your titles? You should have called this “A Game” rather than the title it was published with.I don’t even understand how this was able to get greenlit nor do I understand why it’s out of early access. I got this game for free and I still feel cheated.I was extremely curious as to how this was able to get greenlit and so I did some googling. It turns out that the developer bribed members of a popular game gifting website to vote for his game in exchange for free keys.

The lead developer of this game promised me a key distributer job a number of months back and just ended up ignoring me even when the distribution was going on and then removed me from my moderator status on the forum for no apparant reason.So to make a long story shortThe Devs suck The Game sucks Dont buy thisIm honestly embarrassed that i was part of the dev team for this gameIt also says it all that majority of the positive reviews are reviews saying stuff like: I love it because i like grass			"

												Although this game was very entertaining and very fun to play for ten minutes, all in all, based upon the content, it's a waste of money. It doesn't cost much, no, but you do have better games for the same price to spend your money on.Classic Mode:Has no objective at all. You walk around in a reasonably small world filled with a single cabin, grass, fences, trees and cows with buggy heads. Shooting the cows makes them explode but once you've seen that once and you've giggled - do you want to see it again?Grass Mode:Why would you even put this into a game? You don't spend money on a game to watch grass grow. You can't move or equip anything. All you do is sit in your chair and watch grass grow. Paint-Drying simulator will be the next release.Dubstep Mode:I laughed for about six miliseconds. Stingy cow animations with some tacky lighting effects and some terrible dubstep music. Putting two-and-two together, yes, it's just spinning cows dancing to music. Done.Ranged Mode:Um, this is meant to be a ""Grass Simulator"", not a FPS. Completely irrelevant to the game, and once again has no clear objective. The mace is pointless; you can't kill cows with it and you can't actually get out of the cabin that you spawn in on this mode.Snowfall Mode:This mode is the only one which actually has detail. Probably my favourite mode because the map is actually extremely well modeled, but much like the Classic Mode, has no objective whatsoever. Just walking around in a snowy place with, oh! Guess what! Cows!At first I thought it was a direct model from KHOLAT.Bad Party Mode:This mode does one thing, and one thing only. Generate lag. Guess what! Cows again! Superspeed cows with lights hanging off their backs and dying. For people to laugh at that they really must have a bad sense of humour. Sorry, but why would you put things like that in a game, especially since people actually paid money for this?Online Mode:Gah, what do I say about this? Like I said before, if you call a game ""Grass Simulator"", you must be mad to turn it into an FPS. People seem to be invincible, the aiming sucks, the bobbing of the weapons, although it's realistic, makes it extremely difficult to see what you're doing.All In All, this game is just a waste of money. This game would be perfect if it was a Free to Play game and is very good at pointlessly consuming 20 minutes of your life. You're better off just watching videos of this game and saving your money.			"

The developers of this silly ""game"" banned me from their discussions for a week because I told a joke. The creators of this joke of a game can't even take a joke, themselves.Also, something worth mentioning:A friend of mine gifted me this game... That friend was one of the people on the team that made this game (he left recently because he was disappointed in them for making this pile of garbage), and even HE left a negative review.To be honest, I'm most disappointed in the Steam community for allowing this piece of trash to release on Steam. Goat Simulator had tons of content and unlockables, Surgeon Simulator was actually a well-made game... But Grass Simulator? Grass Simulator has no appealing qualities. None at all.I give this game a 0/10 "

NOTEI initially posted this review while it was in Early Access. Since then, the ""game"" has been released from Early Access. I've updated my review with a few alterations so note that I HAVE tried the ""game"" out of Early Access.First Impression ReviewI'll be using this game to demo a new type of review for me: First Impression Reviews, where I've only played a game for not too long. These reviews will be different in structure than my typical score-based reviews, and will be considerably shorter. They may or may not be extended to a full-length review at a later date.Sorry, I forgot to put quotation marks around the word ""game"" in the above paragraph. Because this, in its current state, can hardly be considered a game. This was incredibly disappointing, despite the overwhelming hype (no doubt generated by a free key for a vote promotion). In the few minutes I played this I quickly realised I exhausted all the content thus far. Almost everything is there just for show. While cows do explode (a factual inaccuracy pointed out to me, I apologise) - that alone is rather ludicrous and unnecessary. I suppose it could pass off as a cheap thrill since there are few to be had here. The grass art assets are 2D, and for a game that touts itself as a ""grass simulator"", that's a terrible disappointment.You also cannot exit out of multiplayer mode. You're stuck in it and have to manually quit the game. Servers are likewise empty.I could go on and on but I'm already starting to get cancer from this super-super-super-alpha-tech demo. At least this has cards.Game StatusReleased out of Early Access on April Fool's Day. Are you freaking kidding me? Still way too early.Recommended?Yes/NONot even worth it at its current state or price point. To quote another reviewer: ""I got this for free and think I was ripped off."" "

												I really wish this game wasnt on steam. It is a disgrace to other games that are trying so desperetely to get on steam and be successful and actually try fairly and hard to do it. The main premise of the game is simulating grass. I think it should be renamed cow simulator cause it has more cows than grass. There is only one level that has any hint of gameplay in it and all that involves is shooting targets. The rest of the levels involve you walking around to look at all the crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥thats happening and that is it. I mean one of the levels is dupstep cows. why... The developer could at least attempt to make this game reasonable but they are just throwing in the trash bin. There is no way I would recommend this at all.TheIronicGamers rating system Don't ever buy this game. Maybe consider it on a sale.

								A nice example of how great Greenlight is, It completely lacks quality gameplay, the graphics are most likely unmodified bought assets, the game requires restarting just to switch modes and the multiplayer is a joke. You could sit down and watch paint dry and get the same amount of entertainment as this game holds for much more time. this is just another game that somehow got greenlighted and onto the steam store in early access (and will never leave early access). It's really nice that Valve is doing something about games like these and providing actual quality control, but for now this one game is still here to♥♥♥♥♥♥up the store. i was fortunate enough to get this title for free in the christmas bidding event. i didn't spend a penny on this, but others did, and that thought alone makes me feel sorry. The author made badges in the game, and the emotes are just memes like Gr8 and M8, nothing to do with the game and only mean't to get people to pay a lot for those two emotes to be funny for a few seconds, then remember they paid 5$ for an emote. while the emotes that have something to do with the game go for 3 cents.

								Where do I start with this? I want to firstly say It's just a joke, but I'm sure jokes are meant to be funny whereas I couldn't even smile while playing this game, It's a buggy unoptimised mess. I get that It's in early access, but I feel it should be placed in an even earlier access for the amount of content for what you get, and I understand the phrase ""You get what you pay for"" but I'm feeling a bit undercut here. This is several dollars on the side of uncomfortable for a game purchase, I've seen better flash games that had more time and effort put into them. So I spawned into a world filled with cheap unity assets and horrible textures and I hit a cow, the cow went boom, calm down Grass Simulator save some of the fun for later, I think I just overdosed on fun and exitement, I don't know what explosive beef and automatic weapons have to do with grass but maybe I'm just missing the big picture here. I decided to play the mode where you actually get to play as grass, I thought maybe the game has something to offer, maybe this is the big dog's biscuit, maybe I've uncovered the fountain of youth. Nope, you are a piece of grass, you grow, you stand there indefinitely, while my brain and eyes were still crying for me to stop, I decided to try the dubstep mode, now I can add my ears to the things that are being tortured. I think releasing the game with no download files would have been less of a mistake, at least then it wouldn't turn your computer into hot molten slag. You know what? For this once, I'd like to present the ""MoWah's Longstanding Achievment Award for Detestable Mess of the 21st Century"" to Grass Simulator, where It will hold it until they make a cross-breed of Grass Simulator, ET for the atari 2600 and Ride to hell.

												In its current state, this game is not worth getting. There are several modes, but not really anything to do in most. You'll be lucky to squeeze 1-2 hours out of it. The multiplayer mode is useless, as there are never any lobbies open. You can create one, but no one is ever online to play. Additionally, the performance is poor. Alone on a multiplayer map with graphics on 'Fastest' I get marginally better FPS than Battlefield 3 with 64 players on Intel graphics. The guns feel and sound weak, though they are vastly improved from the single player guns. The controls can be painfully awkward and are not rebindable. To quit multiplayer I have to Alt+Tab and close it as I cannot find an option to return to the menu or quit the game.  Finally, the Grass Simulating mode has the worst graphics of any mode, featuring 2D 'sprites' rather than 3D models of grass (this is most noticeable with the green silhouette of corn.)Despite the updates the game has received, essentially no significant improvements to individual modes have been made as far as I can tell. New modes get added, and nothing gets fixed. Despite a HUD and all guns being fully animated in multiplayer, the single player modes still have unfinished animations for guns and no hud at all.Perhaps someday, if the dev is willing to fix and expand existing modes instead of randomly adding new ones, the game may end up ok. However, until that day comes I advise you stay clear of Grass Simulator.\\V0.2.1 Update:Just performance fixes and maybe(?) some bugfixes. No new content. Multiplayer still ugly and empty (fun fact: it's impossible to use up all your ammo in a match.)  At least if you now find yourself playing Grass Simulator it will run better.V0.2.2 Update:MAIN MENU BUG FINALLY FIXED. You can properly change game modes now. Unless you start multiplayer, then you have to restart the game. :/New mode, Hellfire, replaced the 'Grass' mode. It's effectively 'Classic' mode but with f.lux set to darkroom and some reskinned guns. Also, and I believe this is new in this version, weapon recoil is more severe. Weirdly, only the gun model moves-your bullets still go to the same spot and the camera fails to move, creating a weird look. I noticed the Glock sounds like it has a suppressor in Hellfire mode, and Classic, Hellfire [and I assume Snowfall as well] now have infinite ammo for all guns. The infinite ammo was implemented incorrectly, however, and you now never need to reload. Cow hit boxes are wrong as well.While it was nice to see an update that actually addressed problems and attempted to add 'new' content, I still cannot recommend this game to anyone.			"

Name is Grass Simulator.. but it's not about grass.. it's just a 1% finished first person shooter...The Base is ok.. but it's not nearly ready and it's current status is no better than most of the high school game programming project...Stay away from this one at all cost until the game finish developing..Current version is out of earlly access but it shouldn't be.. multiplayer is the only good point of the game but games with gun that don't reload and no health bar is no fun at all...Good choice of game engine.. but please improve your skills before selling it to a global market.Anyhow.. 1.5/10 is my current rating.

								Words cannot describe how, or what, or why this game was made. It also feels like air control except nothing to do AT ALL.Although there are 5 modes in this and they are: Classic, Grass, Dubstep, Range, and Christmas. Here's a description of each of them.Classic: Run around, kill cows, slow-mo, kill yourself by killing cows and watching them explode, sanic fast, and run out of ammo with nothing else to do.Grass: Watch grass grow and nothing else.Dubstep: Drop the cow *instert random dubstep sh!t here*Range: Shoot stuff.Christmas: Same sh!t as classic, except christmas edition with no slow-mo and sanic fast.""Grass Is @ss/10"" and ""I got the weed wacker/5"" :| Unfunny game and should be Free To Fu<k Around.

												Let me set this up for you. I just got bought some trading cards to complete some badges. One of the coupons I get is for a game called grass simulator. I immediately think, ""wow, sounds real ♥♥♥♥♥♥."" However, I can get for a pretty good price and it doesn't look that bad, so I buy it as a little joke. How bad can it be anyways?The game looks only normal bad at first glance, but then you realize that there are random invisible walls where the game seemingly draws infinitely, the mace only works if you crouch down and hit the cow in the udder or something, the time manipulating powerups are completely flat textures that are nearly impossible to pick up, the reload function is seemingly useless as the guns don't seem to ever run out of ammuntition, there's no point in useing anything other than the machine gun anyways, the other guns are fully auto for some completely asinine reason, jumping is incredibly stiff and doesn't feel like it works half the time, even at that there's no point to jumping because there's no diversity in the different environments, and it takes less than 15 minutes to see everything the game has to offer.The soundtrack's pretty nice though..5/10			"

The other game modes, are the same thing, just with different music and spinning cows, or targets. If you are looking for a casual, shooter, memetastic game, get Blood and Bacon instead.

In its current state I would say it is not worth the 10 bucks but if you want to see it go through development then it’s not too pricy. But overall as it is right now it’s not worth the money.

Enter the magical world of Grass Simulator!Grass Simulator is the next generation of grass-simulating games. With simple controls, well-conceived mechanics and stunning graphics, Grass Simulator is a perfect replacement for real-life grass! No need to go outside to have a look at grass anymore. This game is truly satisfying with its realistic sprites and real-time motion, a must-have for every gamer!No, but really, this game sucks. Its bugs and repetitive gameplay make it hard and awful to play, despite the amount of content it contains. All you can do is choose your location and then shoot exploding cows there, or literally watch grass grow.There are so many things to spend your money on, this is definitely not one of them.			"

												I hated this. I don't hate too easily, so when I say I hate something... I hate something. Do yourself a hugegantic favor, don't buy this schlock. At least not for yourself. Not even on sale.It has the tag ""Walking Simulator""'Nuff said...The only reason I bought this in the first place was... Actually to be quite honest, I don't remember if there even was one. Novelty, maybe? Sale? I really don't remember at all. I could've just been bored at the time of purchase and thought ""Huh, this should interesting."" In all fairness it was. But overall it was a waste of money. I PROMPTLY got it refunded, even if it was just a dollar at the time.If you want to buy it as a really messed up prank on a friend, that's about all it's good for.Notice how I never called IT a ""game,"" that wasn't an accident.And if you've made it this far and still aren't convinced to NOT buy it then I have no words for you that aren't incredibly offensive.UPDATE: I re-bought this worthless junk as a Chritsmas gift for three people.

Posted: June 4, 2015
												There exist numerous bad reviews for this game, but I thought I'd try it for myself. I am not one of those people who blast a game after playing it for 35 minutes, but trust me on this one, in 35 minutes I checked out every single thing this game had to offer. There is no story, no intro, no video, no cutscene, no dialog at all. Just the obnoxious music at the start screen. You start Classic mode, to find yourself in a random field with cows (wooden, low geometry idle models) grazing grass made up of 2-D models that will remind you of Midtown Madness (the 1999 game by MS). If you name a game Grass Simulator, for the love of Cthulhu, at least render the freaking grass nicely! And to think that THIS maxed out my decent laptop system at second-best graphics quality (fell below 30fps). What is it using the memory for? Definitely not rendering anything in the game!Okay, so you're in the field. Now what? You have a crosshair in the center of the screen - that's all. Since this is obviously not your first game, you click around buttons, and realise that number keys bring up different weapons. You can shoot cows with a Glock, an old-timey Revolver, a Tommy-Gun, and apparently what looks like a swinging mace. After 3-4 bullets the cows explode. That's it. The worst part, is that the budgeoning mace ironically does no damage. The ""world"", i.e., the random field, has invisible borders you can't cross (but your bullets can) and there is no map, no HUD, nothing at all that can tell you where you are and what, if anything, are you supposed to do. Oh, and there are no Ammo indicators, it just runs out when it wishes.Next is the ""Grass"" mode, where you can be a strand of grass on the ground, and can see the Sun set and rise every few seconds, seeing up close the pathetic 2-D grass models around you grow in height as days go by. I don't know if this bit was some satire on the overdose of crappy, mindless simulator games flooding social media, but this is truly pointless. Also, satire works best if there is something of use to complement it. Someone tell that to the Devs.Then there's a Dubstep mode, where some groovy music plays and you have cows spazzing in circles about their fixed axes. You can just watch the light-and-sound show, walk around and watch cows flashing in bright colours rotating to trippy music that repeats every 2.5 mins. The Bad Disco mode is a worse version of the same, with series of glowing disco lights replaced by the cow models. Frankly, seeing this does give you a laugh for the first 20 seconds, but after the joke is over you kinda wonder why the hell this game existsThe Snow Forest is actually a decent-looking stage which again clearly shows that the trees are much better-designed than the grass. Again, you have guns and you shoot cows to explode them.My absolute crappy experience was the Range: There are targets for you to shoot. That's it. No count, no score, no ammo indicator.Throughout the game's various levels, you:-Can't switch to guns if you die. Gotta reboot the game (oh yes!);-May randomly just die, while walking or standing (I even died randomly in the Range); of course, no guns IF you manage to respawn;-Exploding cows, if too close to you, push you back and their explosions are lethal (no health bar whatsoever);-Might face a simple crash;-Might face the game's level loading but you freezing, with the Menu still functional.I had chanced upon this game in Greenlight, and voted yes because the idea seemed new, hilarious and really satirical. But the game has absolutely nothing in it. I expected something like Goat simulator, maybe. What I got was an 800 MB download that basically consisted of 2 MP3 files, 2 terrain models, 1 animal model, 4 weapon models, 2 tree models and maybe 5-6 grass PNGs. I later came to know that if the game got through Greenlight, the Devs would gift a key to those in the group following the game. They did not ask anyone to promote the game in any way, and the group was closed, so I don't know how ethical this whole deal was, but I am pretty sure that shady releases like these are a major reason why the Greenlight system got shut down. If I am feeling so bad over spending less than an hour, and a little bandwidth, I cannot imagine the plight of those who shelled out 10 Euros for this piece of absolute defecation.			"

Why on Gods Earth does Grass Simulator exist?You see, ever since the dawn of time, man has fought to convey their emotions and feelings through a medium of different proportions. Film, TV, Music and Video Games appear to be at the top of the list when it comes to this. But then along comes someone who is so daft, that they decide to create a 'simulator' game on the most unimaginative thing possible. Grass.Funny one, I thought it was actually about Grass for a moment there! Wait, is it?Not exactly. You play as some sort of antagonist, poised to destroy every Cow on the face of the Earth. (It makes a whole lot more sense when you play it yourself trust me) However, there is a mode where you physically play as a blade of grass... AN ACTUAL BLADE OF GRASS.I legitimately spent £5 on this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ what do I do with my life?Well, one thing you can do is sell your cat and your mother to make up for the £5 you unwillingly spent for this pile of toss. Could be worse though, you could of spent full price on the game...Can you recommend any GOOD simulators?Hentai Simulator 2016. Or 9gag. Either one really.			"

												It mostly feels like a cheap knockoff of Garry's Mod, but with small levels and very little things to be done. As far as I'm aware, you can't run out of ammo, you can't get hurt, you can't shoot things that isn't cows (they explode) or targets. And how is it a grass simulator when the grass doesn't grow, do anything or even looks much like grass. Might as well call Team Fortress 2 House Simulator, or Portal Wall Simulator.			"

								Nothing in this game is good. Just a bad gaming experience through and through (Sorry that the critic is not more constructive, but there really is nothing decent in Grass Simulator. Not even creating some funny moments like a Goat Simulator might do). Got it for free and still regret to have played it. Not sure why you would spend 10 bucks on such ****.			"

												I've been trying, really trying to find something good about this game. Unfortunately this hasn't happened. Classic mode: I shot cows. The clipping on the cows is either bad or they take many, many hits to kill. I had no idea if I was hitting them as they continued to ignore me. I shot the cows on the other side of the fence, or tried to as the bullets created holes in the air on the fence. Classic mode makes the grass feel like a sideline. This mode is more Explody-cow-shooting Simulator.Grass mode: where you watch grass textures and tree models get pushed up through the ground just like in real life.Dubstep mode: I'm not entirely certain what the purpose of this mode is. Maybe I just don't get it because I'm not down with the kids and their Skrillex.Range mode: this wouldn't even work for me.Snow mode: again, this wouldn't work. I couldn't move or look around. It's a novelty simluator, but not a good one. However, if I were to give you one good point, its that Alt + F4 works like a charm. "

												A friend bought me this as a gift so I knew it was going to be bad, but I ended up playing for a little while just to try and figure out what the point of it is.I had a strange idea that there may be some competition with neighbouring blades for sunlight or something which (although being absolutely nonsense) would just about justify it's existence, but instead I got to float around a field with invisible barriers as a mystery being for no apparent reason.There are a couple of weapons but all they appear to do is shoot noise that will eventually cause a cow to explode using what looks like the same explosion used on mega bomberman in 1994.Fair play to the developer though because whether people are buying it as a joke or not, people are still buying it and that's about as close to selling fresh air as you can get.

I went outside to look. I was right! It was ♥♥♥♥ing grass! I quickly shut the door and locked it. I don't wanna face those pieces of♥♥♥♥♥♥unarmed. I knew what needed to be done. I went to my closet and opened it. I grabbed my guns and prepared for battle. I unlocked the door and prepared for all out war. I shot into the grass and I was close to killing them all but they brought backup. They send the cows to help them! The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s were too tough for me. I knew I wouldn't last. One of the ♥♥♥♥ers shot me! I knew this was the end. Then I got my thompson and blew those ♥♥♥♥ers away. I went back inside and found the first aid kit.

You don't do anything other then kill cows in a field of grass, and most other modes don't even work, and it's not because of my computer, it's the game my PC runs the game smooth but the game will decide not to work. I recommend getting ORION: Prelude for $1 or 0.49 cents on sale way much better. This game is not worth $5, maybe 0.50 cents at the most.			"

												You know how Goat Simulator started as a joke and then became one of the best games ever?Well, this is kinda like that; except that instead of trying to simulate a goat the Devs tried to simulate the grass really well.To be fair, it is really damn good grass... from a distance. The pure visual experience of this ""game"" is worth checking out when it's on sale. Up close, it's just another basic system of models with ""photographic quality' textures that don't scale well, so you can see all the ugly stretching and pixellation when you take a really close look at the grass at your feet.But the idea here is to stare out over a vast field of grass, so I can forgive the fact that it's not up to the microscope inspection test.It's really not a GOTY candidate, in fact it's nothing special at all. It's one element of the background from just about every other game, which has been taken to the extreme. In a funny, roundabout way, that makes it interesting; although I wouldn't say it's particularly compelling.Would I buy it for $5? Never. For 99c on sale? Maybe. But when you throw in the fact that you can make a profit off of selling the emotes (assuming you craft the badge and don't just try to sell the cards individually), and can easily play the game for an hour and then refund it, what have you got to lose?

												In a lot of games, the game is fine but the community is terrible. Fnaf, Undertale, Minecraft etc. Well this game is the opposite! The game isn't the greatest but everyone who plays it is really nice! First time playing multiplayer: A nice person greets me and says ""welcome to the community"" and taught me some tips. He then proceeded to kill me several times but whatever, he was nice. I wouldn't reccomend this game at full price, but I got it on sale for 74 cents and it was worth it I think. I mean that's cheaper than a McDonalds hamburger!However, one addition would make me play this game much more, and that would be: Everytime you kill a cow in singleplayer, or person in multiplayer, it added one to your score. Then when you were playing with other people you could see there score. And by score I mean it doesn't reset when you leave the game. It's just a score that forever keeps counting. With that addition this game would be worth its full price.			"

												Needs More birds singing in the trees...   The base game could be very Zen relaxing with just a place to sit in the building, a candle,  and a few hours  of recorded bird song.   Otherwise, like most things on steam SecondLife is better...But on Sale, Grass Simulator absolutely lives up to its promise to simulate large fields of grass... with some trees and cows mixed in for good measure.      A workshop with a user toolbox so players could create their own mods would be fun... make some caves, lakes,  waterfalls... let players create their own add ons...  That would be fun... like Second Life does .			"

												I asked myself: what does 'Grass Simulator' mean to me? What would improve in my life if I bought this game? What exactly would happen after I encountered the menacing cows the description for this game entails? What would I do without this game?So I bought it.The only way I can rate this game is with an example. Imagine you're walking in the mall and you come across a shoe store. You see a shoe on display that is ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. One that, without it, your life would be meaningless and overwhelmingly boring. You go inside, further examine the shoe, and find that you want to buy it. You ask the clerk if they have a shoe in stock for your foot size. She comes back with an unfortunate ""no"" to that answer, when you find out that the clerk is a cow. You're not actually in the mall, but in the middle of a field, and the shoe? The shoe is the grass that surrounds your every direction. Your life in this game is brought down to one word: exterminate. It is not a good game and I wish I could exterminate this from my steam library rather than exterminate the cows in this game.All in all: eh.			"

												An amazing game with an amazing name.Look no further if you've already fallen in love with hit titles such as Euro Truck Simulator 2 or Farming Simulator 2017 such as I have. With over 30 hours on this game you already know that this game will leave you breathless.I purchased this game for $0.74 on sale and it has left me with no regret! With over 8 interactive levels and an entire multipalyer mode, there's hours of fun available for you and your friends. It's definitely a game much better with friends but it's great playing it solo as well. This could be the new Minecraft as it shows potential. Clearly it was made by a small dev team that has worked hard on a game that they can be proud of. The music is oustanding with hyper-realistic grass-growing capabilities. When I saw the graphics for the cows all I could say was ""WOW!""Not only are there cows littered throughout the different levels. You can also party out on the Dubstep or Disco maps. There is also a hidden snowman on the Snowy map, if you can find him! There are several guns to pick from which can let you shoot the cows and make them explode. COOL!Aside from the solo mode, the multiplayer is like the new CS:GO. There are over 5 guns to pick from and two teams to choose from on a classic map that never changes, so you can never forget the layout! No more pesky memorization of room names or sniping locations, it's all out in the open from the start.Honestly just look no farther and BUY THIS GAME NOW. If it isn't for the interactive gameplay featuring grass growing whilst you watch, do it to support the developers who have worked so hard.Congratulations to an amazing game and a job well done, to say the least. I plan to play for many more hours.			"

I was diagnosed with brain and prostate cancer. After I discovered this game everything changed. I was offered a management position at Intel. My cancer was succesfully treated, and my depression went away. I am now happily married with 2 beautiful boys. Grass simulator has changed my life. It can change yours as well.			"

												The game Grass Simulator is a well designed and highly addictive shooter. It incorporates highly addictive mechanics from other popular shooters and provides the player with hours of gameplay. It never ceases to amaze as there are many hidden easter eggs and the story is well polished and thought through. In fact you could almost say that this game is perfect in its minimalistic design. It is definitely worth the money and any avid gamer should have this game. It is one that will stand the test of time and will be a staple of our generation. Also...YOU GET TO BLOW UP COWS!

												Personally, I really enjoy Grass Simulator.  Honestly, I don't know what most of the reviewers were expecting- it's a GRASS SIMULATION GAME.  Even so, it actually goes above and beyond just being a grass simulator. Of course there is the grass simulation mode, which is genuinely relaxing with beautiful music and soft, relaxing sound effects. It's perfect for relaxing after a long, stressful day.If you need more excitement, there are several other modes which have everything from dancing disco cows to the ability to shoot things to a snowy exploration level.As a fan of simulation games, I genuinely recommend this game. The devs keep adding new things and it definitely gives you a genuine grass simulation experience.			"

This game has many other features like the 7 levels of graphics that change nothing. This game has enlightened my experience in MOBA's and RTS and MMORPG's as it teaches me stratigies on killing cows who eat my grass even though there is no eating animation; You just beat them with clubs until they blow up and disappear mysteriously. This game has a huge map with invisible borders and force field fences that delflect everythingAll in all this is a great game if you want to troll your friends 15/10			"

												Amazing, I've finally found true happiness.When I first found this game I thought is was about a different type of grass but then I bought it and started to play it and realized even though it wasn't what I thought I still liked it. You know how sometimes things just feel like things are meant to be, like how there are some people you connect with on a deeper level or you have a feeling you are supposed to do something, even if you know it's wrong, that's the feeling I get when I play Grass Simulator. It makes me feel fulfilled in life. I know I shouldn't play it, I know it's wrong, I know what people will think, but it makes me feel so good, I just can't stop playing once I start. I click the play button and I get transported to another world, a world that is full of cows and grass. I think people underestimate this game, once you get to about 20 hours you begin to understand why it is so great, you begin to see the beauty of the game.So, if you like grass, cows, and loud music then buy this game. I hope this helped.			"

												When I become president, I will get this game, and I will invite obama to play with me in a multiplayer match. Obama will love it, since it's like CS:GO but with more grass and bushes. I will then tell obama he doesn't have 60 fps and he will flip out, but since it's grass simulator he'll continue to play. During the match, to get Obama out of the next presidential election, I will glitch under the map and shoot him every time he spawns, causing a major rage and a challenge to golf. I will then bring a golf club to the match, however it will not be a golf club, it will be an RPG and I will shoot him and say, ""lol i didn't need to go under the map that time scrub."" and he will rage at me again and he will quit golf, his favorite video game. With both his favorite games dominated by me, I will then dominate the presidential election because Obama is gone			"

												Grass Simulator takes place back in the 70's where it was common for 'hippies' to try and stand up for their land during an era where it was common for industrialists to turn nature places into buildings and factories that made the business man alot of money. This is a story driven RPG where your choices matter. You play as a character created person trying to keep the land that you grew up in with a group of your friends/foes as a business man by the name of Daniel Davies who owns the multi-billionare corporation: 'Davies Inc' wants to turn the memory rich land into a profitable cookie factory. Its up to you to stop him as you are introduced to the sprawling open world of the land you are trying to protect and the towns surrounding it as you can either stop Davies by gaining power or doing underground illegal work. Either way gives a completely different story with more choices branching out from there. This game also has a heavy focus on weed or as its known 'grass' in the game as every day in the game you have the choice to take the 'grass' and boost your stats but slowly your character is losing its stats and dying or you can choose to not take 'grass' which will leave your character with small stats but will gain immensly as you keep choosing not to take it. Hence the title of this name. Other than the protagonist and the antagonist there are other side characters who are very unique and almost make this game. These characters include Charles Heathbar; your boyfriend or Charlie Heathbar who is your girlfriend (you choose). There is also your best friend Piccolo as you can decide to whether hide his alien identity or keep it public and of course your inside source on 'Davies Inc', Louis Litt. He was easily the best character and made me feel for everyone in the game. Do you know what also made me feel for everything in the game? The beatiful graphics that almost made me feel I was in a real world and of course the sheer scale of this world I was in. It is huge covering the small American towns around you and as you go through the game slowly unlocking the whole of North America and when you complete the mains story you get the endgame of South America where there is promised to be DLC and more quests there. Overall, this game is amazing and is a must play to anyone who has a PC.Pros:+Beautiful Graphics+Story changes every time+Large open world+Amazing characters+Made me feel for the land+Ending made me cryCons:-The story is a little too long with it clocking around 200 hours. But thats just the main story and there are over 9000 side quests.This game shows what happens when you really try to pull of an amazing game and the only con isn't even a con.11/10			"

												Grass Simulator is game, not where you watch grass grow, but where you watch yourself grow, adapt, learn, and mature. You see yourself in infancy, and as you watch the grass grow you become wiser, and older. I feel that grass simulator shows that YOU are the grass, and you are just one grass sapling in a whole field of grass, you grow with the grass, you die with the grass. Grass Simulator is not a game. Its a way of showing the true world, and that you are nothing more than a piece of grass in a field, waiting to be eaten by a cow. Grass Sim is a soulsearch to find your true place in this world.

												Since I was a young child, I was crippled with an allergy to grass. I used to spend my weekends sitting mournfully on my windowsill as my friends played out in the fields.My mother even installed a plastic lawn around our house so I could play without fear of dying, but the experience was too false as the lawn could not simulate the true freedom of a field.Eventually I sunk into depression and decided to commit suicide by playing in the field that my friends had invited me to all those years ago. I did not get far before my body had completely shut down from exposure. Luckily I was found and managed to reach a hospital before the exposure managed to kill me. Upon recovery I was under 24-hour surveillance to ensure I did not go near the field again - a fact that plunged me into depression even further. It was upon the 2nd of April, 2015 that I planned to take my life again where, by luck, I noticed the release of ""Grass Simulator"" on Steam. Fearful it would not match my preconceptions of grass, I bought and installed the game.Grass Simulator provided me a rich and beautiful simulation of how playing in the fields was to my friends and, I daresay, saved my life. So I thank the creator of this game. You have saved my life, but think of how many others you have saved, who have not spoken up. Thank you. Grass Simulator - 10/10			"

												I don't know what all these ungreatful♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bags have wrong with this game. It's epic! You've got exploding cows, epic guns, cocaine mode(aka fast mode) , slo - mo mode, realistic physics, real challanges, scoping in on a pistol, and there are a lot of game types! People are saying the textures are bad? Well, they aren't. They probably put it on the lowest setting so that their $5 computer didn't crap out. Don't listen to these guys. This game is pretty damn cool. I got it for free, but you should buy it. I'd be happy if I spend money on it. I'd feel like I used my money wiseley. This game is worth 10 dollars, and to those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s voting it down and crapping on it, get a better computer and appreciate that the developer made this.

								10/10 Easily the GOTY. If you like watching paint dry, then what in the world are you waiting for? BUY THIS MASTER PIECE!!!!!This game emerges you into a Farmer's paradise. With being able to weild a tommy gun, and shoot at cows that will never die, even if they are in the ground wanting you to put them out of their missery. I mean, for only $8 you could buy 8 double cheese burgers from Mic♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ OR, you could get this game. Cause, God knows this game is WAY more important than eating, am I right? Cause, I know I am. Anyways, if you are short on cash, and have to choose between this and food, starve. You will have hours of enjoyment, along with only like an hour of enjoyment at tops while eating. Plus, you could die from starvation, and be happy that you tried out this God send of a game. Anyways, enough of me blabing, go try it out for yourself, and tell me that it is not the best thing since sliced bread.Oh, BTW, this game is the biggest waiste of money, but WHOCARES, BUY THIS GAME!

								I wanted to make this review short and sweet, but it's hard to stop writing, even when excluding facts that could potentially contaminate an exceptionally well thought-out gaming experience. There's just so much to say.Grass Simulator is, simply put, the best single-player games ever released for the PC. It does so many things right in so many ways that it might be possible to write a thesis on the topic of Grass Simulator compared to other games. What Daniel Davies has created is simply a masterpiece -- a work of art in the genre. Not only does it engage the mind with mysterious happenings, vagaries, and mostly intelligent dialogue, but also captures the senses with a superb visual style made possible by brilliant technology. And once the initial shock of it all wears off and it becomes possible to peel back the polished layers of sight and sound, there is an excellent FPS here. Grass Simulator doesn't do anything particularly new; it doesn't really innovate in many ways. But what it does is set a new height for all other designers of video games to reach. It still isn't exactly perfect, but it's about as close as I've seen.			"

												I love the way this game has evolved in the early access stages, I for one can't wait to see what else this engine had been developed for. Whatever it is, it's bigger than dubtstep cows I am sure.Great early access game. All kinds of intersting fun, check it out if you get the chance... Remember though, the name is a little bit misleading in terms of what to expect as a gamer.			"

								I think it's fair to say everyone who's given this game a negative review simply lacked the depth of mind to understand that this is not a game. This is an experience.In my few short minutes of play time I was exposed to vast open worlds simllar to that of Skyrim or The Forest, I could roam frozen wastelands and green pastures alike in my search to find Cow Jesus and bring him back to the light.After Cow Jesus ascended back to Cow Heaven during Dubstep Mode, I took it upon myself to be the next saviour of cowkind and seek out someone who could take up his mantle. I encountered many cows with powers in my travels, but they were simply unwilling to become a saviour like the great Cow Jesus was. Infuriated, I opened fire on the cows with my arsenal of firearms and was struck down by Cow Jesus. I was thrown several meteres into the air and died. However, I was forgiven by Cow Jesus, for he is a great and merciful God, although he was unwilling to save my shattered legs, causing me to trip every few steps as I continued my search for a cow who could lead all other cows to salvation. I walked across water, scaled the highest mountains and even slowed down time during my quest.Perhaps you will succeed where I have failed. Perhaps you will succeed in the lastest mode, the mode they call ""Oh Lord"". I was weak and unable to finish the quest, and fell to the deepest depths of Cow Hell where I saw the holy trinity of Cow God, Cow Jesus and The Holy Cow mocking me from their sanctuary in the sky.I pray you will not be put off by all the negative reviews and will take up my quest so that Cow Jesus can rise once again in Dubstep mode.Cow God speed my son.11/10			"

								....aaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!*screeching static noise as portal rips through space-time and hurls me back into my computer chair*OOOF!...hoo....*heavy breathing*....huh?!  AM I BACK?!  IS IT OVER?!I am...I think...my first vision after coming back was exactly as I suspected:  a Steam window asking me to write a review of Grass Simulator, AN EXPERIENCE I CAN ONLY BRIEFLY DESCRIBE AS TRANSCENDENTALThere I was, in Dubstep mode, scratching my head and wondering if I could come up with an even lazier method for acquiring quick cocaine cash than the developer, when one of the tiny dancing cows turned to me and spoke my name, but not in a language of this world......it felt like a thousand cockroaches had scurried up my spine and escaped out of the hairs on the back of my neck...A small black dot then appeared at the center of my screen and began expanding more rapidly than I could realize that this was not happening in the game.The blackness enveloped me on all sides.  It felt like the blackness had then started to infiltrate my mind. The universe spun and any attempts at rationalizing what was happening just led to a combination of worsening confusion and schizophrenic popping noises in my brain like all the pneumatic and hydraulic fittings connecting my neurons were bursting.  An overwhelming vibrating nausea seemed to take over every organ in my body and the urge to expel this violent soup inside me was unbearable.  Something was taking control and it was not about to let me protest.  I felt like I was being...stirred...I can't describe how long I endured this.  I could fathom eternity because I had no grasp of anything else.  My bones felt like uranium and my senses had eventually vanished.  My conscience had become a singularity that I could somehow gaze into but would recoil away from in horror.  When I somehow put some comfortable distance between me and my own conscience, a voice spoke to me in inhaled, reversed gasping whispers.  It felt like a language that only I could understand and seemed like was being conceived and conducted on the fly just for me.  The ethereal fingers of the voice articulated its message in what felt like a maddening thousand years for me to decipher:""Eight dollars ninety-nine.  Now don't you feel silly?  Go now, and warn the others.""Here I sit now where the Sun's warmth through my window feels like I've been thawed out of a glacier.  Where the distant boom-boom-PSSHT of my neighbor's awful hip hop sounds like a symphony that took a lifetime to compose.  Where the crumbs at the bottom of my bag of Cheetos taste like nourishment that could cure all the world's hunger.  Where typing on this keyboard feels like I'm speaking to the world for the very first time.Where knowledge is abundant, and love is all that really matters.So do it, dear reader.  Buy Grass Simulator, endure it to the demise and violent reimagining of your being, and then find some reason to care again.  Feel inescapable loss and then rapturous triumph.  Eat some fruit.  Hug your mother.  Wash your damn car.  Man up and ask that girl out already.  Try to pretend that this life means something because now you understand what nothing is.LIVE MY NIGHTMARE, BECOME GOD, AND THEN TELL THE UNIVERSE TO GO ♥♥♥♥ ITSELF			"

								I was once like you. An avid Steam user, always checking out the latest and greatest of titles. Then I stumbled upon a game, known as Grass Simulator. Being in the 2012 ""YOLO"" mode, I said ""♥♥♥♥ it"" and bought the game. My life changed forever. I witnessed many things in Grass SImulator; what is seen cannot be unseen. I saw cows, ravaging the land, houses in the woods, and even a firing range. But truly the most interesting thing to behold was the Dubstep Cow. A rare mythical beast, I stumbled upon while making my journey through the Grasslands. This beast had charmed hundreds, if not thousands of other cows to do its bidding, and I knew I had to put an end to it. Holding my fists up high, I charged in, and as my fist collided with the cow it exploded into a burst of light. I thought the battle was over; I was wrong. Deep inside I felt the beat, my heart racing to the rhythm. The demon had fled inside me, and now I could not get the drone of Dubstep out. Before I could react my mind was thrust away, and I lost control of my body. I could simply watch through dead eyes as my corpse was lifted up high, and the sounds of dubstep shrieked out of me. I spent 5 years wandering the globe with the cow. We invaded city and country; home and land, and soon had an unstoppable force of slaves from every species. We came across a sattelite used to send sounds into deep space. Since that day the cow is in control of most of the Milky Way and parts of Andromeda. This is my, nay, our life.If I had the choice to buy this game again? Hell yeah. For the first 15 minutes it was great, until it, you know, destroyed humanity.			"

Games offer some sort of enjoyment to the human being interacting with them.  There is no redeeming qualities for this title.  Save your money, and if someone gifts it to you, return it to them.  The ""game"" Air Control is better than this.  I would rather step in cat feces than have this in my library.  If you have a steam friend, and this game is in their library with more than a few hours of game play, I would advise removing them from your list, and even blocking them entirely.			"

And the game runs great at the lowest graphics option (which honestly is pretty much the same as the highest graphics option.)• Guns on singleplayer have unlimited ammo yet still have a reload animation• Cool environments.• Next-gen physics• Multiplayer is fun• Hands down the best grass simulation game on the marketNegatives:• Occasional graphical glitches• Cows can't be killed on multiplayer• There's no real point to some game modesOverall I give it 8/10 highly recommended.

Product received for free
												I saw a group for this game while in development stating that a giveaway of keys would take place on we had enough members or something. I joined up because the premise was silly as hell. With all of the ""simulation"" genre taking off, it appeared a good goof was in order. That's what this game is, an elaborate joke that will cost other people money to be in on it. I know other simulators were around that goofed (Surgeon Sim, Goat Sim) and were great to play. This game was limited in scope and touted the ""best"" level as a bunch of cows spinning and flying to dubstep.Have there been updates? Yes. Not many, not a lot of content aside from different dubstep and tree textures. Is this a game? No. You can't add a gun and leave out story/objective and be a game.Is it a simulator? I'd say yes, if the mechanic was really a zen environment where you sat around as grass and blew in the wind, like a paid for screensaver/sound machine. Is it fun? No. Shooting cows with limited ammo and watching them explode on death is a lot like adding god mode to a game and skipping cutscenes and dialogue. There is no fun to be had when the fun is limited to ""stand still, listen to dubstep, shoot exploding cows if you feel like it, whatever. we don't care.""I would recommend buying this for a gag gift, but you'd probably have more fun with a fake lottery ticket.
