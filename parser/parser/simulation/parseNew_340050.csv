												This game is honestly very good.  You're easily getting a game worth more than the $5 you're paying for it.  What I like about this game is being able to individually control all of your people, giving them jobs, equipping them, etc..  Your man power actually matters in this game instead of them feeling like dead weight like they did in State of Decay.  In SoD you pretty much had to do everything yourself as the player.  In this game, you actually have to delegate orders to ALL of your community members unless you want to run back and forth hauling boards and chicken wire a few at a time.  Your community actually feels like, a, well, community.  It's not unlike in SoD where you radio in for someone to come grab stuff while being arbitrarily limited by the game.  It's the same principle, but a very different execution.  Whereas SoD focuses more on exploration and beating up zombies, Survivalist focuses more on the town building.You get this game for the awesome town and community building aspect.  If you want to run around slaughtering zombies, there are better alternatives, like State of Decay, because that is not the object of this game.			"

												This isn't so much a review as a letter of appreciation for the developer. I feel guilty I only paid $5 dollars for this game. If you decide to crowd-fund your next game, please make note of it on your blog so people can donate.  I have gotten an immense amount of fun out of Survivalist, far beyond its actual retail price. I've tried to figure out why this game was so addictive for me, and I think it comes down to a combination of the post-apocalyptic setting, the crafting and community building element, the exploration system, and the strategy and foresight required to reach the end of the game. If these elements appeal to you individually, the combination of them will bring you many days of fun.There were bad times though. The first few hours, I derisively referred to this game as Insulin Quest.  Watching my team split up and run off in four different directions because I was walking to close to a the edge of a cliff was a serious, recurring frustration. I became more afraid of slight elevations than I was of White Strain infected. I also did not like that human-on-human violence played such a big, hard-wired role in the game.But nonetheless I couldn't put the game down until I had beaten it and replayed it, and I can't recommend it enough to anyone who appreciates those good qualities I have described.

												This game is GREAT! I have no idea why Steam keep pushing Early Access scams on my front page, when there are brilliant games like this already available. I had never heard of it. I also always wanted to play a Action-RPG/RTS Hybrid with Base Building... this scratched the itch with its zombified claws.--INTRODUCING you to Survivalist. One of the few Indie titles that really lives up to its screenshots and descriptions, this can easily get you hooked for hours.Play as you like: be the careless, selfish, evil badass people like to think you are, be the paragon savior of the land, or decide for yourself who deserves to keep breathing in a world where trust is the best currency.Do you seek Money, Power or Love?GRAPHICS and AUDIO are good and more than enough for what the game was trying to accomplish.CONTROLS are simple: WASD to move, right-click to aim and swipe mouse horizontally or vertically to change target or change aim (legs/body/head), left-click to fire/use/select, mouse-wheel to select dialogue options.Pressing Control will enable Command Mode, in which you can give orders or assign job (or roles) to your characters.You can also press F to pause, or G to Fast-Forward up to 4x speed.From F1 to F4 you can select the menus (Inventory/Community/Quests/Map screens). Therefore, no need for crazy hand-dancing when equipping your 5 new recruits!COMBAT is also simple and straightforward. Almost all ZOMBIES are fast-moving, and there are different zombies strains, which means each strain is stronger than the other. You'd be smart to adapt yourself and your squad when fighting weaker enemies to preserve ammo, or stronger enemies to prevent instant deaths if bitten. Also, remember to bring some antigen (""antidote"") and bandages!Against LOOTERS (or human opponents in general), not being able to command your people tactically can make combat against well-armed looters rather hard and chaotic if you're not geared up properly - so get your squad some bulletproof vests before attempting some post-apocalyptic genocide! Still, with a little thinking, you can get through anything, and it feels great when you clear an enemy base with no one hurt.ROLE PLAYING: Your actions will change the opinions of those around you (or your whole community views of you, or the whole city you're in, or the whole region). This can make it easier or harder for you to recruit and convince people. You can also give gifts to the characters to make them like you, or perform shakedowns to keep them in check and to show who's boss.BASE BUILDING: Give a man a hammer, and he'll build you Walls and Concrete Watchtowers for a lifetime.Defend your base perimiter with Wooden and Wire walls and gates, build wooden or concrete watchtowers and pillboxes to make your enemies think three times before trying to molotov your base to the ground!You'll also need to provide housing, outhouses, food and water to your people.MICROMANAGING your community member's gear is necessary, but should only take a minute for every member you recruit for the different roles. Some roles the members can take, like Farming and Guarding, doesn't need micromanagement. Farmers will water the plants, harvest, and plant as necessary. Guards will enter any available towers - your guards will keep cycling locations at every ""shift"", which looks really cool and natural.The Collector (Bring Materials to Base) and Builder roles will need to have orders assigned. For the Collector, you tell which building he should go to, and which item he should bring from there.NOTE: I don't know if characters pick up ammo from the base on their own, but the only time someone had low ammo was a guy collecting wood on his own and walked through a pack of 6 zombies - which I should have made him avoid.As far as BUGS go, being halfway through the game and halfway through the map, I haven't found any. CONCLUSION: Definitely try the demo. And if you like it, then buy it, and spam the forums begging for a sequel.PERSONAL NOTE: This is one of the very rare occasions, within our current market, in which a game not only delivers what it promises, but costs (criminally) less than it should. It's less promoted than more expensive ""indie"" (kickstarted) games who were abandoned by the developers (yet are still available on Steam and being put on sale). I have bought 60USD Triple-A incomplete and bug-ridden titles, and this game made (apparently) by a single guy on his spare time gave me way more fun than a lot of games I've purchased these last few years.With more complexity and depth, a sequel could take the market by storm.Thanks for reading, I hope I helped in some way!--BONUS PROTIP: Change your Quick Save key to F5 [or other key]. I was forced to murder a whole innocent town because I acidentally pressed Quick Save twice and it overwrote Auto Save slots. Save often to avoid making dumb mistakes like me :)			"

												The game offers pretty much all it advertised, something I thought rather rare for a 5 € game.You're pretty much thrown into the post-apocalyptic world unawares, unequipped, climbing out of your Vault (where have I seen this before?) and completely unprepared for the horrors outside. Thankfully, the game's first tutorial run provides an easy crash course into the game world and mechanics, first strolling you thru combat, party interactions, building bases and trading and so forth.You'll soon be on your way to building your own post-apo settlement to your own whims, within certain limitations. In addition to your zombie neighbours (colour-coded for your convenience), you'll be setting up diplomatic relations with other settlements in the neighbourhood, with various shantytown or lone survivors out in the boons.What I did like about the game world was the surprising outcomes and twists in quests- instead of plain boring fetch quests, you can sometimes blunder right into a moral dilemma that needs to be solved on the spot, usually either resulting in placating hostiles, or turning previously friendly forces into hostiles, or score some extra loot or survivors for your settlement.So, I was somewhat pleasantly surprised when I was tasked with 'wiping out Looters' (the staple of the post-apocalyptic quest world), and instead of brutally gunning everybody down, I was given the choice of sparing a survivor of the group, recruiting them for my cause, instead of persisting in the silly tradition of game foes have of fighting to the death, even against unwinnable odds.Another time, I was sent to kill looters who stole food from a settlement- only to find out the truth to the matter was not all black and white, as the quest giver had originally let on.Overall, the game is no State of Decay, Dead State, Rebuild: Gangs of Deadsville or Project Zomboid, but it has it's moments- the combat mechanics tend to be very twitchy, with split seconds to open fire on the Infected, as they barrel down on you from the desert with a hankering for survivor flesh. The infection mechanic is pretty simple- you get bit, you gotta get an antidote. Different strains of the disease have different germination times, with the worse strains taking down the host in minutes, requiring survivors to have the proper antidote at hand, or succumb to the disease themselves. Ammo is usually pretty abundant, and you even score 10.000 pistol rounds in the first hour of the game, so you are unlikely to run out of ammo for the basic shooter during your first days. By day 5, I had enough ammo to spare, equipping most of my resource mules with shotguns, my main character with a automatic rifle and farmers and builders with pistols.Instead of bottlecaps, food and water, your main currency in the wasteland is gold, which is surprisingly abundant in spite of the whole apocalyptic scenario. I found this somewhat funny that while the game makes it clear that paper money is worthless, the concept that the new economy would be based on a non-essential luxury item is kind of a strange notion. Still, it's no a big deal- you'll end up doing more barter than plain gold trading most of the time, anyway.So, to summarize:PROS:+ Freebuild of your own settlement, within some limitations+ Additional diplomacy and unexpected realism with some sidequests, moral dilemmas+ Game's difficult, but does not punish you horribly+ You can delegate resource fetching, farming, building+ Survivor AI is not completely helpless if left to their own devices. Pathfinding is decent.CONS:- The minimap and survivor topdown view are much too close, even on 1920x1080 resolution, giving the game a 640-x480 look.- Sometimes survivor messages on the right zoom past at astounding speeds, and you miss whatever tooltip or notice was in question.- Your survivors are practically blind, barely able to see ten feet in any given direction, so they'll constantly get bushwhacked by super-fast, feral zombies until the route is cleared with buckshot, which brings me to...- Fast undead. Combat is arcade-y, twitchy, sometimes almost Press 'X' not to die.- Survivor animations on walk and run are a bit wonky.- Molotov aiming is a game of chance.- Some of the music tracks are really tiring. Others, not so bad.Still, for five bucks, this game is not a bad investment, and probably a good diversion to anyone else who enjoys zombies and town management mixes.			"

Posted: February 26, 2015
												The game has all the content to be a great survival game - scavenging, base constructing, farming, item crafting, diplomacy, trading... unfortunately it suffers from a terrible lack of balance that completely breaks realism.First, the zombies aren't actually 'fast zombies', they are 'olympic runner zombies'. They will charge you from beyond your seeing distance at the speed of a cheetah and then lunge at you from 3 meters away to tackle you. Combat is just 'dodge - shoot - dodge - shoot' until your enemies are dead. There's no room for strategy/tactics or even a little bit of thinking. It isn't difficult, but it lacks depth and quickly becomes uninteresting. And in case you're wondering, there's no stealth mechanic so zombies always aggro you before you can see them, no way around this.The shooting mechanics are also frustrating - guns are very inaccurate even at close range. The characters could miss the side of a barn at 10 feet, literally. And since zombies have quite a bit of health, you'll empty a few clips to kill them. If you wait without moving long enough, you can make a perfectly accurate shot but this rarely happens since you're fighting marathon runner zombies. The time it takes to aim a perfect shot at 3 feet is way too long anyway to be realistic.Then there's ammo - there's too much of it lying around to be realistic or to feel like you're struggling to scavenge for supplies. Out of bullets? Just search the nearest house or car and I guarantee you'll find enough to kill a few zombies. Yes, since guns are so inaccurate it's a good thing there's lots of ammo, but why not just make guns more accurate and give the player less ammo? At least it would feel realistic and like you're actually in a post-apocalyptic world were supplies are scarce. Right now it feels like the entire US Air Force airdropped all their ammo reserves over the game map.Next problem is the inventory size. Characters can't carry a lot of stuff without backpacks so scavenging runs are very unproductive. The ammo you need to carry with you also takes up a lot of inventory room even if you just carry enough at once to kill 5 zombies. This isn't a problem when you have backpacks, but it can take time to find them. And by the way, you NEED a backpack if you want a character to do any construction. Construction requires you to carry a heavy toolbox + construction materials, you can't just drop the materials at the construction site and then come back with the tools to complete the job. Without a backpack, most characters don't have enough inventory room to build anything. That means when you leave someone at base to build stuff, that's one less backpack you can give your guys going out to find supplies. It also means the first backpack you find won't help you scavenge because building barricades will be more important at that point, so you'll have to keep looking for another one if you want your scavenging runs to actually become productive.Then there's the time lapse. The days just go by too fast. Your characters have to regularly eat, drink, sleep and some have medical conditions that require taking meds like diabetes/insulin. So whenever I speak to an NPC, I feel like I'm wasting precious time. Seriously, a 2 minute conversation feels like a terrible, unproductive waste of time. I never ask NPCs about their backstory, I only use dialogue for quests or trading. And when I speak to an NPC, I just quickly fly over the dialogue.And with time flying by so fast, well you need to get food and meds quickly. Your characters will eat them up almost faster than you can get them, especially the meds. Just like with combat, there's no time to think or plan, you have to keep moving.This isn't a survival game, it's a fast-paced arcade game with survival elements. And it's a shame, because it could be an awesome survival game just by modifying a few variables.Sure, it's only five bucks. But then again, it's a game I quickly gave up playing with no intention of playing it again. It's a game I want to enjoy, but it needs modifications to be an actual survival game and less of an arcade game. Right now it feels like the devs just had no idea how to balance difficulty properly in a game, so they made zombies sprint, they made your guns less accurate than a nerf gun, and then they gave you thousands of ammo lying around everywhere to make sure you wouldn't run out.Would sure be nice if they fixed this or at least provided a minimum of mod support. It's just stupid how close this came to being a really great game in it's genre, yet failed completely.			"

												Easily one of my favorite games on Steam and totally worth the 5€ (if not way more). Looks cheap and stupid, but gives you tons of playtime and finally a great mix of story, survival, sandbox and RPG. All in all it's kept simple, which is more than ok considering the price and being an Indie, but that doesn't make the fun smaller. If I would compare it to another game, than State of Decay (which I love,too). Survivalist is simpler, top down, weak graphics, less items, less challenging and a smaller world, but gives you a story with choices to make and more ""open world"" feeling, survival gets more important and finally you not just can control everyone, but also form groups and give your community members jobs to do (farming, guarding, supply runs, building...or just control several groups via strategy mode or by switching through the groups). And ofc there is building. Not just ""This is ma base, I build a kitchen here"", but building up a base you like. You start with a single bunker and then you can add shacks, barns, wells, farming ground, walls and several defense buildings whereever you want.From time to time zombies or looters attack your base, so you have to organize a defense. But not all looters need to be killed. Some group of looters you can find will threaten you, but there are some ways to avoid fighting and even recruit them. Socializing is an important part in the game, although generally kept simple. The creativity to solve quests sometimes reminded me of fallout (for example !SPOILER! there will be a quest killing a gay couple. You can either just kill em, talk with them, kill the person that gave you the job, just lay down the quest and lose the chance to get some extra insulin...or not? You can actually lay down the quest and then rob the quest giver for the key to the insulin, and if you do it right, you won't even get the revenge for robbing here)So yeah..blablabla yada yada yadaBuy game, game great.

Survivalist ReviewWhen I was first asked to do a review for Survivalist, I admit that my expectations were a bit low due to the old-school graphics and the relatively low price on an indie game developed and published by a single individual I hadn't heard of before. Being a veteran of survival, RPG, and all types of strategy games in general I still intended to give a fair review based on the game's content. Twenty minutes into the game all i could say was ""Wow!"" This game is amazing and so much fun. It masterfully mixes Survival, RPG, RTS, and Action elements into a highly addictive adventure that will entertain you for numerous hours and even at full price I strongly recommend this game to fans of all these genres. Not convinced? Then read on...In Survivalist the ultimate goal is obviously to survive yet another zombie apocalypse. Except that these zombies offer a greater challenge than typical survival games. The infection has multiple strains with varying effects and incubational periods before turning into a zombie yourself. Each will require an antigen specific for that particular type. Another difference is that these zombies are incredibly fast and agile. Don't expect to outrun them. In this game its fight or die. Surviving will ultimately depend on building a strong community of people working together. You will need to build a strong base able to defend against attacks. It will also need to provide other basic basic needs to survivors like clean drinking water, fresh crops of food, shelter and hygiene. This will require you to recruit people with varying skills, gather an assortment of building materials, and collect items that can be useful. There are many NPC's in the game and most of them can be pursuaded in different ways to join your community. Players can use gifts, perform tasks, or even strong-arm characters into joining. There are countless possibilites based on dialogue and other decisions made over the course of the game. Its really nice how all choices have consequences. And, don't be fooled. Not everybody you encounter is a friendly face ready to welcome you with open arms. There are other survivor communities and bands of looters scattered across the map with their own needs in mind.Members of your community can be assigned to perform different jobs either by direct control or by using the command feature which will enable you to avoid the hassles of micromanagement. Individuals have a handful of stats that level up through use of that particular skill. They are affected by respect and approval ratings even after being recruited so they can decide to leave your community if they become unhappy with your leadership skills. These are just some of the many challenges that this game offers.The Good:=======+  Solid story and quality content+  Numerous options and variety of choices+  Entirely sandbox and open (aside from the tutorial)+  UI is easy to use+  Good quality graphics+  Sound quality+  Rotating camera+  Full controller support+  High replay value+  Realistic concepts+  Variable speed settings+  Stability (lack of bugs and crashes)+  Low requirements/runs well on older machines+  Steam Achievements+  Developer friendly and active in communityThe Bad:======-  No option to turn tutorial hints off-  No ambient sounds in background-  No useful vehicles or items for transporting resources-  Crafting is minimal (somewhat abandoned concept?)-  Could be multiplayer or co-op?Final Thoughts:===========Survivalist is definitely one of those games Steam users won't want to miss. I strongly recommend picking this game up if you're a fan of Survival, RPG, RTS, or Action  games and the price is unbeatable for the content you receive. Forget about the fact that its made by one person on a low budget rather than by an entire development team with studio backing. This game can easily compare to big name titles like State of Decay and hold its own. Yes, the game is that good.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												This game costs only £4, but it contains hours of fun for those who want to enjoy a zombie apocolypse game where you build your own community.I adore this game. The choices you make can define how your gameplay is, such as: Should I recruit this group of five to my community? They could be used for guarding, farming or constructing buildings, but they also need to be fed which can drain my supplies and risk my other survivors' lives if they venture out to get more food for them.I am very impressed by this game, considering that it costs such a small price is a big surprise for the quality of it. I wish we could see more games like these more and State of Decay. I adore a game where you build a community during an apocolypse or other circumstances. The only cons I would say about this game is that the camera angle and this 'fog of war' that limits your visibility to such a small sight, by the time you've seen a group of infected and raised your gun, they're already on top of you and infecting you. I have had this happen quite often, which is an annoyance. The other con would be the unecessarily fast zombies in this game, there is nothing that has annoyed me more than having one of my runners ambushed by a group of infected and then constantly caught by them when they try to outrun them, eventually they either get caught and bitten due to the poor fatigue that takes a long time to improve or they waste all their ammo on shooting them whilst moving, which is irritating due to the poor accuracy when moving even when a survivor is right in front of them.Overall, there are improvements to be made, but this game at the current moment is great in my opinion.

												I recommend this game. It was $5!  It's honestly worth $30 easy. Survivalist:This is one of the best zombie games I have played in years...  I know there are others LIKE it, but not with this much in it. I have been looking for a new zombie game and lucky for me, there was a demo. I got the demo, played it, then payed for the game instantly.  The demo was good but the game has so much more to offer.Little did I know there was this much packed into in this one game. PROS:- low price - high entertainment value- i don't need a rockin 8 gb (of RAM), a $400.00 video card, and or 15 gigs of harddrive(ROM) space to play- the download/install is short and quick- no tick, no glitch, no crashing... at all... ever... - a sandbox frame- the camera view and controls are good (360 view)- zombies (vary from slow/easy to ""Lost my brains!"")- zombie attacks are scary and get my blood pumping- the chance to contract a virus and not end the game - plenty of guns and of ammo- the ability to build a base (however I want to build it)- the ability to build a dynamic community of people, of whom I chose- the ability to make my community self-sufficiant(sp?)- a realistic level system to advance each member of my community - plenty of quests that all have a start, finish, and reward, etc...- the ability to SAVE my game (thank you sooo much for that)- replay factor is greatCONS:- graphics are a bit lacking, however after playing for a few min this is not a problem, AND it I think it keeps the gameplay smooth for all kinds of computers- the soundtrack is absent and this can make or break any game, however I think the quietness and just ambient noises set the realism up to a higher level, in a good way... listening for brain-snackersOn a scale of 1 to 10, 1 = bad, waste of time and money10 = great, best entertainment money ever spentI give it a 9. Fantastic job! Hope to see more from them in the future! I WILL buy the next game they release if any in the future. "

												TL;DR: A surprisingly deep, yet inexpensive, game that covers a lot of ground left undisturbed by many titles in the survival genre. I highly recommend it!Survivalist has a lot of things going against it, to be honest. It's one of a plethora of titles in the survival genre, it employs a very basic graphics package, and it's developed by a relatively small shop, just to name a few. That said, in my opinion it far surpasses so many of its peers in so many ways. Here's my short list of exactly how it does it:- Choices matter. Virtually everything you do has consequences, including your interactions with the environment, your community (i.e. the survivors who join you) and NPCs. These consequences do have some remedies, but they take work to get around.- There's a lot of quests/missions. In my playthrough, almost nothing has to be done in a particular sequence, in that you can put things on hold if you like and do your own sandbox thing for a while.- Strategy AND tactics. You can choose the RTS controls for some overarching activity, and then take control of a particular character to make sure something is done the way you want it. Perfect for your micromanaging streak while allowing you accomplish a lot of the mundane stuff without pulling your hair out.- Scavenging. The map is full of useful stuff, and you get to choose how to use it, particularly when it comes to building your base.- Replay value. This relates strongly to the first point dealing with choices, but because almost everything can pivot the game in at least a small way, things can be very different depending on what you choose.- Performance. My machine is definitely middle-of-the-pack, but it has no issue running this game with several different background apps.- Active development. The developers just released a major patch today that implements online co-op, and they've been regular about updates and bug fixes since launch.There are some things to be aware of that some people won't find that attractive. - The graphics are very basic, but it's by design. - The crafting system is rudimentary, but you also don't have to pull your hair out putting things together. - Music gets a bit repetitive.Seriously, for the money, it's going to be very difficult to get a game that rivals all you can enjoy here. Really well done!			"

												Survivalist is the single greatest zombie survival game there is at the time of writing; and it is also the game that has SURPRISED me the most in my entire life. On the outside, or during the first 15 minutes of the game, you'll be taken aback by the hilariously ill-fitting music, the goofy character models, and the almost robotic animations. But anyone who has played the game for more than an hour or two will tell you that the game is so much more than that.There are a lot of things that this game excels at, and things that it does as good as (or better than) any other game in the genre.1. COMPLETE CONTROL: Nobody is invincible, and you can choose the fate of absolutely anyone in the game.2. OPEN WORLD: The open world is massive and is full of people and places to trade and loot.3. COMMUNITY: The game handles building your community extremely well, and you can manage everything that goes on behind your gates, such as assigning roles in the community.4. WELL WRITTEN: The story is full of twists and turns, some deliberately predictable, others that will actually make your jaw drop. (Those who've played the love ending know what I'm talking about...)5. COMBAT: While extremely simple, combat in this game is excellent and always feels brutal. Every hit counts, enemies die quickly and so do you. Bring a bulletproof vest...6. IT'S TERRIFYING: Running out of supplies is a death sentence, and being bitten and not having any cure is a stressful experience, and early on without good equipment, A LOT of people will die unless precautions are taken. Venturing into unknown territory is a massive risk/reward as well. It's scarier than most horror games out there!7. IT IS SO MUCH FUN!: I know this one's cheating a bit, but honestly, risk can pay off, and when it does, it's a glorious feeling, and I know that anyone who can be bothered to play the game for more than an hour will realise that this game is both deep and detailed.Also, if you've enjoyed the game, please take the time to go on the discussions page and thank Bob, the maker of this game. He has put in so much effort into making this game amazing, and he deserves all the praise he gets.In all honesty, I would pay £30 for this game. There is so much in the game to do for such a low price. Enjoy the game, it's absolutely marvellous!GOTY 2015			"

												Actually a surprisingly entertaining game, chose to go ahead and purchase this on steam since i had a few extra bucks and it sounded interesting but i didnt expect much and at first it didnt seem like much, bleak boring desert (for the love of god devs, gtfo of the desert) But when you get into the game it becomes an interesting management game where you loot and clear towns, fighting off looters and zombie waves, So i decided i liked the game and worked on it for a bit, got to a certain point and realized the error of my ways so i did a new game. I read someone saying its a linear game, with little open world aspects, well they are wrong to put it nicely, instead of helping alice you can just walk up and blow her head off and go kill everyone else you see if thats what tickles your pickle, but personally i liked finding a few good guys, getting their skills up then hunting down raiders and forcing them into my group.End of the day its a great game that seems very underrated, you can buy it on the xbox360 aswell, which i did just to support the devsHope yall make a survivalist 2....please call it something else, its a damn impossible name to search online.

												This is like an indie version of State of Decay, it's very well made and is probably one of the most underplayed indie games on steam.    It has all the elements of a good game, good story, good game play, lots of action, though choices, etc.   You basically have to start your own community and scavange other abandoned towns for supplies.   A lot of people complain about finding insulin for one of your community members however at day 40 of the game when I completed it I still had 11 or some to spare, so there is definitely enough in the game.   The game will make you make tough choices to find insulin in it, which is why there is the need for it.   If you don't play it the right way and let the person die that needs it, you will not get the full experience of the game, so make sure you play it right.   You will interact with other communities, you'll have to make some difficult decisions with them.   A lot of decisions you make can have unintended consequences, so choose wisely.If only the people who made day z would hire this developer, they might actually be able to finish their game ;)			"

												Great game concept. Author managed to get together elements of RTS, RPG and survival games to create well balanced and very pleasant game experience. You build a base and run (very basic) agriculture, scavenge supplies, explore the world and fill quests, developing your character. And, of course, fight zombies. Or other survivors. There are several shortcomings in each of these areas - low budget really shows - but game gave me (and I believe it will give to any old school RPG positive player) tens of hours of entertainment. Definitely must buy for a price and I will be definitely on lookout for more games from this author (Survivalist 2?).			"

												I will have to preface this review with this one line:  This is literally the first game in over 2 years I am excited to come home and play.  Survivalist is an RPG/RTS hybrid, with sandbox elements baked in.  You start off as Joe, a financial hedge fund manager who has no practical skills and a boatload of worthless money, who lives in a 3x3 meter concrete bunker.  As you start, the game takes you through its tutorial phase, and I found it to be a quite easy to understand.  It covers most, if not all you need to learn about the game.  In about 1-2 hours you will learn how to build your base, scavenge for loot, and shoot zombies in style. However, this game shows its detail even in the tutorial, as you can completely skip it, and the game will remember this and assume you know the game, giving you full control over all functions.  It will also remember that you didn't get a certain community member and have certain events unfold!  But this is only the beginning of the game.  From there, you can quest by yourself or with a posse, forgo exploration and build your base and community, or build relations with not only the friendly communities but also the various looter or highwaymen gangs.  I found it a nice touch to be able to recruit what you would expect to be basic ""bad guys"", and then find out they have personality, and some even have their own story lines!  The quests range from difficult and strategic, mysteries to solve, or easy and borish... but expect the unexpected.  Much like real life, don't take all you hear at face value.  And this is, in my opinion, one of the strongest suits of the game.  Not only do you have multiple approaches to quests, but you'll quickly find out that not all quests are good for you.  I will also note here that the story, or main quest line, is really, really good.  I honestly haven't been engaged in a games story for many years, and this short story for some reason has me coming back for more.  The base building is in the basic RTS style.  You can set your community members out to gather resources, then have some other community members build various structures, while others do your farming, guarding, and exploring.  There aren't too many structures to build, but there is enough variety to work with.  However, the main break away from RTS style games is that your gatherer can also be your builder, soldier, explorer, farmer, doctor, or guard.  However, for veteran RTS players, the controls in Command mode(The RTS mode) are not as extensive as other RTS games. Combat in this game is simplistic, yet I found it quite fun.  Depending on your firearms skill, you can aim at the torso, legs, or head.  Aiming is heavily based on the firearms skill, with no stars in the skill meaning you cannot hit the broad side of a highway sign, to 5 stars where you can head shot all day long and rarely miss a shot.  The enemies you fight are not the slow type of zombie, these are the ""Warp 9 engage!"" zombies that can run down a galloping horse on speed.  Seriously, Aim for the legs!  I found this to be a fun, arcade-y style of combat, with reaction time being paramount between being zombie chow or using its skull for a cup.  However, even if they do get ahold of you, don't fret: you can give 'em a swift kick to get them off you.  This will use up your fatigue meter, which is based off of fitness.  Again, no stars = you can kick them off a couple times to 5 stars where you can go all Neo in the matrix, tossing them off repeatedly.  However, there are stronger zombies out there that will require more, if not all your strength to throw off.  The graphics aren't anything to write home about, but I did find them more than passable. For the most part they didn't break me away from the game in any form.  That said... the walking animation is not the greatest, and the sidestep animation reminds me of MC Hammer.  You can't touch this!  The soundtrack has a couple of good tunes in it, but to sum up: ""Its good, but not great""  The controls I found to be spot on, and I could always get my character to do what I wanted, when I wanted.  In summery, I love this game.  I imagine I will be playing this for at least another 50 hours, and I spent a whoppin' 5 bucks on it.  I've gotten more enjoyment out of this game than most AAA stuff out there.  And if you are on the fence, you can even download the demo and try it yourself for free.  PS:  This game was made by one guy.  ONE.  Cudos to you, Bob, and thank you for producing a quality FULL game for an amazing price!			"

												First of all I want to say… this game was just not for me, and so to people who know my likes well and have similar tastes, I would not recommend it. However, I can appreciate that although it may not be for me, it is actually a fairly good game and people who don’t have the same miffs with it that I do might really enjoy it (and actually have).That said, let’s get on with the review.Joe Wheeler, a self-centered businessman, leaves the safety of his bunker in search for food just about a year after the zombie apocalypse. The game is actually pretty run-of-the-mill post apocalyptic survival game, you have to scavenge, avoid looters, kill/escape zombies, build your own place in the world and overall just survive.The graphics are pretty good, not 3D masterpieces but I rather like the look of them; the game runs perfectly on older computers and the sounds and music are pretty alright as well.The Good:The game has lots of potential, and for being a one-man job, it’s really an amazing accomplishment on the developer’s part. The world seems to be quite large, the quests, although rather typical, are alright; the quest givers do remember your actions and any misstep will have consequences. You can go to war with factions, recruit people to your side, etc. You can use diplomacy, buy, sell, trade… The characters do seem to have some form of distinct personalities, and they are flawed in them. I really loved the touch of one of them having diabetes, it brought realism to the story. That there is a limited supply of insulin you must find/trade for also made it more realistic. But it also has the downside of making you feel truly rushed… You can split your party and give everyone commands. You can build things and plant crops.It has a fatigue system so you can’t just run forever, and I rather like that they added a needed sleep schedule to the hunger/thirst part of surviving.People can actually leave your party/settlement/faction when they don’t like you anymore.You can save at any time during the game, something that always wins my heart.The Bad:The default controls are super uncomfortable to me. Having to click F1 for the inventory is a stretch, using the middle button (mouse wheel button) to skip text is super uncomfortable. Entering a building is done through clicking with the mouse, but so is talking, and the menu for talking pops up as soon as someone is next to you, so sometimes the characters would stand right next to me when I was trying to enter a building which ended up in me talking to them when I didn’t want to.Overall it was a pain to do half the things I had to do.The characters who didn’t have a high shooting skill couldn’t shoot straight worth a damn. I get it this was probably going for realism, even Joe outright admits that he’s a bad shot. But there’s a bad shot, and there’s I-can’t-hit-a-target-even-when-it’s-on-me. The zombies were just way too fast and the aiming did not work quite as well when you had to be moving around all the time to avoid them jumping you from far too far. I found 0 melee weapons on the time I played (I honestly don’t know if there’s any), which admittedly wasn’t much. It was disturbing. I’d expect you’d find a baseball bat to smash a zombie’s head with before you’d find a gun…Then again I suppose since it’s a year later most people would be carrying guns… all the same, a backup melee weapon would have been nice to find.The game’s inventory is handled by a weight system, which is alright. However, it feels like you can’t really accomplish anything because everything you find to carry weighs too much and you end up having to make some very tough choices. This could be fine if you like a hard challenge, I’d rather get a bit more time to enjoy the game while surviving… Resource hunting is mind numbingly boring. Just getting the things to start building a fence took forever. Even with a backpack, because of the weight issue, the character can only bring one or two pieces of wood at a time. While realistic, this was also terribly frustrating - It takes longer to bring a piece of wood back to the shelter than it takes my characters to start getting hungry and sleepy and thirsty.The need for food/sleep/water/insulin seems too pressing. Again, good if you’re playing say, hard mode, but it doesn’t let you (or at least, wasn’t letting me) enjoy the game. I wasn’t even done figuring out a quest, and already they were starving. (Ok, not starving-starving, but already quite hungry).The AI seemed clunky when you left your guys alone. I left one doing the supply runs for wood so I could start building up something, he was attacked and bitten because I wasn’t there to press space when he got jumped. Had to restart because I was unable to get the needed antigen and I was fairly sure I couldn’t lose my only builder so far. All in all, while I loved the general premise and style of Survivalist, I couldn’t bring myself to fully enjoy the game as I felt rushed to get through it, and annoyed with the controls; yet I can see lots of potential in it. I was pretty split on recommending this game or not. In the end I’m going with a tentative “no” because to me the cons are a bit more annoying than the pros. Still, I can admit it's not a bad game.So, if you like a challenge in your survival games, then I would definitely recommend Survivalist to you. For the price it can be a great game. If you were expecting something a little more relaxed, I wouldn’t recommend it.There is word that there might be a multiplayer mode added, and I’m looking forward to see if it makes it any easier on the players by teaming up.* Key provided by Developer			"

												""Again a game with zombies.... When will this end?""Well yes this is a game about zombies and YES zombie games are very common, some of them suck, some of them are medicore, and some of them are Very good, like this one.You start as a survivalist who has been in hiding in his bunker for 1 year in a zombie outbreak.After 1 year you get out of your bunker and meet some people who help you start a community.You have to search for food and water at the beginning. later you build a well for all your water needs and then you start your own farm which is a MUST because food will get scarce very fast.You will come across other communities. Some will give you quest opportunity, others will give you a bullet to the face or they will take al your gold (The game currency).If a character not from your community likes you very much you can recruit then in your community, making your community bigger and even stronger.you can give community members objectives and tasks which they must do to keep up (searching for construction materials/Farm/Guard).Skills are VERY important in this game, A character with a low fitness level and high firearms level is a smart choice to keep on lookout on one of your guard towers.Last but not least, the zombies.There are 5 types of zombies and there infection. (if they bite you you have limited time to find the right cure)Green eye's: Most common of all the 5, if they bite you have a very long time before the infection kills you. low HPBlue eye's: second most common of the 5. If they bite you you have a moderate amount of time before the infection kills you. Mid HPRed eye's: Rare, Infection will kill within a minute. High HPWhite eye's: Very rare, Infection will kill in seconds. Very high HPGray eye's(?): This infection is spread as a rumour so many don't belive in its existence, But it exists. I won''t tell it for spoiler reasons and I'm not going to make a spoiler tag because you will just look at it out of curiousity. In short, This game is worth the 5 euro, damn it is even worth 20 euro, If you like survival games which include social systems and zombies, don't wait just buy.			"

												the animations are really good for a 5$ indie game. I don't think it will have too much replayability.. i'm only a few hours in and i'm just now starting to contruct my base. overall my first 2 hours were really exciting.. it's fast paced, you can bleed out if you get scratched don't have bandages. good amount of items; pistol, shotgun, assualt rifle i've found so far.. it's a neat game.. if you're into zombie games like state of decay, it's worth 5$. Medical supplies can be traded for at NPC towns for gold. You find random items off the zombies and looters you kill. It's not a waste of money in my honest opinion. Try the demo out if you have any fears.Pro's-Free form construction of base, you decide where you build your walls one block at a time. also other buildings like guard houses, out houses, and houses for your npcs.-Other NPC bases to trade with/ attack/ loot/ or ally.. you decide.-Awesome action, npc's fight on their own. cool 2nd fight screen that shows everything in 3d around you.. it's really neat.-Easy to cycle between NPC's-Your builder will gather materials needed to complete project from the town without your supervision. Someone said they needed consant micromanagement, which was a total lie/lazy on their part. there is a bit of micromanaging between the two.. but it's not crazy time consuming.-RPG elements, skills increase with usage and time-NPC towns-Random events like Looters attacking your base, and zombie hordes coming for you-Farming and ways to stay sustainable-Enemies respawn after time, areas you clear of zombies will become dangerous again.Con's- the map is a very decent size, don't get me wrong. But i wish it were bigger.. -probably something like 14-15 hours of gameplayI love the game just wish it had more random generation and a sandbox mode for infinite gameplay.*** there is a cheat mode to add npc's and respawn towns with looters and other enemies. This would add more gameplay.			"

												tl;dr Worth it. So you're a hedge fund manager and you decide to buy up a bunch of land in the desert and construct a bunker and stock it full of food and supplies. Then Zday kicks off and you're living easy. Well that got you through the first hump but your supplies have run out. Now it's time to venture out and resupply and hopefully reconnect with whatever remains of civilization.What you find, rather unfortunately, is an emotional train wreck of a woman with an insulin problem who badgers you constantly and sets off warning bells every time her blood sugar gets too high. Then some pointless quests that are all focused on getting said waste-of-space woman more insulin so that she can complain again later that she's out. I've thought about kicking her out of the group so many times...That aside, you meet some interesting people and convince them to join you. Together you make a small community, build up some walls, put up a tower or two, some crops, a well, a few houses.. before you know it, you've got the sparks of a community you can call yours. you set the guard rotations, make sure your crops are being tended to, and put together an A Team of badasses with some heavy packs to loot the hell out of the desert. Let the good times roll.At 10 hours in I have just barely gotten to that point, and there is so much more to do... This game rocks. The controls are a bit funky (on 360 controller and/or mouse/keyboard) but you get used to them. Some of the interaction menus come up at the complete wrong times and can cause you to die, so my suggestion is to save often to avoid that. The graphics are great for this game and help with emersion. The music ranges from good and very fitting to the horrible non-stop out of place techno music that tends to give me a headache. I usually just save the game then reload the save to force a new song to go on. Some people complain about the reputation grinding, but it's not that bad. So you have to talk to a few people, do some work for them (which also gets you gold), and gift them an item... isn't that how it works in the real world too? It's completely fine.All around great game and for only $4.99 it's an instant buy if it's already on your wish list. So far I've gotten $0.50 an hour of enjoyment in my 10 hours of play and can easily see another 20-30 hours... Worth it.			"

												           Survivalist is a great game. The thing I like about it most is the fact that you can control an entire community of people. The trailor didn't necessarily do a good job of showing community so I will talk about that and then tell you some Pros and Cons of the game(there are way more Pros).           In the community you have to provide for each and every need that all your survivors have. You need to provide them with water, food, ammo, sleep,insulin (for Alice a person with type 1 Diabetes) and protection. You can farm crops or scavenge nearby towns for food. For water you can make wells or scavenge. For ammo you have to scavenge gun shops. And for sleep you need to make sure you have enough buildings constructed or taken over that provide your members with sleep. Each member has a certain amount of respect and approval for you and if you fail to provide them with these necesseties they will lose approval and respect. There are two ways to recruit people to join you. You can help them and make them like you and they might join, or you can force them to join you by having fun with a bullet and rifle. You can tell your people to be guards, farmers, build things, follow you and help you, medics, scavengers you can even set up a team to explore. These are just the first parts of owning a community but I hope it helped.           Here are the Pros and Cons        ProsYou can control your characters directly or in a control modeYou can control each characterThere is a huge variety in skills and a really cool skill systemThe game slowly gets harder and harder as you progressThe game has a cool zombie system with different strains that are harderThe game periodically sends hordes or groups of zombies and looters to attack your baseI love the missions in the gameGood online gameplay except for one thing(see Cons)    ConsGraphics aren't the bestSometimes glitches will happen when forcing someone to join your communityIn multiplayer if you get in a big fight against zombies the game will sometimes lagoverall I believe survivalist is a very clever and cool game and I really hope this review helped.

												A good survival game that keeps it simple but not necessarily easy.There is a story, which is not easy to go through, lots of ups and downs, lots of easy and hard passes.There are several things you can do. The fun part is you can build a base with many npcs in it. You can even recruit prisoners you take from fights.But what is great is that it is a cheap game. For its price it is worth buying it.			"

												First Impressions:This is a top-down action light RPG set in a post-apocalyptic world (with zombies, looters, and other communities). To quickly sum up what you can do, you can switch characters, loot houses (you cannot view the insides), manage inventories, send survivors on automatic supply runs, eat/drink/sleep/medicate to prevent from dying, build a base, embark on missions, trade using gold as a currency, and more.  I'm admittedly not that far into it, but so far I'm having a pretty good time with it.  There's a lot here for $5, though the combat can be a little too overwhelming at times...that is, zombies can run and mission difficulty can spike to impossible levels.  Despite its faults, it's a game you can easily pump four hours into (probably more), making it worth the price of admission.

												I didn't think I'd like this game but I looove it. 7/10Features include:*Building a community, pretty much werhever you want really, but the game recommends you stay in a huge, defendable canyon*Scavenging food, water, bandages and luxuries to help improve you rrelations with your fellow survivors*Ability to recruit tons of survivors in the game, though recruiting means you have to do a lot of work or give gifts to them first*You can command survivors to do things, like scavenge certain resources from a building, defending from towers or pillboxes, or farming, which lasts untill you tell them to stop*Fun, exciting, but difficult quests that give some much needed color to this barren apocalypse*No loading screens except for loading, launching and jumping into your last save takes less then half a minute* You can beat bandits or other camps and force survivors to join youI really love playing this game and would recommend this to anyone, so they can get obsessed like me, however, there are some things that I'm not crazy about and hope they fix or add in the future, I'd play it all the time if they did already.Features I don't really like:*The main character is pretty bland and uncustomizable,  you play as Joe Wheeler, a wealthy man who hid away for a year from the zombie apocalypse in his own private bunker but now has to leave to find more food and resources*The entire map is pretty much a gigantic desert, though the locations are very interesting, being able to find a nice bit of green or a lake to settle near would be nice*Zombies are very powerful for some reason and some, even thought they're just individual zombies, will soak up dozens of your survivor's bullets, even with headshots*Leveling up skills takes forever, and some ou'll need to go out and find books that give you a bonus to that so you can actually use that skill, and then level up while using the book,*There actually aren't that many items in the game. There's canned food, chips, corn, bottled water, wood and chicken wire and cement, which makes up 80% of the items you need to gather in the game*No way to carry more stuff without backpacks, with the second largest backpack in the game, and just a pistol, you'll only be able to carry about 2 planks of wood; the survivors will only walk when you tell them to go gather resources, and you'll eventually have to go further and further away from camp, which is dangerous and can take about a half hour in real time to get maybe a dozen planks*Most of the time survivors will just stand around not really doing anything but complain, it'd be nice if there were more jobs to give, like cook, repairman, lumberer, doctor, rancher or miner*No customization at all*No animals at all*Corn is the only thing you can farm, but there's never enough of it*Survivors can't last longer then a real life hour going out questing as they need rest and eat and drink*Your community can grow up to the dozens, but there's only one way to switch characters, by cycling through them one by one*You can swap characters, but if your main character, Joe dies, game over,*The main characters starts out pretty much useless and you'll even have to swap characters because people will naturally not like Joe's personality or because Joe doesn't know how to hammer a fence*Equipping your survivors with a gun, bullets and a bulletproof vest takes up most of their inventory, leaving no room for loot*Bulletproof vests are the only protection you can wear *Switching, between your building's inventories and the survivors in it can be confusing*No categories to make searching inventories easier, like ""Food and Water"" ""Weapons and Ammo"" ""Construction Materials""*There will be times that you get stuck, you'll have the people; not the food, you'll have the weapons; not the survivors, or you'll feel  like you have everything you need but your useeless diabetic friend needs more insulin which is expensive as hell and currency is really hard to find*You can only build two types of fences and gates and towers, and one pillbox, one type of house, and outhouses*It's implied you should keep everything in your bunker but that makes it very difficult to find what you're looking for, the only real option would be storing things in different houses*You can't negotiate peace in some cases, and some achievements want you to recruit some peoeple, which will either die or end up hating you for finishing quests you need to do.

												The graphics are obviously bad, the music is annoying af, especially at the beginning, the combat, especially versus zombies, seems lacking. While this might sound like I'd actually downvote this game, it is really fun and offers many possibilities. The base building is very nice, many dialogues are funny, some quests have small twists I really didn't expect. It's rather cheap, I'd recommend you try it if you are into this kind of games. Don't throw it in a corner after 15 minutes of gameplay, stick with it a bit. Oh, and you can accelerate time by pressing G.			"

												Great game, especially at this price point. Not one crash or bug encountered in 16 hours of game play.Combat is fast and fun. Controls are intuitive. Controlling each individual survivor as well as being able to command them in command mode for repetitive tasks (like go get the 60 boards from that hardware store, 2 at a time) is very nice. The base building aspect is great. Roaming zombies and looters makes having some guards in guard towers useful.You can recruit pretty much anyone with the right approach, including the enemy looters in camps that people in towns tell you to kill. Getting them all to join you seems to work just as well as killing them, at least in the missions I've done so far.Quick tip for newbies: Try fighting green zombies hand to hand. Not only does it save bullets, it builds your fitness skill - which lets you carry more (much more with a good backpack) and keep the tougher zombies off you better. Just make sure not to sprint your stamina away before a fight, hand to hand does basically no damage when fatigued and you can't kick the zombies off you either. Once your skill is higher you can even fight off the tougher zombies with hand to hand. Another plus to having high fitness is you can do the boxing thing with npcs, which builds respect for you in addition to giving you money. I think high fitness even helps with making the NPCs who try to shake you down back off if you stand up to them (big buff guy more intimidating I guess). With a high fitness I was able to walk into a looter camp and shake down one of them, then recruit him forcibly and everyone else just by asking since they are now impressed with the way I handled myself.

												First off, for $5 if your a fan of rpg or zombie survival games then this is a must buy. Open world with fun quests and compelling character quests. The lack of melee weapons and limited guns (pistol, shotgun, and assault) makes fighting somewhat repetitive but the freedom of how to build, design, and manage your own compound more than makes up for it. For 5 bucks you cant go wrong and if your a fan of survival games like State of Decay then this will grab your attention for hours of challenging fun.			"

												OK 6 hours in and I feel like I'm slowly turning into a green zombie myself. I really REALLY love this game.For me graphics aren't very important. I always compare to the film industry - there are so many shallow, big budget, gorgeous looking, but TERRIBLE films coming out ever since we had the technology to make them.However I am old school and graphics are meaningless compared to story, gameplay and how much you get sucked into a game.Yes you can get the odd title with all of the above including graphics, but you can't get them for the tiny sum these guys are asking.This game is deep, with plenty of fun quests that keep you playing and playing. It has some great base building gameplay which can take place independently at the same time as you are out shooting up the world, thanks to having programmable community members to build, farm and collect materials.You can build up your community and its members as you like, finding people with the required skills or training them up and hopefully keeping them alive. You can test your strategic skills by assaulting enemy camps or defending bases that you have designed completely yourself. Everyone you meet will have their own opinion of you depending on how you interact with them and the people they care about, affecting trade prices and available missions. You can lay waste to other communities or slowly recruit them all away to your base, or leave them intact as valuable outposts for trade and supplies in the middle of the wasteland. You can be as good or totally evil as you like and reap the consequences or rewards!You always need to keep moving and exploring to find the resources required to keep your people alive and it just draws you in!On the downside I did find the controls slightly clumsy and difficult to use in places to begin with, but it was quickly overcome. I would like to be able to change the camera angle though, unless I haven't found this yet. Also to start with I wasn't paying attention properly when placing buildings, so my first watchtower was the wrong way around and open and exposed to everyone beyond the wall! (not sure if this is actually reflected with defense penalties) I would like a feature to be able to rotate the buildings after building them without deleting them (although not realistic).I haven't tried co-op but I am really a single game player so my review would be meaningless on this.All in all you can really get completely absorbed into this world and these guys prove you don't have to have a VR set + next gen visuals to do that!

												This game, oh man, where do i start?It is awesome, great fun to play especially with a friend. I've had my fair share of playing it. I bought it for only 1 euro, and i am 100% satisfied with my purchase. Look how much time i have in game.. 7.1 hours atm of writing this, but i betcha im going to record even more hours.This game isn't the kind of game that is going to be fun forever, it's the kind of game that is amazing for the price it is at. I purchased this for me AND my friend, we both enjoyed playing together, figuring out how to make others join us, laughing at the glitches...TL;DRPros :- A lot of fun for the price- There are new mechanics in the game, that could use some polishing but they are still awesome- Unique kind of game, the way you control the people and all that.- Full settlement building, fallout 4 scaled down.- The game is pretty darn stable in the current state.- The story goes pretty deep, each character has its own personality- The game will always surprise you, whenever you think ""Oh i've seen it all"" you explore that little area you have never been to before, and it has a new zombie type and a new character. Whaaat?- There are these constant raids, and zombie hoardes that keep attacking your settlement, It is really annoying at the beginning, since you can really easily get ♥♥♥♥ed because you have no walls. But if you do have walls, and the enemy is on the other side. You can always shoot and kill them extremly easely. If they are raiders and you have wooden walls, they are goin to throw molotoves on your walls and burn them down, be careful to make a wire fence walla and then a wooden wall. It's the most effective.- Did i mention the settlements? In my opinion it's better than fallout's, since if you get someone you can actually play as them and order them around- Ran out of fun? There's a cheat mode if you finish the game!- This game is a mix between strategy and top down shooter. It's a lot of fun.Cons :- Not so many items- Not so many buildings- The map is always the same, not generated.- Could use some better settings, and the optimization is garbage, i jump from 60fps to 30fps randomly.- Limited cast, you don't have any kind of character creator..

												Seriously, for $5 I wasn't expecting a lot, but there is a lot to this game, I'll be the first to admit it lack polish, but the characters are more complex that you'll find in a lot of triple A titles.  The zombies actually present a real threat, and you have to make some hard choices and live with them.There is a demo, if you can't blindly commit to the $5 try it and see, at the end of the day you don't feel like you got ripped off, and it should provide you with at least a few hours of entertainment.

												This game is top 10 best games I have played, esspecially with the cost/playability ratio.  What, 3 bucks?  Damn, there is no reason not to try this game out.  It is basic, but entertaing and has yet to crash even once (Paging Bethesta, et, all, this is how you put a game out, it WORKS!!).  Congrats and praise for the Developer.   If you like ""zombies"" and TEOTWAWKI, by all means, spend your bucks.  I enjoy this much more than Dead State, or any other appocolyptic game I have bought in recent time.EDITED TO ADD:  Still playng, as I get further along it gets harder as I am juggling supplies with one group, building with another two recruits, farming and taking my action team further and further away from home.Some of the compliants are true, it can feel tedious, but I think a lot of that is the lack of the lazy man's fast travel and the fact that you have to think and experimant to find ways to progress, as there is little in the way of a cheati.  This game gives you little, you have to work for it.  Still better than Dead State, with much much more replay value.Combat isn't that bad (who the hell plays games without a mouse or a controller?!?!), and with a little practice I'm rocking it.  As for zombies out of no where, yeah, so what?  Fkrs are sneaky that way.  Wait till you get the sniper rifle, then you start seeing them first.  Also, don't run everywhere as you explore, gives you less reaction time to the zombies that come out of no where, and makes you tired.  Finally, LEARN TO DODGE, when they first jump at you, step to the side and kick or shoot them as they go past.  You can also stop them in their tracks with a first strike kick when they come at you.			"

												I got tons of entertainment out of these 5 €. The game is finished and still there are updates providing new features (like additional save slots and coop play to name just the latest). That speaks volumes for how the dev is approaching this game.I won't go into the gameplay features in detail, others have done that extensively. So I'll just give the tl;dr:Of course there are a few handling problems and the graphics are a bit basic. But the gameplay is sound, basebuilding is very entertaining and the story and missions are quite interesting. And even if after a while there isn't really anything that can threaten your base (if you set up right) it is still a challenge to keep your resource gatherers alive.I have spent ten times the amount I payed for this game on pieces of eyecandy I dropped after 20 hrs. In comparison I have now spend almost 150 hrs on my two playthroughs of Survivalist.8/10 no ragrets			"

												This game aims for the sky with buckshot and manages to hit a few targets, but misses some important ones. There is no character customization, the amount of content in the game is extremely limited, and many of the features and activities are buggy and/or unfinished. I am impressed with the amount of fun and depth, but frustrated with game bugs and concepts that were implemented poorly or neglected altogether. Awardments are the main reason I keep playing. The fact that someone spent about 5 years making this game should be worth about 5 bucks right?Pros:Tutorial, Quests, Trade, Interesting characters, exploration, building, farming, managementYou get to shoot stuffYou get to punch and kick stuffIt is cheapCons: It costs moneyIt does a lot of things, but none of them are done very well.Learning curveLack of varietyRepetitiveBuggy“Feels” unfinishedIf you have five dollars and you are reading this then you have nothing better to do and should feel ashamed of yourself for pretending like this decision is so important you have to consult other people that have nothing better to do than write reviews for a game that will amount to time they will never get back.

												Firstly I'm going to say that I think some of these negative views are a bit unfair and are clearly here to advertise Home Behind...which in comparison is incredibly repetitive and at least in Survivalist you actually get to use what you collect to build up a base...but I'll leave a review on that game...I really enjoyed playing this game, because it is a great mix of scavenging and strategy gaming, with a good storyline and random generator (you never know when you'll suddenly be hunted down by a hoard of Zombies that have sniffed you out!) and it's really fun to scavenge and survive with the supplies you manage to get.I had some issues with the map area in terms of discovery, when trying to get rid of the 'black cloud' around my base camp and I think it could be better if you could choose to put your base wherever you wanted. I made the mistake of going straight up to search the area, which they clearly don't expect you to do until later on in the game as my level was too low for the mass zombies that came and wiped out my base. - Luckily I could reload a save and not have to start again!Overall this is a really addictive game and if you have the patience to walk the area, it's a really fun take on a Zombie world.

It scratches the itch I have that no one has had the balls to try. I am sick of FPS and RTS Starcraft style games. I want a hardcore post-apocalyptic RPG open world base building game that feels like Fallout. I want the silly moments but I want a damn hard game. Come on developers, make a real game.			"

												This game, while fun and definitly getting a reccommended, has a LOT of flaws and could have been so much better.Pros:+ Appropriate atmosphere- Whether's it's the abandoned towns or the destroyed cars, it definetly nailed the post-apocolyptic theme.+ Building a fort and convincing survivors to join- It has a cool city-builder aspect.+ Despite the combat being very boring, the strain of infected is a cool thing to expore. As you explore the map, tougher strains are found.+ Quests- Though usually a fetch this quest, are fun to explore as different people have stories to tell.+ Looters- It is fun to decide whether to eradicate a looter group or convince them to join.Cons:- Combat- There is no stealth, and enemies just jump at you from the darkness. It's lame. - Building is a hassle, and getting resources around is far to dangerous and takes way too long. - Did I meantion combat?- Ammo is far too common and guns far too useless. I'd rather less ammo and gunns not take 30 shots to kill something- STUPID GIRL WITH INSULIN IS IMPOSSIBLE! Just send her to her death and you will be better for it.All in all, it's fun with a lot of flaws that could be fixed but they choose not too. Pick it up half off and have some fun.			"

												I've owned this game on 360 since it was a newborn, and now own it for PC as well. So I have purchased this game TWICE now, and with my limited game funds that says a lot. It's a great game. Lots of playable hours, challenges, deaths. It's definitely an original take on zombie survival.If you're one of those gamers who's all about the graphics, this game is not for you. It's jerky, robotic animations are not for everyone. But if you're a gamer who's into story and challenge and grew up on 2 bit games with horrible graphics, this will be the best $5 you ever spent. I don't know what all these reviews are saying there is no story...clearly they're the type to just fly through a game without talking to the NPCs or doing any side quests. Plenty of story here.10/10 Would die trying to keep a diabetic alive by busting♥♥♥♥♥fruitlessly scouring various towns trying to obtain a constant supply of insullin just to have her get infected with white strain by a super fast zombie in a hazmat suit and turn instantly and take a flying leap at me and chew my face off anyway again.

Except for this one, because it's got a weird protagonist and lots of neat dialog choices and characters to interact with. Hell, it even has co-op play, if you're into that. Your friends can build a neat base, scavenge stuff for you, do whatever, and you're perfectly free to just kill everyone in the world if you don't want to deal with them.

												Survivalist have some of the most interesting gameplay I have encountered in years. Zombie survival horror at it's very best, and it is far cheaper than it ought to be and similar titles. I suggest people try the demo, and then decide. I for one find it to be the best money spent on a game the last year. Do not get scared by the somewhat archaic looking graphics.Bob have maneged to single-handedly create a game that surpass most industry titles in gameplay, story and even character building. And, I am already looking forward to the next playthrough, with some different choices. Works wonders as a sandbox game too. The game-mechanics are good and functional, the game practically bug free (for me).Others critics have mentioned micro-manegement as somewhat of a hazzle at endgame, but the last community I built was over a 100 people, and it did not take as much micro management as I feared. It depends on playstyle I suspect. Most of the time, my people did their things without supervision. That said, there is manegement required, it ain't abojut the shoot, hack and slash. That said for my only grievance, hopefully future improvements will see optimization of the community member list, so you can sort by skill to pick the right survivor for a job. It took a lot of memory and notes to find that former looter who supposedly were great at farming, but needed that watering can you just found.I recommend the game, and encourage people to support Bobs efforts, as he really got something quite unique here.

												This game isn't worth $5... it's worth at least $15. The game is very immersive presenting you with ethical dilemmas such as, stealing to keep yourself alive, saving the many by damning the few, hell - there's even a literal gay couple dilemma in here. You heard me right, this game has a morale dilemma regarding the treatment of homosexuals. Now that's pretty damn immersive. While not listed this game IS a sandbox game as you have the option of building anywhere which makes the game even more immersive as you'll probably spend many hours simply deciding the layout of your base.There are a ton of quests. Most of these quests, if not all, have diverging paths you can decide from similar to Fallout or Skyrim.Combat is okay but could be improved. The lock-on system specifically is very annoying because I feel it doesn't compliment the fast-paced tackle/grapple style zombies use. Against human AI the lock-on system is more than adequate and is actually fun but against hordes of zombies it can get annoying. Coop is fun. You and your friends share the community members which works great as one person can handle the construction or farming and another person can finish up quests and scavange. During the difficult quests you can bring a friend or have your followers back you up. (Peer 2 Peer style coop - someone hosts, others join. No servers req.)The developer(s) has been pretty transparent with this game often replying to community questions in the forums. I believe a sequel is due and I look forward to playing it. If you're looking for a cheap game that you can easily spend 30+ hours on this is the one.  "

												Survivalist. Just your normal top-down zombie shooter, right? Well, you couldnt be more wrong. You may look at the trailer and think: It has everything i want and more, quests, building, storyline. But, just like any other survival game, you'll get everything in a couple nights then be bored with it after. No, this is'nt just a survival game. There are Three different endings, an amazingly interesting storyline about how the outbreak began and more, So many different items, a constant challege with looters and zombies, you can shape your own story, Build a huge a** base and recruit everyone if you please, and best of all: You can literally do whatever you want. Whatever! Go ahead, kill a whole village! You dont like Isham Seely? Kill em off! You love the Fat Neils but hate the McCoys? Burn em to the ground! Now you may be thinking:, if i can just kill a whole village like that, what fun would it be? Wheres the challege? Well young one, killing a whole village would be extremly difficult. Thats why the possiblites with this game never end! You just cant get bored! Now you may think, how am i going to afford this game? It has to be 60$ or more with all this juicy content! No. Its 6$. I was rubbing my eyes when i saw the price too. Now i could go on and on about how great this game is, with all its missions and possiblites, but ill make you buy the game and play it yourself right here. Get your credit card ready.In a way its Skyrim because of its freedom and possiblites. Its also GTA because of its many weapons and many different characters.Its dungeons and dragons because it has so. many. items. And, enemies.Its binding of isaac because of the challenge.its the Civilization series because of its huge map and exploration.Its Civilization again because of its awesome building system and having to manage your people.Its the sims because of the many skills you can level up in.And finally, i couldnt find many games that have this feature. But ill go with FarCry because its so story rich. And, has different endings. (At least in FarCry 3.)Although all these games are so different from eachother, if they had a child it would be Survivalist. Even though i havent mentioned everything in survivalist, i hope you'll buy it. Being the owner of 400+ games (Including steam family sharing), it is one of the best games i have every played. Great job to Creator of this masterpiece. Now, time for you and me to clock in some hours on this game.			"

												I paid about $2.99 for the game and I have about 9 hours on it.Although there are many zombie games that involve base-building and scavenging supplies out there, Survivalist still remains a unique and enjoyable game to play.One problem, as you can guess from my relatively short time spent in this game, is replayability.  For the $3 that I paid I wouldn't penalise the game too much, but sadly once you're done with the game then there isn't much of a purpose to come back to it.  Most missions can only be completed in pretty much the same way.  The towns and resources are all pre-set (as far as I can tell), not dynamically generated, so exploration isn't a draw.Because of the lack of replay value, the game's limited time for a playthrough is also puzzling.  One character in the game has a medical condition and is reliant on a constant supply of medication.  This forces the player to complete the game within a certain timeframe as the supply is limited.  While certainly such a mechanic introduces urgency, it also serves to shorten the game.  I would have preferred the option to build and explore, instead of being so rushed.But Survivalist does some things very well.  Exploration is actually interesting, with towns being varied enough to make cars and houses worthwhile to explore.  You find things where you would reasonably expect them, such as water from a water tower (duh).  There is also an automated retrival system, where you can use NPCs you recruit to haul supplies back for you.  This offers a nice solution to the tedious task of resource retrival that other zombie survival games fall short on.NPCs are probably another strong feature of Survivalist.  Whereas most other games of the genre simply feature the sole survivor versus other zombies, Survivalist gives you NPC helpers.  Some of them are decently fleshed out and created, while others have no significant backstory.  The presence of NPCs helping you out makes for a much more interesting game, because it allows for an actualy plot beyond ""don't get eaten"".  Getting a quick message from a NPC that they are being attacked will cause me to drop what I'm doing and sprint back to base, because I sort of actually care about what happens to them.Co-op play is another area that has been getting more attention from the Devs.  I tried one session, which was okay.  Dropped in and took over a character.  Started running off to find supplies for the base.  Played for maybe half an hour until the other person logged off.  It's still not a very deep system and because I couldn't figure out how to communicate with the other player (say to figure out which resources I ought to be collecting) it was rather strange.Overall, Survivalist seems like a great work-in-progress game that (very importantly) carries a price like a work-in-progress game.  Although the content could be expanded, the underlying concept is fun and solid.			"

												Decent Survivor management game.Storyline and Gameplay are quite well done.The pace of the infected and enemy looters keeps the adrenaline pumping.Insulin is one of the major problem of the game, just to keep the diabetic female alive,can't see her in a prolonged game.To keep the game going without losing her,  use unorthodox method mentioned in the discussions.Management of a large camp can get really messy, trying to control too many survivor's activity isn't fluid.Constantly have to leave them standing around, trying to group them together, losing controls.Lack of respawns of items once you cleared the areas,other than just the same items and pistol from looter gang spawns, slightly better randoms and ammos of infected visiting the camp.NPCs who accidentally wanders off their usual path, into the routes of the infected/looters spawns get murdered for no reason.Rely too much on save/reload of game too frequently, as you never know the following few minutes, you might lose one of your favorite characters.Achievements aren't in sync with Steam, requires log out of game achievement updates, else all achievements obtained in current play will accumulate with same timestamp.Game is considered not bad if one keeps to the story, plays a short game, keeping a smaller camp.Read the game guides for npc infos on who to recruit for efficiency.Playable.

												How is this game so cheap? This is a very good game! Addictive, fun and seriosly immersive. It is easily worth three times the price at least. Do NOT hesitate to get this if you even remotely enjoy this genre of game.			"

												Stumbled on it on xbox by accident. First thought: ""Oh no, not another 1.99 game""Spent a full 2 week period on crafting my group. Yelled several times at the TV, started over again, read all i could grab on that game, died. Started all over again. Thought i succeded. Died. Started all over again. Found way better solution and more surprises. Amazed by the Story, not thinking much of it at first glance, this is one of the few games you can get ""grow on you"". Its an excellent zoning out into Zombieland, dealing with human issues mostly, did not expected a slaughterdriven Game, got excellent Soundtrack and surprisingly well crafted and more above all a BALANCED gameplay. Lets repeat the system is balanced. Its hard, tough, but fair. Playing it the 2nd time on pc. Listening to audiobooks and enjoying the spartanic atmosphere of the game. Zombiesurvival. Done right. 11/10 Would crawl out of my bunker again. If you like Zombies, the original Dawn of the Dead is your favorite movie, you get down to the comic artstyle, get over the first impression. You get rewarded by a great game. No grinding, Awarding level success. Great implented Elements. A wholesome gaming experience where you can see someone put his heart and sweat to it. TD:LRPlaying the 2nd time now, hooked again. It is a once you got sucked into the worldmap irresistable game which fullfills all your zombie survival isometric gameplay looting desires you can imagine. Including eco friendly power supplies. Excellent game. Please more of this type, good story, good gameplay, A bit corny sometimes but a real complete experience you won't regret to spent a few bucks on.			"

												Cheap, fun enough to play, I recommend. You won't get superb gameplay, but while it is simple enough it's also fun for a few hours. Pretty well developed storyline too.Doesn't really look special, but it's polished enough and at 5 dollars you get a simple but effective combat system, a base to build and manage, multiple npcs/characters you can switch to get a strategic element going on. 1 person guards base, 2nd gets building materials, 3rd (you?) goes around finding and talking to other npcs, get more npcs to do more stuff. Good rpg, good enough as a zombie survival game, combat system could be better (hold right click to auto aim at zombies, then shoot them and repeat. Longer you aim more accurate your shots get, red circle is fully accurate, can also aim at chest/legs/head for hits/slow down/criticals), zombies are incredibly fast, but it works. Also, there's a fast-forward system (which is probably why zombies are fast), which helps a lot while traversing the map.It's a pretty nice game, I played 24 hours without forcing myself too much to enjoy it, and this was before multiplayer support came out. Can be kind of tedious, grabbing materials to build base, getting attacked, getting food to grow, so if you have a dislike of managing a base it's not really the game for you. Or you could just go and ditch your allies, so you don't have to defend your base anymore. Suppose that is an option, I just don't like ditching useful npcs.You can also order your npcs to just water plants/go guard duty/grab materials from house, and they'll do it. They'll defend themselves while moving on, so if you leave them a pistol and enough ammo it works fine.Worth getting if on sale or full price, not that expensive and it's fun.			"

												A great game with a great potential.It has interesting ideas, intense and gripping gameplay, catchy music. And last, but not least, it has a certain depth to it. Characters remember what you did to them, moral dilemmas aren't black-and-white and building your own community is a great game mechanic overall.Compared to slow and boring Dead State fast and addicting Survivalist is a masterpiece.For what it's worth - Survivalist is a wonderful little game.

												This game was surprisingly good, I bought it expecting something decent but got something genuinely good. The one thing I dislike in the game is all of the waiting that seems to occur when you want to collect resources or build up your base, but I definitely understand its place due to the realism that the game seems to be shooting for.

												Got this game in a bundle a while back, and really didn't expect much, but went over the ""base builder"" tag in my library and decided to give this a try.I was really surprised to discover how deep this game I've never heard of before is. While the graphics may be a bit of a turnoff (they game really doesn't have a visual theme), the gameplay is interesting, with many choices, lots of freedom, and plenty of content.Nice surprise, I'm only getting started but it's enough to figure out that this game is worth my time.Pros: + Open world with lots of stuff to do+ Build a community+ Simple yet deepCons:- Graphics- Gets a bit repetitive. The map is kinda the same all around, same loot, same enemies.- Taking and storing items is a bit tedious, 2/3 clicks per item.			"

												Quite a neat little polished game. Basically it's an open world sandbox in the vain of Project Zomboid. You start off in a bunker and go exploring to find food/water and other supplies. Along the way you'll meet friendly NPCs and settlements, as well as enemy raiders and of course Zombies. You can recruit other NPCs to follow you (and become playable characters), and eventually establish your own settlement wherever you like really. This settlement can be built up with walls, houses, towers etc. Inventory management plays a big part in this game with some tasks taking a while to complete without having large backpacks equipped on your characters. You can automate tasks by telling your characters to go collect wood/water/other supplies so in a sense it has an RTS element too as this is all controlled from a top down perspective. Combat is simple yet functional with bullets being relatively scarce, and the enemies are quite varied with raiders being tough to kill while zombies are cliched being simple in small groups but quite difficult in hordes.  There are way more features I have not touched on but if you want a really pleasing survival game with a pick up and play aspect to it, then Survivalist is that!			"

												When i first started this game, i thought ""What the hell am i playing?""  it felt like a very bad game..  But as i continued to  play it, i found it very good.The zombies are actually a threat in the game, you can't just run inside a city like in DayZ. If you get bit in this game your character will slowly die if you don't find medicine.  The game might be hard to get into, but you will like it if you like open world zombie game.Now.. there is some thing that could be easily fixed that is just annoying me.  1. Your survivors will waste ammo on all the zombies they see.  Once they have a gun, they will use it all the time.  Which will just result as an ammo eater machine.  Like to tell your survivors to only use weapon if they absolutley need to or something.  If they are very hurt...2.The dialogue is very repetitive.  You can ask an survivor the same thing and he will anwer the same thing. Like diffrent dialoque would be a nice touch. 3.  Co-opThis game would really be nice to have co-op.  Like 1 is building the fort around your base, and the second is out looting the supplies. Or just simply zombie killing times.  4. FightingThe fighting is weird in this game. I ran behind a wall and i got shot anyway.  In easy words - it's very buggy.Please consider these.. Thank you devs for making such an amazing game! :)			"

												Yes, the game's graphics are quite outdated and the gameplay mechanics make it feel more like a simulation than a survival game. However, while waiting for State of Decay 2, this game makes an excellent coop experience at an affordable price. The controls are awkward and the HUD is poorly designed, but these are minor issues that can easily be looked past once you start getting into the game. Ultimately, the game features a massive map, plenty of content, an actual story, decisions, as well as elements of both RTS and third-person shooters.If you're into survival coop games, this is certainly one worth picking up if you have a friend with similar tastes.

												Had this for a while now and just remembered I promised the dev I would post a review after his excellent help with a problem I had running it.What can you say really, epic fun! Had me engrossed for a long time which as an experienced gamer, it's very hard to keep me interested for long nowadays. Lovely storyline, hard choices to make, free building, minor management of supplies and fighting party etc etc. So much to do in such a cheap package. Please believe me when I say this genuinely that graphics matter not when something like this has had so much love put into it.Very good game and for the price....well....you cant really go wrong. As long as you can put the new gen graphics of modern games to one side, this really is worth the time and pittance of a price. Excellent support from the developer as well! 10/10			"

												I never wrote a review here before, but this game is truly a hidden gem! The gameplay is a very satisfying blend of rpg and strategy (I found it somewhat reminiscent to the Jagged Alliance series). But in this game, the world is much more open-ended and realistic. For example, it seems as though it is theoretically possible to recruit almost any NPC to join you by making certain decisions and using certain items. After the initial, classic-rpg small-group portion of the game, you also start to build your own town, complete with shacks, outhouses, defenses, and corn. The balance of finding items to survive early on and eventually having to make your own is very well done. As you start to manage a larger group of survivors you can also make use of automated commands such as ""collect materials"", ""farm"" or ""guard"" that give portions of the game a sort of apocalyptic Sims feel. In terms of gameplay, I found fighting zombies annoyingly hard, but using auto-combat mode basically turns it into more of a pure strategy game. Fighting other people, though, the computer interestingly does not do so well, so I manually control my survivors then. There are a few weaknesses I'll list below, but overall this is the best $3 I've ever spent and I hope the developers will produce many more games in the future!Pros: Great blend of rpg/strategy, gritty and realistic post-apocalyptic environment, recruit many survivors, build you own town, multiple endings, nice survival balanceCons: Graphics are a bit simplistic, some NPCs look the same, zombies bite too much unless you use auto-combat, no way to fast-forward through sleeping or resource collecting, music is just alrightOverall: Great indie game, one of the best I've ever played, highly recommend!

												This might be my favorite survival experience yet, way better than State of Decay. This game is definitely a gem, if the graphics we're better, I would assume the game would have more attention. The thing is, the graphics never bothered me, and the user interface didnt matter to me after a few minutes of playing.1. Game has a story arc to follow if you want to. 2. Open sandbox allowing you to influence every nearly character in game to join you 3. Building.4. RPG elements5. Decent A.I.6. Complex relationships, meaning each character has a level of respect and or approval of you. 7. Many realism factors.. Guns kill people 8. You can strafe to use cover.9. CO-OP!!!Suggestions for future development: 1. Randomly generated maps for replay value as the game mechancics here are very well done. Not sure how easy that would be. 2. Some sort of deplomacy script. I someone how got caught stealing crops despite grandma coming to my base to talk while her man was in the house asleep I took some corn to plant at home, or a person on my squad was a member of a looter community which angered grandma, i cant even get close without them aggroing my whole community. 3. Capture and force labor, with escape option. *not really important, may open a whole new can of worms. 4. Crafting system. (build carts, maybe include domestication of animals.)5. Clubs, rocks, hammer as defenseDefinitely worth what the developer is asking. The developer could be asking double and possibly attract more buyers with the illusion of value, however I respect to the developer as he's obviously not trying to gouge anyone. Also after looking at the replies from the developer, ive learned a lot about his attention to detail and his dedication to making a solid experience. He also replies to people in a mature way, which in relationship to previous points tells me he has good character and the kind of developer I want to support.			"

VERDICT: For the most part I found Survivalist to be a very solid and enjoyable game.  On first appearances it may seem like a casual version of Dead State-lite but its not even turn-based. If you are a fan of State of Decay then you will be pleased to find a number of similarities with that game.Its a zombie survival RPG played in real-time with exploration, combat, character fatigue/hunger/ thirst, community recruitment, base building, tied together with some complex quests.  Unfortunately there are a few really frustrating things such as overly complex quest-arcs, somewhat frenetic combat and some very gamey aspects to recruiting and achievement hunting that bring it slightly down from being great.  Overall the game possesses some really well designed and implemented features which together add up to surpass the sum of its parts.  However it can be difficult to get into if you dont enjoy the feeling of not being in complete control.  If you are not great at multi-tasking or you dislike the pace and frantic nature of real-time combat then I would give this a miss or dont expect too much!  Those things almost put me off during my first aborted playthrough.  Yet if you can overlook them or possess a methodical approach to gameplay there's a very good game to discover.   One that surprised me but only if you have the patience and persistence to try.... More info below ...01. GENRE: Story-driven, zombie survival isometric RPG.  Played in real-time.02. SETTING: A post-apocalypic scenario full of rival communities in a fictional desert region around mid-west United States. 03. STORY/BACKGROUND: Take control of Joe Wheeler a successful hedge fund manager (i.e. tosser) who built his own bunker before the zombie apocalypse started.  After a year of surviving alone and with dwindling resources, its time to take your first steps into a harsh new world, recruit characters, form a community, build a base, gather resources and complete quests, while fighting bands of looters and avoiding infection from zombies.The story is fairly deep, with a complex main quest.  One that demands your full attention otherwise you can lose your bearings and get bored.  This is further complicated with the time sensitive nature of the insulin quest and your need to find more of it to keep a certain NPC alive.  Unfortunately there is also at least one convoluted quest where you have to wait, wait and wait for someone to die (if you dont want bad karma) to get an item you may desparately need [for more insulin].  These plain suck and take away from the satisfying quests.04. GAME MODES: A multiple story driven campaign played out on a single map with around two dozen quest arcs of varying length, complication and effort.  The main story arc has about 20 sub-quests to complete.  The core gameplay will take in excess of 50hours easily.  My playthrough took 90hours and it was far from comprehensive.  If you fail a quest you are given the chance to reload automatically.05. GAME/LEVEL DESIGN: The whole game takes place on one explorable map populated by survivor communities, zombies, deserted towns and looters.  The map is not fully open-world restricting exploration through the the nature of the insulin quest and the need to keep an eye on your community members.  The game can be continued after the main quest is finished.  If you are lucky you can attempt to complete the other two alternatives to the central quest.06. GAMEPLAY/MECHANICS: An almost perfect blend of features for the genre. Contains a good number of well conceived multi-option quests, well-rounded and flawed characters and a clever dialogue system even though sometimes gamey recruitment requirements for key characters - such as luring zombies near to them to increase respect. There is also excellent base building and community management, substantial item inventory, and a good RPG-lite stats for each character that determine key actions such as fitness, combat, construction, healing and farming.  Combat is frenetic in real-time which was hit and miss and, a fairly robust A.I. that allows you delegate tasks to community members even if it was not perfect.  Resource collection was a tad too slow, making the game last too long.07. ENEMIES: Zombies are unfortunately not the main threat in the game.  They exist alone or in small groups in unexplored areas.  They will try to run and bite your characters either alone or in groups until despatched.   Once the fog of war is exposed those areas are clear. Humans come in two forms: survivors and looters.  Combat doesnt necessarily need to occur with humans but once you start they will remain hostile until they are dead.  These attack with numerous weapons and in groups so are much more dangerous.  However periodically the groups of roving zombies and looters will target your base to keep you on your toes.08. A.I: The game possess some solid A.I.  It allows you to manage what tasks individuals are assigned, while having them seek; food, water and rest when they require it.  They will even hunt down ammo if they are low.  The A.I. was so well-made that the paltry issues I had were that farmers did not collect and store corn and if water wasnt available, they did not seek it from nearby wells.   Combat is straightforward enough, as they will shoot any perceived threat or attempt to kick them off if overwhelmed.09. CONTROLS: Fine but not completely initutive for a PC user.10. GRAPHICS: Basic.  Cartoony in nature but clear and good enough for the job.11. SOUNDTRACK & AUDIO: Unintrusive.  Firearms and reloading sounds are satisfying.12. VOICE ACTING: None.  But the well-written dialogue compenstates.13. CHALLENGE/DIFFICULTY: Easy to pick-up.  Not so easy to manage the party as it grows.  Its main difficult is determining the right course of actions to complete the quests in hand.  Combat also presents its challenges when faced with better equipped enemies. 14. PROBLEMS: No problems running the game experienced.  15. ACHIEVEMENTS: These are wide ranging.  Only a few are simple.  Some are overly complex.  If you are expecting easy and fast achievements this is not the game for you.  There are a couple that are insanely difficult to get and very time consuming!  On the other hand when you do trigger one its very satisfying.  Some of the achievements will need at least one replay.  Likely more. 16. DLC: None but a sequel is planned by the developer.  Yes I said developer.  It was made [mostly] by one person!  So kudos to him for a sterling effort!17. ONLINE PLAY/COMMUNITY: Did not try co-op but I would imagine if its stable the game would be twice as engrossing to play with two of you in the same group.18. ENJOYMENT/APPEAL: For a real-time RPG and indie game this really surprised me.  It has alot of great content even if only the main quest is replayable.  I think fans of games with the story and questing of Baldurs Gate and Icewind Dale, and the zombie survival and party/base management of State of Decay, Dead State wil definitely enjoy Survivalist.  Even if it appears to be the poor relation graphically.19. PLAYTIME/LONGEVITY/REPLAYABILITY: The game is built for at least one playthrough but given the complicated nature of the quest arcs and the all to real possibility of messing up something you could be playing this twice or three times as there are three possible player sanctioned goals that require the best part of the game to slowly achieve.  These are: Love, Money and Power.  Each has its own set of sub-quests you will really need to make and to some extent grinding goals to chip away at as you play.20. VALUE FOR MONEY: One of the few titles I would recommend at full price.  Getting it on a sale would just be a bonus.			"

												Hahahaha !  HAHA!! HAHAHAHAHA !!! HA !  HA !  HAHAAHA !!This game is -awesome- !I've only played about an hour so far, but even if it sucks from this point onward, it's still more than worth my five bucks.  It's great!  It's so unique and weird.  I love the little cinematic camera that traps everything going on around you in 3D, it's a little bit like watching a bad 80s zombie movie.This game oozes so much personality, I might just catch a social disease from it.Seriously, if you're even half thinking of it, buy the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.I've gotten enough fun out of the last hour that it doesn't matter where the game goes .. although I do have the impression that there's a bit of depth to it .. crafting, base building, long-term survival .. but I'm still muddling through early game.UPDATE (2 weeks later):Okay, so I've been playing a bunch of games - so many in the library, but Survivalist has been able to lure me pretty consistently.  So it isn't just a great first reaction, it's a great game overall.  Later on you get into politics and quests and drama with other survivors inside and outside your community, you get to grow your community, build a base, defenses, farm, etc.  I was surprised by how much depth the game has (as the graphics are a bit arcade-y).  There's a learning curve, but once you master the systems, you can assign all kinds of cool roles to your community members - farmer, scavenger, guard, etc ... and the AI is surprisingly good.8/10 overall			"

												Survivalist is a surprising find. I don't know how to describe it to anyone that the other comments don't already do a good job of doing. You play as a survivor, you find other people along the way exploring, you do missions for other groups, build up your resources, including building your own town. It is beautiful in its simplicity and wonderful in a sandbox survival with a light hearted story. The fact is I wish there were more buildings, or atleast options to choose colors for your buildings. The game has a lot of amazing fun moments, and some over the top ridiculous story arcs, which made me laugh and I enjoyed the time I've played. If you want a game that will keep you surviving, wheeling and dealing, searching and constantly strategizing on how to get the upper hand, this game is a must play.			"

												Very fun game. Spent over 100 hours on the PC Version and over 500 hours on the Xbox 360 Indie Game Version, and it fails to disappoint me at all. It's very hard for me to stick close to a game, and this game debunks my feelings towards all games(Since this game is addicting to me, but not too addicting). I remember when I first played the trial version on the Xbox 360 that after the trial was over, I instantly wanted to buy the game. Great game that is given to all of us at a cheap price. Also, if you are a fan of the game, I'd suggest helping on the Survivalist Game Wiki: http://survivalistgame.wikia.com/wiki/Survivalist_Game_Wiki "

												I'll not spend too much time echoing what others have said.  Instead, I'll draw your attention to a key choice the game has you focus on:As you can see from the official trailer, Alice Ivers has type 1 diabetes and will die if she doesn't get her insulin.  Getting that insulin is something close to a full time job.  You have complete control over Alice and could easily march her off into the desert to die.  Or you grit your teeth, double down, and get one more syringe to get through one more day.It's honestly a tough call, and you don't find decisions like that in games these days.Good stuff.			"

												This is as the name of the game suggests its a game were you & a group of Survivalists most Survive in a post apocalyptic world one thing i can say is that for an indie game made by a very small indie dev team this game is amazing. the game has a nice look to it the game has a nice fiting soundtrack the game has great animations the game has a very nice torn-down beat up looking city you can loot , you can craft , you can build bigger & better defenses for houes you can fell the overall fell of the disaster that hit this games world & its after effects the gameplay is very smooth & nice & easy to control & there is a major plus to the contolrs you can play with keyboard & mouse or if you wish to do so you can even play it with an xb360 gamepad i have to say that i am very impressed with this game a indie game for 4.99 & its one of the better indie games here on steam i say that its a must buy if you are looking for an indie game that has a decent story great use of music & just overall a fun game to play then pick up this game. the only con i would give this game in a review is that the guns in the game they take a but of time to learn how to use them correctly at first i was shooting like a wild man & just missing my shots & waisting my bullets. but after i learned how to control my shots i never missed a shot. i give this game an 98 out of 100 i give it an 98 because of its an indie game made by a very very small dev team & what they made for there small team & extremely limted budget to make this game with i am very Pleasantly surprised with this game. you should all buy it & at least give it a shot. its only 4.99 usd & its very well worth the price.

												Before I say anything I have to say this, I'm having fun playing this game. Okay so some of the zombies run wierd and the pictures look funny so on and so on but the game is $5.It was worth that price when the first zombie ran out and knocked me to the ground.When I hear zombie sounds I am truly on guard and looking all over the screen. I'm a little bit scared and it's just a game.It may have flaws and maybe there are bugs I haven't found or some terrible game mechanic but I don't care it's fun playing it and for me thats the point. Well, that and the hillarious nature when I found that zombie with the girlie mag LOL.Here is some video of my first experience:

												Okay, first off, this review is not a joke or anything, so this should help others who want to get this game or interested.Survivalist is a open-world RPG set one year after the zombie apacalypes. The game focuses on a business man named Joe Wheeler, who emerges from a underground bunker in the middle of a desert. Here are some Pros and Cons of the game.PROS:*Price tag for this game is relativaly cheap and affordable, about the same price of a 5 $ foot long at subway.*Big in-game map and lots of interesting locations.*The player can make decisions and choices.*Good amount of NPC's.*(SPOILER!!!!! BELOW!!!)Infected are harder than others and have different types of ""strains""*A player can build a community.*A player can interact with a good number of NPC's*A player can learn skills*And much much more but I don't want to spoil anything :-) Like every game, it has its flaws...CONS:*Graphics aren't the best and may look outdated, however, if your interested in this game, this really shouldn't matter.*The Soundtrack........ terrible, just turn it off, unless you like retro during a zombie apocalypes, however, turning off the music sound isn't a challenge.*There aren't alot of weapon veriaty, the player only uses guns to defend himself or may use the characters fist, so don't expect UZI's or AK-47's, however, there are still some weopons but these are very broad with the name and description.*Combat: Combat is not the best in this game, as this game does not really focus on combat itself. Usually, you'll run into some looters or infected and shoot them and defend yourself. Don't expect anything special with the combat here in this game, as it focuses on survival. *This game is not for you if all your interested in is shooting zombies and getting killstreaks.CONCLUSION: Is this game worth it? Yes and of course, the game itself it a very unique take on survivaland living in a zombie apocalypes. However, like I mentioned above, if all you want is to kill zombies and get killstreak, this game is not for you. I have enjoyed playing this game alot so far and I never encountered a bug or glitch. For being a lesser known game developer, they really made a neat game. You should check it out yourself.			"

												I bought this game yesterday and continuously pleayed for 12 hours. For the price of a cheap burger, this game definitely worths it.Pros:- Good amount of stories and plots, some of them are surprising/intereting- Player's behaviour affects the story lines and world- Blanced combat difficultyCons:- bad modling and animations- occasionally the AI goes wild (e.g. community members ignores the big well in front of his door but wandering miles for water)I'd say you probably won't find any other games with such cost/value ratio.

												Been ages since i played this game and I just noticed it's still being updated! This game merged several genera in really interesting and well executed ways. It's a zombie/survival game, a decent post-appocolypse rpg, and ... a city builder/management game? It's hard to quantify all the aspects of the game, the combat I disliked at first but then after the first couple hours I decided I really liked it. Involves a combination of click-to-aim, select-to-aim, and dodgeroll mechanics with light squad management aspects.The plot was a little (sometimes intentionally) cheezy but charming as well; there was one aspect of the plot that really created a sense of urgancy and commitment for me, but some of my friends didn't find it compelling so we had vastly differant experiences with that, (which is a good thing!).The building and management aspects turned out to be really awesome as well and were my favorite part of the game.  For five dollars this game was a real steal for that alone.If you like Walking Dead, City builders, and zombie games this game is easily worth your time (since for 5$ money isn't the issue) and it is a solid buy.

												Okay, so I have played about 38 hours worth of this game now.In short, I like it, and it's dirt cheap!You start out with the main protagonist, a hedge fund manager, with no great skill, no weapons, a few packets of chips, some water and some bandages. You leave the bunker, only to be attacked while looking for your car. You beat up the zombie, take his gun and ammo, and from then on, get ready to shoot some Zombies.But the main focus of this game really isn't on the Zombie shooting. You need to find other survivors, entice them to join you through various methods, and slowly build a community. You can build buildings, fortifications, farm food, draw water from the well you dug, and most importantly, trade and scavenge for food and other supplies.The game becomes increasingly harder, giving thougher Zombies and looters to fight while you solve various quests and increase your numbers.By now I have plenty food, water, ammo and a completely build camp with walls and towers, and most importantly about 10 inhabitants.And still, I haven't seen the entire map yet, or found all the challenges to come. Great game, especially when you consider the price!			"

												This is the Zombie game I've been waiting for since the genre exploded. It is a superbly well thought out game and contains a perfect mix of RPG, Base building and Adventure.RPG: Characters level up. They improve as they carry out the actions in several different areas. You can also purchase books which improve their skill whilst in the inventory. Your actions are remembered by NPCs too and their opinion of you is fluid throughout the game based upon your actions.Base Building: This is just sublime. Yes, the buildings are generic templates, but you can buid those fences, fortifcations and such however and wherever you like. One very minor point is that it's fairly tricky to build anywhere other than the default place, but as mentioned before, what you do to enhance it and how, that's very much up to you.Adventure: There are storylines! You have to curry favour with various individuals and factions. This can open up other questlines, and you can even persuade them to join your cause. I believe prices charged by vendors for items can be swayed this way too.This truly is a magnificent game. Until this game came along, State of Decay was probably the closest to 'realism' and sense of survival against the odds with dwindling supplies. This, for me, while it doesn't perhaps look quite as gorgeous to look at, is infintely better it almost all other aspects of the game.Since buying it I've hardly gotten any housework done, and I've contemplating phoning in sick at work!The developer seems to be a one man team - and he is very active on forums, answering questions and discussing feedback. Can't wait for Survivalist 2 (PLEASE MAKE IT HAPPEN!)Thoroughly recommended.			"

												A HIDDEN GEM. I was very surprised by this game. Survivalist is a top down post-apocalyptic RPG similar to State of Decay and Dead State. Set one year into the zombie apocalypse you start off as a wealthy business man with heaps of worthless money who has been living alone in a bunker for a whole year hoping to wait out the apocalypse, but then your bunker supplies unexpectedly ran out. Left with no choice but to venture outside you will encounter other survivors, zombies, looters and so your adventure begins in this zombified desert wasteland.The game is not perfect but it is still very fun to play. The graphics are pretty dated; they look like The Sims 2 from 2004 level of graphics but with better shadow effects. But this is probably due to the game be ported over from old Xbox 360 hardware, which also limits the frame rate to about 30 so that may turn some people off. Also the aiming is off as you cannot pull off any headshots against your enemies which makes gun combat pretty annoying in early game where your character's firearms skills are low and can lead to some pretty cheap deaths with your characters. Also ammo and supplies are plentiful in this game which can take away some of the hardcore survival aspects of this game.But the positives out-way the negatives, gameplay is still fun and there is a lot to see and do, there is a good package here for just $5. If you enjoy zombie games like State of Decay which is also similar, then you will have no serious problems with this game.Survivalist has my seal of approval.			"

												OKAY so this is my first ever review. I want to state i was unsure about the game due to some of the negative reviews regarding the how the zombies are too fast and stuff like that. I dont think they are. Like when they come of no where it reminds me of World War Z zombies from the brad pitt movie. i think its good. I do think the way you can get bullets is way to easy. You can see the game lacks graphics but the gameplay makes up for it. This game is great so just buy it.			"

												For only $5 bucks, well worth it all. Only wish they'd add more custom content/less linear world, maybe workshop it to allow mods. If it was open, randomly generated world, it'd be topnotch. Still, it's a good story line with plenty of choices to make each way things happen different. Be nice or just shoot everyone in the face. Have fun in many ways.			"

												I Have spent a few good hours on this game and felt it worthy of writing a rewiew. I have enjoyed this title so far, Even thought I feel like the controls are made for a controller more than a keyboard every thing is still responds smoothly. There are a lot of interactions with NPC in this game, some of the dialog is very funny, and what you choose to say can affect the story. I have found this game to be one of those that you better save often or youll find yourself loosing a few hours of game play because you saved three hours before you got infected, or injured. I like the NPC team control in this game. You must keep track of your survivors health and sleep statistics, or at least make sure they have food and water available to eat and drink themselves. You can send survivors in different directions and on different quest at the same time. There is a system that allows you to give orders and the survivors will use their own AI to complete the task given. So far I have one fetching water, one fetching wood, and the other is completeing the story quest. Ammo is sometimes hard to come by in this game and youll need a lot of it to level your firearm skills. Dont allow the infected to bite you as the antigen is hard to come by and is very expensive. I think this game has a neat User Interface it is simple I really enjoy the action camera view in the UI. So far what ive explored of the map is pretty fun, not knowing whats ahead always makes things tense however I feel that the survivors would be able to see a bit further than they are able to in the game, but then they wouldn't have so many suprise infected moments.     For those who are looking for a fun single player game with a good setting,story, and action then I can easily reccommend this game. If you are wanting a sandbox, openworld, build it yourself then I reccommend 7 Days to Die because this is a different type of game. I have had no issues with performance on this game either everything worked very smooth from the beginning. I am using Windows 7 x64 and Radion HD 5450 series video card. Overall I could easily give this game a 9/10 score. The only reason it didn't get 10 is every good game can use more content, or even a coop player mode right?			"

												Every time I'm playing this I feel like I'm playing a part of The Walking Dead series which is pretty cool. Granted there are things missing such as Daryl's crossbow, but Survivalist captures the overall feeling of trying to survive against zombies  looters and the like.This game is hard though, and not everything is intuitive, so it takes a while to get used to. But once you get into it, you look at efficiency: How can I minimise the trips I need to carry these wood planks? Farm up lots of food? Take out these looters with minimum injuries? It's a great game, one of the best indie games, made by a single person. Play it!			"

Sure its a little rough around the edges and the controls take a few mins to get used to if you don't have a joypad, but my god this game is good. If you are a fan of survival strategy / simulation games then I urge you to buy this now, don't wait for it to go on sale that just a massive insult to the dev. Seriously if I had paid £9.99 for this I would not have been dissapointed.Just wish it had trading cards so I could support the dev with more of my money			"

												As a new comer to indie games, I was slightly skepticle about spending the $5 for it.  Thankfully there is a demo available for it, and after I played the demo, I was sold.  Best way to describe Sruvivalist would be a ""post apocalyptic, zombie survival, base building, resource gathering goodness"".  While the graphics may not be ""top of the line"", and the camera cannot zoom in or out(same with minimap), and at the moment; there really are only three guns available(been unable to locate the sniper rifle if it is in game yet; found plenty of ammo but no gun,  the gameplay itself is very solid.  The music is well made, and the idea of being able to improve relations with various survivor groups around you to possiably recruit them later is very nice.  On top of the basic find food, water, guns and ammo, the devs also included a twist of one of the survivors you find that joins up with you, needs insuline b/c they are type-1 diabetic; resulting in some nail biting moments when running to the nearest trader in hopes they have some left for sale to save her life.  Melee is fun, but much more enjoyable when using a fire arm.  Filling a zombie with lead and then kicking them away is entertaining as well as if the slo-mo kills get combined into it.  One of my personal favorite things they did for this game is to allow you to build your own base (once you find a survivor that can help build, but they are near by in the beginning ;) ).  Base building can seem pretty straight forward, build a wall here, gate there, tower over here, shack over there.  However, to build the base, you need supplies, aka lumber, chicken wire, cement, ect ect ect.  This causes you to either just let one person build, than go out alone to gather supplies(which will only be one of each since the mats weigh so much), or send out a few ppl to gather the mats, so the builder can stay safely tucked away in the base and they can protect each other?  Mean while, you can keep exploring and looting.  Also enjoy the fact that you can start growing your own food and make a well, creating a self sufficent base.Sometimes while exploring you will find small camps of looters, that want nothing more than what you have, and they will attack.  A nice feature is sometimes, one of them will surrender, and offer to join you if you wish, leaving you the choice to take them in, take all of their stuff, or kill them.  Many npcs will have quests, and there are a few times where ""things are not as they seem"" with the quest, adding to the depth of the game.  There are so many positive things that can be said about this game they greatly reduce or destroy any negativity I may have about it.  It is after all, a indie game.  For $5, you get more out of it than many $20 + games made by reconized labels.  I'd have no qualms about spending $10 for this game. I'd highly recommend this game to any one, and if you are unsure, check out the demo first.			"

												A fantastic game. I was slow to playing and finishing it, I never had much time to play games these days.I finally got around to it now, 50 hours in 2 weeks or so, and I feel positive about the ending that I followed.-The game allows you to build a new thriving society however and where ever you want in the game world, but you're limited to the supplies you have and can find.-Zombies. It is a zombie survival game but it's not boring. It has an interesting and depressing story behind it where there are no right answers.-Karma. A Karma like system exist in which NPCs will either like you or hate you to a certain degree. Some will like you so much that the price of items go down while those who hate you will leave your community or outright attack you.-Scavenge. It wouldn't be a survival game without some scavenging involved. Set up supply routes with your survivors to keep your flow of wood, wire, and cement going strong. Be wary of Looter Gangs and Infected Hordes that emerge from the small towns.-Control or command. Control each survivor in your community individually or command them as a group as you would an RTS. Issue orders such as Guard, Farm, or Supply run to keep them busy. Don't worry about their needs. If they need food, water or sleep, they can do so themselves and return to their assigned duties. I found it useful to have a larger community with good fighters to cover the Watch Towers. So say 10 Watch Towers, with 20 Guards on shifts. One guard goes to sleep the others take their place. Giving the community 24/7 protection from anyone or anything sneaking in, and the buggers do manage to sneak in if you're not careful.-Story. There is a story involved and it's good. You meet your main character Joe Wheeler, likely of Captain Planet fame which explains why he's so despicable. He survived in a Bunker for a year but now needs to venture out. He meets a damsel in distress. Ok cool, what does she need? Oh that's easy. Kill her sister... well she's infected so good news. Bad news is telling her she's infected. I am joking. Now Alice Ivers plays as your secondary main. Her Chat options are much kinder than Wheelers and will achieve more friendships than Wheeler will who is better off as an imposing figure to intimidate people to his will. Finally we meet the third character who players only use to build the base. Isham Seely, the sole survivor of his community who joins up to assist in helping Alice with her problem. She needs Insulin and there isn't a lot to go around.So now with Wheeler as a fighter, Alice as a healer, and Isham as a builder, you're off to a great start to playing this game the best to your ability to swindle, convince, fight, and manipulate others, or, are you being manipulated yourself by those you trust the most? Honestly, I trust the Antagonists of this game more than I do any one else. At least they're honest about what they do.After 85 hours now, I feel accomplished. What an experience and for a very low price. This is a survival game that doesn't get boring so easily. The map isn't too big, there are over 400+ characters with their own stories and needs, and you can choose to help them or kill them outright. You can build your home where you need it to be or build multiple homes. Burn homes down, take over territories, whatever. It was a blast and I cannot recommend it anymore than I can right now.I never knew this game was going to be so damn good.			"

												My first review ever but I think the developer of this game deserves it, considering, from what I've read, that it is only him and he isn't even dedicating all his time to it.This game is one of my best purchases ever, and for only 5€! It's simple but still it offers different developments according to your choices interacting with other survivalists. There could be many improvements, of course, but I appreciate the effort in creating successfully an original and very fun game.I love the idea of creating a community and making it sustainable and protected, assigning a function to EACH of the members in the community. I've been completely addicted to the game until I first defeated Los Ceros, afterwards I have so many people in the community I need time to adjust it.. "

												Erm why do my hours dont add up? anywho its a good zombie survival game with a decent story line and well highly recommended for the price range. It doesn't need a powerful computer to run and I think your grandpa's pc will be sufficient as well.You start solo and then can expand into a community which enables you to control any character in your group. Yes, you do need to gather food supplies, ammo, water and well medical supplies like any other zombie survival game by either scavenging or trading with other npcs. What I like most about this game is the challenge it might provide as well as the little details the developer managed to fit in such a light game. One of the initial, rather a major character suffers from diabetes so you need to find some specific medicines for her from time to time. As you over use a character, it becomes tired and end up being less productive so you are forced to shuffle which is a POSITIVE here. You can kill any character and decide if you want to complete a mission or not. It has base building which is pretty straight forward and unlike other games, it takes real man hours to complete construction (an NPC fetches resources and builds).I could go in detail (not really) but lets keep it short. Using steam rating logic I rate this game 11 out of 10.			"

I was hoping this was going to be a great game, it is full of great ideas but as a whole it is very poorly designed and put together.One of my biggest issues is the ""fog of war"" that covers everything and is only revealed when you get REALLY close to it.  As in I'm sure even someone with poor vision could at least see the outline of a building 20 feet away, but it's blacked out for no good reason until I get close enough to spit on it.  Combat is often initiated because you can't see things coming due to the ""FOW"" and the zeds get on top of you so fast you can't do much about it.  The combat controls are crappy at best, however I do like that you can initiate a kick while holding a pistol or other weapon.  Lots of games would make you put the weapon away to kick or punch.   The building aspect is a good idea but I haven't bothered trying to drag around enough stuff to build anything so I'm not sure if it's useful or more trouble than it's worth, however that is something more zombie survival genre games need so I give the game a solid +1 for adding that.I guess if you love the genre pick this up on sale, otherwise steer clear.  Despite not really liking the game I'll probably still play it a bit here and there since I see potential there.  Just wish I'd paid even less than I did.  Got my fingers crossed that this game gets straightened out soon.			"

												A decent Indie Zombie Survival Management RPG. Can be a little slow, but building your homestead up and recruiting other survivors is quite satisfying. My only real critiscim is the lack of a full map (only a mini map is in the game at the time of writing). When sending my happless volunteers off to find supplies/do quests, Id rather not have to scroll a fair distance to to point out their destination.Obviously if you want fancy graphics and a bit more of a story based game, your better of with State of Decay but this is still worth a punt if the price is right.

												This is a game about choices if you refuse to compromise on your morals you will be in for a more difficult time and if you compromise you might have it easier but blood will be spilt and it will have consequences if your not careful, this is an excellent game that i was very suprised with it is a bit clunky but it has a good sized world some quests and some decisions, the zombies can be real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and can really give you hell but the people are the ones to look out for, buy this game and take your time to learn it because you might just find that like me the game has more to offer than it initially seems.

												This game is fantastic.  A full game (no lame DLC or disgusting micro-transactions) at a fair price.  Everyone should support this kind of game development.  This is a zombie survival game that you can actually win!  In fact, you have a choice of three winning conditions, making the game a replayable instant indie classic.  With better production values than many AAA games, this gave is clearly a labor of love on behalf of its designer.  A developer who cares about the quality of his or her game is a rarity in this era of broken releases and Early Access rip-offs.  Support this game, and you won't be disapointed.			"

												Great game with interesting mechanics and clever quests. Most aspects of true surviving are present and they take time to establish (food supply, proper defence, etc). This game is way underpriced imo, because there are a lot of peace of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥products on Steam that cost 10x more and provide less interesting and thought up gameplay. So don't let the shabby graphics fool you, this game is great!P.S: It makes me sad to think what will happen if I use up all insulin available at the map and won't complete the game yet. I put too much effort to obtain it this far just to let it go, on the other hand i'm not a fan of a fast playthrough and that chick is a certain time limit device. You are too cruel, Bob!			"

												On Steam most $5 games are worth less than the money you paid. This one however really is a bargin at $5, plays better than some $15-$20 games I have bought. I was afraid in reading some of the reviews that the Zombies would be too fast for me since I kind of suck at first person shooters and while it did take me a little while to get used to the controls used I actually found combat and Zombies to be pretty good. Yes the Zombies are fast and some (depending on the strain of the infection) are faster than others but I was able to handle it fine. I loved the town aspects and building your group of suvivors and you should know the choices you make, how you treat others (both good and bad) have bearing and consquences, including who will join your group and who will stay. Super fun game especially at the bargin price of $5! I hope to see more from this Dev.			"

												This game doesn't look pretty, but it gets the job done, I'll give it a 9/10 considering the developer did this by himself with a shoestring budget, and the game is 5 dollars. This is probably one of the best survivally games I have played, Imagine if state of decay had a great, robust orders system with an ai squad system and gave you full control over all your guys, thats this game.The game is basically a rough diamond. The animations a bit janky, the lack of a down/revive system means your allies that you need to keep alive long term can just get permakilled at random in combat, but the game has community management, base building, skill improvement, and a pretty great story, as well as character relationship systems.

Much better than Dead State or some other zombie survival games out there that you pay alot more for.			"

												This is quite literally one of the BEST indie games i have EVER played. It made it into my top 5 and it should be in yours if its not already. This game has so much content i was baffled that it only cost 5 dollars. The game lets you choose your own goals which effect the storyline, theres fantastic combat, zombies dont respawn which some might consider a negative but i actually like that since you can effectively set up safe zones where theres no threat of attack, but even then if you enter a major township a pack of zombies or lotters might pick up your scent and follow you back to your base. The looting is amazing, i was always excited to see what new buildings held and what i was gunna bring home with me. The character interaction is top notch, you can switch to any player in your community at any time and control them as you would the main character, and so the character you currently control will have different views of different people and people outside your community will see that character differently than your main character, which makes character selection when interacting with other communities very important. Lastly, the build up to the final fight and the final fight itself with los ceros is amazing. I was losing it trying to make sure that everyone in my community was geared up for a good fight, and we certaintly had a good fight which was quite satisfying. I'll say it now, I WANT ANOTHER!!!! Gimme a damn sequel and i'll play the hell out of it. I LOVE THIS GAME! I will support it to the ends of the earth and you should to! This game is just 5 bucks and youll get countless hours of fun out of it so what the hell are you waiting for? GET IT!!!!			"

												A very well made game. The graphic and layout may gives an impression of a cheap and sub par game but when you try it, you know you were wrong. Well, after you finished the tutorial of course. The first few hours of the game might be boring but if you stick to it until you get your base, that's the real fun and action really starts.Pro: - Nice story. It is not a blockbuster, but it is not as simple as save-the-damsel-in-distress-but-she-is-in-another-castle linear type of story.- Nice implementation of RPG gameplay. You start weak, you end strong. You start poor, you end rich. You start with fist, you end with a rocket launcher. You start alive, you end dead, at least couple of time for me near the end.- Nice action/combat. It's kinda simplistic, but fits well with the gameplay. Some people dislike the targeting system where with the lowest skill, you can even miss at melee distance. For me it is done well as you can improves it with firearm skill. It's better than not being able to use certain weapon due to not meeting the requirement. You want to use a rifle? You can, but you'll waste lots of rifle bullets. If the rifle bullets are too precious, keep using the gun until you get better with your aiming.- Nice enemy. Some people dislike the infected being able to detect you from distance and ambush you. I think that's brilliant. It will give you a sense of fear and always be careful when exploring especially new area. It's not zombicalypse if you're not fear for your life. You're not only dealing with zombie, but also with human. - Adequate partial RTS. You can build a base, or multiple bases. You can provide shelter and create a self sustain community. Fend off gang of raiders or zombies. I would love to have more choice, but it is adequate for the game.- It's a survival. You need to eat, you need to drink, you need to sleep, you need to make lov...maybe not. Be prepare for your adventure and scavenge as needed.- Choices you make, affect the game. All those people you kill, all those people you shakedown, all those presents you give, will affect others.- There are no ""I'm the kindest, purest, friendliest, generous"" type of gameplay. It's a state of emergency, act like one.- Large map. It is kinda empty, but it is large.Cons:- Slow tutorial. The tutorial is embedded within the storyline. It'll be a while before you'll complete the tutorial and left only with a real quest. Before the tutorial completed, the game kinda boring, which turn off some of the players.- Some part of the objective give you a sense of rushing towards the ends. You don't have all the time in the world to explore the map (in the beginning). It's part of the story, and with a good reason to do so, but some people just get annoyed by it. Me included. After finishing the game, I'm glad it's there. It serves a purpose. A valid purpose.- Super equipment to know everything. I'm not sure why it's there, but it feels like a cheat.- After you established a self sustain base, the survival part of the game feels empty. Corns are way too effective that it's becoming a trading commodity.			"

												I like the game, it`s pretty deep with a ""nice"" story that keeps you going. There`s a lot of stuff to do and a BIG map to explore (with FoW). Farming, quests, building and more... For only $3 it`s a steal and worth it for sure :-)One thing I keep doing is trying to tilt the camera down from a top down view but no such luck...Works like a charm with my DS4 controller and the menus are nice and tidy.I wish I could set the autosave to a shorter timeframe (I always forget to save, and I die a lot).- I only got a few hours (so far) but this is a game you could spend A LOT of time in, and as I said for only $3 it`s a lot of bang for your buck!+ Nice setting (I like the apocalypse theme).+ Great skill leveling system.+ Farming.+ Base building.+ PvE (you have to manage thirst, food, sleep etc.).+ Detailed quests.- ""Easy mode"" (I`m a wimp).- ""Zombies"" are crazy fast (not just a bad thing, but it scares the crap out of me).- Lack of autosave option.Do I recommend this game? YES!!!			"

												Alice: ""I feel really guilty for killing [Isham].""Me IRL: ""Jesus, Alice, I'm REALLY SORRY, but I kinda forgot to give you a damn.""But in all seriousness, this game is pretty fun. It's a game that is somewhat like Rebuild, except every character is unique.EVERY. SINGLE. MAN AND WOMAN.The game is quite hands-on in comparison to Rebuild; You can control each seperate character, and everyone has seperate inventories which means that if you want to keep people alive, you can't just plonk down some farms.You'll need to grab it all, and protect it, and just generally keep it afloat. Looters will find your people, or you will find their camps, and then they'll rob you, and it's not a case of ""SHOOT 'EM, BE A HERO"". Do that only if you enjoy shotguns and snipers to the chest.But I've raved about nothing. :p Just look around; The game isn't to everyone's taste. "

Product received for free
												Survivalist is an open world RPG best played with friends, to enjoy the Zombie apocalypse together in a cozy bunker and provide to your little community. Without other players it is possible to give tasks to the different characters that can be recruited, and I was surprised to see that the AI did a good job managing them.The different systems for survival are logical and work well, without being too hardcore to be a hassle. Survival is definitely not a constant chore as in Don't Starve. Killing a Zombie is easy... Except when there starts to be more of them. Shooting is not too fast, it's not a shoot'em'up, but it still works well enough to balance fun and tension, especially when it becomes possible to aim specific body parts.Just don't expect too deep. Not much is said about each characters, they just all have enough to be different,  Overall it's a light take on The Walking Dead, free for you to express your own story.The graphics seem a bit poor at first, but once again this is very functional as the zoomed-in/portrait camera allows to give more personality than a top-down view would do alone, and ends up being quite endearing.To conclude, Survivalist managed to be enjoyable to me despite not liking survivals and RPGs. I found that it is because all its systems are very functional. Everything is well done, a perfect balance between easy and difficult. Enough complexity without being unforgiving and annoying.

It's a mixture of sandbox & survival but the thing that makes this (often repeated mixture) stand out is that it's strategic gameplay. If you've ever imagined what it would be like to really run & manage a group of survivors of a zombie outbreak, then this is your best bet.If you like Kenshi you'll almost definitley like this. If you played State of Decay but wanted more management and less action then you'll definitley like this.			"

												My name is Joe Wheeler, its been 364 days since the end of the world, im out of food and water, tomorrow i will venture onto the surface in search of more.So i walked down the road in search of my car, its still there, parked where i left it, but it doesnt work anymore, and not only that but there was a corpse lying beside it. When i ventured closer to the corpse it stood up, so i proceeded to ruin my suit and bash the corpses head in with my bare hands.The corpse had within its pockets a loaded gun and a large amount of extra ammunition for it. I needed to find a town, and people. My radio let me know of an sos call nearby that i might check out. Probably not, i dont like getting involved with other peoples♥♥♥♥♥♥ On my way down the road i found another corpse, it stood up yet again, but i was expecting this and i had my new found pistol ready, it took me a few shots, roughly about a clip before i got lucky and put a bullet between the blazing green eyes.It was quicker and easier than the first corpse, but i still missed alot so i decided to train a bit on a nearby parking sign. I got a few good shots in and decided to continue into the nearby town because that was still the reason i was out here right now.So i found some food, and decided i would in fact check out that sos call. Who knows, maybe they have some food or something i can have?I met a girl and killed her sisters corpse, this one had red eyes, i wonder if that means anything, i think it does, all of my shots landed thanks to my training on the sign, but it still took almost 4 entire clips to put her down. The girls started following me around now, apparently she was headed for a different town before she and her sister were attacked by other living corpses.We ran into another man, he gave us some insulin (the girl turns out to be diabetic, who knew) and offered to help us hold up somewhere, he tells us he knows a thing or two about building, and he'll even gather the supplies himself.Well not long after, i was just out looking for food and now im lying here bitten and bleeding out quickly. I'm not going any further than this. So i guess this is the end for Joe Wheeler huh? Oh well, lifes a ♥♥♥♥♥ and then you die heh...These were my first about 20 minutes of survivalist, and i have to say its an excellent game, despite its age and cheap price, its excellent and has a very deep gameplay. By this i mean, its not a tps or an fps, or anything of the sorts. Its a very in depth survival game where food, water, sleep and even insulin are all required to live. It has a good learning curve, as long as your not an idiot like me, where your fairly babied here and there, your first two enemies can barely move, and even if they catch you, just tap space and your fine, but your third enemy, is a sprinting zombie who jumps out of nowhere and tackles you, and moves too quickly to aim your gun at properly, but get tackled 4-5 times without getting a shot in and the game says ""hey, moron, SIDESTEP"" which in turn, dodges the attack and gives you time to aim your gun. This game is really cool and one awesome thing is in the top right corner theres a little window which shows events as they happen, if you swing a punch, you get a full body view of your character swinging said punch, if your talking to someone, the camera alternates between each persons faces. But the game isnt without fault, a strange and unchangable camera angle forces a omewhat top down view which i enjoy, however you cant change it, and id like even a SMALL amount of ability to change it apart from simple 360 degree rotations. And theres also the fact that while tutorial missions do baby you a tad, when theyre done, thats it, zombies come in different levels, green being the lowest, then blue, red and apparently theres a ""White super zombie race"" each gets progressively stronger and all the tutorial missions are against green and thats it, with a single red but theyre somewhre u can hit them but they cant hit you so that doesnt matter, but i accidentally wandered the wrong way and got instantaneusly mauled to death by a hord of about 15 blues.But this game is still amazing, and cheap as dirt, i would have happily payed triple what i did for it just to support the developers. 10/10			"

												This is one of the games I purchased on summer sale and the cheapest I bought on that sale(I even bought my brother because it got co op). to our surprise, this is the game we are most addicted to. although theres more improvement to be done, its worth it even though its not on sale. Its like.. (based on my experience) jagged alliance BIA with zombies + coop. the moving zombie face (zombie horde) in the map really reminds me of jagged alliance BIA.			"

												I was expecting buggy 90's gaming throwbacks based on the screenshots. And it's a yet another wombie-game...But the positive reviews and the low price during the Summer Sale convinced me to pick it up and give it a whirl. I've been whirling since. I have been playing several hours and still can't decide whether I should continue exploring or expanding my base. Or moving my base elsewhere? I wouldn't know. I'm too wrapped up in this game and its surprisingly suspenseful gameplay. This is more of a RPG than an action game, but you can't win on auto-pilot: you need a strategy and some decent reflexes. Or the firepower to make up for it. I can't even create a coherent review now that I'm not playing. I'm thinking of strategies to build and strengthen my community without invoking war...The map has its limits but it looks pretty big and the side-quests seem endless, so this game will probably have me hooked for a good 100 hours or so. By far the best game I've picked up this Summer Sale.			"

												(I made this review short and simple to avoid any spoilers) Once my demo time was about to expire i said ""nooooo!"" because I was thoroughly enjoying the game. For 5$ this game is a steal. In order to avoid spoilers, I'll just say there's a lot of content in this game (including choices, dialogue options, and the ability to be a normal person or a straight up nuisance to everyone). My only problem, which isn't a problem I just think it's funny, is the zombies snarl kinda like dogs. There's dozens of hours to put in this game which I will definitely be doing. 'Grats developer; you did good.( i deleted this to edit it because i was adressing an issue but i've found out i'm just an idiot)			"

												This game has complete inovative and never heard before story.. Not... Hehe, but even though it's about zombies which has been chewed to the death it bring something that should count the most in games world, playability! And this game has it in abundance! I'll try to review it without spoilers :)It's about John Wheeler, some broker dude who did some fine investments in his life that made possible for him to buy a shelter in the desert.. All hell broke loose, he hid there for one year until his supplies run out and decided to get out of bunker..That's where you start leading this dude through his adventure. Game is incredible because only one dude made it! And he managed to implement many great aspects like character development, relationships with npc's, trading and even some RTS and building elements!Like I said, you are John Wheeler, no nonsense dude, who wants to survive zombie outbreak, and (depends of the player decision), achieve his life goal of love/money/power. It has sort of isometric view, game is very fluid, it offers few standard weapons and enemies, and besides outer danger, you have to take care of sleep, hunger and thirst.. So, especially in the beginning, save water and food cans :)As you progress through the game, it gives you option to make a settlement, recruit people to join your cause, plant corn, build wells etc.. Interesting part is that you can control everyone who is in your settlement/group, so when Wheeler needs to sleep, you just play with other characters..Almost everyone is ""expendable"", except Wheeler, which gives you much freedom.. Ofc., you can save game anytime, so if you are opsessive like me, you can always do missions without casualties :)..Ofcource, people can leave your camp, based on your actions and their approval of those actions. Some people will approve your violent nature, some won't etc.. Be careful when you recruit people, because if you recruit people from opposing camps, they will attack if they run across eachother regardless of their current ""group"". PRO- very interesting main story with many intriguing side missions like saving people from zombies, other people, burning stuff, building stuff, finding missing persons, their stuff..- great playability and replayability!,- easy to use/comprehend inventory and trading systems,- very good balance between story and action,- 4 player coop online, one player can scavange, one build settlement, one just killing and grinding characters, one doing missions!,- almost everything :)CONS (remember, this game has CONS only if you compare it with some blockbuster games, but remember, one dude made this game, so taken this into account, every CON here is irrelevant)- it could use some more items for food or drink, it only has corn and dog food.. And only water for drinking (and wine, but wine is used for increasing relationship status with NPS's)- shortness hahahaha, well, game isn't short, it is actually pretty long, but after you finish it, it gives you that feeling ""I WANT MORE"" hehheThis game is a must have, if you want hours of fun and exploaration, action, story telling, if you want to see how world gets on based on your decision (directly and indirectly), i.e. I once expelled one dude from my settlement, gave him gun, few bullets and let him go.. About few hours later, while scavanging, that same dude, now zombified killed two dudes from my group XD. Your actions have very lasting consequences..Big shout to Bob the P.R Bot, the dude who made this great game (something tells me that it's not his real name :/..p.s. It also offers 4 coop online which is incredible to play! Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more. Free Keys and Reviews weekly!

Blog Review: http://wildwoodgeek2.blogspot.com/2015/05/pc-game-review-survivalist.htmlWhat Survivalist did RightNice building systema cool feature in Survivalist is the building. you can build fences and razor wire to protect your chosen home base, protecting you from zombie hordes and raiders. you build houses for your followers and fellow survivors. you can build bunkers to give you an edge when fighting gun wielding hostiles. by the late game you'll have a nice little town. Large open world to exploresomething that Survivalist did right is its large open world for you to explore. you can also set up your base anywhere you want Hostile Factions Attack eventsthe cities are the best places to find loot and food but going into them often will cause your base to be attacked by looters or zombie hordes. this adds some nice challenge to the game, it makes it dangerous to visit the cities a lot.What Survivalist did Wrong No real choices in dialogue several times during the game you will be able to make dialogue “choices”. the only problem is that they really aren't choices.  you will get three ways to be a jerk without the choice to be  nice or understanding. or you will get three ways to be nice and understanding without a choice to be a jerk. Zombies are way too fastZombies in Survivalist run as fast, if not faster than a speeding car. im not  joking. when you see a zombie it will be on top of you in 1 to 2 seconds. Worst shooting system in a game evershooting in Survivalist is horrible. really horrible. if shooting worked this way in real life armies would be still be using swords. when you aim at a zombie or hostile NPC you have to wait about 5 to 10 seconds to even have a chance of hitting them. and if you or they move your “aiming” resets completely. and with the zombies being so fast it makes it impossible to wait to aim. also hostile NPCs seem to have pin-point accuracy hitting you virtually every shot. Way too fast Day/Night systemSurvivalist has a Day/Night system. during night your view is even more limited and more zombies are racing about. the problem is that the day is about six minutes. you and all your friends are weaklingsthis makes sense for you. i mean you’re a hedge fund manager. but why is every friendly person a weak shell of a human being? by that i mean that they will run out of stamina after just a few seconds of running. or they can only hold a few things of food before running out of storage space. Annoyingly unhelpful Tutorial In Survivalist they have kind of “learn as you go” tutorial. you play in the game world while they teach you want to do. the problem is it doesn't work. as i was leaving my bunker for the first mission i got hurt and needed to heal. but because they had to tell me how to open my inventory i couldn't. they didn't give me the pop-up message on how to open inventory until i got to a certain place. the problem with that is that there are two very strong zombies  in the way between me and that place, and with my person slowed even more by the wound i already had i could barely get past them.  Bad inventory systemanother annoying thing in Survivalist is the fact that you can’t not drop things. you can only destroy them. also you can not select how much you want to destroy, you can only destroy the whole stack. this was really annoying to me as during my play through i had too much stuff and had already gotten ridden of all the junk out of my pack. i had a 50X stack of gold and if i dropped 10 i would be good. but i couldn't so i had to lose my 50 pieces of gold. Bad graphicsI know I know, graphics aren't everything. but Survivalist looks worse than a PS2 game. everything is jagged and blurry.Final ThoughtsSurvivalist is by no means the best RPG zombie game out there, but it isn't the worst. if you really like RPGs and/or zombie games you should try Survivalist. and if you hate it you've only lost 5 bucks.

												This game is an arcade like, zombie survival game that substitute the horror with techno rave like music, in other words, humour. The game is highly addictive after you get used to the animation but hey, some of the best games are made in ASCII.Despite it having maybe some bad traits with the graphics and at times FPS problems, then it is a great find! Easy to understand, hard to solve! This is an open-world game where you can decide what you want to do. The story is intriguing and gives you a meaning to the world around you, giving you a reason to move and explore the world instead of just surviving. Gather people, become stronger, withstand and survive the vast world!I highly recommend this game if you just feel like surviving zombie apocalypse with funky techno music, doing whatever you want, saving, taking over or destroying whatever you want, with consequences to doing so. Your choice, you're the big man here.			"

												As with all open world games, it starts off pretty slowly, leading you through the tutorial with minimal effort. After that, the game seems to slow down. It doesn't of course, but while you've got your main guy out exploring, shooting zombies, etc, the girl you pick up sleeps for about two days (and so you can't do anything with her), and the construction guy (no, not Emmett) walks at a snail's pace between your camp and the local hardware store, bringing back a single plank at a time so he can start building walls, shacks, even toilets.That said, this is about the only complaint I have about the game. The rest of it is simple (gameplay, not difficulty), intuitive, and fun. Just... While you're exploring, don't forget to save regularly. It's pretty easy to wander out of your 'safe' zones, and if that happens, you're going to be the one seeking breakfast brains.			"

												This game is worth more than the $5 the developers ask for. The gameplay is amazing and overcompensates for the graphics which aren't too shabby in all honesty. The game has a lot of potential and is a must for RPG fans. You can choose how to interact with all of the world, whether you want to put a bullet in every living thing or be a complete pacifist you can do whatever you want, whenever you want. The only real problem is that the main quest makes the game somewhat linear and can get annoying at some points. The whole ""get insulin for a useless npc"" gets tiring after a while and I would hope they remove that completely. However irritating Alice is, the game is still an amazing title.			"

												This game is pretty fun and intuitive as to how it works.  I didn't have any trouble mastering the controls within half an hour.  You die very, very quickly if you don't play properly, but it's easy enough to survive if you plan ahead.  The prices on goods from traders are pretty steep in general, especially medicines.  Food and water can be grown in your settlements, but you can't make medicines or guns/equipment AFAIK.That being said, however, the soundtrack is awful.  It's very unfitting for a game of this type.Also, F&*K DIABETES!!! "

												I'm blown away by how fun and challenging this game is, even the story is good which you don't really find in these type of games. I can't believe it was only $5 it's worth at least $20.I restarted after I decided to let a certain person die and now I play at my own pace, building up my stronghold, exploring the map, recruiting people, finding out the big picture as well as the little side quests that add a lot of story and interesting details.It has RPG elements in that you and other survivors that may join you have skills. Some will be good at shooting or medical, others are good at building or farming. All these skills will level up, slowly, as you use them.It also has the survival/building element. You have to secure your base, wherever you decide that may be. You scavenge for wood, wire, cement and then build them into walls homes and defensive structures. There is no mining or woodcutting so there is a limited amount of materials so you must plan well.The pacing is really good. the zombies close to the starting area are easy, but at the beginning you have few weapons and low skill so they are a challenge as well. As you progress and go out into the map further the zombies are tougher so it scales well to your abilites and weapons. It helps to bring along a friend.The only setback that may turn some people off is the perspective. It initially seems like the view area is too small but this is done so that you can't see the zombies and other threats from a mile away. It may seem annoying when you 1st start the game but you will quickly get used to it. It gets much better with a sniper rifle.I have sunk a lot of hours into it already and I feel like I'm only about half way. There are tons of areas of the map to explore still and a lot of quests left. This is one of those ""I can't stop playing"" games!Edit: updating for Steam nomination. This is a great game!			"

												It catched me in just 3 hours. This review can change in the next days I keep playing, but at the moment I can say it's a deep game.About the PROS: If you like background stories, there's a lot of microstories as you do  your main quests. As in any other sandbox worth his salt, you can chose to do your quests or just roam for loot and improve your base. I'm not used at all to play multi-character RPGs so I can say this game makes it easy to control different characters, doing different actions in different parts of the map. That's so enjoyable because you can just ask your stronger man to go and search for heavy supplies for your base while your gardener keeps farming and your firegunner roam killing bandits or doing missions. And you can chose who you control, or you just can take care of them all. The AI is pretty good despite some path errors, the zombies are hard enough to beat in numbers and easy enough to kill one by one. The freedom to chose your playstyle as bandit, hero, neutral, or whatever is great -a guy wanted me to pay him 75 coins for a cure of the infection, I bribed him with an item 10-15 coins worth, he now wanted me to pay him ""just"" 73 coins for the cure. I killed him, got a lot of coins and the cure-.About the CONS: I feel there's so little variety of weapons. It doesn's seem like more will be added since every weapon has already a hotkey number 1-9. This is not really a negative aspect, but sometimes is hard to end missions cause the guys who give them to you go and fight and sometimes die, so you have to chose between loading the game or keep going without the mission. Too many ammo. Sometimes you forget it's an apocalypse because since the beggining of the game the mainstory leads you to a weapon storage with 12000 (yes, you did read well) pistol bullets and like 500 shotgun shells and rifle ammo. Anyways you can buy bullets SO cheap. Its true that in the beggining you're not very acurate, and zombies needs more than 1 bullet most of the times, but I like to worry about my ammo when it's about the end of the world, and here you will just shoot like a rambo. I will edit the review while i keep playing, thx for reading!			"

												Most likely the best value I've gotten for 4,99€ EVER. It contains so much content and gameplay. The RPG system with decisions and reputation works very well (your choices to matter), action is simple and easy to understand, yet extremely entertaining. Society growth and base building is really fun and the storyline is interesting. Food and supplies are scarce and requires effort to gather which makes the survival aspect of the game feel real. Since online co-op mode is on the rise aswell, this game is looking to become one of the better survivalist projects out there in my opinion.The only negative thing I can mention about this game is the fact that there are some abusable bugs out there, such as bugs which allows you to gather more supplies than intended. Other than that, I can't really find anything negative.I really recommend this game to anyone out there who's looking for an interesting indie, society building, survival RPG-game.			"

												So I've played a lot of this game and it's pretty basic but that's kind of what makes it addictive and for the price I paid (I got this on sale so it was about £2) I was very happy with it. What is both a pro and a con is that the game is quite long and I'm yet to complete it. So i'm at a point where I've played nearly 30 hours and still haven't completed it, feeling a bit bored of it but still want to know the ending, but then again if it hadn't been as long it would have been disappointing as this is a game you will probably only play once. I haven't tried the multiplayer feature though which does look good. Another pro is the map is pretty huge which I personally like. Overall, yeh i'd say you should buy this game!			"

												My Personal ReviewGood things*The  detail is kick a$_$ for the price you pay for it.*The Sounds are   good for the price you pay as well.*Plain and simple its good for what you pay 4.99? i think so 5.00 dollars in plain words----------------------------------Bad  partsThe Game its exciting at the start but after awhile the game gets very dull n boring shoot this guy shoot the zombie go in building steal stuff run out.Thats pretty much it besides making a   some what of a  base which means placing  some walls,a gate n power for water n some guns that you find around.So from 1-10 i rate this game 5 as it could do sooo much better if they put more effort in to it.

												For a game made by one person. Its a gem. And at its 5 dollar price, even more so.The graphics may not be the best, and the AI may need some micromanaging at times, but those aside its an amazing game.The combat feels like an arcade shooter (Which I mean in a good way) and the base building is both solid and enjoyable. I've found myself redoing aspects of my base to try and better equip myself for raider attacks.Scavanging is simple and can be done in a number of ways, sending people in your community to auto walk stuff or sending teams of people in you control to get it done quicker, your choice.The story is great too. Could use some polishing and personal variety with the characters, but otherwise very solid.With that said, its hard to find a game that offers what this game does for the price it is. Go get it.

												I admit, originally when i saw this game i thought 'This is a nice concept though it doesn't seem very well executed, also looks kind of strange'. I bought the game thinking 'Might as well give it a try'. I played the game on the edge of my chair trying to keep my survivors alive for just another day. I still haven't stopped playing this game(I'm actually trying to complete a quest as i type this).Overall, this game is a fresh & interesting combination between a classic topdown zombie survival game, Sims & The Walking Dead. Pros:Not purely quest-driven. I've played more than my fair share of zombie games that are 'Go get X object, return the object to Y person, get Z reward and progress in the game'. Survivalist does away with the linear quest-driven system & replaces it with a nice 'Go do it if you want to, or if you don't just don't. We're not going to hold anything away from you if you don't'.If you're told 'Go and stop this gang' then you also have the choice of assimilating into your group/community instead of just marching in there & murdering everyoneA unique relationship system. Instead of the standard 'i like you, i don't' Survivalist has a twin-axis system of respect and approval. You can make someone do what you want by either making them like you, or fear you. They see you burn their village to the ground single-handedly then they'll fear you, if you save them from being bitten they'll like you.Well-balanced progressive gamplay that keeps you from becoming too powerful, whilst hard work/dedication/planning pay off greatlyCons:40 hours in and I'm yet to find something bad about the game that wasn't caused by oversight or just plain stupidity on my part			"

												Survivalist is an open world, survival RPG where you play as Joe Wheeler, a self-centered businessman who has built a bunker just before the apocalypse with resources sufficient for one year, lived in his bunker during the apocalypse without any connection with the outer world, and finally decided to go out into the wasteland when he got out of resources. He doesn't have the slightest idea about the events happened after the apocalypse, unfamiliar with the surroundings, people and of course zombies.Skip to the end for TL;DRI will start with pointing the best thing about this game: the atmosphere. The feeling of isolation, chaos and depression, which are the outcomes of apocalypse are perfectly reflected. There will be times when you will have tough chocies, times you have to decide between two parties and you can't simply pick the 'evil' out of the sides, as moral values/ethics are simply not valid anymore; in a world where looting is the only way to survive, killing a person is justified by a simple conflict of interest and overall, being strong is the ultimate goal of everyone. As humanity has taken a step back from the civilization, there are no laws and no enforcers. People have done what they had to do, in order to increase their chances to survive, they have gathered and started forming groups. There are small civilized settlements which started raising their own crops, outlanders, bandits, looters and all sorts of groups in game.  Now with such a case, a logical human being would find a decent community that shares his/her interests and join them. But Joe Wheeler happens to have a better idea; without knowing absolutely no one in this world and having nothing to offer, he will start building his own settlement. This is the goal of this game. To make Joe Wheeler lead the biggest/strongest settlement in the area (i.e. feed his ego). Other than the first two characters who join you within the progress of storyline, people are not willing to leave their current, steady systems and join your newly-founded formation. And neither they are going to do it for the sake of your baby face and well-tailored businessman suit. You have to convince them. People have flexible opinions about you and to make them join your group, you have to act accordingly.  You can either complete their quests, protect them from raids and deal with someone they dislike to make them respect you, or pick the correct approach with your dialogues and bribe them with rare trinkets (e.g. chocolates, wine, books etc.) to make them like you. Only then, you can have enough influence on them to make them join your group. Map is huge. And it is not empty at all. I need to say that I am really surprised with finding so much content here, as there are various events/characters/loot all around the map and this encourages discovering. Even when it gets really hard with lots zombies around, you know that you'll find something significant in that area and it definitely makes up to your effort.Story progression is in a way that teaches you the mechanics of the game, which is appropriate as the game has so many things to do and you need to get to the end step-by-step. You also get to recruit people, explore the world and have better equipment with side quests, alongside with getting in the middle of conflicts between the factions and overall the intriguing plot.   According to your play style, game almost always allows you to choose between a diplomatic and a violent approach. Every choice you make show it's unique consequence in story progression. While you may find it more beneficial to rock the boat and loot loads of corpses for items, recruiting people instead of killing them makes your group bigger and thus, increases your chance to survive. The game has a simple, strategy-game style of base building system. You need to have tools, materials and builders for building. You build houses, barns and wells for the needs of your group; and walls, watchtowers and pillboxes for the protection of your settlement. Protection around the settlement has to be set strategically, as there will be numerous zombie/rebel raids against your settlement and they get more frequent with the increasing population. The game sets a great balance for protection issues. If you assume that you will be perfectly safe after building wooden walls around your settlement, I am afraid you will soon find out how long it takes for a molotov coctail to burn down wood.  Protection is not the only issue. You need resources for your group. While you can usually find plenty of water around, food is not that easy to come by and you will quickly run out at some point. The game introduces another asset here: farming. This is also well implemented; you manage to feed your group with the food you scavenge around until the time you have access to crops/farming and after that, all you need to do is tasking some members of your group with farming and wait.  With more population, the amount of crops you have to plant also increases. I believe these are enough for convincing people this game is amazing in terms of its RPG and sandbox factors.Shooting mechanics are not hard if you follow some simple rules: stand still, aim and wait for the crosshair, shoot. Spraying is only a waste of bullets. The more you use weapons, you earn experience and get your firearms level up, this allows you to use more weapons and makes you shoot more effectively. Sound effects and graphics are quite good for an indie game; I haven't had any staggers or graphical glitches despite the huge map with various interactive elements.  The only negative I could think of would be the controls. They are kind of way-out and this may make the game seem tedious first, however I got used to them in my first two hours and understood the way things work, so it's not really a big issue if you are interested in playing the game. TL;DRI am simply amazed by the content I got from this game. Really well-made and fascinating in many aspects. Brilliant as a RPG, a survival, a sandbox and in the end, for this price, this game is a steal. Kudos to the developers for getting it right with their first game. I can't recommend this enough.Edit: Nominated for the “I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award” award.			"

												Overall it's a pretty okay game. I believe that if it had some kind of local co-op it'd be a whole lot better because it already has three survivors that you may control. In my opinion the top down camera gets a bit annoying as you can't see very far left or right because the screen is limited by the menu that is always to the right. The graphics aren't anything to be amazed by which is expected I guess you could say. For five dollars I would suggest it to anyone who likes the feeling of a singleplayer suvival game (oh yeah, and zombies).			"

												Potential, but it's really irritating that whenever I get attacked, a window pops up that stops me from moving, but doesn't pause the game, so I get injured, infected or killed.Every time I die, the auto save saves as I'm dying, so it keeps looping me to that point. I have to rush to exit to the main menu or else it just infinite loops. It seems programmed to do this. It has been EVERY time. Literally.The map is zoomed in so far that it's very difficult to see your surroundings. The zombies pounce you before you see them coming.There are quests to carry items... but items that are so heavy that you can only carry one at a time. However, the quest requires that you carry at least a dozen of the item, so you have to take a long time going back and forth to get all this crap.Getting infected is too easy, finding antigens is rare and most infections infect you so fast that even if you have the antigen, good luck using it before you're dead.If you are very injured and have bandages in your inventory, you can't use them. Sometimes it will randomly use bandages automatically.This could be fun, but there are too many problems.Pros: The zombies basically hump your brains out, which is sort of funny. "

												This game is great, it has its faults, but other than the small negatives I have for it, it is a great zombie survival game. You can litterally build as big or small of a community as you want, depending on how many people you can recruit, I dont know many games that allow you to do that. The only negatives I have for this game is that its LONG, and I mean it. I've currently played about 25 hours of it, and still havent completed it yet, and I'm breezing through the side missions. Its also tedious, with controlling your charactor manually or automatically, it gets boring fast.

												Don't dismiss this as yet another zombie survival game - this is a hidden gem which is well worth a look.There are so many great ideas - recruiting survivors, building a community (each of whom you can give orders to or control directly) relationships with every character which are tracked and affected by your actions, a variety of quests, building, crafting... While the game is somewhat linear, there are a few different endings and various ways to achieve them which adds replayability to a game which already has plenty of playtime potential.The graphics are functional, and while the isometric view is a bit limited, the cinematic window is a great touch. Some of the music tracks are earworms, if a bit grating after a while. The best bit is the writing, which is often amusing and occasionally touching.There's plenty of content and good ideas here for a low price.			"

												I got this game for 3 Euro during it's most recent sale and I'm glad I did. It's a really fun, open world game that feels quite unique compared to a lot of zombie games I've previously played. There are plenty of quests to keep you busy and you will also need to build defences at your base to keep looters and undead hordes away. Switching and controlling different characters is fairly straight forward and allows you to multi task with the members of your group with ease. Sometimes leaving group members to do tasks you've given them can get put off due to the character deciding he/she needs to find food/water first before continuing their task even when they're not overly hungry or thirsty. However, I think it's fair to say that this is the biggest problem I have with the game which isn't much of a problem, just a nuisance from time to time. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a simulation zombie game to put a decent amount of time into. To anyone who is interested in the game but not entirely sure on whether to buy the game or not, be sure to try the demo. It's what made my mind up			"

You can add more and more people to your community, build walls, homes and other things, people can do things on there own, without your direct control, like eating, drinking, sleeping and fighting zombies and bandits, you can just order them to farm, build, guard or bring home supplies, an they will do it while you do quests or explore. This game also has awesome and funny music:p			"

SurvivalistZombies? Check.Post-Apocalyptic Wasteland? Check.Base Building? Check.It all sounds very cliche, but it's pulled off - well. Instead of being focused on 1 area, it takes bits and pieces from each genre and creates a game that's worth playing, and definitely worth the price tag.Audio: ★★★★☆ [4/5]Well constructed music and sounds' guns sound like they pack a punch, panting when fatigued, the grunts and shuffling noises of the undead, lurking in the fog. The music is good, however some seems misplaced (too upbeat when you've just seen your community slaughtered, for example)Graphics: ★★★★☆ [4/5]Obviously, nobody is expecting top of the line graphics here, yet doing it like this has it's charm. It's cartoon-like appearance helps take away from the harshness of the surroundings, whilst still immersing you in what's going on around you. Some of the animations could of been improved though, however, for an indie game, personally graphics don't matter too much.Gameplay: ★★★★★ [5/5]Gameplay is a very important feature; the most important you could say. The gameplay is done flawlessly. Base building, whilst it could be expanded, is simple. The UI is easy to navigate, which is handy when you've got zombies swarming around you, with that looter party in the horizon getting ever closer. Guns are well thought out, and whilst slightly limited, each serves a role with perks and drawbacks for each. The RPG elements keep the game fresh, and keep you on your toes as to who is the best man for the job.Options: ★★★☆☆ [3/5]A range of languages to choose from and rebinding keys are big pro's for an indie game. However, the options menu's are let down by the lack of Graphical options (Resolution, Full-screen, and 60fps are your only options) and the sound sub-menu, whilst efficient and clear, when turning everything down to 0, some noises are still audible (such as panting).Overall: ★★★★☆ [4/5]PRO'S Gameplay is fresh Quests are well executed and tie the story well Sandbox style means you're not limited to said quests Base building is simple and effective Characters stories and skills are well thought out-CON'SReplayability can be lacking if not following questsCertain characters problems (certain characters lung cancer or Alice's insulin need can take away from the fun.-SUGGESTIONSHouses; some buildings have more than 1 entry/exit, however characters must always enter and exit through 1 door.Ability to synthesize anti-gen's. Similar to the crafting system for bandages / molotov cocktails, could possibly craft certain antigens, with the rarer strains requiring rarer materials.Perhaps a more ""dead-end"" start zone to help minimize attack casualties early on, or the ability to deconstruct, then, using concrete, build a new bunker.

												I'm coming up to my first hour in this game, and I can make the early insinuation that it is going to be a hit.Admittedly, not for everybody. This post-apocalyptic zombie arcade game offers more than you'd actually of expected. I feel like I've made at least a £10 under-payment. There is so much content just wedged in to such an un-renown, outlandish game. It lacks polish in the combat, and sometimes it can throw an abundance of haste zombies at you- which can be rather profuse, and irritating. The RPG elements to this game are fantastic, and I've really found myself getting drawn in to Joe Wheeler's character. If you have somebody in your group which is diabetic, you need insulin; if somebody in your group has been bitten, you need to inject yourself with some toxin, which has to be the parallel colour of the zombie's eyes who bit you. There's also a Sims-like command system which works spectacularly.I'm just getting to a part where you can fortify your base- yes, you build and fortify your own base too. Another feature which isn't intricate, and easy to pick up.For £3.99 you can NOT go wrong with Survivalist.I'm looking forward to my future endeavours. Well done developers for making a zombie game which isn't overhyped, and doesn't suck.			"

												This is an incredible game.   I like the character interactions and the overall feel of the world after the apocalypse.There is crafting, resource management, a little bit of skill upgrading (not a deep RPG but still interesting).Questing, clearing out areas.The Developer is also adding Coop. The Beta has Coop play. We have been playing for 22 hours of multiplayer and it is working really well. It is nice to login and see enhancemnts all the time.   It has been more stable than many games I have played.  I don't remember any crashes.The most amazing thing is.. less than 5$.. Only one thing could make this better. Turn based.. But I am a turn based fanatic and when the zombies jump out in real time, it can get intense. Be patient, it is a little difficult until you get the hange of it.  I am also using a controller and it works well.Give it a try, if you are a fan of the Zombie management, want a decent story and lots of quests and build your base. I think you will really enjoy it.			"

												I cannot recommend this game enough, I bought it on sale as it looked interestng and wasn't expecting too much from it. However I am pleased to say that it really surprised me with how smooth the gameplay is and just how deep it gets with building, assiging jobs and managing relationships with other communities along with growing your own and surviving. The only negative point I have to say is that there is no multiplayer but it isn't a major gripe and does not affect how great this game really is, it would just be a nice addition to an already superb game.

												Solid game, nice flowing dialogue system that keeps you immersed and is very realistic as to what two survivor's in a post apocolyptic world would actually say to each other, satisfying shooting, great camera angles, especially the one that is fixed on the player's face, interesting narrative, runs on my average laptop, but building things is a chore, maybe I am playing on hard or something, I have searched everywhere and I can only find 1 backpack.

What I like most about this game is that it has the feel of a casual game play. I can leave it wheb I want and come back to it a few weeks later without feeling lost. This game is a great investment if you are wanting to have something fun to pick up and relax to for awhile.  "

												This is one of those good ole very hard to start but once you get started gets easier kind of rpgs. Survivalist is a top-down shoopter with rpg elements. As I first stated in the begining dont expect to run to your nearast town and rambo your way through. It wont happen. This is a in depth (in my opinion which may be crap to your) real survival game. No your not Bear Gryilles (or what ever that crap his last name is) eating poop and drinking pee. But you do have to manage food, water, sleep, etc. Also on top of that you have to manage Alice's type 1 diebetes. YAY, which means your'll constantly be running around looking for food and water and insulin. As I said this isn't easy starting off. As all games should be,  in the beggining your gonna be moslty scaveging for food and water and ammo and insulin. Then you'll head back to the bunker to start making your camp. Here's where it starts getting intense. Now your'll have to juggle using only one survivor Joe. For the time being. So that means you'll have to split food,water,ammo,and else. But enough rambling. Once you finally start builgind a comminuty the real action starts. I found myself constantly getting attacked while i was building or away. SO now your gonna have to start getting wood, and metal to secure your small comunity. As you start to accumulate more and more in your community your begin to realize hey I dont have to scavenge as often i have farms and wells. While ammo and insulin and building supplies now on the top of the GOT GET IT ALL list. Soon your'll feel safer leaving your comminuty alone from time to time knowing hey anything comes close ole buckeye pete and his m16 will gun it down. Of corse nothing is invincble but you'll feel better knowing raiders cant burn down chain-link fences. Soon the game gets easy for the time till it catches up with harder zombies. Now with that talk of coop it makes tingle inside knowing I can be guarding my community while someone else scavages. So I rate this a 9/10 IGN very very fun but gets kinda repetitive. Very hard early one. But hard fun.? (sounded better in my head). I would reccomend you get this. But learn to come and love the restart button			"

												If you like the survival/zombie genre then this game is a must buy! Fantastic game, with individual character development, tons of potential NPC allies and enemies, expansive map to explore, good story, etc. It goes on sale for a mere couple of bucks, often, which is really just stealing money from the folks who deserve more for a really well made game. If you are on the fence, then spend the few bucks to pick this up; you'll probably be surprised you hadn't discovered it sooner!Pros:+Interesting/original spin on the zombie outbreak scenario. Fast zombies suck but are awesome.+Lots of NPCS hidden around the desert, mostly in small enclaves to interact with. Hostile humans can often be turned around to become neutral, or even join your group, if you play your cards right.+Base building is balanced; the buildings and upgrades give benefits comparable to the work required to construct them.+Finite, if generous, quantities of building materials rewards careful selection for base location and smart construction of buildings.+Anyone who gets taken by an infected becomes an infected; you'll find former friends and enemies have become the very zombies that are now attacking you!+Individual character development, with uncomplicated stats and skills.+World changes as you play; NPC enclaves will eventually succumb to wandering bands of bandits and zombies, including side-quest locations and even groups of hostile survivors end up perishing over time.+Reasonable graphics, the game has very modest system requirements.+Good replay value; it is quite a long game and can be played through several times.A real nice touch is that the NPC's appear to have the same rules as the player characters; everyone needs food, water, and sleep. If the NPC's that do the farming of an enclave or group die then the other members will start travelling the desert in search of provisions. It also usually leads to the death of everyone else in that group as their members individually run zombies they can't handle. Then they become zombies and help polish off the next desperate survivor who leaves the camp in search of food. The bandit groups might be an exception to this, hostile survivors that cannot be negotiated with, seem to never move and have no resources close by to sustain them. They stay awake for months at a time, with no food or water, the true zombies of the apocalypse!Cons:-Character development, while effective, is quite simple. It may be part of the charm but it feels like some lost potential.-Base building can be pretty tedious when trying to gather resources from remote locations. Your runners either constantly run to the point of exhaustion(extremely vulnerable to zombies!!!) or walk about at a casual pace.-Unable to create groups of runners for salvaging/gathering. Having to select each individual survivor and send them out to collect resources is a nuisance. These survivors all function separately, instead of working as team, out in the field. Lots of times a survivor gets mauled by a couple of zombies that they've encountered while one or two other survivors, also travelling to the same destination, are within a screen's distance and do not go to the aid of their fellow survivor. The only work around I found was to assign guards to each runner, which works, but wastes a lot of carrying potential.-As above, you have to micromanage your survivors out in the field. Lone survivors are no match for two or more zombies at a time. Even teams of two, with a dedicated guard, tend to get overwhelmed pretty easily. It wouldn't be much of problem except they tend to be much less effective when AI controlled so you have to be quite vigilant. If your main group is also dealing with an encounter, it is very easy to miss a runner in trouble.This is a great game and would easily be worth $20-$25, especially to fans of the genre! I've stayed up far later than I should on many a weekday to just get a bit more ""Survivalist"" time in!			"

												What a lovely little gem. I almost feel guilty for buying it at such a low price. I was very pleasantly surprised to learn just how fun and... honestly kind of complex this game is. PROS:* Great gameplay. Combat can feel a bit repetitive, but being able to cap a zombie in the leg to prevent the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ from jumping you is pretty good. I also really like the skill progression, though it can feel like a grind at times. There's homesteading, zombie shooting, looter shooting, quest taking, micro-management somewhat akin to RTS games, building a huge posse of fellow survivors, exploration... lots of content in this game. * Content. I'm still kind of baffled just how rich this game is for its price tag. 30 hours in and I still am not done with my first playthrough. I'd say that's pretty impressive. Along the same lines, the RPG elements are pretty solid. I was amused to see that characters respond to just about anything you do to them or others in their community. If you so desired, you could just wiped everyone out with extreme prejudice, or you could be more of a peacemaker and try to recruit as many people as you can... including bandits. I'm somewhere in between. People even remember you being RUDE to them. *Game design. The author of this game clearly went to great lengths to implement depth and replayability. There are three game winning scenarios that the player can choose from, people to save or not save, quests to take or not take, and just the fact that you can't please everyone in the game makes it so that you can easily boot it back up and try a different path. -----CONS:Honestly... I can't think of many serious problems with this game other than a few minor nitpicks, but there are two things that bother me in particular-* Ear-bleeding music. UGH. The soundtrack in this game is just hideous. I've played most of it with it muted. It's a minor gripe, I suppose, but still. *The allied AI can sometimes be a bit bone-headed... like they may wander away from the path of safety just to make a shortcut (and bumping into zombies and looters along the way), they waste time sometimes by wandering around FOREVER looking for food or water when they could just complete their ♥♥♥♥ing jobs and go back to base to eat and drink. ----All in all, VERY solid game. I highly recommend it. The price tag certainly helps me say that it's worth every penny.			"

Excellent Game.Grabbed this game on sale; with low expectations, but let me tell you now, I very much regret underestimating this game.If you want to know what this game is about, it's basically a Top down survival game; with relative realism, as there is hunger dehydration and sleep deprivation to worry about, as well as being infected from zombies and bleeding out.Good Stuff: Easy to learn to play; whilst not being too simple(I just found this really cool, but) If you are bleeding, you can use a bandage to stop the bleeding, but you can't just spam them and heal faster.Cool NPCS with good, but brief backstoriesPlenty of quests and characters to meetBad Stuff: Small amount of weapons (but it keeps it simple so It could be a pro)I personally found building a little bit tricky, as the tutorial was a little hard to understandI also often had the problem of my teammates or NPCs walking into me and popping up with the chat menu when I didn't really want toAnother thing was the builder guy you encounter at the beginning of the game as I had trouble getting him to do what I wanted, he didnt seem to listenOverall: I'd give this game a solid 9/10, It just needed a tiny bit of polishing, and hey, I don't usually bother to review games, so do with that what you will!It's a steal on or off sale!

												Tried the demo and got hooked instantly. The game follows the usual survival-zombie-theme but in it's own way. Kind of similar to State of Decay but with more quests. I haven't played so far yet and I can't wait to see what's up next. I recommend it to anyone who likes the genre. 5$ feels like a steal!			"

												Suprisingly amazing!  Don't let the graphics fool you. This is a Real time strategy where you manage a tribe of survivors in the zombie appocalypse.  If you get past the first hour or two of gameplay, you will realize the ability to customize bases, set up defenses from raiders and zombie hoards and schedule supply runs without fariguing your group is highly addictive.

												Day 1: I've ran out of captain crunch and hershey bars I must venture out in the world for supplies. Day 2: Found a man and a woman, the guy's okay but the woman is diabetic she asked me to go get insulin at a nearby fort. Day 3: We're holed up in my old bunker and the guy built a wall and a gate around us. Day 4: We went to scavenge an undisovered town but soon discovered a group of bandits were living there. We threatened them after doing favors from them, we ow have 4 new members in our group the surivalists. Day 5: All food I eat tastes like captain crunch, even the corn Alice the diabetic started growing with her nose in that book. Day 6: My only builder smoked ONE PACK OF CIGARETTES for his FIRST TIME he now has lung caner. Day 7: We couldn't afford the insulin for Alice anymore so we told her to leave the group. I knew she couldn't survive out there alone so I shot her in the back of the head with my shotgun. There is no Captain Crunch corn left now. Day 8: I am now a bad@ss and cannot die by bullets for some reason. Anyways we shot up a bandit camp and got a wimp to join us. Day 9: We got half of Fort Kohai to join us. Day 10: We stole from Fort Kohai. I did not save. I brought my entire group. I WAS PLAYING HARDCORE SO I DID NOT SAVE THE ENTIRE GAME. We were caught stealing them. An old lady pulled out a shotgun and shot Bob the Smoking Builder. I sprinted as far as I possibly could into the fort with my group ad than a message appeared on my screen: YOU ARE NOW AT WAR WITH FORT KOHAI. Day 11: Half of my group was slaughtered by them. We are low on bandages and food. We are at war with Kohai. We will fight back. Day 12: We molotov torch Fort Kohai and shoot up everyone inside from far away with our sniper rifles. A man surrenders, he looks like Lucas Simms from Fallout 3. He begs for mercy and he'll even join us because we've proved. I the said ""This is for Bob the Builder!"" And we all sprayed a giant wave of bullets into his torso he quickly fell on the ground. We had won. We had beat Fort Kohai.  We were invincible and victorious. Day 13: We all die of starvation, we forgot to get a farmer assigned or loot the farms at Kohai. 10/10 The Real ""Don't Starve""			"

												Better Bang for your Buck than Fallout 4: More Realistic Survival Scenarios: Your character must constantly satisfy hunger and thirst, as well as constantly fend off hostile survivors and zombies.  Wounds require bandaging quickly, or you'll bleed to death.  A bite from a zombie requires a speedy shot of antigen, which often isn't available (making a zombie bite the death sentence it ought to be).  Choosing the right balance of equipment with weight limitations is a constant challenge.  Better Moral Dilemmas: Would you be willing to murder a doctor or a random survivor to steal insulin for a member of your party? Do you have time to work odd jobs to make the gold to buy a shot of insulin to make her last a few more days? Can you accept a survivor into your party knowing that he is an outlaw in a town you frequent? Multiplayer: Unlike Fallout 4, there is actually a multiplayer mode in this game.  Like Destiny, the multiplayer co-operative  is meant to blend seamlessly into the singleplayer experience.  Unlike Destiny, Survivalist properly executes on this feature.  The chat log is extremely handy.  You can't go wrong with this game at full prce, or on sale, buy it now!!			"

												This is the game I would make about the zombie apocalypse, if I were living on a planet where other video games had never been invented.  It has a fantastic concept and scope, but is badly handicapped by a clumsy interface and graphics out of the 90s.  The fairly extensive author tract about how Christians are stupid and evil is kind of annoying as well.Even at $5, it's only a buy if you are a fan of zombies or sandboxy survival games.2/5 Stars			"

The written review is way too long and can't post the whole review here, so you have to watch my video for complete information about the gameAre you getting tired from games with zombies? Yes? Well, i'm certainly not. This game have zombies and it's a top-down shooter with light crafting and strategy to spice things up.The game takes place in the near future, one year after the collapse of civilization. You take the role of John Wheeler, a wealthy L.A. manager, who own a underground bunker in the middle of the desert, filled with food and water for 1 year, in which you took refuge. On the 364 day in he picked up signal for help on his radio, coming from somewhere near by. He goes out to investigate . You find woman named Alice locked, you help her and the rest is up to you to find out. Half way through the game story picks up and starts to get interesting and it have few twists.Usually in a game like this, the is goal to find out, where the disease started, find a cure or save someone. Here it's not like that. Your first priority is surviving. Some quests will lead to answers. To reach the end of the game, you have complete five objectives: construct certain number and type of buildings, enough food for feeding your people, neutralize all regional treats, find love, have at least one person in your community with max skill level in each of: Fitness, Firearms, Construction, Farming and Medicine.The game was first introduce for Xbox Live before landing on the PC platform and it's almost perfect port. The most disappointing thing are the video options. Only fullscreen, resolution and large fonts. Textures are okay, movement of everyone is kind of robotic. All human and zombie characters differ from each other only by the clothes and skin color. In Sound there are only 3 options – sound effects, menu sound and music. But all those things are minor problems, the game is indie and it's awesome!However, the developer did make mouse and keybord controls perfect. So many variations in Controls menu. I was really surprised by this. And of course all keys can be rebind. You can even play with a controller if you like.Next is gameplay. Here is where the game shines a lot. I'll start with the base. After rescuing Alice, you find out she have diabetes and she need constant supply of insulin. Through the hole game you will either have to buy it or searching for abandoned pharmacies. You and Alice are heading to the nearest town and there Isham, another survivor, will join you and decide John's bunker will be your base. Here you will find the strategy part and it's giving orders to your people. And what are they? To bring supplies to your base and build. So, Isham is constructs, Alice is carrying and you complete quests. In the beginning you can only build shack outhouse, wooden and wire fences, gates and wooden watch tower. After gaining few levels in Construction it will unlock more things – barn, well, concrete tower and pillbox. All buildings will improve the life of your people. Don't make wrong conclusions. For the most part this is  action oriented game, with nice story and it's not another with only crafting and surviving.The game wants from you to build certain number and type of buildings. That way you will have places for everyone and everything. More people you have, more buildings you need. They are used to store supplies and for people to sleep. Of course, you need to defende your base. That's way you have watch towers and pillboxes. When someone is inside them, it's more hard to shoot them.One extremely important elemnt of the game is feeding your community and supplying them with water. In the first few hours they will eat cans and chips and water you can be found in dead bodies, buildings and water towers. But there is easier way for providing  both of them. After the mentioned hours, you can plant crops. This way you will have constant supply of food. And if you don't want to search for water, build a well. It's also used for watering the crops.You can take control of every single person in your community and make them do what the game allows you to do. I was quite surprised by the AI. When you give an order, there is no need to babysit them. When someone is thirsty or hungry, he goes where you store food and water. If don't have them in your base, he/she is searching for you. If he wants to sleep, he goes to a building alone and after it's done, continues his task from where he stoped . Builder don't have enough materials? He goes to the nearest dicovered place to get them. Sometimes suppliers encounter 1 or 2 zombies and they deal with them without a problem. You don't need to take control over them, unless they are big group. If this is the case – you better rum. I didn't rely entirly on the AI and you don't have to. While people sleep, I feed them and give them water and supplies. Sometimes I take control if something attack them. Simple, but effective.Every single person have 5 skills to develop: Fitness, Firearms, Constuction, Farming and Medicine. Level 5 is the top, but not all characters can, they are just limited. Only when using certain skill, you gain experience for it. For example – using a weapon will increase Firearms. There is artificial way for gaining levels. You will find books for the respective skill and the only requirement is to carry them all the time.On the right side is shown the person you control, mini map (there is big map also), what weapon he uses, does he have bulletproof vest and fatigue. If you run for too long, the character is getting tired and you better stop on one place or just walk, because if you run it to a zombie or looter, it will be hard to fight them.There are few stats, that you need to keep an eyeon them. They are hunger, thirts, for smokers lung cancer, for Alice glucose level. When you walking or running without a break, people don't eat or drink water, so keep in mind to stop for e brief moment.If you want to get somewhere quickly or people sleep and you don't have anything to do, speed up the game. But there is a risk. When you are in this mode and you control someone and zombie attack the character, you may not push it on time and this have consequences.The map is huge and dangerous, but there are friendly communities. From them you will get quests. Most of them are just killing looters. All communities have traders. From them you can buy a lot of stuff or sell. The currency here is gold. You will get it from searching buildings, cars, bodies and completing quests. The first thing you need to buy is backpack. It will let you carry more stuf with you. The bigger backpack and higher level of Fitness will allow to take more things with you.You have total of 6 weapons – pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, sniper, RPG and Molotov. The shooting is as follows: you hold the right mouse button to lock-on target. For more accurate shots you have to stay in one place for the crosshair to turn red. But if you are not moving, you are sitting duck. Bigger the Firearms level, fastert the crosshair turns red. It's fun to shoot with every weapon. They don't have recoil, but even if you have highest level of Firearms, doesn't guarantee every single shot to hit the target. Don't expect to get RPG right from the beginning. You will start with pistol. For him it's easy to find ammo, but it gets progressively harder to find for the better weapons. While the target is lock-on, you can choose with the mouse to shoot it in the legs, torso or head. They have their advantages and disadvantages. The head is harder to be hit, but guarantees quick kill. The torso is easy to hit, but you do less damage. Shooting the legs leads zombies to limp and generally slow them down.			"

												The bad graphics are misleading since Survivalist plays really smoothly, as a modern game should. It was extremely addictive. This is actually a really cool game. It's a lot better than most of the zombie sims I've tried. It has interesting characters, an actual plot, and intriguing gameplay. The only things I would like to add to this game is - A better overview for my survivors, like a map view with all of my survivors where I can set where and how they should work- More emphasis on base defense - I'd like more defensive structures and more attacks on my base.

												EDIT: I've been told that big changes are coming to the game, so I'll update this if the changes are positive.Despite being a decently crafted game with a solid amount of text dialogue, the game falls flat when it comes to AI and balancing issues. The problem with it, is that your fellow ""Survivalists"" will often charge out of barriers to ""get food"" and proceed to get mauled by hordes of zombies coming your way. It was an obnoxious and frustrating part of the game, and discouraged me from playing any further.Overall Score I would give: 5/10			"

												in all honesty i have put a few hours in this game maybe 30 hours hoenstly. and i DO want to play this game more as i like its THEME. and i like the fact the developer seems to still be working on the game being in complete staus. i honestly think the developer should make mod tools and let the community of steam takeover then integrate VERY commona nd VERY beloved steam mods into the game. because a small team can only do so much. but an entire community can do ALOT. and it will bring this game forward in a very positive way. looka t arma 3 without the community it would be a dead game. this game is EXTREMELY dead. and i am a big fan for mods.

												Current version of the game... it cuts frame rate in half for a long period of time every time you save, and sometimes even when you're just opening the inventory and such. I write this review while my game sits on a seemingly unending loading screen instead of taking me to my start menu it took me to a loading screen? And I'm hearing gun fire.. which suggests it's still running while I have this indefinite loading screen. This is not alpha, it's a fully released game. Do I think it's fun? Yes. On that note would I recomend it? No. It's far too laggy with too many annoyingly pointless effects. For example the menu doesn't just open, it all peices together quickly but what's the point of having a flashy start menu? And every option you hover over pulses on top of already changing color! Getting past that... this game feels to me what I was expecting from Project Zomboid and didn't get. Just wish the lag wasn't so bad. My PC can run ARK on max with out a melt down and still rocking almost 60 fps. And I can't save on a tiny game with out dropping me to 30? Jeezus.			"

												I did not enjoy this game, it does have some unique things in it, but I just couldn't get into it. The way the zombies work makes it very difficult to play, and rather offputting. I love the zombie genre as much as the next person, but I apologize as I could not get into the game enough to justify the purchase of it.			"

												This is a very interesting game. A pretty realistic zombie-ish survival (zombies more resemble 28 days later ones, not your traditional Romero zombies). I was pretty impressed with detail of how construction, survival, fast paced combat, and human interaction goes. Highly recommended.			"

												Day 4: Sent Alice too far south to scout and ended up running out of ammo. Ran as fast as she could but she took too many bites and lacked any fitness levels to outrun the infected. She fatigued quickly and was quickly caught before getting an adrenaline boost from being bit. She finally reaches an ally who happend to be walking by on a run to pickup wooden planks. Suddenly, she is no longer running. Just as she collapses from blood loss I receive a notifcation: ""Alice has reached level 1 of fitness."" 10/10 would make slow♥♥♥♥♥run again			"

												Really want to play the game well done concept and mechanics. However the game doesn't want you to play and features the worst control scheme I have ever seen. For the price it might be worth it if you can get past the horrible controls (however I doubt it considering they directly hinder gameplay).			"

												I can see what they were going for, but they obviously just didn't have the studio team or money behind them that you'd need to make a game like this. It's not bad, but the controls are very iffy and it's all over the place in terms of having to always pay attention to make sure your characters don't die but also doing nothing for large amount of time, even sped up. Good concept, weak execution.			"

												Being honest here, I think this game is complete trash. Maybe it's not my type and i've hardly played it, but I started to realize it's pretty unfinished and probably won't be super good until it becomes fully complete. First of all, the aiming is very weird. I don't really like the system. Having most zombies run at you I guess is realistic but you really can't tell when they will jump out and kill you. Why I got bored so fast is I found my self running from zombies, they were too fast and I couldn't really see them coming that well. Fatique left me defenceless after one zombie jumped on me and I had to push him off and I would enter a house only to literally be camped by these zombies. They would wait out my door and murder me as soon as I came out. Maybe it's not my type but I feel like this game is just very incomplete. I've hardly gotten into it so maybe I oughta give it another shot. But for now, i'll leave this review negative. Not reccomended for anyone really unless your an extreme zombie diehard fan.			"

												This game would seem interesting if you read about it. Unfortunately, the controls and interface are non-intuitive in the extreme. The player wanders about with no sense of direction or purpose, and has little interaction with the world around him. Enemies overtake you in an unpredictable manner, and you must ""aim"" at them on the one hand, and then ""attack"" them using an altogether separate control system. I'd really enjoy a game like this if it were fun, but I'd recommend better-designed ""post-apocalyptic"" games. Not to specifically ""plug"" a game, but a hint as to the name would be ""the resulting devastation after nuclear war that has an amazing half-life."" Another hint is that you're raised in a vault safely underground and leave to see what the outside world looks like. Even if this game were on a terrific sale, steer clear of it. In good conscience I cannot recommend this game.			"

Now this one is: Application: Survivalist.exeFramework Version: v4.0.30319Description: The process was terminated due to an unhandled exception.Exception Info: System.BadImageFormatExceptionat ZombieApocalypse.Program.Main(System.String[])im running .net framework 4.6.1 if that mattersHere is an update to this review. After fixing the issue (The developer was awesome in helping with this). I started off playing coop. It was a great time with my wife who decided to micromanage my community. I absolutely love the possibilities here in this game. You can be a lone gun and only play for yourself (no time limits or urgencies except for the beginning) or you can build a huge community and deal with everyone's problems (pretty realistic). If you enjoy micromaging things than this is your game. If you enjoy scary post apocalyptic settings than this is your game.In all honesty I have played the ""big box"" games that cost $60 on release and none of them compare to this game which is still being developed. The story behind any of the paths you choose is astounding for a choose your own adventure sort of game. Survivalist really hit the nail on the head.10/10 would blow up felipe's house with a rocket launcher again.10/10 would run my 60 member community into the enemy base with just pistols and molotovs.3/10 would want to meet a diabetic in the real world apocolypse			"

												I sold a bullet proof vest for a backpack to carry more.But I could only afford the Fuzzy wuzzy pink rabbit backpack....10/10 would never speak of this againin seriousness its a strangely addictive top down survival - do quests build a base - I love the ability to set up friendlys to forage and do looting automatically using all the chars in my team not just the ones in my party - for 5$ its a must have for sandbox/survival fans - quests include getting anti zombie drugs or a steady supply of insulen for your type 1 diabetic follower - balance out food ammo water and carry weights to make it pretty challenging - better then some 60$ games I've played Cons - the controls are a bit wierd I'm used to E being activate but its switch follower here and left mouse button is activate which feels a bit strange at first but you get used to it - the fatigue sound gets on my nerves and I feel early game carry weight is a bit low but thats about it for my complaints so far			"

												Had no idea such a simple game on the surface could be so darn addicting in execution. Think State of Decay meets Project Zomboid mixed with 28 Days later zeds  and you got the gist. Building up a community is fun and engaging. Even the..ahem...complications with one of the starting chracters I found made the game more compelling when it could easily have been bloody irritating. So kudos devs for taking a creative chance there.What really makes this game for me however is command mode. Basically, you can go into a Sims style overworld view to tell chracters your not directly controlling what to do. Gather resources, build, or whatever. And the best part is you don't have to micro-manage every little thing! They need food or water? They find it! They need more materials for that build? They head to the nearest cache and grab materials. And mostly they intelligently defend themselves (wouldn't suggest letting them auto into looters though. That never seems to end well).All in all, a fantastic game especailly given the price. And the recently added multi-player serves only to give it more replayability. I would highly suggest this one to anyone more interested in community interactions with their zombie survival instead of just scavaging and waiting to die.Oh, and last note. The combat I find to be extremely engrossing. The fast paced zeds and erratic nature of shoot-outs with looters will keep you entertained!			"

												I normally do not enjoy these types of games but I thought for the price why not? I was plesantly surprised. I bought this yesterday and have since racked up ten hours. It is a good blend of role playing, base building, and zombies. I really like the command view which allows you to order members of your party to do a certain repetative task (gathering supplies, building, etc) so that the user isn't wasting time going back and forth to do those things. Thoroughly enjoyable and I recommend it. What you're getting for $4.99 is hours and hours of entertainment. The open sand-box type set up of the game ensures you will have plenty of replay value.

												Listen. I understand if some of you like this game, but it just didn't click with me.Let's get this over with.+ open world zombie game+ has a lot of RTS elements - you collect resources, build your own base, recruit survivors and protect it from raiders+ multiple endings and many choices+ quests can be completed in all kinds of ways+ generally very open-ended - do the main quests or just wander around the desert and expand your base.Now I get mean.- HORRIBLE MUSIC. I mean, seriously! When I play a zombie game I expect something dark and heavy, some rock, maybe metal. Heck, western tunes would fit with the setting of the game. But instead you get some music made by teenage boys that would fit more for Unturned (no offense for Unturned btw, it's a great game). But yeah, you're walking around the desert killing zombies, and then... ugh. I have no words.- the graphics. I understand that this is a low budget indie that started as a small game for consoles. If you have a weak laptop, then you may like it. But for me? I'm not a ""graphics are everything"" guy, but... nah.- the animations. Check out how the character walks. This is a placeholder from a prototype, not a fully relased game you pay money for.- the combat. This is pretty much a twin-stick shooter, but there's something very important. You don't aim manually, intead when you draw the gun the game just locks on to whatever is in front of you. And this is really annoying when your ally is getting eaten and you just lock on to all the zombies swarming around you but not the one you need to shoot.- the infection. If you get bit, you get infected. When that happens, you need a cure. But there are different kinds of zombies, and each one requires a different cure. Remember the previous part? Yeah. You know what happens. What's worse is that cures are pretty hard to find, and they are used automaticaly. Now for example a green infection takes a few days to kill you. It doesn't really weaken you in any way, but instead of saving it when you will really need it, you will just jam it right away and then probably get bit again.-t    h    e     f   r  a   m  e   r   a   t  e. Now that's the worst part about the game. In 60 FPS the game runs in slow motion. Now there's a reason for that: enemies move pretty fast, so you need some time to react. I would understand if this slo-mo activated in combat, but it will be on even when there's no enemies around you and you're just walking to the nearest town. And with slow motion, it will take ages. Meanwhile when you turn on 30 fps, slow motion disappears, and you now move much faster. This is better, right?Right?NO! Zombies are not slow like the old-school ones, they run at the speed of light at you, then they leap at you draining a lot of stanima forcing you to knock them off. If you're in 60 fps, you can actually dodge the leap and watche the zombie gracefully fly right past you in slow motion and slowly ragdoll on the ground. But if you're in 30 fps, you get no time to react and get grabbed and molested repeatably untill you get bit and probably killed. It's worse when you're fighting enemies with guns, because then you will be literally showered with bullets and killed befoe you even think about getting to cover.That's enough. You get the message. Some people like it. That's fine. I think it's just plain awful. I regret wasting my money on it.Just buy Left 4 Dead 2.And if you want ""base building with zombies"", one word: Terraria.			"

												First Impressions:After seeing this game for cheap and not on Early Access I thought I would pick it up. The game is pretty fun, with some nice mechanics. I love the little selfie type cam that shows what your player is doing. I will keep playing but if you want to see how the first 20 minutes of play go check me out playing below.Not sure where the negativity comes from as for £3.99 you got to expect a little roughness and you won't be getting an AAA title.There is a demo too so you have no excuse not to try it.

												I cannot actually remember when I bought this game. I played it at last because... it updated.Top-down combat that's not very good. You can't see zombies before they're running at you. Your companions get to do gun combat. YOU get to lie under a zombie and kick it off. Since you have to shoot things to get better at shooting things... I was hoping, from the other reviews, that there was some reason to keep playing. But action combat with RPG stats in this case is purely translating to ""you are bad at this, and it's the part of the game that isn't walking"". And I thought, from all the positive reviews that the writing would make up for the graphics. It doesn't. I'm facing characters that are more lifeless than the ♥♥♥♥ing zombies, who at least have expressions.The game also does a thing I really can't stand. It's the opposite of handholding... blindfolding. You have to advance the story to gain the power to hit f4 and bring up the map. That's not nice. It means if I try to explore at all, I'm going to get lost, and probably get someone killed.I could probably forgive the hell out of a lot of these things if it were 2D... and/or turn-based instead of some anti-fun action combat where the game unhelpfully suggests dodging to the ""side"" while you're DOING that, but when the zombie's close, wasd with lock-on means you're barely moving.

												I do not recommand this game for anyone that doesnt have all day to play this game.First of all, graphics are terrible to have this game come out in 2015.Second, when you shoot zombies in this game you miss 50% of the time, so when the zombie if is your face, you miss like by 5 meters.Third, the walking to different parts of this map takes a long long time! A quest/mission need you to travel to several places and it takes a hella long time just to walk your character over there.Fourth, your backpack literally has no room! You can barely pack anything in your pack, after you pack things like ammo, gun badage, some food, water. You are pretty much full in your backpack and you have to throw things away for loots you find.Fifth, the directions of the quests in this game is extremely ♥♥♥♥ing confusing! I don't know if it is just me, but the directions are very unclear and hard to follow. Sometimes glitch happens and you don't get missions done or your mission SOMEHOW disappear.Sixth, you might think it is fun to build a fortress to defend against zombie, yeah that it fun BUT IT TAKES ♥♥♥♥ING YEARS TO BUILD ONE. You have to get supplies and transfer supplies to your base, with a backpack and toolbox so that takes ♥♥♥♥ing years and your backpackI do not recommand this game, i would 10/10 refund this game. This game was fun in the beginning but because of how confusing it was and how long it takes to do stuff is just boring,			"

												This is a very nice game.The rate has nothing to do with game itself, i actually like this game.It's because of the god damn bugs. Have you ever try to finish a very hard mission and do not save it after complete it?Well, this game give you a great damn number of chance to try if you haven't before.Game crashes regularly about once 5-6 minutes, and all progress after the last time you save will lost.This actually add challenge to game because i have to finish every mission NPCs give me in 300 seconds.Plus, game could crash when savingOnce when i realized that i have to redo my mission again because of unknown reason, i was heartbroken, but now? now i'm somehow used to it!I'll change or delete my comment after they fix this bug			"

												Good concept, Good effects, Good luck staying alive for more than  2 minutes. This game is nearly impossible and if you think you can work through it get better, you are wrong. The Zombies are too fast and seem to come from nowhere. If this game was turn based it would work. It only gets harder and there is very little hope that you will have fun.The gameplay is impossible. At one point my side charactor wanted to build a fence.... He wouldnt stop, Couldnt stop. He contantly wanted to run and build that damn fence even though it was miles away.			"

												So i havent really played that much of it but i can tell you that it feels like it came right out of the year 2000 and not in a good way.  it feels slow and clunky and i really think that the zombie thing is so over done these days.  only played it for a bit but i already know that this game isnt for me.  If you want to give it a do wait untill it is on a flash sale or some thing.			"

												It pains me to give this a negative review. It's exactly what I want in a game: survival and resource management but in a large, populated world with a sharp narrative. Unfortunately, the command mode UI is impossible. Telling people what to do is complicated, telling them where to go is complicated, and once that's done they have a bad habit of dying anyways, interrupting the quest you're personally overseeing. Commanding people needs to be done paused, outside the environment of the rest of the game, and their AI needs to be smarter or you need to be given notifications, or something. This game was apparently made by one person, and I 100% commend them for the effort and hope that they continue to develop this and other games; it's just that one major flaw makes this, for me, unplayable.

												I mean in reality it could just be walking simulator, or maybe even exhaustion simulator don't get me wrong its a very great title and it was very fun to play but most of the game is either walking, killing things to easy to pose a challenge or running from things that are to much of a challenge, not to mention the fact zombie's can literally reach you from 5 feet away. honestly I normally don't like the idea of fast travel in games as they encourage laziness but this game needs fast travel or some way other then running and dying or walking and never getting there.Quests in this game take what seems like years, you get a simple mission to kill a group of raiders and then the person reveals that the raiders are actually 20 miles away and you've never seen this area before, now if raiders are 20 miles away how are they bothering you.The realism in this game makes my dark heart glow a little because you actually have to assign a person to water crops, you have to assign a person to bring supplies and you have to assign people for everything, but the realism is killed when the game stats that one person cannot carry more then one log as it weighs the persons wait, I don't know if the developers have ever lifted a plank of wood, but it doesnt weigh a god damn person.Overall this game was worth the money I paid, a whooping 27 cents, I use coupons on a lot of stuff, I don't believe the game would be worth the 5.49$ CDN for a running simulator. but if that is what you're into then go ahead and purchase ""Survivalist"". 3/10			"

												Damn...I just cannot handle games that aren't balanced and this ""zombie"" game just doesn't feel right. Im sure a lot of people will enjoy this game and I can't pretend it isn't priced right, but...... I think the devs need to learn a little more about the zombie world before their next attempt. I'm really not sure what they were thinking trying to combine a ""state of decay"" like game with infected zombies running at you from the dark fog in packs of 12 at 100mph when your sight range is about 25ft. You spend most of your time just trying to side step their massive jump lunges and kicking them off one after another when they do get you. It quite literally gets to the point of annoyance and repetitiveness so quickly, that I pretty much shut it off an hr in. I mean in what ""fast moving zombie"" movie like ""28days"" or ""World War Z"" do you see people carelessly just strolling down to the local store to collect chicken wire one piece at a time with the delusional goal of eventually building a fence that will stop this type of zombies. I mean come on....all zombie fans know the difference between the slow zombies and the fast zombies, along with how different survival tactics would be...well, except the people making this game apparently. Kinda sad that they came up with such a cool concept only to drop the ball in the end with one stupid flaw that actually changes the entire dynamic of the game.WHY CAN'T THEY JUST GET ONE OF THESE GAMES RIGHT!!

If this happens I don't really know what to do but wait.There are quests around when talking to NPCs but I think the map is so huge, I autowalk a lot. The fact that there are lots of empty spaces that makes walking boring.This game just does not appeal to me. If I were to control one character only while handling the other characters through the main character, then that will be my cup of tea. If sleeping is not implemented in this game, maybe I will have more fun. Or put maybe add things to do while characters sleep?			"

												Despite the premise which I always find enjoyable and the clever little character quips this game suffers from two major issues. First off the interface is rather anti-intuitive. The controls feel like they were mapped by a three armed man with Parkinsons. Secondly, Looting and combat feel more like a chore than an enjoyable game experience...thanks again mostly to the lack of thought put into the interface. For $4 it isn't bad but I just can't stand behind this title yet. Very rough. Couldn't even get past the first half hour playing it.  "

												For all the praise this game gets it has some glaring problems.The controls are very counter intuitive and will also cause you to mis-click many things since far to much is done with the same button.The same button you use to fire does almost everything else inscluding reloading a game when you don't even want to. Oddly the buttong you use to kick can cause the same problem.The quests will often beeline you into choices you never wanted to make. Such as trying to play as good person and being forced to be greedy for gold.The crafting and inventory lacks any depth at all, with crafting being basically an abandoned concept.Playing it is constantly frustrating and all of its good points have glaring problems.I honestly don't think there is one positive feature about this game that doesn't come with an annoying downside. Unless you count being cheap.Don't buy the game until the developer learns how to make it accesible at least. It gets lots of praise due to potential only not actual delivery.			"

												Very good simulation game. It's very hard as it should be. The hordes are very dangerous because it's big risk to get infected. In game you can recruit other survivors, build, trade, scavenge and ect. This game is very interesting and hard.EDIT:After i played it longer i saw more interesting things. There are lots of factions and you can recruit all people in the game. But one thing i miss. There are is very poor crafting system, no forging, tree cutting, mining, and there are not too many different weapons : Pistol, shotgun,Smg,Sniper,molotov,and i think RPG.( haven't seen Rpg yet)And you know what? I really missed Ai(people) faction wars, they just stand in their bases and only farmers growing crops and thats it. By the way only corns? I dont want to eat in post apocalyptic world only corns. I want potatoes, apples, bananas, grains, carrots and ect.Edited: Thats why from 10 i give only 7.7/10 (and the game still needs co-op)+ One more thing after i almost completed the game... This game has very cool story line.			"

												I can appreciate that this game is still in early development, but from what I see ...This game is azz:Horribly bad, outdated graphics (looks like Grand Theft Auto 1) and animationsThe music is cheesy and doesn't fit the mood in any way -- you'll instantly turn down your speakersThe Fog of War makes light-speed zombies practically impossible to dodge or hit -- Apparently people can't see farther that 5ft in front of them, in a desert, in sunlight, in the apocalypse.  The targeting system is virtually broken -- trying to aim at legs, torso and head is impossible by moving the mouse up and down ... when you have to move the mouse around to even pick a target.Of course, your AI teamates are stupid as all hell -- while they are John Rambos while traveling with you, good luck having them rest up and heal in the bunker while you make a supply run.  You'll be halfway through the run when the party memeber decides to disregard your orders, exit the bunker into a mob of zombies while unarmed and estentially getting eaten, thus ending your game.The savegame function is a joke:  Hey, your party memeber just committed suicide ... np quickload .... whoops ... the autosave dinged, literally, right as the partymemeber enters the middle of the mob.  At least you can watch her/him get eaten over and over and over ....Horrible, un-wieldly dialouge, inventory and command menus.  Just ... ridiculous.There's about 20 other reasons why this game sucks.  I can appreciate an indie game like this, especially for $5 ... but it's just horrible.  Fun idea; terrible execution.  Just give me your $5 and save yourself the hassle of this game.			"

Dead Frontier 3D, fast paced, none of that contagion crap, awarding at high levels/started off characters;though, it's a grind at lower/mid levels unless you have friends to enjoy the game with. Rebuild 2 fun to play and compare how well you did vs. your friends. high replayability until you know everything.[2-5 complete playthroughs]This game... Cons - White/Red strains, you're ♥♥♥♥ed if you get bit/hit while another zombie mounts you and you don't have medic to bandage and the required anti-gen[you'll be a zombie in 10/30 seconds] - Terrible inventory systems, starting weight, backpack rarity, info button[COME ON!!!], weight of items, no sorting, no categories.- Combat system, don't be low on stamina and sidestep zombies + how hard it is to make fast Zs into slow Zs, becomes boring.- 100% Infection rate for bites.- Anti-K+M system, this game seems like it was made for a controller setup, thankfully you can change the keys.[side to side for target selection | up/down for target area]- Horde/Bandit system, if you're going to do this then atleast have like 10 days before they come out and increasing in frequency once it gets closer to estimated endgame day.- Sleeping decrease rate way too slow, only game I would ever want a 1:1 time ratio is VR FPS.- FFW is too slow- Building material requirements + availablity.- No real gathering- Quests for gold/rep, but you don't even need them to complete the game?- Needy un-necessary companion, so you can purposefully kill to save yourself the trouble.- Quest A.I. abuse, never runs out of ammo, does get infected but only if 4+:1 without your help.- Overdone game genre, so people are expecting better quality instead of...this.- Medic heals one wound, but doesn't heal another allowing your character to slowly bleedout - got stuck in an infinite death loop because of this.- Graphics are actually comparable to JA 2; though, they had more detail...]- No VAs- Clunky skip system, why would you ever make MMB insert skip? can't double bind to space/enter?- Un-natural skill assessment of a corporate hedge fund manager?- Planting corn in the desert and FOOD PROFIT.- No option to self-heal although i've seen characters do it?- Laggy co-op partners wait system...- unclear injury warning system [your characters clothes can obscure the injury]- Farming doesn't work at times/character does nothing except stand in front of the well- Someone can have -80/100 approval for you, yet still stays in your community.- Infinite water from well.- No team-damage when aiming at a Z through allies.- People in your community can dislike eachother, but they never do anything about it.- Automatic gathering, they don't run then slow down & wait until stamina full then run again.- builders will automatically gather materials from unknown sources- Characters will idle while teamed up characters are being attacked around the corner/nearby- Zombies can't do anything if mobbed by a team of fists/kicks- Usefulness of wood after chickenwire/concrete stage | construction still uses wood in concrete setting stages- Possible racism? not a single asian character that i've seen through 3/4 of the game.- Getting stuck on cacti [plural of Cactus] Pros + 3-5$+ Questlines? Found a photograph of a old guy's daughter then returned only to have him die and the wife suddenly murders you because you found the photograph that caused his death[maybe]. You could prevent this if alice[psychiatrist] gave the photograph.+/- OST though after playing through the game it becomes incredibly annoying especially that high-shriek one.+ Time spent on creating a story/quests throughout the wasteland.+/- Save system 2 quicksaves, but you can get into an infinite death loop if you aren't warned.+ Fast loading+/- Co-op, but people leave you the moment you don't have a Mic & will often do things you don't like - running off somewhere getting bitten and injured.+ Moral Dilemmas+/- Some quests are selective by who does it otherwise negative consequences.[not enough of these to actually matter.]			"

												The game is cute, definately soemthing worth playing.Combat system pretty much sucks, the UI is clunky but looks nice, there's no interiors for the buildings and you can't see very far.  Two hours was about as long as it took me to have seen enough to not be interested anymore.The biggest thing i didn't like is that it's story driven, you're stuck with a diabetic so that drives your necessity for exploration on high, which means you can't just build your town and make it self sufficient before setting off into the dark, and going anywhere takes ages.If this game was a procedurally generated world with the story as a tutorial then i'd definately be playing it instead of writing this.

												The game starts off ok but quickly loses momentum as it is very easy to die in this game. Don't get me wrong, I like a good challenge but dying every 30 seconds is not my idea of good, or even decent, gameplay! It definitely needs a difficulty setting, which it sorrowly lacks! The mapping system is sloppy and inefficient (having to hit select all the time to access it is annoying). The doors in the game are not well marked so you lose a lot of time finding trivial things that should be clearly visible, such as doors. The missions could be a little more linear too given the type of game it is trying to be!			"

Want a big community well then I hope you like feeding your friends to the infected because on some of the missions thats exactly what will happen when you start running into the red strain infected. Everything you need to buy to have a good stronghold is real expensive and will just get used up right away and the fortifications you spend hours on will only get burned down by roving bands of looters and Alice's need for Insulin will have you tearing your hair out. The games balance is just utter dog crap.			"

Takes a while to get used to.The interface really bogs it down and considering it's basically a colony action/sim it really grinds on you even for a short while. I have only a few people so far and having to deal with their need for food, water and insulin is too much of a grind. It doesn't make it rewarding or enjoyable at all.The game has it's own charm and I can see the appeal but I just can't force myself to wade through this one. "

												Played for 12 minutes, asked for a refund.I had high hopes for this game due to the positive recommendations and it was number 1 on my wishlist.  I thought they had mispriced the game as it appeared cheap for how good the reviews were.  Why I didn't enjoy the game and got this refunded:- The graphics were not great.  I can usually get past not having top graphics but this was a tough one.  Not good graphics for characters or scenery.- The controls were clunky for me. Too many keys, and requied use of mouse wheel when I'm on keyboard without a mouse.  You can reconfigure the keys, but there are a lot to reconfigure.- The combat system seemed weak - hard to target, and very quick and rushed combat without much skill only a few key presses at right moment.- A walker jumped at me at seemingly a few hundred miles an hour and not much I could do to react, especially with the clunky key pressing combat system.- One little attack and you keep having to use a bandage.- You pillage zombies to find ammo, guns and things?  They would really carry them?Yes the games cheap, I hoped undeservedly so, but it's cheap for a reason.  I just couldn't get into this one, I find other good value games a lot more addictive.			"

I put on the soundtrack to Walking Dead - and things drastically improved.Alas I didn't enjoy myself. After just 30 mins into the game - combat and interactions in the world are just. DULL. And the zombies can keep up with you sprinting seemingly forever. The only way to get them off you is practically letting them jump you and shoving them back (good old ""press space to avoid grab""). And the first companion I get is a whiny diabetic. What the hell, why can't I just dismiss her. I was however able to shoot a random guy in the first community I encountered. Plus for that. But didn't change my oppinion of the game unfortunately. Did not catch my interest. There's so much other good stuff out there			"

												This game is better than you would think after playing it for just a few hours. After a while, you begin to constantly adapt to the ever changing world that is Survivalist, making choices in power or money, life or love.The story-line can be edited to many different outcomes in the mysterious choices of our three protagonists that could change as the tides turn. It could be five, ten maybe hundreds of characters that build the story of this game.If you could just not see the negative reviews, they don't really make that much sense. Yes, the game will expand and take a bigger shape in zombie survival and it is much better than buying a hamburger with somem fries and drink for 5$.Trust me, after a little, you will not regret the choice.

												I am unimpressed with this game.   Obviously this  is a port from a console... X-Box or something, and it sure shows.  But that isn't the real problem.This game lacks depth.  It's basically a base builder/resource gather type game.  But it was too easy, so the developers threw in the twist that one of your starter colonists has diabetes, and you scramble like mad the first part of the game trying to buy/cheat/and steal your way to keep her in insulin so she doesn't die.  They try and make it moral dilemma, by throwing in marginally easier options to obtain the insulin early on, by stealing and causing trouble between two rival factions.The combats are mostly harmless once you aquire a couple shot guns.  Those that aren't are easy to steer clear of until you're ready.   One of the biggest problems with the game is the limited camara field of view.  There's no scroll out, and your primary character can see about 10 feet for some reason.  Zombies hurl themselves at you from off screen as you explore new areas, and this is what passes for a fun combat system for most of the game.The base building aspect is actually pretty well done, with a good balance between resources needed to construct new buildings.  Beyond that, there's not that much innovative with the game.  Simple graphics, a sound track that could have been ripped from some Euro-Electric rave, make the entire title feel like a PC one man indie title.Don't get me wrong, I'm all for indie games, but if you want a much funner and more engaging challange, try Rimworld or Judgement Apocalypes for PC.  Both titles have the depth and fun game play you'd expect for PC games.			"

Survivalist produces at first anger at ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ useless camera angle, then at movement of your characters, they all move like they have stacked broom handless up their assess. The combats are completely uncontrolable, especially if there is more then few characters involved in fights. Those things are so annoying that every other possible good aspects of the game are lost. At the end, this game produces sorrow on 5$ thrown into garbage. Good thing is that it does not cost 25$. Anyhow, if you are not a masochist, avoid this game at 5$ cost.			"

Maybe a multiplayer option would make it better, but I just don't know.I would for sure give it a better go if you could make your own guy in it.			"

												The gameplay isn't terrible, as for everything else it is rather awful.  The music will give you a headache, the camera will disorient you.  The story is as generic and overdone as most other zombie-survival games.  The interface is very basic and needs a serious upgrade, it's similar to something made in flash from Newgrounds.			"

												This game could have a lot of potential, but the combat style is boring and never changes. If you like arcade mixed with RPG this might be something for you. If you want a survival game based on stealth and realistic combat, this isn't something for you. The graphics aren't very good, but you will probably get 60 fps on every computer while playing this. My tip for the developer would be to maybe add speech to the characters, and more ambient and realistic sounds instead of the arcade music, which is really anoying. I bought it for 3€ in the sales, and it might be worth more for me if it weren't an arcade style game.			"

												The game Survivalist seems like it's a good game for others but for me it wasn't what I expected. To me this game has pretty bad combat, if it was a free style shooting game like others, just aim and shoot with skills instead of charging shots, maybe I would change my mind about this game. The melee, kicking and punching didn't seem right. Was kinda simple, It should have more animations and such to make it more appealing in combat.Cons:-Having to wait for the aimer on guns on target to charge for accurate shots-Melee combat(Bare hands) wasn't that great-Didn't get to refundPros:-Game is very different from other games-Building things-Looting-Co-op-Nice graphics			"

												This game is one of those games that looks like a cheap goodie, but it is really just cheap.Here's a breakdown of my gripes with it:-Shooting System: For those who have not played the game, the shooting mechanics are the longer you focus on a target, the better chance one has in hitting their target. My gripe with it is that it takes too long to aim, but some players of the game say that it gets better as you level up, which leads to my next gripe.-Leveling System: If you are going to make a terrible shooting system that gets better as you progress into the game, at least have it awarding more experience when you go into combat. I am not also going to spend time with each of my individual squad members grinding my way up just to make shooting managable. It gets boring and makes the game lame.-Inventory Management: I have no problem with list inventories and a weight system. I view it gives more depth, but please add a search function to them when I go to my bunker to get something. It would be helpful.-Community Micromanagement: I do not want to scroll through each of my individual cast to get to the one I care about. I know I can quickly switch between multiple people using F1's community menu, but it gets harder to manage when you have more and more members. At least make it managable by letting us chose who to cycle through.-Combat and Vision: The combat is alright when I am facing zombie enemies, but when multiple looters come and attack this is when the issues arise. There is no vision cone wich matches the viewing angle of the charater, so when doing medium range combat with the assult rifle. I had died multiple times to looters because I know that they are there, but the game would not render them because ""They were out of my sight."" I would not have a problem with this if the vision cone was longer from the eyes of the charater.I had alright hopes for this game, so I was not afraid to be disapointed. But if you want to feel boredem and small fustrations, this is the game I would recomend.			"

It's dull, I guess.That said, I haven't put a lot of time into it, but something about it just doesn't do it for me. There are a lot of elements conspiring together to make this an odd soup of design decisions, from how entering buildings/looting works, to the absurdly low line of sight.It was cheap so I bought it, but I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone else.

												Its a good game so far as i have seen, however, i have some qualms.first off being the carry weight system. Carry weight is prevailent in alot of these games nowadays, but this one is by far done the worst of the ones ive seen. each character you get at start gets 20. (22 for the other guy i think) and for each level of ""fitness"" you gain an extra 2. Im currently on the part where the characters split up, one goes to the hardware store, the other to find insulin for a woman i wish i could kill, because i can tell shes going to be a HUGE pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ the quest requires sending a person to grab suppplies from a hardware store BUT UH OH, all the building materials are too heavy to pick up. (even just one apparently ) so not sure what do there.the second issue is ammo and gold for me. this stems hugely from the carry weight issue, i simply cannot carry enough to effectively survive the long run to fort (khorai?) and sell enough to fund a trip back as well as buy the insanely expensive insulin and do quests for the townsfolk. i thought 50 pistol ammo would suffice ( the pistol and its ammo being lightweight allowing for more stuff) but i ran out of ammo for it along the way and got bitten. The third issue is actually a good one. ( that is, one i dont mind too much ) im infected with the blue strain. (so i have a day to cure it) again, wouldnt be a problem if not for the huge lack of carry weight. it really all comes back to that, if i cant carry enougn at the start to effectively survive AND scavange for loot to sell, i cant get enough gold ( the currency) to pay for anything. literally anything. theres stuff too, lots of it. ive been tripping over stuff i know i could seel if i could only afford the space. and then when my ammo ran dry, i ended up stranded in the fort with a bunch of people referring me to the traders whom im convinced must be imaginary or ghosts because ive done 6 laps (literally 6) around the fort trying to find them and i just cant.  . . . that ran too long on tangent.that was actually my fourth issue, a ""where is..."" chat feature would be a huge help. so i can ask people where to find the traders. it took me 2 laps and 15 minutes to realize that ""stranger"" wasnt the generic NPC name, it literally meant i had to ask that person's name! i know it sounds like im ripping on the game, and honestly i didnt realize until now that the game wasnt early access but is actually a full game. but in all honesty, i like it. it kept me playing. will i again? yeah, maybe. and maybe i will do better after a few failures. ( those types of games take years for me to actually enjoy, as one failure can turn me off for months depending on the circumstancs) but as it so far stands, i cant honestly recommend it. but thats just me, its my recommendation based on my experience.

Just based on looks I would have opted out  but I gave it a chance.The dialog is akward and unnatural, the story is non existant.The gameplay is beyond awful, clunky movement, badly designed mechanics, a level system simple yet unnecesary.

												This is not a complete game. While fun until the refund limit is surpassed, it has it's bugs, cons, and really just isn't finished at all.Pros:- Fun for a couple hours.- Nice quests and controlling aspects.- Interesting stories and quests; don't feel like chores like other games.- Cool window in top right of screen, even though it has no purpose.Cons:- There is no stealth, and zombies just attack you at random.- Building is a pain, and getting resources is far too dangerous and takes too long.- Ammo is far too common and guns far too useless. I'd rather less ammo and gunns not take 30 shots to kill something- Supplying the girl with insulin is impossible.- Constantly tells you what to do, despite being ""open-world"" ie: ""Click to enter"" CTL = Control mode etc. like we know...- I feel terribly lazy to do anything that requires walking, as it takes WAY too long and the zombies will always bite you.- Terrible, terrible, disgusting filth of a multiplayer. For the first few hours, there are only 3 characters, the 4th player online will be stuck spectating for HOURS.- The whole game is a tutorial.- Character can't carry practically anything at the start.- No vehicles. Yes, while it IS a zombie post-apocalyptic game, walking feels like MILES between places.- Your bunker is too far away from everything.- Let's just not bring up the whole distance issue again.- Gold is so... complicated? It's not easy but it's not hard to get, but 82 gold for ONE DAY of insulin is just terrible.- Building supplies are far too heavy.- No zoom.Overall Verdict:Would be a fun game if it was early access, in it's current, ""complete"" state, not worth $5			"

												Unfortunately, the game to me feels like a cheap early access title. I expected a lot more from an actual released game. The models are mediocre, the animations are blocky and abysmal, the story feels like it was written in a day, and the characters are laughable.Hell, not an hour into the game and I came across a weapons shop with an assault rifle and a shotgun with THOUSANDS of rounds in it for each weapon. The game just gave me some of the best weapons right off the bat! At least, that's what it seems like.On top of an extremely unrelatable main character, who is also a bit of a♥♥♥♥♥♥by the way, I have to say that I do not reccommend this game.			"

												It really pains me to give this game a bad review. It really does have a lot of content. It's just....how do i put it.....well. Okay, one of my favorite games still to this day is ff7, if you haven't played it, you know someone who has. I have such fond childhood memories of ff7. So fond infact that about a year ago i decided to play it again. OMG it was so horrible to look at and this leads me to my point. Survivalist graphics are so poor and clunky for me that i cant see past it, much like my personal opinion of minecraft. I know, i know, i'll probably get stoned for that last one but it's just my opinion. I try really hard to see past graphics in games because great graphics does not make a great game. So maybe i'm being too harsh. Actually, I'm going to give this game another try soon to see if i can work past this. If so, i will change my review.			"

												This is a phenomenal game. I bought it for $5 to kill time while I was waiting to move overseas and within three days I had 35 hours totalled up. I came close to finishing the game in that time but wasn't able to due to a difficulty in the main campaign where I had to track down a bunch of people to kill them (won't spoil it by saying precisely what).  A couple of them went missing along the way and I couldnt' find them.Initially I thought this was a bug and contacted the dev (who responded VERY quickly and went to a lot of effort to help me).  After sending my save game the dev had a look and told me the location of a few guys still waiting around that I had to track down. I haven't played it since because I'm on a different PC with limited internet, but boy this is a fantastic game, and worth more than $5.Buy it, you won't regret it.			"

												/From the moment you start playing this game, you will get drawn into it!  It's less about mind-blowing graphics and sound than it is about pure enjoyment and strategy.  The role-playing aspects and character stats are well done, and the game is remarkably free of bugs.  Gameplay is smooth, the controls easy, and building and managing a community--while seemingly overwhelming at times--is very satisfying when you do things right.The bottom line: 9/10.  It's like a real-time Jagged Alliance 2 with zombies, and who can argue with that?  Definitely worth a lot more than the price, especially in a world where 99.9999% of modern games fail to live up to the good old days.  This one doesn't, and it's easily fun enough to play through many times over.			"

												This is probably the best game of the year. They thought of everything, the characters have different personalities, you can try many different ways of playing it. They still could add many things, such as multiplayer communities, different starting characters.. I also expected melee weapons to start with in the start, could have been cool too! I have so much fun playing it and I hope it has or will get the sucess that it deserves. 10/10                                                                     *Fixes*-If you try to complete the game with *Power* after realising you can't win with love, you probably killed Los Ceros already, which is more than 21%, becoming less than 80%. Basically now I have to restart because there isn't enough survivors left for me to recruit and get the quest done.-If you choose to go kill looters with Sarah and do it ""Au Naturel"", the quest will get permenantly undone for the rest of the game. *Fixed*-When two ais are hungry, or one is thirsty and the other one is hungry, they will start asking eachother for food and water in a loop and it becomes a never ending counter production for the community until they are legit, to tired to ask the other one for food/water!                     *Suggestions that would be great if there were more than one area, (More than one state to travel), and if the game would last longer, more communities and quests etc..*-Traps and animals (Bosses would be cool, at least white strain zombies should drop better loot than green strained zombies..)-Getting a way to increase the survivors skills, maybe adding buildings like Shooting targets, gyms, Hospitals. Send them to shoot targets at the gunstore like Joe Wheeler and the Diabetic girl did would be cool. (Can't remember her name atm)-Asking our scavengers to run back and forth to the resource place would be good, because walking takes way too long.-When our guards shoots down a horde of zombies, we should be able to customise what loot we WANT them to take, what ammo, guns, material, gifts. Which one to bring back to the base, if they find medicine they should go give it to the Survivor titled ""Doctor"" in the community. Also, it would be great to demand our guards to have a certain amount of ammo, our doctors a certain amount of bandages, our scavengers a maximum amount of ""space"" they should have.-Ok, that is the most ANNOYING thing in the game. I go really deep in the map, to find a sniper, with Joe Wheeler. A horde of zombies is attacking my base and survivors, so I go to my base and fight them off, but Joe Wheeler decided to go scavenge for food................... He gets attacked by looters and dies, gotta restart to the last saved game.-Since commanding a Survivor to do something becomes a ammo waster, we should be able to ask them that while scavenging, they use a shotgun, while attacking or being attacked by looters, use snipers. Reason is, shotguns are great against zombies and along with  the pistol you shouldn't care about the ammo because you'll never miss any of it. But if they get a sniper, they will spray the zombie and waste 5 bullets on a green strain zombies, like, come on man!-When a farmer is done putting seeds and watering the plants they go guard or scavenge. Reason is that all they do 60% of the time is sitting around doing nothing.-Classify the *Community* tab with  Doctors, scavengers, guards, farmers etc... Once they are titled Doctor, the injured ai will go ask THEM for bandage or w/e unless they can't get there in time they ask someone else. To be titled doctor, you would need to have a doctor suit, etc... (Or make a clinic/hospital where when someone is injured they can go heal there, faster, depending on how many medicine skilled survivors are in it.-Placeable guns on towers so you don't need to give a type of weapon specialised for everyone, ex: Pistol/Sniper/Assault rifle for guards and shotgun for scavengers.-When you command an ai to go scavenge, guard, or what not, if they encounter a zombie, they will waste 4x more ammo than the player would. It's one of the reasons why I hate equiping snipers and assault rifle on my guards because I'll have no ammo later on, but reduce the chances of Los Ceros exterminating me..-Have your gifts change the characteristics of the Survivor. Give a bible: Gets a bit more religious. Unless he rejects it like most unreligious survivor does. -Cigerettes shouldn't give you cancer neither kill you in a couple of days.-I love how other communites have trade routes, adding more 2 resources: water and food, to produce would be great so we could actually trade. *Trees for wood* *Melt rocks for cement* *Metal to barbed wire*... Etc-Automated turrets would be cool, or turrets that could be controlled by the survivor.-Multiplayer, I am leaving that for you to decide how it's going to work, but please don't do a remake of pay to play and play to win Clash of Clans. The reason why I do this review and love the game is because it's worth WAY more than it actually costs.That's all for now, great game, you have to buy it!			"

												Was chosen by an ally community as an impartial election votes gatherer. My task was to get statements from the community members on who do they vote for. One of the members was killed by looters several days ago. He has been lying there in a mixture of dirt, his blood and vomit ever since, nobody seemed to care much.

												Okay, so I was hunting around Steam for a relatively cheap game because I had $5 left in my wallet and wanted to make the most of it.I sure did.Survivalist is quite frankly the most modest/fulfilling game I have found in a long time, in all honesty it should be raised to the $7.50-$10 price range, and I shall tell you why soon.Okay so basically TL;DR Survivalist is a post-apocalyptic zombie survival game that orientates you a year after the outbreak, all the whilst you have been barricaded inside a bunker you bought for absolutely no reason (quite coincidental if you ask me). You begin the game exactly one year on as a rich, cheesy character who emerges from his bunker looking for other signs of life, and then the adventure begins.Before I mention about the storyline (I don't want to spoil it so I will only provide vague details) I want to talk about the general gameplay. The closest I can liken the camera angle to is Diablo, fixated roughly birds-eye but angled slightly towards the player. This allows for a good view of the surrounding area, but doesn't impede imersion at all. Your character also follows the direction of your mouse, which is a good quality as you are easily able to pick off zombies as they come screaming towards you. The aiming aspect of the game I believe is unique, yet brilliant; your accuracy is basically zero if you are 'run and gunning' so to be able to kill zombies you need to stay still, juke side to side while plinking them off. The sound is also relatively ambient, however after a fair amount of time the footstep sound can get a little repetitive, but don't get me wrong it definitely adds to the realism of the game. Occasionally you hear the words ""Eeeviillll"" coming from a zombie somewhere in the close vicinity, but I love this cheesiness considering the game only costs $5, and I have absolutely no problem with it. Although the only aspect of the sound that I consider irritating is when you over-encumber/fatigue; the heavy breathing your character embodies (despite realism) is loud and kind of annoying but oh well, thats a minute flaw in a brilliant game.Now basically this game grasps every concept of a fantastic zombie survival on a minimalistic, but perfect scale. You cannot carry over a certain weight in items, but this can be enlargened through increasing your fitness skill (by running) or by obtaining different backpacks. You have a constant need to find water and food but on top of that ammo is relatively scarce so you need to make use of it considering zombies take a fair amount to bring down. You can also band up with other survivors to create a community, each with different assets like construction/medicine that can help improve your chances to survive. That brings me to the point of base-creation, which in this game is just amazing; you have to collect building resources such as wood and concrete to be able to fence off an area and construct buildings/defenses for a good defense agaisnt the undead. I love this aspect of the game, I didn't expect it to be there at all considering the price but oh boy does it make the difference. However early on you are established as the alpha of the group, and that means catering to the Type-1 Diabetic who requires Insulin constantly, which in this world doesn't come cheap at all. The one thing that really impresses me though is this game is made by a single guy. Just one developer, who hasn't given up on the game (online co-op is in beta now with constant updates) which brings happiness to my heart considering most developers these days give up on early-access. For this guy to be able to create such a simplistic, perfect zombie survival is beyond me, and that is why I believe the price should be raised.I definitely recommend this game 100%, and at this point I only have 3.5 hours but I feel like that number will just skyrocket.

												THis is a nice game. It has a good story with an outgoing story taht folllows it. Also the way it is first and third person makes it cool. The game focuses more on the story rather than just shooting and violence like other games. This game is well-done, plus the price for it is reallllllyyyy cheap, it should be more expensive compared to other games.			"

I liked how that various people who can join your survival group have their own unique issue bars that need to be dealth with. I paid full price but it is well worth it. I'd like to see more like this in the future though possibly without zombies and just with normal people trying to survive a man made or natural disaster. 10/10			"

												Here is another game that just takes a great game that should be worth so much more.  For the price, this game is a must buy for the zombie suvivalist lovers.  I would like to add that this game offers more than a game made by a major company.  Not only is the story very well written, but the attention to detail in characters, traits, base building, and weapons is top notch.  And what makes this game even more worth it?  The developer is a true developer.  The developer watches the forums not judt on steam, but other sites too.  And not only do they watch the forums, but answers and responds to the posts.  That right there is what makes this game worth it.  This game is a 10/10.  Look every single game will have a fault to it, some with many more than others.  But with what you can tell is that the developer put a lot into this game.  And I will be one of the first to buy the sequel.PROS:Character developmentCharacter storyGraphics are great for this gameNot grindingAble to task one community member to build while others farm, scavange, trade, etcdiplomacygood trade systemweaponsbase buildingenviremntal hazards in the game from starving to roaming zombie/looter packsetc etcCons:None that are game breaking for me personally.  All in all, this game is a gem for the price.  It is worth it.  Great game.			"

												Love this game.Bad at descriptions so just outline the main bits.Scavange for supplies while fending off zombies. Playing as a character, can freely change between them. Have teammates following you or assign them other tasks. Can take control of someone doing a task and when your inactive they will resume it (I often change between people to sprint for a bit to speed things up).Build up a base, walls to keep zombies out, watch towers and other fun defensive things. Build a well and grow some crops for sustainable food and water.Explore the world, find new places to search for supplies, discover other survivor settlements to trade with and do jobs, bandit camps. Pretty sure there's a city but have barely explored.You can do basically what you like, if you want to kill all the other survivors you can, haven't tried it as I'm nice and they have more guns than me. Can rob, murder or just be rude, probsably won't get you far in life. As only just got it and on first play through I haven't tried out much, having been very nice I got much cheaper prices with some traders.Something I especially love in games in general is having really low system requirements, I like the graphics in Survivalist and it didn't require a computer murdering graphics engine like GTA 5 or watchdogs. I think my 12 year old crappy desktop computer being fossilised under my bed could run this just as well as my gaming PC.athering just fits within their carry capacity with the gear I always have them carry, and so then often cann't carry Definatly think this game is worth more than £4, also I rarely ever see a game with a demo, as its only £4 I considered not bothering to try the demo as I thought it looked so good, don't know how much content is in the demo but I got quite far before deciding I could be downloading the full thing whilst still playing, not that I needed to as the full game downloaded in less than a minute.

												If you like fallout style over head games then this is go to, even if you don't care for this style you should get it. You can get followers, find supplies to build barricades/forts and get companions. Your actions affect your community's view on you. The followers gain stats just like you and need ammo and supplies to survive. This game is really fun and only 5$ that is only the price of a couple of energy drinks so its not like its a bunch of money down the drain if you dont like it. Give it a shot its hours and hours of fun and the main quest is really long + you can do jobs in different towns for gold, thats the currency the game uses.			"

												I DON'T LEAVE REVIEWS OFTEN SO PLEASE READIf you like Zombie Survival games. This game is awesome! Negatives first because there are few. I wish this was still in Alpha, because even though it has so much it can still grow. It has so much potential to be more than what it is. The Graphics are it's greatest downfall. But that's about it! Otherwise the game is basically perfect. I wish it was easier to get headshots on Zombies. I wish there were more slow walkers though. They are mostly runners. (Which is fine, that's just a personal preference) And I wish there were options to make it slightly more realistic. It is way to EASY to find Guns and amo. I'm not excited about my Machine Guns and Shot guns. If head shots were easier and amo rarer it would be so good. I've barely been playing an hour and I love it. Probably would spend $10 on it. Pros:- Solid Story. - Great community builder.- can kill anyone. - Can loot nearly anything. - Fast paced Zombie Action. - Can BUILD a base. (walls, fences etc etc etc)			"

												The graphics are a bit simplistic but overall it's a fun game and is quite a bit more in depth than I thought it would be. The base building especially since you can set up literally anywhere on the map. Some places are easier than others due to proximity of resources but if you want to build a base off in the corner of some canyon or ontop of a hill with only one or two entry points that would be easy to defend you can.Combat is fast, though predictable. Each fight basically comes down to trying to keep your stamina high enough to knock away Zombies that grapple you while trying to aim at legs to make them stop running or heads to just kill them quicker. One thing I don't like is there's basically no melee option, the only weapons are guns and there is a limited amount of ammo available even from traders but to be fair it's a hell of a lot, more than enough to finish the story even if you take it slow.You can recruit as many people as you want and build your base as large as you want, your choice between sticking with a small group that's easy to manage or recruiting everyone possible and having a massive compound with farms as far as the eye can see. The advantage to the latter is you can bring a bunch of people with you and totally overwhelm any opposition. I would have liked to see an option to just join one of the other groups instead of always having to fend for yourself though.Out of stamina and get bit? If you have the correct cure for the strain of Zombie that bit you then you're fine, if not you better hope you can find someone who has it in time or that character dies when the infection meter fills up. It adds a bit more challenge and an actual reason to be extra careful when exploring.The other thing I really didn't like was the whole type 1 diabetes thing for one of the characters. I mean, sure, you could just forget about hunting for insulin and let her die right away and not have to deal with it but then you miss out on some very nice free skillups and some story.All in all it's a fun game and worth the couple bucks, especially if you get it on sale.

												This, in my opion, is a beautiful, yet unpolished gem of a video game, its fun, complex, and addictive (for me at least), but it also has it's share of short-comings, there is a real lack of story behind the other communities, I mean, yeah you can get the basic idea, but maybe if you could play as the other community leaders, you could have a complex action to consequence sort of story mode, say if you play as the Reed family, and you all die early on in the game, then you play as Joe later on, there could be ruins where the Reed family would've been, and so on and so on with the other communities. It could also do with some more construction options, as well as more use of insulin, there being only 1 character who uses it just makes it a pain in the butt to get it when you could just kill the character off. It also needs a changing map, the same map over and over again gets kinda boring. I know, I know, I've only been saying bad things so far, but I can't really name all of the great things about this game. Overall, this is a great game with some kinks, but has tons of potential, eventhough the game is finished besides for a patch or 2 after this time. Good job, and hope the sequel is as fun!			"

												Survivalist is one of those games that you play that you can't wait for a sequel. There are a lot of great things about the game and there are some things that could have been done much better. First the pros:The storyline and content of the game are impressive. With a variety of win conditions that allow players to decide what type of person Joe Wheeler wants to become in the post apocalyptic nightmare that is his new life. It also has a plethora of recruitable NPC's which have their own backstories and personalities. The combat system is straight forward and as you increase your abilities you get more ways to ensure that in a fight you're the last one standing. The fact that your characters can be infected makes fights with the horde all that more dangerous since one bite and you better start running for some anti-gen otherwise get ready to lose one of your companions and be in danger of losing even more when they finally turn.Of course with a large cast of characters you're going to need more than just a small bunker in order to keep them all together. This leads into the construction system which is similar to combat in that the higher your level the more things you can do. Sure you can craft yourself a wooden gate but, if you want a watchtower you got to have the skills before you can actually build it. The game gives you a small tutorial though you have to complete it in a certain time limit if you want one of the characters to stay alive. It introduces you to all of the basic skills in the game but, does allow for some trial an error (no complete hand holding but, enough of a hand to know what you're doing.)One of the more unique takes on it has to do with the female lead. Since she's a type 1 diabetic she'll need insulin for the entire game if you want to keep her alive throguh it. This  allows for insight on exactly how difficult a post-apocalyptic world would be on those with poor health conditions. It also gives a sense of urgency to you depending on if you want to keep her alive or not. As far as the graphics go it's not excellent but, when you take into account the game was developed by one person it's much higher quality then certain games done by teams.For the con's there are quite a few but, mostly things that just required more work rather then actual demerits.First the Ally AI is fairly shoddy even if those characters are profecient in weapons they don't usually use the tactical skills that they have acquired (IE: no head shots or knee capping) in command mode they will either run full speed until their fatigue bar is full or they will walk at a normal pace. Unlike a player who would mix running with letting the fatigue bar lower after a while.Both of these can be reworked by messing with the AI however the important one (for survival sake in roming) so that a character will be told to ""run"" until the fatigue gauge is  at a certain level before going back to a walking pace.For consturction there is a far too little selection in the amount  of things you can build. A few different style of shaes would be nice or being able to set up automated defenses.Next, Farming. The farming system is fairly convoluted. First it takes several days before what you plant actually grows. Also it doesn't tell you when there is food ready at your camp so the farmer ends up hording it. The fact that the plants tend to blend into the ground doesn't help much either. Raising your skills- Even though you can get a character that doesn't mean their stats are perfect. However raising the skill of a single character takes a long of time and the game doesn't really give directions on how skill gain experience (other than the obvious of ""using them increases skills)  Finally the last major issue is in combat or rather ""ranged combat"" If you're in a fight with a set of ranged enemies it's most likely not going to end well. Even with a bulletproof vest all it will do is protect from some of the damage as you get turned into swiss cheese. Fights can be won or lost on a dime when it comes to facing human eponentsAll in all I highly recommend this game in spite of it's faults because the game is very fun and gives a realistic view of what would happen if the ""zombies"" infested the planet. The only big problems are less about the actual game and more about the gameplay itself an how it could have done something better.Final score 8/10			"

												The game needs some work, the dumb AI that is on your team has a habit of stepping outside of the safety of a building to go I don't know where?   Alice keeps on dying because she won't stay put in the freaking shelter.Other than that this is still more interesting than H1Z1			"

												Survivalist is very similar to state of decay but i like survivalist better like state of decay survivalist is about building a base in the zombie apocalypse and keeping your survivors fed and alive rather than killing zombies unlike state of decay there are also looters and other bad survivors this element makes survivalist more realistic than state of decay people are always the real threat survivalist also has a huge open world to explore the graphics are good for an indie game survivalist is also long and has great replay value overall survivalist is the best zombie survival game on steam and better than state of decay5 stars			"

												This is a fantastic game all-around. As many others have pointed out; it's definitely worth the very low price.Pros:Project Zomboid-esque freedom with a touch of the sims thrown in. The game is a legitimate free, open sandbox. The backstory, characters, and world are all well thought out. Controls are very straight forward, and the learning curve isn't too brutal or too casual. The progression; story, character, and gameplay!Cons:Single player.. which may or may not be a big deal. The insulin thing.. I won't spoil anything; but it makes it feel a lot less sandbox-y. Lack of character customization. The only thing I wish I could change about the game is that characters, traits and scenarios be a bit more random so that each playthrough could be as amazing as the first.In conclusion:A lot of other zombie, survival, or zombie-survival titles will not mete the itch quite as thoroughly as this one, and for less than it costs to eat at Subway... Eat flesh!			"

												Similar in a way to x2: threat and mount and blade: the gameplay itself isn't that fun, but the simplicity of it, and the ability to build an empire (settlement in this case) makes the game highly addictive and amazing. Worth trying, esp. if you like Mount and Blade or X: series, but played them long time ago so you will not get bored easly. On a side note - it has some advanced character options compared to other games (you can make standard quests for people, give them gifts) + the quests are generally better than Mount and Blade. A minus - how many empires can you build? These games lack strategy requirements, they lack agility requirements... Sanboxes as this one are excersises in imagination - fun, but repetitive, if you play them too often. Overally? Very good game. Totaly awesome for the price - would pay more!			"

												After quite a while of searching for a decent post-apocalyptic game that didn't feature zombies (so sick of them), I finally gave in and decided to try the demo and, when it timed out, I immediately bought the full game.  While I hate the over-saturation of zombie games in the last few years, my love for post-apocalyptic-themed games infinitely out-weighs such disdain.  The inclusion of zombies did little to negatively affect my opinion.This game is excellent in almost too many ways to name, but it does have a few faults.  Then again, what game doesn't?  I strongly recommend this game to anyone who appreciates both post-apocalyptic- and/or zombie-themed games, since it will certainly satisfy both varieties of fans.			"

												I was having issues with carry weight but after more gameplay since my original review I've come to realize that it is all good, Don't try to run through the map and you'll do alright, at least until you realize that your base defenses suck, then you take it as a learning experience when you have hoards of red strains attacking and you are stuck with no fences, and 5 citizens with 3 of them using pistols.In conclusion, don't plan on making this a quick runthrough for your first play, or maybe even second play.9/10 just because I feel it still needs a little something more to it.

												The game itself is very polished, which is rare for an indie developer now days.  I definitely appreciated that and it's worth mentioning.  I didn't come across any bugs or glitches though it did leave some things to be desired.  The AI seemed to work well for this game.  The basic concepts of survival was also fun, as were the quests.  The graphics are simple but worked for this game rather well, same with the interface.  I kept my community fairly small which I did prefer, it can quickly become a micromanaging nightmare after 10-15 members.Though the combat system was simple, I didn't like the heightened speed during combat.  Dying was so common and random during fighting with other ""humans"" you really had to save a lot and reload if the outcome wasn't desired.  Fighting the infected was only annoying if running on fast-forward, since you'd easily get bitten in a second even with fast response.  Again emphasizing on saving frequently.  Also not sure about the replay value but I expect to give it a try.  It felt quite linear the first run through.  Victory conditions are kinda lame and winning was a bit of a let down as well.  There's quite a few quests, I think every person has a ""job"" for you to do that increases your relation with them and their community.Overall the good does outweigh the bad in this one.  Try the demo out if you're in doubt.			"

It had scavenging, building and crafting.. But then.. But then the flaws stepped in. Game started being boring after 2 hours and the soundtrack is just terrible. (Literally. Not fitting at all). I dislike the combat system ALOT, and the whole game feels unfinished.If there was some kind of ""endless"" mode (Without everlasting searching for insulin. Screw that thing.) with randomly generated map, colonies and trading posts.. If there was better command mode (Give roles to people, so they do their things automatically.), This would be a great game.TL;DR: Game is great, feels unfinished. Music is terrible. Worth 5€.

Play this game if you wanna use your brain a bit more then in SoD.If you haven't played State of decayThen take up the challange and survive the zombie apocalypse my brother, your time has come to rise above weak and lead a group to victory.. or wander around for ages trying to work out how to recruit people into your survivalist team (hint they have to either like you enough to work for you, or fear you too much not to)10/10 not many games get that c:			"

												Okay, I bought this game when it was on sale.I expected some half-baked game worth a few hours of fun.I. Was. Wrong.Typically, I am the type of person who isn't interested in games with zombies, and I thought I would give this game a shot.Granted, I initially played the game up until Alice gets her first five insulin and I stopped playing the game for 5 months.Eventually, I did return. I was bored, scrolling through my Steam Library when I saw this game.""What the hell"" I thought ""might as well give it a shot"".I played it for 30 minutes, which turned into an hour, which turned into 6 hours.I loved it. The game was amazing, and when I finished my first play through (I chose Love over Power and Money), I was hungry for more. I am now starting my second play through, choosing Power, which is no easy task.So far, I have not run into any bad bugs or glitches. The physics do sometimes do weird things, for instance, if you shoot a zombie as it is jumping at you, the body can end up going several feet behind you. A similar instance is when you kick a zombie in front of you, it can end up flying in the direction you pushed it, several feet away. Regardless, it's not a ""bad"" thing, just funny.My point is: give this game a shot. I initially hated it, but I grew to enjoy it a lot.Also, I realize that my review says that I have only played 0.8 hours of the game, but I played it offline on a separate harddrive.9.5 out of 10.A little tip: if you're going to threaten looters to get them to join you, use a character other than Joe. That way, there is less of a chance of people leaving your group (people often leave if they hate Joe).			"

												Creds to the devs who managed to create this game and sell it for just 5-6 bucks.It's basicially a survival-game were you create your own society in a post-apocalyptic setting.You trade, wage war, explore, recruit members and have the opportunity to shakedown and rob your neighbours.Every member in your society have certain skills and ""state-bars"" such as;Hunger, thirst, sleep deprevation and other depending on individual dependencies like smoking-lung cancer and diabetes type 1-insulin.The graphics certainly could be better, but takes nothing at all away from the game experience in overall, it sort of has its charm.For 5-6 bucks this game is a gem and showing us devs that appreciate the consumers and listens to the ""crowd"".It's not perfect, but at this low price - nothing would.Having 20 hours gameplay and still has a lot to explore and do, this certainly was worth my money.Big ups to the devs, keep feeding the consumers and take with you the appreciation from us.Hope your mindset rubs off on other devs!9/10 "

												Well i downloaded this the other day, and so far i like it and can see its not ready for release but i was thinking three things on my mind what this game needs to be successful is to let us change clothes so we can be different from the next guy and so we don't get bored looking at the same toons day in and day out also that girl alice who always needs insulin now i don't mind having to go and work on her shots. also the camera angles would be nice if we could get that in zoom on our toons and have it be able to go 360 degrees should we be able to look infront of us, idk i understand we'd have to have some sort of a fog of war but what i do mind is that it seems to be a greater importance then the virus itself and if i am not mistaken this is a zombie outbreak survival game not a keep your survivals alive before they complete their quest game or just to keep them alive period, i thought this was about keeping john wheeler alive only period. all in all it looks like it will become a great game though it lacks fun qualities that other zombie survival genres i the past have included i don't think i will say more at this time..

												This game so far (7 hours into it at the time of writing) is extremely satisfying. a survival rpg sandbox type feel.  Graphically it is acceptable, but like many indie games, its the concept that truely sells the game.I would like to see more added to the game (although I suspect there is plenty for now), by addition, I think a mod kit would do this game wonders for community content, stories, romances, new enemies, memes and puns, etc.  such a open and fun world to mess around in. For the price, its a steal.Pros: Just all around a fun mixed genre game balancing out building survival, rpg, and exploration. Simple easy interface and controls. People who enjoy games like project zomboid, Dead State, and other type survival rpgs will enjoy this. Good price, could be a bit higher with more contentCons: the graphics are not very interesting. rather bland cartoonish top down borderlands but without the charm. the chat menu can become a nuscence (would rather hit a key that open/closes chat verses autopop open and close based on proximity).  the music...the music is so out of place and terrible that I had to shut it off and just play mood music from youtube in the background..change that pronto would be my suggestion.There is more pros and cons, and may update this down the road once I get a bit further on and truely test the limitations.8.5/10 "

Great game, great story and a good balance between exploring, fighting and building a safezone.

												I was having issues with carry weight but after more gameplay since my original review I've come to realize that it is all good, Don't try to run through the map and you'll do alright, at least until you realize that your base defenses suck, then you take it as a learning experience when you have hoards of red strains attacking and you are stuck with no fences, and 5 citizens with 3 of them using pistols.In conclusion, don't plan on making this a quick runthrough for your first play, or maybe even second play.9/10 just because I feel it still needs a little something more to it.

												Guys buy this game Im in love with it! If you guys love either zombie or survival this game is perfact for you. Me personally have not played a good zombie survival game in ages. Last good zombie game i played was State of Decay on Xbox 360 and that was a ehhh for me but this game i payed what 1.99 for it and i payed $20.00 for state of decay? Rather this any day. Anyways Let me stop blabbing on about State of decay and talk about the game itself! The game starts off with three (Main) survivors... 1.Joe: Starts off with no good stats but is main character2.Alice: Starts off with good stats in medicine but has type 1 diabetes 3. Isham starts off with good stats in construction but dont get him close to any smokesYou start off at a bunker and work yourself up gain more surivors build up defences housing Toilets water sources send off survivors to go and take over gangs choose to let them live and force them to join you or kill them to show your dominanceGuys i recomend this game you dont need a strong computer either i used it on a surface pro and a old hp pc that my dad brought back from work and its like a couple years old not good for gaming cant even start minecraft but it can play this so i recomend this game Snoop Doge rates 12.69/10 Great game!

												This is a game where player needs to survive, a bit bored for the first 20 minutes, just like any other decent game.With he time pass by, you will need to start build your base operational, recruit member from any survivors or war at them, then give them place to live by building shack, toilet, water supply, and even you have to farm on your own to feed your community, because scavenging in town could be really dangerous from a spawning zombie.Then you will start to build your base defence like guard tower, pillbox defence wall etc.Good quest though, political, love, money lover etc.Sandboxing game which make you want to replay again and again.All your act has it own consequencesWorth of 5 penny			"

Many times I meant to play an hour only to find it 5 hrs later.For an indie game it is well worth the 5 bucks. watch a gameplay video of it on youtube and see for yourself..... replayable 2 maybe  3 times if your trying to get all the achivements. (Little more then 50hrs of game play my first go around with 69% or achivements unlocked)There are 3 different ways to beat the game.-Following your heart (don't let alice die)-power (recruit high enough amount of survivors)-gold (100,000 gold)There is even a secert way to get the gold without sacraficing anyone, that i or as i can tell anyone has found yet. Dev hints at it involving a character not related to that particular quest. "

												I have looked far and wide for an actually realistic zombie game, and just recently did I find this gem. Other games base themselves around shoot-em-up combat, but this game incorporates violence, character interaction, food, water, and medicine alike. The graphics are kind of funny at first but they kind of grow on you. I recommend turning off the music entirely because the soundtrack must've been chosen by an eight year old tripping on LSD... it ranges from techno to gentle piano to some kind of vocals to high pitched beeps. Anyway this game is probably worth $20 or more for how good it is, it's a steal at $5. I highly recommend you choose it if you crave a realistic zombie game.			"

												Here is another game that just takes a great game that should be worth so much more.  For the price, this game is a must buy for the zombie suvivalist lovers.  I would like to add that this game offers more than a game made by a major company.  Not only is the story very well written, but the attention to detail in characters, traits, base building, and weapons is top notch.  And what makes this game even more worth it?  The developer is a true developer.  The developer watches the forums not judt on steam, but other sites too.  And not only do they watch the forums, but answers and responds to the posts.  That right there is what makes this game worth it.  This game is a 10/10.  Look every single game will have a fault to it, some with many more than others.  But with what you can tell is that the developer put a lot into this game.  And I will be one of the first to buy the sequel.PROS:Character developmentCharacter storyGraphics are great for this gameNot grindingAble to task one community member to build while others farm, scavange, trade, etcdiplomacygood trade systemweaponsbase buildingenviremntal hazards in the game from starving to roaming zombie/looter packsetc etcCons:None that are game breaking for me personally.  All in all, this game is a gem for the price.  It is worth it.  Great game.			"

												The game itself is very polished, which is rare for an indie developer now days.  I definitely appreciated that and it's worth mentioning.  I didn't come across any bugs or glitches though it did leave some things to be desired.  The AI seemed to work well for this game.  The basic concepts of survival was also fun, as were the quests.  The graphics are simple but worked for this game rather well, same with the interface.  I kept my community fairly small which I did prefer, it can quickly become a micromanaging nightmare after 10-15 members.Though the combat system was simple, I didn't like the heightened speed during combat.  Dying was so common and random during fighting with other ""humans"" you really had to save a lot and reload if the outcome wasn't desired.  Fighting the infected was only annoying if running on fast-forward, since you'd easily get bitten in a second even with fast response.  Again emphasizing on saving frequently.  Also not sure about the replay value but I expect to give it a try.  It felt quite linear the first run through.  Victory conditions are kinda lame and winning was a bit of a let down as well.  There's quite a few quests, I think every person has a ""job"" for you to do that increases your relation with them and their community.Overall the good does outweigh the bad in this one.  Try the demo out if you're in doubt.			"

												This game showed so much potential.I bought this game for few cents in a bundle. I looked at reviews and decided to give it a try.I really liked this game fist 2 hours. It had scavenging, building and crafting.. But then.. But then the flaws stepped in. Game started being boring after 2 hours and the soundtrack is just terrible. (Literally. Not fitting at all). I dislike the combat system ALOT, and the whole game feels unfinished.If there was some kind of ""endless"" mode (Without everlasting searching for insulin. Screw that thing.) with randomly generated map, colonies and trading posts.. If there was better command mode (Give roles to people, so they do their things automatically.), This would be a great game.TL;DR: Game is great, feels unfinished. Music is terrible. Worth 5€. (Definitely worth if you got it in bundle).			"

												Similar in a way to x2: threat and mount and blade: the gameplay itself isn't that fun, but the simplicity of it, and the ability to build an empire (settlement in this case) makes the game highly addictive and amazing. Worth trying, esp. if you like Mount and Blade or X: series, but played them long time ago so you will not get bored easly. On a side note - it has some advanced character options compared to other games (you can make standard quests for people, give them gifts) + the quests are generally better than Mount and Blade. A minus - how many empires can you build? These games lack strategy requirements, they lack agility requirements... Sanboxes as this one are excersises in imagination - fun, but repetitive, if you play them too often. Overally? Very good game. Totaly awesome for the price - would pay more!			"

												EDIT: I have gone through a thorough paradigm shift as a gamer, and feel that my previous review was not intellectually sound, but for the sake of integrity I will leave the old review at the bottom of this review.I was expecting A and the game gave me B. It is not the developers fault for making B, it is my fault for expecting A when I bought B. When it comes to B, the game is great and does a wonderful job. Too bad I'm not a B person.If the psuedo-analogy wasn't clear, basically I'm saying the game does a great job at what it's supposed to be. Therefore I am changing my review from Neg to Pos. Too bad I didn't enjoy it, but that is my taste, I can still see hard work and artisanship where it is, and this game has it.Old review:When does the game start? This feels like a never ending tutorial. Is this game really just a clunky, needlessly limited, inventory organizing simulator with occasional♥♥♥♥♥♥poor combat instances that are either impossible or toddler-level difficulty? The game is built like an RPG but there is zero room for grinding, training, and building. It's linear trash, don't waste your money.The music doesn't fit either.			"

												Okay so this game is GREAT.... BUT in my oppinion there should be more building you can craft like a greenhouse maybe that will be very expensive and only for late game but still you an oppision i just wish there would be more then that you can build also maybe they could make more craftable items or something i dont know just put in more content but eaither way this game is really good i suggest it to everyone, just the fact you can have your own town that you built you self that you have to deffend from zombies and bandits gives you the hype, you have to feed your people give them water make sure they have guns ammo and recourse to drink and eat is really hard give you a nice feeling inside when you do something right you can also make choiceses in the missions/quests like if to kill someone or not you can also raid other camps and sometimes they give up and that moment you can make them go on your side im warning you they will hate you for killing there family/friends opps i guess xD you can make them give you there money or you can make kill them there is also a bunch of achievments to unlock a bunch of things to craft a bunch of bases to make <3 and also the best part a hole world to explore have fun guys			"

												Love this game, more than worth $5. Well done! Also, for the devs. There's a bit of a tiff when Spawning Survivors from the console menu. The names that sit above the over the shoulder view all say ""Stranger"" and I see no clear way of fixing it. ALSO! Possibly add a way to change the name of the Survivors you Spawn in? Just a thought! Game is a 10/10			"

												Survivalist is one of those games that you play that you can't wait for a sequel. There are a lot of great things about the game and there are some things that could have been done much better. First the pros:The storyline and content of the game are impressive. With a variety of win conditions that allow players to decide what type of person Joe Wheeler wants to become in the post apocalyptic nightmare that is his new life. It also has a plethora of recruitable NPC's which have their own backstories and personalities. The combat system is straight forward and as you increase your abilities you get more ways to ensure that in a fight you're the last one standing. The fact that your characters can be infected makes fights with the horde all that more dangerous since one bite and you better start running for some anti-gen otherwise get ready to lose one of your companions and be in danger of losing even more when they finally turn.Of course with a large cast of characters you're going to need more than just a small bunker in order to keep them all together. This leads into the construction system which is similar to combat in that the higher your level the more things you can do. Sure you can craft yourself a wooden gate but, if you want a watchtower you got to have the skills before you can actually build it. The game gives you a small tutorial though you have to complete it in a certain time limit if you want one of the characters to stay alive. It introduces you to all of the basic skills in the game but, does allow for some trial an error (no complete hand holding but, enough of a hand to know what you're doing.)One of the more unique takes on it has to do with the female lead. Since she's a type 1 diabetic she'll need insulin for the entire game if you want to keep her alive throguh it. This  allows for insight on exactly how difficult a post-apocalyptic world would be on those with poor health conditions. It also gives a sense of urgency to you depending on if you want to keep her alive or not. As far as the graphics go it's not excellent but, when you take into account the game was developed by one person it's much higher quality then certain games done by teams.For the con's there are quite a few but, mostly things that just required more work rather then actual demerits.First the Ally AI is fairly shoddy even if those characters are profecient in weapons they don't usually use the tactical skills that they have acquired (IE: no head shots or knee capping) in command mode they will either run full speed until their fatigue bar is full or they will walk at a normal pace. Unlike a player who would mix running with letting the fatigue bar lower after a while.Both of these can be reworked by messing with the AI however the important one (for survival sake in roming) so that a character will be told to ""run"" until the fatigue gauge is  at a certain level before going back to a walking pace.For consturction there is a far too little selection in the amount  of things you can build. A few different style of shaes would be nice or being able to set up automated defenses.Next, Farming. The farming system is fairly convoluted. First it takes several days before what you plant actually grows. Also it doesn't tell you when there is food ready at your camp so the farmer ends up hording it. The fact that the plants tend to blend into the ground doesn't help much either. Raising your skills- Even though you can get a character that doesn't mean their stats are perfect. However raising the skill of a single character takes a long of time and the game doesn't really give directions on how skill gain experience (other than the obvious of ""using them increases skills)  Finally the last major issue is in combat or rather ""ranged combat"" If you're in a fight with a set of ranged enemies it's most likely not going to end well. Even with a bulletproof vest all it will do is protect from some of the damage as you get turned into swiss cheese. Fights can be won or lost on a dime when it comes to facing human eponentsAll in all I highly recommend this game in spite of it's faults because the game is very fun and gives a realistic view of what would happen if the ""zombies"" infested the planet. The only big problems are less about the actual game and more about the gameplay itself an how it could have done something better.Final score 8/10			"

												Basically, if you like State Of Decay then you will enjoy this game.  Both are very similar in just about every way except graphics wise.  Survivalist isnt as graphically ""pretty"" as State of Decay(if you can call SOD graphics pretty at all), but Survivalist gets the job done and does it in a very satisfactory way.  For the price that they want for Survivalist its really a steal for what you get.  Nice little game for sure.			"

												This game is a really fanastic one. It puts you in charge of an entire community that you have to build up. You get missions to carry out for gold, you get raiders who track you from across the map, and you ge different zombies that pop up randomly. I'm just going to list the main ups and downsUps-almost everyone can join your community-Food and water are easy enough to get but hard enough to still be a task-controls are simple and easy to learn-each character has their own story-each character has their opinions of other charactersDowns-when you don't have many people, tasks can get very long and tedious-The weight of items that each character can carry is only about 20-25 pounds-It is difficult to get a new person into your community-special items, such as backpacks, are very hard to find. I reccomend this game to anyone, but it isnt and action packed shooter or hardcore survival like ""The Forest""			"

												I'm absolutely addicted to this game, which I must add was purchased for under $5!!!  Although not too customizable (except for backpacks and weapons), and you'll damn the day you promised to chase this desert non-stop for whatever limited quantities of insulin there are left for an individual who essentially is just a stranger to you, it all seems to fall into the right places.  The insulin chase adds the element of urgency to the whole thing, otherwise you'd turn this experience into a city builder sim.  Scraping by, and fighting tooth and nail to survive, is your humble beginning.  Leading a tactical squad later on in the game is when it really pays off.  Really wish there were armor options aside from bullet proof vests, both for armor and cosmetics.  Oh well, no big deal really.  Great game, great price, great entertainment.			"

												Probably one of the best zombie apocalypse games I have played. The main thing i like about the game is the ability to set your people to different jobs, I don't know if there is a limit to the amount of people you can have at once but for now I have 4. 1 man is my lookout who basically stays in the watch tower for most of the day, another one is my scavenger who looks through abandoned houses and cars for anything useful like food or ammo, then my last 2 work in a team, one goes to collect wood to build my fences to keep out zombies or looters and the man with him is just their as fire power incase he runs in to trouble on his own.I was searching the area with 3 of my people and came across an older couple who set up life on top of a small hill, the old man started to disrespect me so I killed him then asked his wife to join my community, she said no so I thought to myself I have no reason to keep her alive and killed her too. 10/10 You should definitely buy this game if you're in to strategy as the choices you make affect your story.

												This game so far (7 hours into it at the time of writing) is extremely satisfying. a survival rpg sandbox type feel.  Graphically it is acceptable, but like many indie games, its the concept that truely sells the game.I would like to see more added to the game (although I suspect there is plenty for now), by addition, I think a mod kit would do this game wonders for community content, stories, romances, new enemies, memes and puns, etc.  such a open and fun world to mess around in. For the price, its a steal.Pros: Just all around a fun mixed genre game balancing out building survival, rpg, and exploration. Simple easy interface and controls. People who enjoy games like project zomboid, Dead State, and other type survival rpgs will enjoy this. Good price, could be a bit higher with more contentCons: the graphics are not very interesting. rather bland cartoonish top down borderlands but without the charm. the chat menu can become a nuscence (would rather hit a key that open/closes chat verses autopop open and close based on proximity).  the music...the music is so out of place and terrible that I had to shut it off and just play mood music from youtube in the background..change that pronto would be my suggestion.There is more pros and cons, and may update this down the road once I get a bit further on and truely test the limitations.8.5/10 "

												80 hours later I can say its a good game. SAVE FREQUENTLY is the best advice I can give, there really are consequences for your actions in the game and scouting parties can run into huge swarms near towns.I almost wish there were melee weapons and more ""role specific"" items such as hoes for farmers. If they make a sequel to this game I'd love to see procedurally generated levels, the game would really lend itself to that. Perhaps allowing multiplayer would be a great option too, I would love for me and my friends to be able to try and run several towns to cooperate or raid with each other.			"

												This game is a lot of fun! It is kind of hard though because one group member is diabetic and needs a steady supply of insulin. Encumberance is an issue as you try to decide what you should loot and what you should leave behind which makes for some really difficult choices. Graphics: Old School, and simplistic, but they work just fine.Controls: Pretty good.Story: Decent.Sound FX: Decent.Music: Fabulous!Group Dynamics: Yes you can play another group member or you can send them to gather or build and assign them jobs.Open World: Yes, it is pretty big as far as I can tell, and you can do missions (mostly) in whatever order you prefer.Crafting: Yes, a little bit, there are things to build and things you can make.Zombies: Many seem to be fast, but I have encountered some that are slow.Baddies: Some raiders out there need taken care of old school style.Missions: Some are easy and some are hard. I am far from done.Gameplay: Fun! There is plenty here to keep you very busy. Building a base will take a lot of time. There really is a lot to explore and a lot of character interaction. NPC's have wants and needs. Exploration is enjoyable wiping out cloud of war.Advice: Get a backpack!Money: It's worthless.Ammo: Priceless!Insulin: Rediculously overpriced =(10/10 Will give the photograph to Old Man Toby again!

												ALMOST the ultimate zombie survival game!You follow a hedge fund manager who took the ultimate hedge: he stocked an emergency bunker in the Mojave desert in case of a disaster.  And it paid off.Manage multiple settlement members, press-gang thugs and looters to join you, keep your populace happy, keep everyone fed (or they'll get stupid), watch out for the undead trailing you back to your base, and looters tracking you back as well.Social and reputation mechanics are simple but functional, though they could be a bit more transparent.  Transportation and water are your most important concerns.  Different grades of infected and infection serve different levels of danger.The ONLY reason this game isn't THE BEST is that it lacks a bit of 'full feature' fleshing out.I'd like to see:more structures (kitchen/canteen, concrete barricades, mine, tents, barbed wire, stakes, irrigation...)more types of food (particularly involving nutrition and craft cooking!  We can't eat corn forever!)more crafting (melee weapons, fletching, clothes, duct-tape engineering) more advancement (wooden fences have an upgrade, mines add rails, people start asking for hot showers and solar heaters)vehicles and gasoline scavenginghouse dangers (narrow sightlines and darkness make buildings more dangerous than being outside in the daytime!)Annexing buildings (I know 'the dead can smell where we used to live', but surely they can smell where twenty people are living NOW, too!  Don't just let us, MAKE us claim certain kinds of pre-disaster buildings for benefits and requirements!)And of course...  character creation.  I'd really like to start a sandbox style of game with all of this going on that doesn't force me to play the jackass hedge fund manager.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE that the hedgefund manager is a jackass, not a negotiator, but the interplay between social skills, potential, and current skill level makes for some intriguing characters, not to mention the little things like lung cancer, or being a diabetic (which the game ALREADY HAS!).

												Excellent Game, right up until it started running slow, not just one of my saves, all of them. At first i was able to go back to an older save and it worked fine, but it too slowed down eventually and now is running so slow as to be unplayable, I will be starting a new game and hopefully it will work, if not, i guess i will be unable to play it.

												I had been previously searching for a great survival game with strong RTS aspects for some time. Low and behold I find this $5 gem. This game has RTS, RPG, and Survival elements all wrapped in one. Where the game trully shines is within the AI. Members of your community can be set to automate EVERYTHING. From quests and building, all the way to finding something to eat or drink on their own. Best $5 I have spent in a very long time! 11/10			"

												This game so far (7 hours into it at the time of writing) is extremely satisfying. a survival rpg sandbox type feel.  Graphically it is acceptable, but like many indie games, its the concept that truely sells the game.I would like to see more added to the game (although I suspect there is plenty for now), by addition, I think a mod kit would do this game wonders for community content, stories, romances, new enemies, memes and puns, etc.  such a open and fun world to mess around in. For the price, its a steal.Pros: Just all around a fun mixed genre game balancing out building survival, rpg, and exploration. Simple easy interface and controls. People who enjoy games like project zomboid, Dead State, and other type survival rpgs will enjoy this. Good price, could be a bit higher with more contentCons: the graphics are not very interesting. rather bland cartoonish top down borderlands but without the charm. the chat menu can become a nuscence (would rather hit a key that open/closes chat verses autopop open and close based on proximity).  the music...the music is so out of place and terrible that I had to shut it off and just play mood music from youtube in the background..change that pronto would be my suggestion.There is more pros and cons, and may update this down the road once I get a bit further on and truely test the limitations.8.5/10 "

												Just have to say that it was a long time since I had this much unexpected fun. I randomly found this game and have not been able to turn it off. I looks like I´ve played almost 150 hours which is not true (left the game on) but I have activly played the game 40-50 hours. Great game, great story and a good balance between exploring, fighting and building a safezone. Pro; - Cool settings- Love the exploring- Good enough questingCon;- Limited base options- Big difference running the game in high speed mode vs normal mode when attacking infected. Score: 9/10 and 11/10 based on the price... Good luck hunting.			"

												Some people may thing, ""OOOH another zombie apocolypse survival game!"",  but to be honest, the game is decent, if not more than decent.  I havnt played this game too long and horrible at it and need to learn how things work, but im working on it and am still having fun.Pros:Fun Mechanics, even if they are unreal.Performs extremely well and seems to be very well optomized.I personally enjoy the characters face in the top right corner.I enjoy the skill system and how some magazines boost the skills (Little overpowered).Fighting is simple and easy to useEasy to use control systemCons:Fighting can be too fast pacedNo cover system for gun fightsZombies can be annoying to take care ofMy survivors Seem to not automatically heal themselves, can be annoying if one is bleedin out.The game is a bit too fast making it hard to fight.AI kind of just charges forward to attack.Over all this is a decent game that could use some work.  Getting randomly killed by roaming bandits in the beginning and having one of my only three people die isnt fun, but like i said before, i suck at this game. I rate this game.... *drum roll*7/10			"

												Many players who like other games such as CS:GO or TF2 will say this game is crap because of the terrible graphics. I do admit to terrible graphics, but the actual game itself is a whole new, amazing, fun, and addicting experience. And with the completey worth-it price of $5. If you have the money, get this game, it is werf. Joe Wheeeeela is your character and you are an L.A. hedge fund with 1k $100 bills at the start, which so happens to be nothing at that day and age. It is the new age, the age of the apocaylpse with zombies at every turn forcing you to find your own way to survive with 3 choices in mind: Love, Money, Power. You figure out the rest. Try not to cause the collapse of society ;). You'll find out what I'm talking about sooner or later.................			"

												Okay so this game is GREAT.... BUT in my oppinion there should be more building you can craft like a greenhouse maybe that will be very expensive and only for late game but still you an oppision i just wish there would be more then that you can build also maybe they could make more craftable items or something i dont know just put in more content but eaither way this game is really good i suggest it to everyone, just the fact you can have your own town that you built you self that you have to deffend from zombies and bandits gives you the hype, you have to feed your people give them water make sure they have guns ammo and recourse to drink and eat is really hard give you a nice feeling inside when you do something right you can also make choiceses in the missions/quests like if to kill someone or not you can also raid other camps and sometimes they give up and that moment you can make them go on your side im warning you they will hate you for killing there family/friends opps i guess xD you can make them give you there money or you can make kill them there is also a bunch of achievments to unlock a bunch of things to craft a bunch of bases to make <3 and also the best part a hole world to explore have fun guys			"

												Gotta say i put more time into the game, and it just isn't that fun. It's ok at first, but it needs some vast improvement before i play again.I enjoyed the soundtrack at first, but when you roam around for long periods of time the same 3 loops over and over again start to get dull (and quite annoying).The gunplay feels ok at best, but it mostly comes down to how much ammo you have, not how much damage a gun does or how skilled you are. The base building is a joke, as you have to have someone that's skilled as a mechanic to even carry THE SUPPLIES for building a base back home! Why would i need to how how to use barbed wife and planks to carry the bloody things around?!?While i enjoy the lack of voice acting, the dialogue is mediocre and the characters feel as bland and lifeless as the undead they are fighting off. The least you could do is give each character a personalty, as they aren't randomly generated and you will run into the same people time and time again.I also feel that the game forces you along certain paths, and here's an example of what i mean: I was doing a quest for someone at one of the forts, she wanted to go see some guy she left at a police station. I liked the guy better then i liked her, as he seemed pretty polite and would make a better addition to my group. So i shot her and recruited the guy. I saved in a different slot and started my way back to my base. Half way home my people at my bunker kept getting killed. So i set the main guy on the course for home and switched back to the carpenter at my base. Turns out, the people from the fort of the woman i shot sent a death squad to my base. It may sound logical at first, but i was halfway across the damn map when i shot her! HOW ARE THEY GOING TO KNOW?!? It wasn't even a little while after either, it was right when it happened! Unless you're armed to the teeth, you are going to get annihilated. So i you even stray a little of the path the game thinks you should go on, you get severely punished.Over all, it's a mediocre survival game with decent potential, but poor execution. I'll give this game another shot down the line to see if it is improved, but in it's current state, i strongly reccomend spending your money elsewhere.			"

												Similar in a way to x2: threat and mount and blade: the gameplay itself isn't that fun, but the simplicity of it, and the ability to build an empire (settlement in this case) makes the game highly addictive and amazing. Worth trying, esp. if you like Mount and Blade or X: series, but played them long time ago so you will not get bored easly. On a side note - it has some advanced character options compared to other games (you can make standard quests for people, give them gifts) + the quests are generally better than Mount and Blade. A minus - how many empires can you build? These games lack strategy requirements, they lack agility requirements... Sanboxes as this one are excersises in imagination - fun, but repetitive, if you play them too often. Overally? Very good game. Totaly awesome for the price - would pay more!			"

												I like this game, but there are some things about it that I would recommend changing:1) Moving supplies is way too tedious.  Why can't you use a cart or a wheelbarrow?2) Your bunker is probably not the best place to set up a base.  Why not reclaim a town or area that already has some fortifications built up?3) I agree with some of the other posters that the top down view seems way too zoomed in, its hard to see zombies coming and you have very little time to line up your shot before they jump on you.4) Trying to keep the diabetic woman supplied with insulin is a constant distraction.  I would prefer if there were some in game option that would allow you to ditch her, or find a permanent supply of insulin that was closer to your starting location.  (The game makes it seem like she is important to the plot)5) I like the idea of ammo and supplies generally being plentiful, because it is far more realistic.  I also like that your carrying capacity is about 20 pounds, or 50 with a backpack, because that also makes sense.  Also, kudos for no ammo in garbage cans.6) I understand your game engine's limitations and why you don't have functioning cars, but maybe come up with a reason why they don't work?  Like there is a severe gas shortage or economic crisis?  Also, why does Wheeler have a radio in his bunker, or a TV?  Why did he wait so long before he went out and got more food? "

												Wow. there is not much to dislike about this game. Also, there is a lot to like about it. What is to like? Well, Let's start with how real this game feels. When I hop into the world created by these developers I feel immersed. I enjoy how difficult it can be and how you can feel the danger. Another  thing I like is all of the added mechanics. The ability to customize the layout of your base and choose the best defense scheme is a great addition. Although this isnt the most immersive game, such is State of Decay in my opinion, it is a well designed and thought through game which i truly enjoy. Now the downers in the game. The POV I very much so dislike top view cameras. I cannot stand them and that really puts me off this game. However the other mechanics really make up for this.			"

												Wow, cheap as chips 9especially in steam sale) but despite it's budget graphics and game mechanics this is a solid survival game. The story flows to let you collect people for your community and learn the basics, but once you get past that it's hella difficult. I completed the start quests and whislt having to split the party suddenly looters tracked our footprints back to our bunker that wasn't defended. now half my crew have severe injuries that require healing. The best part is also the most annoying part, one of the companions I've collected is diabetic and yes, you require a supply of insulin, which you need gold to buy, so now I have to do jobs around a nearby settlement. Deceivingly complex, not sure if I get to make the choice of just executing the sick yet...			"

												Great game, amazing deal for the price you're paying.Pros-Decent story (I personally did the love ending and I found the story to be great but that may differ on which win condition you choose-Fairly challenging game-Lots of surprises which makes the gameplay a lot more exciting, you must expect the unexpected-Controls are a bit awkward at first, but as you get used to them it becomes fairly smooth and convienient-It contains elements of townbuilding, which would be a plus or minus depending on what you like (I personally liked this aspect of the game)Cons-Moving from one side to another is quite the pain since you have to have your character run the whole thing and running consumes stamina and low stamina makes you vulnerable to zombie bites so it can take quite a bit of time just getting to one place to another-The lack of a group auto function for example, have 4 survivalists farming and managing them as a group so you dont have to go to each one and tell them to farm-Sniper rifle is pretty broken, it lets you deal with a huge number of looters without much risk (I guess this isnt really a big issue since sniper rifle ammo is quite rare, but even so)Overall, I would highly recommend this game. Lots of fun, defintely one of the more enjoyable indie games Ive played.			"

												This game is definitely worth the $5 dollars. Now remember, you get what you pay for, so don't expect a triple AAA title, because it's far from it with its wonky animations and graphics. With that said, this game is really fun with a lot of replay value. Survivalist is one of my favorite zombie games at the moment!			"

												I have looked far and wide for an actually realistic zombie game, and just recently did I find this gem. Other games base themselves around shoot-em-up combat, but this game incorporates violence, character interaction, food, water, and medicine alike. The graphics are kind of funny at first but they kind of grow on you. I recommend turning off the music entirely because the soundtrack must've been chosen by an eight year old tripping on LSD... it ranges from techno to gentle piano to some kind of vocals to high pitched beeps. Anyway this game is probably worth $20 or more for how good it is, it's a steal at $5. I highly recommend you choose it if you crave a realistic zombie game.			"

												Talk about gems just popping up on the radar.This is the kind of great idea you'd expect to see as a half-baked early access title never to truly see the light of day. But out of nowhere appears before me a complete game of the post-apocalypse where your decisions affect the game in meaningful ways.This is just not done often enough.The gameplay may take a little getting used to for some as it is not conventional. Personally, I was an expert after a whole of five minutes of minimal handholding.I feel like I'm playing a game I can really sink my fangs into. An excellent buy at five; I didn't bother waiting for a sale after playing the demo (I tend to find that is another good sign, when a developer goes out of their way to publish a demo along with their title... I find even AAA titles don't even go so far). If you don't believe me, give that demo a shot. If this is your kind of game, I'm sure you will be sold in minutes, as I was.			"

												ALMOST the ultimate zombie survival game!You follow a hedge fund manager who took the ultimate hedge: he stocked an emergency bunker in the Mojave desert in case of a disaster.  And it paid off.Manage multiple settlement members, press-gang thugs and looters to join you, keep your populace happy, keep everyone fed (or they'll get stupid), watch out for the undead trailing you back to your base, and looters tracking you back as well.Social and reputation mechanics are simple but functional, though they could be a bit more transparent.  Transportation and water are your most important concerns.  Different grades of infected and infection serve different levels of danger.The ONLY reason this game isn't THE BEST is that it lacks a bit of 'full feature' fleshing out.I'd like to see:more structures (kitchen/canteen, concrete barricades, mine, tents, barbed wire, stakes, irrigation...)more types of food (particularly involving nutrition and craft cooking!  We can't eat corn forever!)more crafting (melee weapons, fletching, clothes, duct-tape engineering) more advancement (wooden fences have an upgrade, mines add rails, people start asking for hot showers and solar heaters)vehicles and gasoline scavenginghouse dangers (narrow sightlines and darkness make buildings more dangerous than being outside in the daytime!)Annexing buildings (I know 'the dead can smell where we used to live', but surely they can smell where twenty people are living NOW, too!  Don't just let us, MAKE us claim certain kinds of pre-disaster buildings for benefits and requirements!)And of course...  character creation.  I'd really like to start a sandbox style of game with all of this going on that doesn't force me to play the jackass hedge fund manager.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE that the hedgefund manager is a jackass, not a negotiator, but the interplay between social skills, potential, and current skill level makes for some intriguing characters, not to mention the little things like lung cancer, or being a diabetic (which the game ALREADY HAS!).

												For €5 you get a great little indie 'survival' game. In all honesty it is a more traditional RPG with go here and drop this off, go there and shoot that guy type quests, the crafting is very limited and the zombies are all olympic sprinters. The map is big enouh if a little bland but the building aspects let you design your own base from scratch.It's not going to 'win an Oscar' for best voice actor, cinematography or horror atmosphere....but it is entertaining and easy to pick up the gameplay immediately. And it's for less than the price of one of those 'I add nothing to the game' CK2 DLCs.			"

												Sometimes you have less than $5 in your Steam wallet and decide to roll the dice on an Indie title and it pays off. Survivalist is one of those diamonds in the rough that delivers a satisfying zombie survival/RPG suitable for the nostalgic gamer like myself-meaning you've got to have hard-core gaming chops and a strong stomach for retro visuals. The environment responsive face-cam window on the UI was an interesting choice but ill-concieved considering that the portrait models look like♥♥♥♥♥♥overall the art of this game-is pretty terrible quality on the close-up components-especially on the conversation exchanges and the title screen despite having ""good enough"" graphics to accomplish its gameplay goals plus nice aesthetics and environmental set design in the overworld. It harkens back to the old Fallout games in a lot of ways visually and in terms of deep narrative but with a less advanced and comprehensive dialogue system and using a real-time combat system rather than the turn-based tactical systems of those pre-Bethesda games. There is a more acute survival component and a community building element that while somewhat clunky provides something similar to a low-fidelity Fallout 4.My first 2 hours with the game almost caused me to return it because even with the tutorial it is hard to get in to at first-in fact-I would say the tutorial is to blame. The main character of the tutorial should have been the girl with diabeetus-then ""you"" as the player would have to value her as a non-expendable character and be thereby compelled to follow the linear sequence to the point of obtaining and maintaining your supply of insulin. The plot around this is somewhat nonsensicle with Joe as the main character having to begrudingly accept her and it is unclear in the beginning how linear the game intends to be on account of the forced dialogue and character scripting around these events. You can deviate from the linear story but you will suffer for it in multiple ways...but it also has its advantages if you survive. The key is understanding that the reload option push from a failed mission is a courtesy and not a command-you can continue on after failing an objective-such as not responding to a certain SOS signal before thirst and diabeetus takes it toll but you will not able to access a few features until you recruit some additional members nor will you have the necessary construction training or tutorials available for base building with Isham.  The combat will be too fast paced for many I fear and harassment from random roaving mobs (especially if they are looters) from even the first two towns will discourage a lot of folks from going forward with the game given the time differential between building a fence versus time it takes to burn by molotov cocktail.You've got to be willing to give this ugly duckling a lot time to develop into the totally awesome but slightly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ plaid & polka-dotted flamingo that it will become...and you've got to love grinding and have lots of time and patience for  running around the desert, reading conversation text including asking everybody their name and ""what's up?' then beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of them for money as the most legit job available. I have been considering using this game for some videos on my channel but it would need to be heavily edited because the time it takes to do things on this game are ungodly. That said, it is pretty brilliant in a lot of ways and the only reason I am so hard on it is because I see the massive potential for the game (or the announced sequel-since Bob indicated that after MP was added the game was done and he was shifting focus to that) Here's hoping that you will be able to roll a character with military/police, athelte, bartering/social-skills, farmer/construction worker, stealth/thief skills, and medicial archetypes and customizable secondary skills to help organize community roles better than just having stackable skill books that anyone can use which although easy is kind of lame. Having no stealth, melee weapons, vehicles, nor a robust skill and item crafting system seems criminally negligent and the addition of these critcal elements along with more adequate dialogue options and less detracting visuals to a sequel would go along ways to making it truly outrageous...I'd buy that for a dollar ;)The fact that this joint was only $3 both explains and excuses many criticisms but the dude who made this is my hero and I wish I could spend some hours with him to explain to him basic stuff like how much lumber weighs and that while backpacks may increase the number of small items a person can carry comfortably it does not in fact make them able to carry more weight than they could before donning the backpack...but hey ya know it's a game and I like it anyway.

												I had my doubts about the game when I first saw its graphics, but this is EXACTLY what I want out of a Zombie game. There are different factions, plenty of people to talk to and see what they're doing. The AI is actually pretty good, whether its in combat or just general moving about (except when they're stupid enough to walk to the nearest source of wooden planks/chicken wire/cement, which just happens to cut through an unexplored, unsafe white strain zone with 100 bullets and a pistol...) it all seems pretty fluid. Once you've visited a town, hordes will pick up your scent and will track you back to your bunker every now and again, meaning once you've built up a little nest egg, you wont be sitting there bored out of your mind. Also, there are looters! They track you back to your bunker and try to destroy you as well. Think your wooden walls will keep them out? They come packed with molotovs as I unfortunately found out. Once you've upgraded to Chicken Wire you'll be pretty safe... Until someone comes along with an RPG. Fortunately theres only 20 of them in the game, but thats still plenty enough to kick your♥♥♥♥♥			"

												This is a great game I recomend that you get this game it is very cheap and fund to play. My favorite is how the story line goes. I have always looked for a game where you can build your own community and I found the best one. I would like if they added more choices into the game and even more communities to trade with as well. I feel like there should be another area becuase you are blocked of from leaving where you are there should be an update or even a DLC where you can leave or travel to a new area spread your influnce there and bring people back to your community. I feel like they should add more guns into it , but if they don't I am fine with the same ones anyways.  If you ever get the chance please make a sequal I really did enjoy this game. Over all 5 out of 5 thanks for making this fun game.			"

												Wow!  I wasn't sure about this game so I picked it up on sale for like $2.99.  Now I wish I'd payed full price to help support this developer.  This game is simply aweome and from what I understand a one man show!  The combat is fast paced and takes some getting used to, but really well done! (save often lol)  You can set survivors to automated tasks like gather resources from nearby towns which is awesome!  (Just don't forget about them when there are roaming packs of infected or looters around.)  This game is eaasily worth more than its being sold for.			"

												Very cheap but does single player survival very well. It focuses on what other zombie survival games don't, managing a community. It feels like an RTS assigning units and having them do tasks and organzing building layouts. It doesn't waste time with crafting or hundreds of building interiors, you explore a town and kill infected and it is all marked on the map to assign people to ferry it back to your base.			"

												Some people may thing, ""OOOH another zombie apocolypse survival game!"",  but to be honest, the game is decent, if not more than decent.  I havnt played this game too long and horrible at it and need to learn how things work, but im working on it and am still having fun.Pros:Fun Mechanics, even if they are unreal.Performs extremely well and seems to be very well optomized.I personally enjoy the characters face in the top right corner.I enjoy the skill system and how some magazines boost the skills (Little overpowered).Fighting is simple and easy to useEasy to use control systemCons:Fighting can be too fast pacedNo cover system for gun fightsZombies can be annoying to take care ofMy survivors Seem to not automatically heal themselves, can be annoying if one is bleedin out.The game is a bit too fast making it hard to fight.AI kind of just charges forward to attack.Over all this is a decent game that could use some work.  Getting randomly killed by roaming bandits in the beginning and having one of my only three people die isnt fun, but like i said before, i suck at this game. I rate this game.... *drum roll*7/10			"

												after only playing about three hours of this game I can honestly say I highly enjoy it and reccomend it to any one who enjoyes a fun gaming experiance. The good *a simple yet fun *you get to recruit almost any one in to your community*friendly and not so friendly human charecters*you are not the only survivor!!!! the bad *a bit repetitive*another zombie game (it does stand out however, and that is good but its still another in the genere) *get used to the music besides gun shots its going to be the thing you hear the most.Over all a good game can't complain to much with simple gameplay it makes for a fun way to kill some time.

												Probably one of the best zombie apocalypse games I have played. The main thing i like about the game is the ability to set your people to different jobs, I don't know if there is a limit to the amount of people you can have at once but for now I have 4. 1 man is my lookout who basically stays in the watch tower for most of the day, another one is my scavenger who looks through abandoned houses and cars for anything useful like food or ammo, then my last 2 work in a team, one goes to collect wood to build my fences to keep out zombies or looters and the man with him is just their as fire power incase he runs in to trouble on his own.I was searching the area with 3 of my people and came across an older couple who set up life on top of a small hill, the old man started to disrespect me so I killed him then asked his wife to join my community, she said no so I thought to myself I have no reason to keep her alive and killed her too. 10/10 You should definitely buy this game if you're in to strategy as the choices you make affect your story.

												I had been previously searching for a great survival game with strong RTS aspects for some time. Low and behold I find this $5 gem. This game has RTS, RPG, and Survival elements all wrapped in one. Where the game trully shines is within the AI. Members of your community can be set to automate EVERYTHING. From quests and building, all the way to finding something to eat or drink on their own. Best $5 I have spent in a very long time! 11/10			"

												1-) There are people who would be poor and hungry enough that they would steal your food & supplies. They would even kill you if you are in the way, in the name of survival,2-) And there are these ""looters"" in Survivalist who would attack your base and destroy everything in the name of...well, destroying.In game, a band of looters broke a piece of wooden wall in my base, entered and destroyed EVERYTHING that wasn't in the bunker (which consists of all the food, antigens meds, weapons, ammo and armors).And I am not talking about ""stealing"" and then storing them in God knows where, or actually using what they get their hand on.My guess is that the only reason they stopped with the destruction at bunker doors because the bunker were indectructable. (What a relief...)10/10 for this kind of logic and experience.			"

												Wow, this is an amazing game. I have had it on my lis fro a long time, finally got it about a week ago. Wish i would have gotten it sooner! I really hope the dev's come up with more content for it, like and expansion ect. You can either make this a game that goes on forever, or you can blaze through it in a few hours (though that would be really difficult, i don't want to spoil annything, but be sure that you have a LOT of resourses!) i would hit recommend another 20 times if i could! this game was worth the few dollars and far more. If the Dev ever wants to do voice acting, i would gladly help ( the vocie part, not that great at the implementing part haha.) Pros:-fairly east to manage settlments ( my largest was around 20 people)-Building your traveling parties is very is- follow, or stay.-Graphics are good for an indee game made by one person.-Lots of loot-Easy combat system (combat still challenging)-I like the injury system- skills reduce if you take too much damage and you need to heal before heading back out.Cons:-TOO SHORT!!! again, you can make this game last forever, [/spoiler don't like how it just ends.open ended would be cool]-Would like more settlement buildings-Maybe a few more guns would be coolAgain, this game is totally worth the $5 and more. I don't know if the dev plans on doing any mroe with it, but i really hope so, and i would totally buy another title from them.			"

												After 20+ hours I got a bit bored of the game... I keep rebuilding my base all over the map and yah... I got a like an army of survivors.This game is great, and will take up lots of your time if you are into that. I know I for sure am because I got nothing to look forward to in my life... fml. No but really. This game has a good grasp of what I have been wanting out of a zombie survival game, the fighting style and the view maybe isn't exactly what I wanted, but that is what this game is. To complain about that is complaining about a game you knew about before even buying it and I don't think that is fair.This game isn't to easy, yet isn't to hard. I wish they had a more online based scenario where the loot would respawn and much more details I won't touch base on. The online gameplay isn't much, but it is out there. Expect to play this game by yourself and against NPCs. Overall 6/10 would recommend.			"

												this game, it's a great game. You can set it to 60 fps mode from within its settings, but if you've played it on 30 fps mode the majority of the time it's gonna be a little weird and even feel sped up when you make the switch.What can I say here? I really enjoyed using two characters to build things and help manage the community by building a couple wells. scavenging for building materials, food, water and even in some cases meds gives the game a more realistic zombie apocalypse experience than some others will give you. Ammunition is very important and not having enough can be the difference in being overwhelmed or not. You have to build your own community, it'll be difficult, but you'll get there... or you know, you can try to mostly solo it and see where that goes as well. The game has so much freedom in it. An example being you can build random stuff nearly anywhere, so long as your character has the materials and building skill for it. Recommended if you enjoy a survival, community building, community managing simulator game. It's also a bit of an open world third person shooter.			"

												Absolute gem of a game. It'd be a crime not to buy it for 2.50 on sale. It may seem like a basic zombie indie game, but trust me when I say that it runs much deeper than one can imagine.It's one of the better zombie survival games out there. It's shocking how much content (game mechanics, map size, dialogue and quests) there is in such a small game. There is a huge map to explore, with areas separated by different strains of zombies that act as difficulty barriers. Plenty of loot and communities spread around, with some hidden areas as well. You can capture enemies alive and make them work for you in your community, or kill pretty much anyone except the main character, without the game ending. Almost everyone (except zombies and some generic looters) are named which is sweet. Characters have personality profiles and preferences. Zombie strains infect you via bite at different speeds (how many days / hours it takes to turn) and people who die to a zombie bite can turn into a named zombie, which will be marked on the map and stay there forever when killed (serves as a cool reminder of who you lose). Can build your own place anywhere on the map, plant crops, make wells, etc. but has a lack of crafting (can't craft weapons, ammo, clothes).Combat is basic, aim at something and wait for the reticle to turn red before shooting for an accurate shot. Depends on your firearm skill and the weapon you're using, as well as if you're in a watchtower or not (elevation seems to confer bonus for you and debuff for enemy, vice versa). It's a bit fast paced, especially when fighting humans, but the mechanics are very solid. Get shot in the arm and have a debuff to your firearms, for example. Bleeding requires bandages or cloth. View distance and weapon range depends on weapons that you're using (sniper rifle having one of the longest ranges and view distance, as far as I know).Dialogue is fairly simple for all characters, but have a lot of contextual meaning. You can always ask someone what's up (their interests), what's their opinion of you, for work, offer them gifts, offer to trade supplies, hold them up (as in rob them) or kill them. What's cool is that if someone is thirsty, hungry or is injured, they can ask nearby people for help (free or paid). Who you talk to (and how you talk to them) can affect your characters relationship with that person as well as their friends and enemies. Who you use to talk to the character also matters, so just because one person in your community knows the name of another and are good friends, doesn't mean that everyone in your community has the same relation with that person.There are numerous quests scattered throughout, and aside from the main quests, some of the smaller ones involve fisticuffs or taking out a group of looters. There are some big main quests which have interesting stories.Most buildings can be destroyed and you can occupy (and fortify) existing buildings rather than building your own (so technically you don't really need construction skills). Buildings have a weight limit to the amount of things it can carry which is cool.Inventory management is a nightmare without a backpack and fitness skills.Skill books in the game can be stacked for multiple skill level bonuses. Skills themselves are varied, in that whilst level 5 is the maximum, some characters can only attain 1~4 levels in a certain skill. So job dedication does sort of matter.Eat, sleep, drink. Some people also have special conditions, like diabetes requiring insulin, or lung cancer, etc.You can recruit a crap ton of people for your community. It's almost silly running around with a 10 man raid group.Best of all, press G to fast forward the game. Saves so much time running to and from or when you are just idling cause people are asleep or carrying loot back home.			"

												I would recommend this game to everyone if you're into open world survival games. This game gives me TWD feels, I feel like the main character is Rick Grimes. Don't hesitate to add this to your library, this game is good for killing time or even playing with your friends.Pros:-Different roads(not literally a road, okay?), every decision you made have consequences.-Open world! You're free to do everything you want! Everyone wants that.-Many quest to do from NPC's and some of them requires something before getting or taking those quest(Like trust etc.)-You're able to conquer other communities, or even make your own base at your own will.-I like how you can control your camera view. That's +1 for me in every game.-I also love how you can train your character or people on some certain skills.Cons:-I really hate to say but I feel like the crafting system is less. I wish there's more in the crafting system.-The saving system makes the game so easy, if you did something wrong you can just re-your previous saved.Overall, It's a fun game to play. It's worth spending your money on this one.			"

												I got the game when it was on sale, and I definitely not regret it. Not trying to spoil too much, but this game is extremely fun to play. Despite killing zombies, killing looters, recruiting looters, looting towns, stealing crops from others, recruiting survivors, building your very own base, building a well, growing crops, feeding your community and so on. I came across a glitch here and there, but it didn't make it unplayable. Also the Dev is pretty cool too.This game is a must when it's on sale if you don't want to spend too much money on it.EDIT:  I accidentally discovered a ""White Strain"" terrain while trying to save Connie from being bitten, and now I keep on getting attacked by White Strain even though I still haven't built a proper base and they are too tough for my little army, eventually wiping out my whole community.
