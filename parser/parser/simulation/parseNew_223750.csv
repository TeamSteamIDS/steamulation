												At my current level of skill with this remarkable simulator, all I can say is the Ka-50 Black Shark has a surprisingly large portfolio of warning indicators, usually experienced just prior to death.			"

												I'm new to flight sims, I don't even have a flight stick. I tried this out bored one day and after about an hour of frustration, not even able to get the plane in the air, i stopped. However, a long while later, I decided to give it another shot. This time I took notes, studied, and really focused on learning the operation of the aircraft. Once i got the plane airborn from a cold start, i was hooked. This game is truley amazing. I've since got a flight stick, trackIR coming, all because of this game. It's my current favorite thing to do on a PC right now.If your a sim veteran, you'll fit right in. If you are new like i was, give it a shot, but be patient. Take the time to learn properly and it's one of the most rewarding gaming experiences you will ever have.			"

												It's the best combat SIM on the market, but you need equipment like HOTAS and TrackIR ! (I use FreeTrack)Patience and training is needed a lot, to be effective (~3 weeks for Ka50, more than ~1month for A10c)   <--- my opinionBUY DLCs at SALES every 1-2month, usually up to over 70% sale. Also this SIM isn't finished ~every 1/2 year DCS get a new plane (F/A 18 is coming soon, also we get DCS 2 upgrade soon, with better graphics and performens)DCS has some bugs and stability problems (don't aspect a perfect SIM !)Sry for my broken english and read some of the comments or check out   http://forums.eagle.ru/ for more infomation !S!

												This game can break you or it can make you. You'll know what a real ""achievement"" is when you take off in a helicopter 7 hours later and realise you know every switch in the cockpit. You find yourself reading books about hydrodynamics, aerodynamics and your reader library starts to look like a spy's wet dream with military plane manuals, charts, quick start guides and startup checklists. You can then distinguish MiG -15bis from MiG-17F, you start talking in abbreviations. Your right hand is getting really buff... because it takes a lot of force to keep that joystick in proper position for horisontal flight as older planes have basic trim and no autopilot. You then try to come back to normal life, but you don't understand why people don't know what Mach 1 is, what is the Bernulli's formula and how it relates to aerodynamics, how translational lift is achieved. Your hard disk isn't filled with porn or memes, it's filled with pictures of aircraft in random liveries that you flawlessly copy in Photoshop, you then learn how to actually use Photoshop properly. Radio talk is nothing new to you - you know what ""Fox-1"" is and the difference between ""right 3 o'clock"" and ""3 o'clock"", you know the distinction between UHF, VHF and what TACAN is. You buy books about seemingly forgotten conflicts, like war in Angola, and you read any bit of information related to airforces, airplanes, pilots. You actually know how to avoid a missile, what every strange beep and tone at every frequency is related to, your normal daily conversations with just about anyone usually start with ""Did you know that nearly 50% of all Thunderchiefs were destroyed in 'Nam?"" You have a strange aversion to civilian pilots and you cringe when you hear the word ""captain"" in relation to one of them. You actually know what aircraft are shown in the news... You then separate your steam library into ""games"" and ""DCS"".-----The serious part of the review.Too long, my time is too precious for your awesome review: 1. Shady business practices2. Toxic community3. Best modern combat aviasim on the market (save for Falcon BMS)4. Extremely aged engine5. Will be completely destroyed by a competitor in the near future if one ever appearsLet me just shout this out here: the modules are slightly overpriced, but only slightly cause like a Jewish mama would say - ""They've gots ta make tha profit, if ya know what I mean Sal"". My verdict - they are worth every penny. Especially the Helicopter ones... Ohhh... The helicopter ones... *drools* The truth of the matter is - you get an actual digital representation of an airplane, down to such details as factory defects and internal systems modelled to actually ""wear out"" on you, with 400 page manual and sometimes additional material. It will take you at least 20 hours to get comfortable with it, and if there is a campaign included or two - around 40-50 hours of additional gameplay. So yeah, it's like buying a new game. And then you get to create your own missions, which to me is as important as flying in the Sim, so it's alright that some modules don't contain campaigns. The only trouble is that some of them are anachronistic and they don't come with era's vehicles and props, so you'll be flying a 50's aircraft against modern Anti-Air Missiles... which is incredibly fun, but also comically difficult. Then again, how many Sims you can name where you can shoot down an Apache in a Mustang?P.S. Whilst this is an awesome game, the community has got much to improve. If you want to have a good time - do not go to steam forums. The moderators are, for the lack of a better word, horrible and most of the community is toxic to say the least. Do not expect them to help you. It's so bad the official moderators don't even know English well (kazareal - I'm looking at you as you have tried to insult me after my criticism of Hawk and then quickly deleted your post and banned me) and they ban everyone save for 5 ""groupies"" that constantly lurk the forums whilst stroking mod's egoes. Don't believe me? Look at discussions and see which people comment - they are all the same five-six accounts. If anything you say could be taken the wrong way - it will be. The ""pro"" club that is formed on steam forums does not accept newcomers, whether they are more experienced or less. This self-proclaimed ""expert"" society fails to comperhend when they are wrong, whether it's about the game or historical topics. Apparently, being a blatant dilettante whilst holding your nose high is the new idea of ""professional"", because they get even the simplest facts about well-known and studied topics like Vietnam War wrong (since studying from only western sources and from some ""How I didn't die from smoking too much weed in South East Asia"" pilot memoir is all it takes to know about the entire war). That is the TRUE reason behind ""mixed"" reviews people are seeing now. Not only is the game hard and requires a helping hand - you will also be thrown into the deep end of the pool by your peers, one with sharks and gators in it, and if you try to swim up - they'll drop a piano on you.  (Note: this is fine by me, as long as it's fun to play with them, but it isn't and most people ragequit if they can't SPAMRAAM you to death). If you want to learn then better do it all by yourself, which is what I've done. Go to Hoggit. ED Forums are filled with banhappy moderators as well - they will insult and ban you if you dare to point out the inaccuracies in the module or problems in its programming. They will definitely ban you if you call out a developer on what they've promised in their module and as the Beta is finished you get the news that some key features are going to be missing, and you aren't too happy about that. For example, VEAO did this with Hawk module: they promised a two-seater plane, but in the end they just said ""it's too hard"", threw their hands up, called their momma and cried on the phone, and finally - removed said feature from the list without reimbursing anybody who was dumb enough (like me) to buy the Beta. As I called them out on this, I got banned and insulted by forum moderators on steam. The way it was done is extremely pathetic, since the moderator (kazareal) insulted me, then after I replied politely but firmly - deleted his post, left mine (this has taught me one good lesson - always quote the post you're replying to, although that wouldn't have helped the situation in this community), locked the topic and banned me from the discussions. Kindergarten level. Another thing - do not join ""military"" clans like TAW or whatnot. You will be prompted and nearly forced to - do not react. Do not reply. It's a game, games are for fun - go ahead and fly with friends, but for the love of Icarus do not join any of these ""brofessional"" clans.And a final word of advice - do not buy trainer aircraft modules, like C-101 and Hawk. They are made by shady, passive-aggressive third-party developers that take eternity to complete their modules. So far, not a single one is even out of a bug-infested Beta status.A little video showing how the developers and moderators treat the community:

												In order to understand what DCS World is, you must first understand what it isn't:  DCS is not a fighter combat game.  If that's what you're looking for, go download War Thunder; you'll  have hours of fun with it.  DCS is a high fidelity simulation geared towards pilots, sim-heads and plane geeks -- of which I am all three, therefore I absolutely adore it.  If you fall into that same category, go ahead and push the download button then come back to finish reading.  If, however, you're an average gamer looking to jump into a plane and start blowing away the bad guys, it's very likely that you'll be sorely disappointed with DCS.  The focus in DCS is realism, literally down to every switch, knob and light bulb.  The people who love this simulation crave detail, and it provides that in spades.  But you must love to fly.  I don't mean you glance at planes occasionally and think, ""That's cool.""  I mean you have to be the sort of guy who spent hours and days and months as a little boy thumbing through books about planes, watching television shows about them, and generally absorbing every detail you could.  You skipped meals and let your rent run late as a young adult so you could afford your next lesson in a beat-up old 152 at the local asphalt strip.  You have strong opinions about the viability of the F-22 vis-a-vis the F-15 on a cost/return ratio.  In other words, you eat, sleep and breathe aircraft.DCS is a plane hobbyist's dream, and it is deliciously difficult, providing an enormous feeling of accomplishment for every task:  cold starts, taxiing, take offs, radio navigation, and landing are just a few examples.  The combat is simply the icing on the cake; the real object here is learning to fly the various aircraft in all their hyper-detailed glory:  cussing when you burn out the starter on the P-51 because you forgot to turn the fuel booster pump on; reveling in a successful crosswind landing on a short strip at dusk; setting up a clean Maverick attack and executing it perfectly then rolling off into a valley; or finding an airfield at the last possible moment and bringing a damaged bird in on fumes and prayers.I suppose you could use the arcade mode settings, but I can't for the life of me imagine why you would choose to do so.  It would be missing the entire reason that DCS exists.  That's like buying a liter bike and putting training wheels on it.  There is no dynamic campaign, there are damned few missions, and there's no progression model, (and thank God for that).  It's a simulator, not a game.  The planes are the stars; the handful of pre-made missions are just there for when don't feel like creating your own.  Sometimes, just flying a radnav loop above a thick overcast can be relaxing.As for the individual aircraft modules, I own a majority of them.  They are all uniformly excellent, though you should stick to the aircraft which use the pro flight model and fully interactive cockpits.  Several of them, such as the F-15 and Su-27, are just ports from Lock-On; avoid those.  Of all the modules I own, the F-86 is the one I keep coming back to time and again.  It has a special charm, being at the leading edge in the early days of jet-vs-jet combat.  The sound is stunning (it sounds exactly like a real jet turbine; crank  up the surround sound), and the plane is easy to learn.  Note that when I say ""easy,"" I've thousands of sim hours and hundreds of civ-av hours.  I adapted pretty quickly, but if you're new to realistic simulations, it will probably take you several hours just to figure out start-up, taxi and take-off.  Once learned, however, the plane rewards you quickly, with a feeling of speed unparalleled in simulations to date.  A dogfight versus a MiG-15 will give you an appreciation for the high speeds and energy envelopes involved, the enormous scope of the battle, and the difficulty of hitting a small, fast target with nothing but machine guns.  It's less a knife fight and more like a ballet -- if ballets were performed on salt flats in Formula One race cars.   Note that I recommend you start out by learning the art of jet-powered gun passes against an unarmed transport.  Practice that for several hours before moving  up to targets that shoot back.  Otherwise, you'll be watching that MiG from a parachute.A couple other modules which stand out for their excellence are the MiG-21 and the UH-1 Huey.  I have reviewed the latter separately; search my review library.  They're all good, of course.  The best part is that you don't have to buy a single plane to get started:  the Su-25T and the TF-51D are included in the free download.  All you War Thunder mouse heroes, try the TF-51 and prepare to be humbled.  You just THINK you know how to fly. As with any high fidelity simulation, I strongly recommend HOTAS equipment with rudder pedals, as well as TrackIR.  You'll have to spend some time setting up your controllers and tweaking your curves.  Accept this right now, or you'll get frustrated.  This is a program for adults, not impatient children.  Also, DCS provides excellent support for triple-monitor systems like Nvidia Surround, you're golden if you're a superwide or ultrawide resolution guy.Hey, it's free; try it out.  Just set your expectations for what you're getting into.  If you're looking to be shooting down the Hun five minutes after the download completes, you'll almost certainly be wasting your time here.  But if you had internalized ""lifty-thrusty-draggy"" by the age of 12 and are still willing to engage in a lengthy debate about the relative merits of the XB-70 Valkyrie program, you'll adore DCS.  It was made just for you.  Welcome home.			"

												Ok, so, many of you will discount my testimony knowing that I am an actual aviator with nearly 6000 hours, over half of which is in combat helicopters.This simulation is the bomb! I just finished my first successful ground attack mission.  I've never felt a better sense of accomplishment after a computer game than when I taxiied to the parking ramp, shut down, got out of my P51D Mustang, and walked around to look at all her bullet holes suffered as we took out the entire platoon of BMPs.  Just take your time to set up the controls, learn to use the views, and learn to fly the aircraft smoothly and safely before you start taking on harder tasks.  The reward is definitely worth the commitment.			"

												This game, or more accurately, simulator, is one of the best games I have played in a VERY long time. No matter what your taste in aircraft or flying may be, there is fun to be had in DCS.You can purchase aircraft from a wide number of time periods, from WWII, The Korean War, and even modern battlefields. There's also some very nice helicopters to purchase, but I can't comment on those, as I don't have any.. ;-;If you like CAS, BVR, Dogfighting or just screwing around with friends in fast aircraft, DCS World is most certainly worth trying. The free aircraft you get, the SU-25T and TF-51 give you a pretty good feel for what you can expect in DCS, but I definitely reccomend picking up a full fidelty module if you like it, great fun learning what all the alarms mean... ._.One quick note though, getting the game directly from the developers is a better choice than Steam, as the version from ED's site gives you earlier access to new modules, updates, and let's you buy modules from sales on ED's site AND Steam, which cannot be done with the Steam version ;Dtl;dr : BUY IT AND YOU CAN CRASH TOO :D			"

DCS World or Digital Combat Simulator is one of the best military flight simulators out. I have played for over 700 hours(this only includes DCS flight time, I've played Lock on 1.0 and FC1 for 500 hours too) and I don't get bored of the series. There is a variety of aircraft and helicopters that are currently out as modules to the game which are sold seperatly. I have all the module and have tried out each and every one. The DCS modules include the A-10C, P-51D, KA-50, UH-1H Huey, MI-8 MTV2 Magnificent Eight and the TF-51D (Recon aircraft, which comes free with DCS world).Every DCS module has amazing detail and requires you to study on how the aircraft start up and how the aircraft functions. If you enjoy studying things before you try them out you will definetly love this sim. You can also just jump into the cockpit and mess about which is fun but the most fun is studying the sim and getting the aircraft up in the air, then the next step is employing the weapons which is even more fun. There is a module called Flaming Cliffs which is a good module for people who don't enjoy much of the study aspect of flight simulators and they can just jump in and hit a few keyboard buttons and get the plane started in less than 40 seconds. The F-15C (New Update introduced the AFM (Advanced Flight Model) which makes the aircraft much more realistic), SU-27, SU-33, MIG-29A, MIG-29S are the flaming cliffs aircraft, these aircraft allow you to perform CAP (Combat Air Patrols), BARCAP (Barrier Combat Air Patrols) etc. Whilst the DCS: A-10C can be used for CAS (Close Air Support), FAC (Forward Air Controller) etc. Each aircraft in the game as shown above can perform various tasks but you also need to know the aircrafts limits in what roles it cannot perform, This will help you not get killed!Overall, I Highly recommend this game if you enjoy military flight simulators and enjoy learning about how aircraft operate and how to use each aircraft weapons systems, Navigation systems etc. If you don't like the study aspect as said above you can just get the Flaming Cliffs DLC and hop into one of the faster jets and shoot some unlucky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ down.

												DCS world offers quite a few modules that really add variety to the game. The engine and flying dynamics are a sight to experience just by themselves. I didn't really know what I was jumping into when I bought this game. I've played Microsoft Flight Simulator x, X-Plane 10, Wings of Prey, and IL-2 Sturmovik: 1946 for a few years now. But all of a sudden had an ""itch"" for a modern military flight simulator with an up-to-date game engine. If you're in the same boat, or unsure if whether or not you want this game, then please keep reading.Pros:Flight dynamics- Easily one of the coolest features in this game. Every aircraft has a different ""feel"" to it. It's still a bit of a shock to fly one particular aircraft for so long, and then swap to another. DCS offers view modifiers when flying this aircraft. The player can experience positive and negative G forces (in the game of course), while straining their body to turn in on a MIG for an air kill. But be careful, straining the aircraft too hard can cause aircraft issues from instrument failures, to having it's wings/rotors completely ripped off in a realistic fashion. I can't tell you how many times I've been ""downed"" for blacking out pulling hard G's.Engine- What first caught me off guard starting this game was the engine limitations. At first I thought the map size covered a very small section of Georgia, then after learning how to pull up the map...I was in shock. It covers roughly 80% of Georgia, spots in Turkey and Armenia, and approximately 150NM into Russia...and yes, this is all one map! Not only is the map pretty large, but the graphics themselves are stunning. Not the ""best graphics I've ever seen"", but it's probably one of the best that you'll get for a combat flight sim.AI- The complexity that goes into how the AI handle ground vehicles and aircraft are simply amazing. And you're not stuck on a single difficulty setting, You can tune EACH INDIVIDUAL aircraft/vehicle,infantry, or whatever to suit your abilities! The AI will react to whatever you do near or at them accordingly. You spin up your GAU and lob a few rounds near a tank, they'll get the hell out of there. You see enemy AIs flying over a friendly SAM, the SAM will prioritize air threats and act based off of threat level. They see a wingman go down, they'll probably buzz out for the day. Just one of the many things you'll encounter against AI.Custom missions- I was so excited to see that I had the option to create my own missions/campaigns. The ability to make the combat environment more dynamic by the minute really adds immersion to the game. I can't say that I've found an online game so far that was playing a default mission from the game. I can't say that I wasn't excited to have the option to watch a bomber drop 16 Stand-off munitions against a single SAM unit.Attention to detail- Usually when it comes to flight sims, there's one thing that lacks from anyones expectations, and that's the detailing. I'm defining attention to detail as a graphical representation of minor details within the engine. Details within the cockpit are phenomenal! The glass on the Instrument panels reflect the surroundings, the sun beaming into the cockpit reveal microscopic scratches on the outside of the cockpit as well as the metal panels surrounding the pilot. The heavy breathing of the pilot when making difficult maneuvers. The list goes on!Active developers/community- The devs update this game to FIX known issues within the games, before they consider adding anything new, and this is a big thing for me. I'm tired of seeing other devs pushing updates that focus on new features without fixing the previous features of the game. So far updates have been rolling in between 1 and 2 month intervals, which honestly is a good pace for this game. Aside from the devs themselves, we have the community. The user downloads page on DCS's website is full of downloadable content, whether it's a new skin, texture mod, or a whole new campaign for the players to enjoy. There's also tons of multiplayer servers up-kept and ran by the community as I write this. A polite and professional group of individuals to say the least.Cons:Complex- I would honestly not recommend this game to someone who has NEVER played a flight simulator before, UNLESS you want to experience a challenge of reading tons of pages of information on how to fly the aircraft. However, there are ways around this, such as having automatic start-ups, and basic controls for flight. If you just want to learn how to do maneuvers in an aircraft, then you can always revert to the mission editor and create your own mission to start in the air...without air or ground threats if you prefer that. This game would also be impossible for newer players if they don't have a joystick of some sort. Playing using only your keyboard and mouse, or a standard gamepad controller will not do you any good.New Aircraft- I'm not saying new aircraft themselves are a bad thing, it's just how they release it. For some reason whenever a new aircraft goes beta for DCS, they start by selling it on their website, and not steam. Before they had the option to redeem keys bought on their site to steam, but has been removed since then. This puts the DCS community at a slight disadvantage, because now there's less DCS enthusiasts testing a new feature for it's main release. Which in turn, may hold the slight potential of having bugs slip through the cracks for release. But that's just my opinion.Terrain- Yes the world is huge, and has endless flying space, but my main snipe is that the hills/mountains are too ""sharp"". They don't even have a gradual incline/decline to them. It's hardly noticeable from a higher altitude, but CAS aircraft/Helis would be able to notice it quite easily.Final verdict:All in all, DCS: World's pros easily outweigh the cons when it comes down to playability. I have no doubt in my mind that flight simulator enthusiasts who crave a modern day flight simulator will get to experience a game that will fulfill that satisfaction of Air superiority.-""Blinx""			"

												[I play the non-Steam version of DCS World in addition to the Steam version, so I have more time into it than my profile indicates :3 ]First off, let me say that if you enjoy being able to jump right into a game and blow stuff up, DCS World is not for you.  If you only want to play with a keyboard and mouse, or even a controller, DCS World is not for you.  If you enjoy flying the C172 in FSX with arcade settings, DCS World is not for you.  If you want a SIMULATOR that will take time, practice, and a good set of controls to become somewhat decent at, then this may be exactly what you are looking for.The free SU-25T that this game comes with is incredible.  The quality and attention to detail is beyond anything I have ever seen in a freeware aircraft for another simulator, and, frankly, in most payware ones as well.  I found it relatively easy to fly, and the controls were pretty simple after mapping most of them to my joystick.  The missions are decent, and even after purchasing a few DLCs I still find myself coming back to blow up some tanks in the SU-25T.While purchasing DLCs is optional, you will definitely want to find a good joystick and throttle; the more buttons the better.  I have been using the Saitek X-55 Rhino HOTAS system and Pro Flight rudder pedals, and I still often wish I had more buttons for my  Ka-50.  TrackIR or something similar is also highly recommended.  Don't even try to play this with a keyboard and mouse - you'll save yourself a lot of frustration.Most of the negative reviews here are complaining about the complexity of the game.  And honestly, I don't blame them.  Eagle Dynamics published a hard-cover, 534 page manual for the Ka-50 for $189.  But there is nothing more rewarding than actually putting the time in to learn how to fly it and knowing that if you ever had the chance to fly one in real life, you would know exactly how to do it.  The Air National Guard used the DCS A-10c to train pilots transitioning from the A-10a the the A-10c.  This is clearly not *just* a game.Honestly, I'm not sure what else to say.  This is by far the best air combat simulator you will ever get your hands on outside of the military.  If you're serious about flight/air combat simulation, by all means download this.  Even if you're not sure, try it anyway; it's free.  Just please don't leave negative reviews because it's not an arcade flying game; that's not what it's supposed to be.10/10Sorry for being so serious :3			"

My Opinion: I could honestly say I love this game. It has such a realistic feel that not many flight simulators have. When I started I was just using the free modules, once I got hooked I started spending money on the game. The first module I bought was the UH-1H Huey and if you have ever played with it you will know how big of a learning curve there is. The Ka-50 is like flying with butter (it means its easy) unlike the Huey where you need to put the pedals and stick to a certain position so you can get into a good hover. If you ever look at the manuaIs for some of the aircraft it goes so indepth I feel like I'm acually studying to fly the thing. I love this game.Prices: The prices for each module tell you what kind of experience you will get. In most cases cheap modules will give you a non-clickable cockpit and less functions. In most cases more expensive modules will give you a clickable cockpit more function. Each module is like a new game. It's pretty simple.Bugs: The game has bugs like anyother. At this point I have been able to shrug them off and laugh at them. There are a couple screenshots on my profile of the bugs. Conclusion: If you want a realistic military aircraft simulator, you dont mind spending money on modules, and you can be patient when learning a new aircraft this is probably the game for you.Thank you for reading my review.

												This game is amazing. However, that should be common knowledge. The reason I am writing this is to address an issue that keeps cropping up. When people write negative reviews say ""Oh my god, the DLC is so expensive. WTF were the creators thinking?"", that really pisses me off. The modules are separate games. Hear me? SEPARATE. GAMES. On the DCS website, you buy them individually. However, steam puts them in the DLC section, probably for ease of access. I am going to say this one more time. The ""DLC"" is not DLC. They are games on their own. They need DCS world to open them though, (Something I learned the hard way) but that does not mean they are DLC. If you are wondering why this review is so long, it is because people who give this game negative reviews are probably not that smart, and need the extra help.Thank you for reading this very long rant.P.S. Buy a track IR. It really, really, REALLY helps.			"

												I have most of the modules however my favorite is the A10-C. You can do almost everything you can do in the real jet and because of this there is always something new and interesting to learn about the plane. Compared to other flight sims I've played over the years the flight model in the a10 feels the most realistic. You'll notice the difference upon takeoff compared to other flight sims which feel like they have sticky wheels.I would warn against purchasing the SU-25 or A-10A DLC for DCS world because at this time (2013) they don't have clickable cockpits or advanced flight models. If you're looking to get into the DCS series and like jets as opposed to helicopters then definitely pick up the DCS: A10-C DLC as I would say as of this time it's the most in depth flight simulation available.

 It is a SIMULATOR, not arcade bs  If you like arcade shootout plane GAMES like war thunder with mouse aim, and have no experience on real simulators, don't waste your time and complain how bad the game is, it's a simulation, you need to know exactly what you are doing and spend time learning the basics of flying the plane! Now, let's get to the point.This thing is pretty much as real as it gets. you can control every aspect of planes in DCS just like they would work on a real plane. there are hundreds of actions and options that you need to learn, and when you figure out how to use different type of weapons for example, i find it really rewarding. it will take A LOT time to master this game (like every real simulator) only negative thing I have to say about this, is that the in-game radio system doesn't always work properly in multiplayer, which really doesn't stop you from playing it, but it's a neat detail when you can communicate with the flight control and the ground crew like a real pilot would.i really like DCS and recommend it to anyone interested in real flight simulators.

												DCS is like math. I love it. It makes you cry. It wants to hurt you. You will despair of it. But every bit of success deeply satisfies you.First, you look into manuals, text books, listen to the instructor and think..yeah..I got this..can I start now? Then you crash. Multiple times. But DCS wouldn't be like math if there wouldn't be a good end. Eventually, you will succeed with something, perfectly hover with a helicopter, successfully land on an aircraft carrier. These are the moments that make up for all the crashes. Like the feeling when you solved your first second-order differential equation..remember? If you want to click ""Fly"", take off and be Lt. Maverick right after installing, skip this one. If you want to get as close to real flying as you can get on your home pc, why are you still reading this. Great plus: the support is friendly, replies fast, and doesn't show you that you just won the award for the most stupid user of the month. Especially when you asked them for help after forgetting that you set up an account already and all your DLC are bound to a dude that stole your nickname. I am still ashamed. 9.9/10 (9.9 because coop is not implemented yet, my gf cant sleep on the copilot seat in the Huey; will set 10 as soon as she can)			"

												I am 43 years old and I have been playing flight simulators for almost 30 years. I have watched them develop over many platforms ranging from Commodore 64 to modern day computers we have today.  I just recently purchased a thrustmaster warthog and thrustmaster rudder pedals and downloaded DCS with some modules. This simulator is so sweet it almost brings me to tears. With the graphics cranked up it runs smooth as butter. The realism is the likes of something I have never seen in a simulator and I have flown the best simulators in the past. Do not listen to any negative reviews about this simulator. Take my word for it... it is simply amazing! You better be ready to learn how to fly with this one. The learning curve is not that difficult for me but for a beginner this would be brutal. This is a high-end simulator made for people who can to play.  And they're working on 2.0!			"

												Best flight-simulator I have experienced on the PC yet!Flight-dynamics beats all the other sims I've tried on the PC.Visuals (from cockpit to the world environment around you) beats all the other sims I've tried on the PC.Flight-control menus (the setup system) give a brilliant ability to setup your joystick (in my case just a simple Logitech joystick) and fine-tune it so you have the feeling of control over the aircraft/helicopter you want (joystick zones)I can't really find much that could be better with this sim, except (as a simmer mostly interested in civil aviation) full world-coverage and larger/civilian aircraft.DCS (with the aircraft I've tried on it) is an amazing piece of software :)			"

												Great game!  Very detailed!Each aircraft is like an entire different game.  You can spend dozens of hours learning and improving with each one.  Even the more 'simple' aircraft, like the ones included in the Flaming Cliffs 3 package have great depth.  The Steam community is very helpful and quick to come back with answers.  The in game training is hit or miss, some are interactive, some are just long videos, some more detailed than others.  To make up for any lack of training information is YouTube, a large community of players that upload training videos that can simplify or clarify many of the complexities of the game.  Online play can be great fun.  There is a division between the FC3 players, and the 'fully clickable' aircraft players (master race), but it is rarely an issue.  The developers are constantly updating the game, and new aircraft are added regularly, with many more on the horizon.  This game is very detailed, so if you are looking for an arcade shooter, look elsewhere.  If you grew up playing flight and combat sims, this is the next level.  Don't dismiss the free aircraft, they are very deep and useful.			"

												An amazingly well done flight sim. Sure, if you're in reality a terrible pilot with bad habits it's going to be really hard to retrain yourself from the hand holding of other well known flight sims. Reality check #1, you can't expect to land at full speed. #2 Your 20, 000 pound Su-25 or A10 won't turn on a dime unless you know how to make the beast obey your wishes.#3 this is a very unforgiving and realistic sim. You WILL be shot down a hundred times before you learn to actually evade enemy fire. Also, you really can't blame the developer for the user being too lazy to actually read the manual provided/available to each aircraft. I mean, if somebody's too lazy to read the mission briefing that describes the campaign progression why would you expect them to read the manual? In conclusion this game isn't for the lazy or weak willed. It's for those that want the satisfaction of seeing an a10 at the local airshow and knowing you could start that sucker up and off the runway and navigate anywhere you want to go. While using any and all real world equipment in that airframe.For me 10/10 for this high quality sim, DLCs as DCS definitely worth every penny			"

												One of the best combat flight sims out there!DCS World is itself is framework for different modules (on Steam it will be classified as DLC, but it's not really DLC as in the traditional sense). This part is free to use and you get the Su-25T with it, a Russian ground attack aircraft thats really fun to fly.The additional modules/aircraft you add can be classified as ""Medium Fidelity"" and ""High Fidelity"". For a quick example, the Su-25T is a mid fidelity aircraft, to start the aircraft on the parking lot you press Shift + L to turn on the avionics, Ctrl + L to turn on the navigation lights, Alt + Home and Ctrl + Home to start left and right engines and then you are ready to taxi adn take off. Hi fidelity like the Ka-50 and A-10C on the other hand you start the aircraft up by following the actual, real-life procedures with clickable switches and buttons in the cockpit. This will require a lot of study and practise.The Flaming Cliffs 3 module includes the aircraft from Lock On Modern Air Combat, updated to work with DCS World. These are of the ""mid fidelity"" type aircraft and contain some awesome fighter jets.Another module is Combined Arms. The main feature of this module is that you take control of almost any ground unit (tanks and stuff!), and coordinate in strike missions with other players in aircraft, BUT, you can also drive around and shoot your cannon, surfice to air missiles, artillery, rockets and it is awesome fun in single player too (albeit not simulated very realistically). There are also rumors that you may also be able to control sea units sometime in the future.If you like aircraft, like to study how machines work and like fire laser guided missiles and drop GPS guided bombs this is the game for you!

												Learning when I first started with only the core free modules was definitely demanding. In the SU-25T, a Russian ground attack plane and DCS World's only free aircraft with weapons, my experience was something along this timeline:15 hours in and I can just barely taxi, take off, navigate my flight path following the correct headings and speeds, and finally fire a few cannon rounds at some anti-air targets on the ground before being shot down and perishing in a massive fireball of justice. 50 hours in, and I can just about hit a good approach, set my ripple spacing and quantity, nail a 30 degree angle of attack, begin CCIP setup and lock a point of impact before being shot down. SAMs are not a joke and I am not very good. Who knew countermeasures weren't a cure-all for pilot error? Chaff chaff chaff!75 hours in, and I can destroy helicopters with the undermounted cannon with relative ease, dodging incoming missiles on the way. I can lase AA and ground-based threats with impudence. Vikhr missles and I are like the hand of God, destroying all who oppose me with fire and rage and... joy, there's an F-16 Block 52 feeding AIM-9M's into my rather sensitive exhaust ports. Yup, still have a long way to go.The SU-25 has entirely changed my opinion on multi-role fixed wing aviation. I was always an air superiority guy; the F-15 Eagle and the MiG-29 Fulcrum are great examples of fighters that can be retrofitted to be multirole, and they're the kind of birds I like. Fast, powerful, and sleek, they're the kinds of aircraft a helicopter junkie like myself can really respect and all I really liked out of the fixed wing side of aviation. Until I flew the Frogfoot. It's slow, it's not a dogfighter at all, and it feels like the Soviet answer to the A-10 Warthog. It's glorious. It turns on a dime even while it carries more armament than I could have imagined an aircraft of this size could have become airborne with. Excellent tutorials, in my opinion. Free form enough to learn, guided enough to teach. The Frogfoot is great place to start learning what DCS is about.---If you want a game, keep looking. If you want a simulator with real-world systems modelling and all the attending details, I haven't found better anywhere else. Besides, show me a single other current flight simulator out there with these features, these attentions to detail, and this ease of use. Falcon 4.0 is about as good as you can find in my opinion, and that isn't modern so it doesn't even meet my criteria.As to the modules, or this being a ""rich man's game"": It kinda is, if you are the sort who feels compelled to purchase every DLC available for a title and can't be happy otherwise; but I didn't purchase any modules until over 100 hours in. If that's the kind of value I can expect from the paid aircraft modules, I think $40 for an aircraft I will spent 100+ hours piloting is fair. Having now purchased the Flaming Cliffs 3 module (as I was recommended to start there,) it was worth every penny. I hadn't even touched the mission creator before FC3 but as I become familiar with it I have found I can make any scenario I want, from A-10A CAS flights to patrols in an SU-27 and anything in between. Training. Forced failures right before a landing. Whatever I want to practice or do, I can create. And if I don't know how to script it someine in the very friendly community will know how and most likely help. I see complaints about the module pricing and I do understand, but in my opinion for what you are paying for it is worth it. Just the modelling and rigging in the cockpits alone is fantastic. All instrument panels work. I have been able to practice blind ""instrument approaches"" like I saw the real pilots I worked with in the Army do, and that is a hell of a thing.Given that there aren't really any other modern optionswith this kind of community and backing I should think aviation enthusiasts such as myself, (with or without real world experience) can see the value on offer here. See ya in the skies.			"

												DCS World enables you to fly various modern aircraft or command ground forces in a hypothetical war between NATO and Russia on the Russia/Georgia border region. DCS World comes with the SU-25t which includes tutorials, multiplayer, a campaign, single missions and a mission editor. It's an entire game, for free! The best part of DCS World is the ability to combine the various modules, DCS: A-10C and Combined arms for example. All the modules are linked through DCS World and therefore you can play on the same server as someone else flying/controlling different vehicles to you in one big battlespace! So if you fancy taking on a highly realistic combat simulation then pick up DCS A-10C for DCS World. If you want something a little more forgiving then you can grab hold of Flaming Cliffs A-10A.More and more aircraft are being added all the time, with the F-15, F/A-18, MiG 29, SU-27 and SU-33 expected fairly soon. There are also sims for the Mi-8, Huey, KA-50 Black Shark and also the P-51D Mustang!If you love aircraft and want to jump into something more true to life than 'Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X' then this is the product for you!(Joystick with rudder function and some kind of head tracking system is highly recommended! Facetracknoir is free and works with any webcam)Overall this game is fantastic if you are into modern aviation and don't mind a somewhat steep learning curve.In case you were wondering (as others have) The reason steam thinks I have not spent any time AT ALL playing this game is because I use a non-steam shortcut to play it, the standard shortcut that steam provides does not work with the steam overlay for me. So before you start making clever remarks about how I know about the game, just bear that in mind :)I get no benefit from having written this review, it is for your benefit so why would I lie about it? it's absurd lol.

												Cannot describe how bad♥♥♥♥♥this sim is.  Needs 3 things, to be successful.-(Atleast) A simple flight stick.  -Check--Track IR -Check--Patience -Check-I want to point out that many of the negative comments are geared towards the ""DLC"" parts of DCS.  To call the content ""DLC"" as if it were some CoD or Battlefield zombie map pack trash being crammed down your throat by EA is wildly inaccurate.  Each aircraft, the Huey for instance, is a game unto itself, that will take hundreds of hours to master.  Some of the modules do not even come from Eagle Dynamics (the developer).  For instance the F86 Sabre comes from Belsimtek and the aforementioned Huey is so accuately detailed it has a Bell Helicopters Product Serial #.

												So, DCS World is an incredible niche hardcore flight simulator. You need a HOTAS and realistically head tracking, and if you don't know what those are you're probably in the wrong place anyway. But I'm not here to tell you about all that. I'm here because some of the negative reviews for this game are amazing.""Too much controls to remember""""Horrible game way too confusing""""Confusion simulator 2015""""...unfortunately, this is one of those 'overly realistic' simulators.""""Wtf did I just download?""Hard to argue with any of them, actually. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go back to flying my A-10C.			"

												The most underrated game of all time I'm sure...There is so much time and development that went into this simulator.I read a review based on this game and the reviewer mention, once you get that plane started and everything ready and the second you get off the ground... the feeling is unbelievable.... 1000% correct.Awesome feeling! Especially when you land safely :)I completely recommend it!!			"

												Are you looking for a ultra realistic military flight simulator that includes fighter jets, CAS (close air support) jets, attack and transport helicopters and WW2 era fighter planes? If so then this game is for you!The core game gives you the SU-25t Russian CAS jet and a WW2 era fighter plane with a fully interactive cockpit for free. To use more planes you have to buy them as a DLC but flamming cliffs 3 have cheap aircraft (check the store for more information on prices and aircrafts).The physics are extremely accurate and realistic: E.G - missiles, fuel pods, bombs, airliners, wings, the nose etc - create drag depending on their size and mass as well as affecting the overall weight of the aircraft. There is single-player training, free flight, scenarios and missions as well as the public and private multiplayer. There is too much for me to say about this game but I just don't have the time to write it all down, but I will tell you that the game has a learning curve for players who want to play this game.Overall, if you love military aircraft, dogfighting and/or doing ground attack with aircraft with realistic simulation then this is the kind of game you WILL want to play!

												This is not a game, if you expect that, look somewhere else. This is a simulator in the old sense of the word, every plane has been crafted by many people, for years each, they replicate almost every nook and crany in every single plane, every possible damaged system, every reaction to damage or malfunction for misuse is there.You won't hop in with general basic controls and fly your way through the skies.You WILL have to read manuals, you WILL have to practice and you WILL fail, many times untill you get it right; but when you do, oh when you master a plane, you know you can hop into that winged beast in real life and you would be able to work the systems, and get that thing in the air and hopefully back home safely.This is not a casual game, it costs what it does because it has it's value invested in time and effort by the developers.It's not the intention to sound like a ""master race sim player"", but the only way you would appreciate this sim, is if you are a plane enthusiast. Otherwise you will find it frustrating. But if you meet the requirements...there just isn't anything more realistic than this, and it  WILL be worth every penny. "

												I`m with DCS World since its grandpa Flanker 2.0, I own all the modules and I put more than few months of playtime in to this simulator. What will you get for free:DCS World comes with Caucasus map and two free planes. The unarmed version of legendary WWII Mustang - the TF-51, and Russian twin-engine ground attack jet Su-25T.The TF-51 comes with fully clickable/interactive cockpit - means you can move every button with your mouse. The Su-25T does not have this feature but it comes with large variety of weapons.I can safely say that both free planes (the TF-51 especially) are on pair with some pay-ware add-ons for other flightsims. The TF-51 model and flight dynamics are really amazing. Free DCS also includes powerful map editor - you can create your own missions, scenarios or even whole campaigns. Sim also allows you to play in MP with your friends.Thanks to that you can get hours of entertainment with out paying anything extra.Regarding the map - so far its still the same old Caucasus theater but its big enough for all those war birds. What you can buy:Various planes and helicopters called ""Modules"" made by ED or third party companies, additional campaigns, additional maps (currently Nevada terrain only) and expansion called Combined Arms that allows you to control many ground units and even atni-aircraft batteries.  Planes included in Flaming Cliffs pack does not have clickable cockpits and are more simplified, other modules are pretty much stand alone study sims. Those are not ""cosmetic dlc planes"" - every DCS module is a in depth replica of real aircraft/helicopter that was developed for more than a year, tested by real world pilots/ground crew, and mostly (like Huey helicopter) are licensed by their real life manufacturers. Every plane has excellent 3d model, in depth system simulation and flight model. I see lots of confusion regarding module prices - you can go to official ED forums and see for yourself what those planes are made of. After flying with all of them I can safely say - if you are serious flight simmer you wont regret purchasing any of them. DCS modules gives you months or even years of entertainment - I don't know many AAA games that can do that.There are few aerodynamic flight models used in DCS World - less advanced and more professional ones - if you want familiarize yourself with details you can look up DCS wiki page. The most advance one Professional Flight Model (PFM) works pretty much as a virtual wind tunnel and its most realistic atm. To be honest planes that utilizes PFM feels just incredible, comparable to best add-ons for X-plane. Also DCS in my opinion has the best helicopter flight model next to X-plane.Of course every module comes with really in depth manuals (100-300 pages of detailed informations) and this shows how complicated those planes/helicopters are.I must mention that lately DCS introduces shared MP cockpits that allows you to fly in the same plane with your friend - it was introduced with official ED module L-39.Full list of available planes and helicopters with upcoming ones can be found on official Eagle Dynamics website. Some are currently not available on Stream platform.  Summing up - this is not a game. DCS must be played with at least joystick, or preferably HOTAS setup and TrackIr. You can try to fly with keyboard or controller but its not recommended.If you are less experienced, before jumping in to more complicated modules, try the free version, or start from getting one of Flaming Cliffs planes. http://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/products/world/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Combat_Simulator "

												Alright, so ehh... This review won't be something special, but I'll try to do my best.I love simulators, military based ones tho. Most of everything, I love planes. I started loving planes when I started playing Ace Combat Zero / Ace combat games.All types, cargo planes, fighter jets or bombers. I love 'em all.This game gives you 2 free planes. SU-25T [Frogfoot] and P-51D. Both special in their ways, depends on what military situations or time periods you like. With both of those planes, you can have some pretty good experience and fun, with or without friends.The problem is having only 2 planes availible. The rest of them are just accessable by purchasing DLCs.I do wanted to cry about it, but when you think about it... The game is free. It gives you much more than just fun or experience. Details, information, different editors, models, realistic sounds, manuals, HUGE map aswell.It all takes a lot of time to create, people to find who are willing to work on the game, and last, funding.This is an excellent simulator and I do hope they'll add more different planes you can fly, cargo ones aswell.In 2 days, by just focusing on the SU-25T, I learned how to check everything before taking off, taking off, flying and doing some cool maneuvers, using the thermal screen and guiding rockets to the designated target... and landing it as well. Once you know the basics, the rest will be easy. Using dragging chutes when landing is pretty hardcore and awesome. :)It would be nice if they could add a free helicopter and a fighter jet, giving us more roles that you can work on and improve your skills.SU-25 is not a fighter jet. END. <-- (Just for people who wanted to argue that the plane is a fighter jet.)Consider buying a DLC when on a discount. It will be worth it. You'll be happy aswell as a company that works on the game. :)That's pretty much it. Thanks for reading.			"

												DCS World is fantastic. It greatly benefits from advanced computing hardware, but you can play it if you have the minimum specs. Think of it as future-proof. It is as real as it gets, without actually getting into a multi-million dollar fighter.Got VR? Holy smokes, you need to try this! Picture this: your friend buzzes you in his ME-109 (you're in a P-51 Mustang). You turn your head to watch him as you roll the aircraft--maximum control deflection, full throttle, WAR EMERGENCY POWER, 1,750 HORSEPOWER BABY!!!111!one!! You've got him in your view, and you're turning your nose towards him. Finger on the trigger, ready to blast him out of the sky with your six (yes, SIX) .50 caliber machine guns. What's this? A split S? You weren't expecting that! Where'd he go? You look around frantically, trying to find him, but it's no use. Next thing you know, your plane is spiralling out of control. What happened? You look out the right side of the aircraft. Everything seems fine. Left side? Oh no. There's a flaming stump where the wing used to be. You desperately try the controls. Nothing works. Time to bail out? Crap. Your altimeter reads 2,000 feet and it's spinning like you've never seen it spin before. Vertical speed indicator? Maxed out. No time to bail. Here comes the ground--you actually feel like you're going to die. Yeah, kinda like the Matrix. Then you remember it's just VR and a rush comes over you just as you smash into the ground--engine pulling at full power the whole way in. BOOM!You'll get him next time.Don't have VR? Um. So you know... your friend buzzes you in his ME-109, you hit the hat switch to slew your view. Slowly, your head turns around as you stare intensely at your monitor, looking for him. Gee. The seat sure looks detailed. Next thing you know, bullets riddle the cockpit and you're finished. There goes your plane, flying off into oblivion with your limp body inside. Uh, get TrackIR (excellent for non-VR) or Facetracknoir (a little finecky, but free). Or, look, just hold off on buying that 70"" OLED TV and go get yourself a Vive or a Rift and a GTX-1080 (a 1060 or 1070 will work, but you're missing out on some of the magic).Oh, but for the love of science and all that is logical, give this game a try. And you will LOVE the war-birds. Try to find aircraft with fully-functional cockpits. Leatherneck has a really neat Mig-21Bis. It smokes a lot, accelerates like a bat out of hell, and the compressor stalls at the most hilarious times. It is very Soviet Russian.			"

												This is simply the greatest flight simulator that I have ever had the privelage to use. Through out three seperate installs I have logged over 200 hours and regret not one second. DCS offers unmatched realism, but not only is it realistic at being a simulator, it is fantastic at simulating what it is like to be a military pilot, this is what in my opionion sets DCS apart from all other simulators. I have noticed that many complain about the price of the module, trust me they are worth every penny, you will most likely spend somewhere north of three hours reading through the manuals, five hours practicing the procedures, at least twenty hours learning and perfecting techniques in that aircraft, and then countless hours enjoying yourself in the cockpit of a legendary fighter aircraft. You never will get screwed over by a low quality overpriced addon as you would in FSX or Xplane, as Eagle Dynamics is very picky about the content made for their game, they ensure you get a realistic flight model, a cockpit full of a bunch of buttons that each their own purpose, and a way to throw ayay a ridiculous amount of time. The SU-25 and TF-51 are not made to be permanent, they are meant to introduce you to the dynamics of the sim, I would reccomend buying the A-10 and spend some time in it and then decide that you love this game as the SU-25 and TF-51 are not an accurate reflection of what this game really is.

												This is the ultimate game for those wanting aircraft combat with simulator like realism. But despite it being free-to-play this is a rich man's game. The Aircraft are highly polished and are worth their expensive price tag. You can still enjoy it casually as is, but you're also going to need some serious hardware to enjoy this game as intended. Like a really good computer, A VR headset or just track-IR, and that's granted you already have a decent Joystick or Hotas already. I plan to play this game alot more when I have a VR compatible computer.  But once I do have VR I'll be a very happy man playing this game. P.S  Those who complain about the controls being hard, flying planes is hard... Go back to War Thunder if you want to just point and shoot at things.			"

												DCS is on a whole different league than MSFSX, Prepar3d or any other flight simulator.  The level of detail within the aircraft modules is astonishing.  I would highly reccomend picking up this and get familiar with the controls and purchase the F-15C or the Flaming Cliffs 3 aircraft to get more aquanted with the feel.  The base ""game"" is free, however the depth to this game comes with the modules you purchase.I've already bought the L-39 and F-5E Tiger II within the last 6 months and am still getting to know what each control switch does in the cockpit.  As far as beginner aircraft goes, pick up the L-39.  If you're ready for a challenge, pick up the F-5.  They're both very fun training aircraft.The sim itself has its flaws here and there, but Eagle Dynamics are making strides to better the franchise and their customers!Have fun flying!			"

												That feeling when I got my first muliplayer kill in the MiG-21, and with guns, is something I can't explain with words. And it was only an A-10C.The satisfaction when, after tons of hours of practice, of mastering an airplane, its systems, weapons, etc, you get to use it properly and succeed, that kind of satisfaction I haven't experienced it in any other game, even when playing team vs team tournaments in tactical FPS games.I can only say: if you are into flight simulation, into fighters, attack aircraft or helicopters, go for it. The simulation of most of the modules is superb. Yes, I know it can get expensive, but actually I wouldn't recommend getting a lot of modules when starting. Get a module you think you will like and start invesing hours in it, and learning the aircraft and to be able to fly it as if you've been doing it for years. Then go to multiplayer and show what you are worth. First it will be all frustration, but after some time and experience, when you start acomplishing your objectives it will be extremely rewarding. One last thing to say, and being an X-Plane 10 player I noticed really quickly, the clouds on this game are extremely optimized and look fantastic.			"

												-Ignore my abysmal play time, I play the non-steam version-DCS World... wow. TLDR: Great sim for those with months to kill.Although I am not the most experienced pilot in the game, I still enjoy it... That is a bit of an understatement, I love this game.Review without any modules purchased:DCS World provides two aircraft for free; the SU-25T ground pounding beast, and the TF-51 Mustang. Ignore the Mustang, it's just there to introduce clickable cockpits, but it has no available weapons. The SU-25 is where it's at. For a primarily CAS and SEAD aircraft, the Frogfoot is surprisingly fast and manueverable. Load that bad boy up with only AA missiles and you got a veritable fighter on your hands, not that recommended however. The ground striking is where the SU-25 shines. Dumb bombs, guided bombs, rocket pods, guided missiles, you get a little bit of everything with the Frogfoot. Couple that with the incredibly easy flight characteristic of the aircraft, it is the perfect starter. As a completely free download, DCS is so incredibly worth it for those with just a little time to learn the keyboard commands.Review with some modules: Personally, I own the KA-50 Blackshark, A-10C, SU-27, and P-51D Mustang. As a second aircraft to buy, I would highly recommend the SU-27 if you prefer a more CAP style of play. If you prefer a CAS playstyle, get the A-10A/C. A if you want an easier plane to fly, C if you want realism. The A-10C is amazing. That does not need to be said. When you start it up for the first time without any help, it is an amazing feeling. I'm going to try to stop gushing about the amazing modules and actually try to review the game with modules as a whole. It is so worth it. Sure, the modules are really freaking pricey, but they offer so much more depth to the game. You thought the game with deep enough with the TF-51? Try the A-10C. Often described as the most confusing aircraft to start in the game,  although I don't see it. Flamming Cliffs 3 provides a litany of easy aircraft to fly. F-15, SU-27, Mig-29, etc... They all don't have clickable cockpits, but they are the best to just fly around and have a little more arcade-y fun. Want a proper realistic fighter experience? Get the Mig-21, Mirage 2000, or F-5E. Those are proper realism at it's finest. Although I don't own any of them, simply watching some basic flights on YouTube makes me really want them. The Mig-21 in particular. It's radar is literally cooled with the finest of Russian alcohol. It does not get more awesome than that.Perhaps will be editted as experience is garnered.			"

												** DISCLAIMER - This is a simulator, not your moms War Thunder **** You wont be able to download this game with your SICK internet, log in, and fire missiles in 20 minutes - sorry kids **I like reading the down votes for this ""game"". people quoting that they cannot seem to ""play"" with a mouse and keyboard. If you're looking for a mouse and keyboard game, and a game to play with your 14 dollar joystick - War Thunder is a click away and will probably wet your panties like no other. Second entertaining reads are about game stability or performance. Problem #1: Get the game from the developers and not off Steam. Been Using Eagle sims for 5+ years, and like ANY other flight sim game - they will crash, and periodically set your machine on fire. Simulators are not games you load up to test your UB3R:L33T gaming rig on - play Crisis. Sims have more processes going on than your mother on menopause - so PHAT FRAMEZ will not be achieved here. See War Thunder.This sim is split down the middle with accurately modelled aircraft and ""10 button"" fighter jets. The DLC's that are expensive are aircraft that are detailed down to the♥♥♥♥♥sweat left on your seat. They act, fly, and control like the real thing - and that's what you're paying for. Regular sims dedicated to a single aricraft were also set to sell at 30-50 dollars back in the flight sim golden era. This game comes for free with a dedicated aircraft: SU-25, complete with tutorials and a myriad of controls and commands. This aircraft alone will keep you busy, and gives you the ability to fly with others. Simulators like this are fantastic and require you to put the time in - and you will be rewarded for it if flying these types of simulators is your thing. 10/10 - Strongly recommend this to anyone interested in putting some time and dedication into a combat simulator.

												Just a few hours in, but the level of detail in this simulator is amazing. Before you even take to the skies, you get to spend some quality time just learning how to start a plane. The modules go on sale for $10-$15 ocasionally, so id say take a look at it then if you like planes and all.			"

												To do this game justice I almost bankrupted my family. First there was my Warthog HOTAS, then the track IR, then I realized that I badly needed pedals, and then disaster hit, VR came out! Its an amazing simulation even without VR and after about 200 hours (on this and DCS 2) I still pretty much suck! Its just an amazing experience. Not only are you flying but using modern day computer systems to seek, lock onto, and destroy your enemy fromyway up above. Its terrifying to imagine being up against these beasts! At the moment they knew you were a dead man You wouldnt even know they were there, watching from above, as the missile they had just launched cut through the sky towards you.Dont pay attention to the 'mixed' reviews this game gets trolled alot because its free. This means casual gamers load it up without knowing what it is, and end up getting butt hurt. But you probably already know that! This game may be free but as I already mentioned to really do it justice its probably the most expensive game you will ever buy! You dont have to buy everything I bought for it all at once but to get the most out of it at the very least you need a HOTAS and track IR.  Its not a game you could possibly enjoy without actually learning how to fly (take off, and land) and understand the computer systems at your fingertips. With a good HOTAS combined with peddals the feeling of flight is incredible. Add in VR and its a damned near perfect experience! I feel immensely pleased that I decided to to take the plunge and teach myself some of this simulators modules. The one I enjoy the most has to be the black shark helicopter.  The reward is that once you have mastered the sim itself you can start enjoying the game, and attempt some of the military missions the 'game' sets for you. In short you can start blowing stuff up! I think almost everyone would love this simulator, but not everybody is willing to sit down and learn. Things are easier these days though and there are loads of videos you can watch on you-tube. When you get into it you will also find, that learning to fly a plane, or helicopter is (of course) alot of fun and the more skilled you become the less like work it will seem. Its not like playing a game its like flying a military helicopter with military modern weapon systems at your fingertips!			"

												(Edited 25/07/2016)The best A/A A/G simulator.PROS:-Very good flight model-Very good aircraft systems and weapons-OK mission editor but needs to be more user friendly with more options like random spawn in zone or random respawn, it can be done with external scripts like MIST-Nice graphics-Multiplayer works OK and its really funCONS:-ED takes years (literally) to make 1 aircraft-Very few maps, 1 free and 1 which you need to pay NTTR. An F-18C and the Strait of Hormuz map are in development-The Georgian map has very low polygons and the mountains look awefull flying low, the textures aren't that bad (EDITED: This map is currently being improved with textures, grass, water, lightning and shadows. ED also hopes to imrpove the mesh of the terrain!!)-Combined Arms should have the possibility to use a S-300 or Patriot SAM sites-Few modern aircraft-Weird engine performance, sometimes stuters when you look in a direction where there're multiple units no matter the distance.-No dynamic campaign!!!!

												At first it was like ""Oh this isn't THAT hard""Then it was like ""BEEP BEEP BEEP! MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING BEEP BEEPBEEP! PULL UP! PULL UP! OVER G OVER G! BEEP BEEP BEEP!"" *Kaboom*And then i was like ""Okay, back to the tutorial"" No but seriously its a great game. It's running on max for me with 70+ FPS. I am using Track IR 5 and a Saitek X55 Rhino Hotas. The game is relatively easy to set up and the tutorials are pretty nice (except when you ♥♥♥♥ something up, then you have to restart the whole tutorial mission manually because the shift+ r command breaks the tutorial)Don't even bother to watch the video tutorials of the SU-25T because everything is covered in missions. At the end its pretty much all about common sense and learning keybindings. I expected it to be more complicated and harder but it really isn't. Keep in mind that you can only play the SU-25T Frogfoot and the P51D Mustang in the Free Version. The DLC's are pretty expensive but the level of detail and the amount of work invested in this are amazing + there are alot of sales from time to time. If you are looking for a good sim then go ahead and try it. Play the tutorial and don't stop after the first 10 minutes because you clicked on the video tutorial and you were expecting the playable tutorial that is right below it. ;)			"

												I wouldn't recommend this game if you don't want to spend 6 to 8 hours just to learn how to fly the plane with stick and keyboard commands, much longer if you want to use the interactive cockpits. But if you do like your combat flight simulators as close to reality as the average consumer can get, this product is unparalleled. Oh, and don't forget to bring all of your money, the base modules are excellent, but you will want likely more and most planes are $40 to $50 each.			"

												I'm a big noob for this type of hyper realistic flight simulation, and I play with pad+Keyboard+Mouse.I Immediatly bought the MiG-21b, because it was praised as one of the best mod and also because the MiG-21bis is a F***ING MYTHIC BADASS MEAN LOOKING MOTHERF***ER

			DCS: MiG-21bis for DCS World. Coming Soon! www.leatherneck-sim.com		

Well in the end, the game and especially the Mig mod are just amazing.I took the time to understand the game and customize the controls (you'll have to read a little, guys ^^ ), almost everything on realistic settings and clickable cockpit (you can choose an ""arcade"" configuration with onscreen radar for exemple if you prefer), and I have flight feelings that I've never felt before,For the moment after 28 hours of incredible pleasure, I'm still not able to take-off alone (edit : Now I can o/ ) or to use the armement and avionics properly, I still didn't took part in a real mission except for basic tutorials, and I don't intend to play online.I just FLY (also crash a lot and once got my♥♥♥♥♥exploded in 2 mn by a bot I forgot in the settings), and JUST THAT feels AWESOME, In the end there is no known reality or parallel world where I could, as a healthy grown adult with fully fonctionnal brain who works and has a social life, fly a real MiG-21b loaded with an atomic bomb to the stratosphere while smoking Magic Green Tobacco and listening to the Deftones, so there's also that.

												One of the best Aerial Combat Sim's on the market and one of the best looking ones at that! For those who want ""dumbed down"" aircraft, fly the Flaming Cliff's 3 aircraft. Overall great fun, good community. Granted it can get a little boring at times, but thats when you go and learn more about your aircraft and utilize them in MP. Yes there are more game breaking bugs now because the dev's are trying to integrate the current build to DCS 2.5 so its going to take some time. Also don't expect the dev's to push new modules at a rapid pace, this sim is very complex so alot of work and detail goes into it.			"

												First and foremost, I have to point out that I have much greater time invested in this game than what is indicated (55 hours). I've been playing some form of DCS since 2009 when I purchased LOMAC and Flaming Cliffs 2. I started out with LOMAC and progressed to FC2. Now I own several modules, including FC3. I didn't download DCS World on Steam until January of 2014. Prior to that I had DCS in its individual state. Now I have several modules: FC3, A-10C, P-51D, KA-50 and the free modules (SU-25T and TF-51). There are several different options in terms of modules and their respective level of simulation. There is survey level and study level. Survey level includes the SU-25T and the Flaming Cliffs modules. The cockpits aren't clickable and they have basic systems and start-up procedures. You can start an F-15C in 20 seconds by pressing RShift + L and R Alt +Home for the left engine and R ctrl + Home for the Right Engine. There you go, the plane is started. A study level module is much more complex and involves procedures almost identical to what you'd find at an air force base in terms of pre-launch/launch.  The cockpits are clickable and the weapons/systems usage are 98% spot on. The manual can be anywhere from 100-200 pages for the Flaming Cliffs and SU-25T modules and can be more than 600 pages for the ""study"" level modules like the A-10C. The learning curve for this game is somewhat steep, especially if you do not have any experience with any form of aircraft or prior simulations. If you're coming from games like War Thunder Simulation mode or Il-2, that will give you a good background so at least you're familiar with using an ADI or HSI, though IL-2 is more realistic. If you approach this simulator with a notepad (digital or pen and paper) you can be successful. Just because you're good at the training module does not mean that you'll remember everything you learn. I strongly recommend a decent joystick (I have a HOTAS X that was $40 and it works perfect for me), a smart phone at your side to take notes, and I also recommend storing the flight manual on your phone for quick reference. The game comes with the TF-51 and SU-25T for free so you don’t have to pay and can “try before you buy.”  The former is the trainer version of the P-51D. The cockpit is virtually identical but it does not come with a HUD.  You also cannot mount weapons on it. This is okay because it is free and it is what is considered a ""study"" level simulation so you can get an idea on how the start-up procedures work on the study level modules. The SU-25T is survey level but it is harder to fly than any other fixed wing I’ve flown so far (I’ve flown all of the FC3 modules, the P-51D and the A-10C). It is a less maneuverable version of the SU-25a that comes with the FC3 package. I put together a video with a few clips of training sessions and kills I’ve accomplished with the 25t:

 The graphics are very good for what you’re getting. You’re talking about rendering an obnoxious view distance as well as multiple ground, sea and air units. I sent a screen cap of 2 F-15Cs flying at Dawn at 20,000’ altitude to a few friends and they commented that the pilots were so lucky. I had to explain that it was a simulator and they were surprised. There are many videos on YouTube of DCS and you can see that the game sometimes looks true to life. There are other portions that look “muddy,” such as air to ground missions. However, every aircraft and almost every mechanized ground unit is modeled almost 100% of what the real life version looks like; down to the panels and bolts. Even units that aren’t flyable/drivable by the user are still modeled very accurately. Since the release of DCS 1.5 your graphics capabilities are increased greatly. They still use many of the same elements as the original DCS in terms of texture but in DX11 now instead of DX9. When 2.0 and the Vegas training map release, it is said that the graphics are going to blow people away even more. I personally run it in 1920X1080 as my rig cannot max out the view distance and offer triple screen capability simultaneously. My specs are listed on my profile.  The sounds are spot on. They’re accurate in terms of “biotching betty” (the voice heard in warning systems), sounds of missiles launching, the sounds of the plane approaching and departing, comms, etc. Everything is extremely immersive. The sounds of AWACS and your flight radio also add to immersion. In terms of controls, the controls are as accurate as you make them. There are people with customized “pits” that take advantage of MFDs, pedals, and $500 joysticks. I’ve spent $40 on my joystick but I must use a modifier. Modifiers are buttons that allow other buttons several secondary uses. Example: the trigger button fires my gun. If I press modifier1 with the trigger it switches in between the gun as my primary aiming system on my HUD to whichever missile I was using (aim-7, aim-9, aim-120). One huge advantage is Track IR5. Track IR provides a head tracking apparatus that intensifies how you look around in the cockpit. If you turn your head 5 degrees in real life, it can turn it 40 degrees in the game. This is adjustable to your liking. I strongly recommend this if you expect to be competitive. Using the HAT in game is not as effective as using your head to look around. Eventually the Oculus Rift will be released. Users using the Dev Kit for Oculus report unparalleled immersion in DCS and other simulators. If you have the graphics capability and the money, running the game in triple screen offers a significant advantage. If you want a challenge, yearn for professional military pilot-like camaraderie, look forward to making your first “splash” in game this is the game for you. There’s nothing like meeting certain benchmarks in a game with the learning curve of DCS. Taking off from your base, navigating the waypoints to a certain objective, flying through terrain infested with SAMs and enemy AWACS to take out an objective and RTB successfully is extremely gratifying and never gets old.  If this is what you want, this is your game. If you lack patience, if you do not understand how an altimeter or compass works and are not interested in grasping the idea, if you are the type of person who needs instant gratification, if you are unwilling to take notes for a video game, and you are the type of person to yell at somebody on your team in games like CoD or BF4, this is definitely not the type of game for you. As stated before, the reviews on this are polarized; there typically is not a happy medium. You like it or you don’t. Try the free demo before purchasing additional modules! Good luck! "

												Disclaimer:I haven't played DCS that much yet. I'm just getting into it. So the reason I write this review so early ist because there are a lot of misleading reviews out there.So, I read some reviews for DCS a while ago, and I noticed that there seems to be some confusion about what DCS is.Many bad reviews seem to be based around what genre this game is, or the difficulty, or the DLC policy.So let's adress that:1. This game is no arcade flight game like War Thunder! This is the be all end all when it comes to realism in military flight simulations. The gold standard for the best flight models and most emersive gameplay. That means it's a huge treat for realism fans, but also means that casual fans of arcady flight sims might be turned off. So before you buy think about what you want from this game. If it isn't the ultra realism you will get, then don't buy it!2. The difficulty stems from the realism. The fact that some planes have every single button and lever modelled and functional in a cockpit means that you will need a lot of knowledge and routine before you can fly those planes well.You will need to do tutorial missions multiple times, probably fly a dozen training or free flight missions and read 500+ page Flight Manuals before you can consider yourself an effective pilot. Those who don't have the passion or time to do this might still enjoy casual flying around and attacking a few stationary targets, but you will be at a big disadvantage to those who put in the time.3. The DLC policy. Here is the biggest misconception. DCS World is NOT a free game with all planes unlocked. DCS World is the framework, that ties together all other modules of DCS and conveniently gives you two free planes to fly on top.The reason for the high prices of the DLCs is simple. Every aircraft DLC is a standalone plane, with training missions and campaigns. Some are cheap because they don't have fully modelled cockpits, and others cost 50€ because the planes are fully modelled, and could probably be used for military training simulations. That's how good they are! For that kind of quality, a lot of work, time and research is needed. That's why I don't consider the DLCs to be overprized. If you don't have the money, wait for a sale, there are many sales on DCS.On a last note. Get at least a decen HOTAS system. Headtracking isn't mandatory but nice, but without a HOTAS your screwed!

												This game is a true combat flight simulator. It's as realistic and true to life as Flight Simulator X and as fun as Flanker 2.5 and Jane's F/A-18 sim. The F-15C Eagle module is so true to life I sometimes think, ""Wow, is this really a computer simulation?""  The mission editor is very flexible and dynamic, not to mention easy to understand and use. The pluses of the game are as follow:1: Very realistic, true to life environment2: Aircraft simulations are very accurate with extreme detail and clickable switches3: The default SU-25T and TF-51 are not what you'd expect from default planes4: Missions can range from simple intercepts to heart-pumping dogfights5: F-15C is the most accurate modeling of that plane yet6: It's free!However, there are always some downsides to these games.1: You need a lot of space to have this game2: If you don't have at least a moderately poweful rig you're stuck3: Occasional crashesIn my opinion, this game is a true gem in the flight simulation genre. I give it an 9.5. Totally worth your time.			"

												Hands down the best combat flight simulator on the market. This simulator combines stunning visuals with high fidelity aircraft simulations. Flight models are awesome, avionics, atmoshphere, etc... everything about this game breathes immersion.  Dont purchase this game if you don't own a HOTAS, this is not some arcade b******t, this is a simulator. Also, if you aren't willing to learn how to properly operate each aircraft, then don't waste your time. The modules for this simulator (DLC essentially) are developed over a long span of time - years -  and are released with a hefty price tag (for good reason too), these modules are modeled to every nook and cranny, and come with flight manuals that can be hundreds of pages long.  So long story short, don't play this game for 3 hours and rate it down, you will need to learn alot and practice alot to get the full package of what this amazing platform offers.			"

												This is probably the most realistic flight simulator out there (with the non FC3 aircraft). In this simulator it is no game, you have to learn how to fly, operate avionics, radios and weapons. Even though the learning curve for the advanced aircraft might seem big there are interactive tutorials that will teach you, which is better than reading some of the multi-hundred page manuals (which should be read when wanting to know how to operate something in the plane if the tutorial missed something). The world in this game is huge, mountains, ocean, towns/ cities. You can achieve long range flights with the map size. Also there is aireal refueling (only with the A-10C and most FC3 aircraft) which caters even more to long range flights. As some of you probably knew before you read this, that DCS is a combat simulator. So on top of having planes with realistic flight characteristics and avionics, you also have the ability to use that planes' weapons. The weapons are just as realistic as the planes, and yes, bombing with planes like F-86F is just as hard as it always was for the real pilots.The only thing that is missing from DCS is more modern fighters that are not like FC3 aircraft, so far the A-10C is the only modern plane (but it is only a A/G aircraft) and from what I heard the F/A-18C is coming to DCS so hopefully it will expand the variety of planes and helicopters in the future			"

Without a doubt the most detailed simulator  I've ever played, flight or otherwise. I'd highly recommend investing in a good joystick and a Track IR for maximum immersion. NOTE: I have hundreds of hours in the standalone version and recently switched to steam for convenience only to find that it isn't optimized that well for the steam clinet. I'm not sure what exactly it is but compared to the standalone version I suffer from slow loading of textures, serious hanging when I first join a MP server, and overall less performance than I would in the standalone. I'd recommend downloading the game from Eagle Dynamics website as it much more stable and optimized (from my personal experience). Either way, standalone or steam - if you're a flight sim enthusiast or a jet guy like me, you're going to love this ****. The Free DCS World game is great, but the modules that are for sale here and on the ED website are absolutely phenomenal. When you purchase a high fidelity module you're putting yourself in the cockpit of the actual aircraft in a sense. Almost every single button you see in the cockpit is clickable, has a function, and needs to be utilized for proper flight and combat engagements. This is what sets DCS apart from all of flying sims and games out there. Each aircraft comes with a 150-250+ page flight manual that needs to be studied in order to master your machine, and it's a lot of fun to learn. It's very immersive being in the cockpit, selecting your weapons loadout, fueling up, doing your start up routine, and making sure all systems are functional before you begin your taxiing to the runway for take off. The game has a great communications system for ATC and AWACS that offer invaluable information before, during, and after your flight that adds to this immersion. Coupled with a very friendly and professional multiplayer scene this makes for a great experience for both novice and enthusiast sim pilots. I can't give this game enough credit for what it brings to the world of flying and combat flight, it's something I will be playing for years. 10/10			"

												Let me start off by first saying this is not for the light hearted. If you come from a simulation background you will have no problems learning this sim. But if like me you started off without a clue or played the rare session of FSX you will have a lot of learning to do, even more if you do not know about military terms and equipment. This simulator is as real as it gets for most modules excluding the Flaming Cliffs add-ons. You definitely need a decent HOTAS system to be able to play, I recommend the Thrustmaster Hotas X which costs about £30 new and you can upgrade to a better system later on if you become addicted like I and many others have. THIS IS NOT A DLC SYSTEM.DCS world uses a modular system, you get the SU25T and the unarmed variant of the P-51D for free. The SU25T is an FC3 style module. This means that the plane and weapons systems handle as they would in real life but the cockpit is not clickable, you have to use a keyboard for most functions. Modules apart from FC3 modules are fully detailed with clickable cockpits. Alot of people complain about the prices of the modules but they are reasonably priced, if you think about the hundreds of hours of work and research required to make these modules then it is totally worth it. Modules range from the nimble and quick Gazelle helicopter to the flying pig that is the A10C to the old WW2 planes like the P-51D, this sim will cater to a broad range of audiences. I have bought the FC3 module because of its large amount of planes but I plan to buy the KA50 soon (reviews for those are separate). The SU25T is enough to get you into the fight.GREAT COMMUNITY, GET TEAMSPEAKDCS World sports a large and great community, several youtubers play DCS World and it’s not hard to bump into them online. If you don’t know what you are doing HOGGIT is a great place where there are people ready to teach you the ways of DCS. The unofficial Facebook group is also a great place to meet people and learn new things. Almost everyone is welcoming. The number of multiplayer servers is great with anywhere between 10 to 50 people online at once which can quickly turn into a mess if you do not communicate properly. One thing I must stress is the importance of teamwork and communication, TeamSpeak is a necessity if you are going online. It can help you survive a lot longer and reduces stress on other team members. Teamwork is key, sending CAS in without CAP is a recipe for disaster in PvP. The multiplayer caters for many styles, whether you want a quick session in PvE or a long campaign in PvP, you will love the many community made missions. These missions require a lot of structure, GCIs and flight leads are a vital aspect to success, so listen and communicate with them. The amount of times when the team is going for one objective and most of them are on TeamSpeak when a few loners outside of TeamSpeak refuse to help, losing the objective has been very low, even then I think they were new to the sim.GRAPHICS AND SOUND IS GREATThe graphics whilst a little outdated are great, tonnes of vehicles are modelled with great detail and the modules look fantastic. The ground can look dull at times but with DCS 2.5 coming out this is set to improve. The sound effects are very nice, listening to the RWR can drive you crazy at times but it is all very immersive. Watching your missile detach from your wing and hunt your target can be very entertaining and immersive. Watching your wingman breaking off to attack a target, then popping tonnes of flares as he turns with AAA unloading hell on him and the sky is breathtakingly spectacular, I have never seen anything like it in any game engine.CONCLUSIONThis sim is breath taking and very rewarding but frustrating at times. You might witness a few game crashes but all will be forgiven when you actually learn and enjoy it. The learning curve is steep and you will be destroyed if you jump straight in without reading or doing training missions, but the feeling of overwhelming joy when you destroy your first enemy in PvP is great. You don’t need to sink a lot of money into this sim, as I said a cheap HOTAS system will suffice and if you really want head tracking there are tonnes of cheaper alternatives to tracker IR which will give you generally the same experience.Have fun and I hope to see you in the skies.(THIS REVIEW WILL BE UPDATED AS TIME GOES ON)			"

												If you are looking for a realistic flight simulation, this is it.  The air dynamics, interactivity of some of the planes, and fact i can blow them all out of the sky with my 30mm is just awesome.  Although it is free, you only get 2 planes with it for free, the SU25t and another prop-plane.  There are settings to make it much easier to immidiatly get off the ground, or you can put it to simulation mode and have to learn the startup procedures which will take you some time.  Certain planes you buy via ""DLC"" but everyone is able to play together regardless of what planes they own.  Multiplayer as well!			"

												One of the best, if not the best millitary aircraft simulators avaliable. Texture quality is superb and the simulation is on par with other major sims.There is no point writing a full review to this game, since it is free anyone who is looking for their perfect sim can just play it and judge for themselves.Only con is that you may like it too much and end up getting; VR headset, HOTAS, Rudder pedals and all of the addons this game has, but by that stage you won't regret it.Edit: I have started using the standalone version since getting this game, and indeed you should too if you are interested, it makes getting addons easier.

												I've been looking for a title like this for quite a long time. I had heard about DCS, but never took it seriously until I saw some YouTube videos. I didn't realize there was a DCS World for free. It's well worth picking up the addons for various aircraft once you learn the SU25T (free). Joystick is 100% required though and I highly recommend that you have a rudder, throttle quadrant and motion tracking (TrackIR5) hardware. A bit of an expensive bit of hardware, but absolutely worth it if you enjoy these games. And TrackIR is very useful for other games like Arma2/3, etc.			"

												Incredible deep if you get the single addons (IE not the flaming cliffs 3 ones or says they are part of FC3), every damned button works. While FC3 gets most things realistic.The only issue is missile mechanics, it seems to be tuned for WVR and not BVR. Which means Russian jets with the HMDs have a better advantage since most of them have better WVR capabilities (read agility and the HMD), than BVR. The AIM-120 and the R-27 are both close to useless farther out, and home of jam (HoJ) mode is kind of completely meh to the point I don't seem to every get kills in that mode.Otherwise, very solid sim.

												The BEST flying sim EVER. havent played alot of flying sims but this one is best so far.  fully functional cockpits, manual startups, real weapon systems, its just amazing.  it can be as gamey or as sim like as u want. also being able to fly with people online makes it even more fun.  The planes are a bit expensive but 50$ to me is worth learning how to manually start(some modules dont have fully functional cockpits), fly, and learn all the weapons an systems the aircraft uses.  they do all go on sale up top 75% off ive seen so keep a close tab on sales cuz they dont happen to often and dont last long.  it does take along time to get the hang of expecially if u dont play flying sims much.  u will have hours of fustration an crashing but its all in the learning process.  the more u fly a particular plane the better u will be at piloting it.  all planes fly differently and have different weapons and systems.  ive been playing for 900HRS so far an still dont know how to fly all the aircrafts... havent spent all my time learning all them either. i just stick to the ones i like mainly...  Once you do get the hang of things you can play online with other people. there is a lot of servers to choose from which most are made and hosted by DCS players.  it is much funner flying with other people doing coop missions or just practicing flying formations.  to play online u have to make an account at http://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/auth/?register=yes well, happy flights, and good luck.  download it NOW, play for HOURS.  P.S.  dont need it but highly recomend a joystick/hotas.  even a cheap one will make flying easier. for a nice cheap joystick that works great for beginners try the logitech extreme pro.  used it for along time.  resently got the saitek x-55 rino,  its amazing and worth it if you take flying seriously!

												Easily the most realistic flight sim on the market. One below a full motion simulator, in my opinion.This ultra high-fidelity simulator is great if you're experienced with flight simulators and basic physics and aerodynamics. (I recommend you understand how stalls work, G-limits on humands and the stress points of planes.)With all but the most minute buttons modelled you can really mess up your flight if you want too, there is no hand-holding here. Can't stand the relative silence of the cockpit? Well that canopy can come off with just a click of a button or a flick of a switch.----While the base DCS World is fun it just doesn't compete with the DLC; the UH-1H Huey and MiG 21Bis are there for those of you who want a real challenge (The Huey is just a hard fly and the Fishbed is a rocket with wings attached and not a whole lot of fuel.)If you just want a change of plane Flaming Cliffs 3 brings you the F-15 Eagle, A-10A, Su-27, Su-33, MiG-29A and MiG-29S; They don't come with clickable cockpits so they are a good fit for people who are transitioning from the Su-25.If you're looking for a good transitioning point into the planes with clickable cockpits I recommend the A-10C featuring a fully clickable cockpit and relatively easy start-up.----Overall I (As an avid player of Flight Simulator X and X-Plane 10 and an overall flight simulator enthusiast)  recommend this game ONLY if you have a joystick and are prepared to buy DLC and other peripherals in the future. Don't expect DLC to be free, the complexity and time invested to make these modules is massive and you can easily put 100 hours into each module.To play this flight simulator you are all but forced to have a joystick; it's a flight simulator, it's not a game.I recommend your next purchase to be a TrackIR 5 or, if it has been fully released when you're reading this, maybe an Oculus Rift.Finally, if you plan on flying the helicopters get a force-feedback joystick and RUDDER pedals, racing pedals with almost certainly not work and if they do they won't work nearly as well as genuine ones.----Recommended brands:J: Saitek X52 JoystickJ: Thrustmaster Hotas Warthog (VERY expensive but VERY good.)P: CH Pro Rudder PedalsP: Saitek Pro Flight Combat PedalsH: Oculus RiftH: TrackIR5(J:Joystick, P:Pedals, H:Head Tracking)			"

Spent 27 hours this last week playing it as a SU 27 pilot. So what am i saying?This is a great game, you need to give it a few hours to learn the aircraft and set the controls but when you know everything this is so much fun. I can't get enough of this game and i've only played the SU 27 so far.Thank you  DCS!			"

												I've spent countless hours on this game, partially becuase steam doesnt count the hours for the actual launcher exe... XD But in all seriousness, this game is amazing. Maybe the graphics arent as good as COD or ArmA 3 (some mods can make it look amazing), but this game is simply awesome once you really get into it.With new content and fully interactable aircraft coming out every year, it never gets boring. If you're even remotely interested in aircraft, fixed wing or rotary, this is the game for you. The rewarding experience once you put time into this game and learn the aircraft is very great and well worth the time. As for the money side of things, the first free aircraft (SU-25T) you get is nice, however I would strongly recommend purchasing a DLC such as the A-10C, even if it does seem overpriced. However if you want to get your money out of it, you need to be dedicated and patient as you learn certain aircraft.Warning: Steep learning curve for some aircraft - be prepared to spend a bit of time learning them.P.S. The reward will be worth it. Trust me :)			"

												This game is one of if not the best Flight simulaton games. The game has full fidelity cockpits with flight manuals over 100 pages to tell you which buttons to press. Although the game currently has its short comings in the graphics department it is a wonderful simulator. You don't know what true success is until you've mastered the planes you get and know what every button in the cockpit does. I have many hours in DCS world sadly not counted because I switched to standalone, but each hour can be the most frusterating or fun thing youll ever do. This game is NOT meant for fast paced gamers but those who actually look for a reward in what they are playing. DCS will leave you happy with it and you'll keep coming back.However I would recomend that new comers get the standalone on the Eagle Dynamics website for DCS as it has more modules for it.			"

												Probably the best modern flight sim on the market right now. The modelling of Air-to-Air missile performance is unfortunately quite simplistic (as are countermeasures), and high explosive bombs don't do much due to a lack of splash/fragmentation damage modelling, but the flight models and systems fidelity are superb. There's a reason DCS is a byword for high-fidelity simulation now.Don't come into this expecting your experience flying Warthunder or whatever to translate, though. You must have a joystick of some sort, preferably with a twist axis (unless you own a set of rudder pedals) and a throttle (unless you have a proper HOTAS throttle). Knowledge of basic aerodynamic concepts is important, as is the ability to dilligently monitor your aircraft's systems for potential problems, and the ability to learn the limits of each aircraft you buy.Luckily, you get two aircraft for free with the base game download. The Su-25T will teach you basic air to ground and missile avoidance techniques, while the TF-51 is basically the exact same aircraft as the paid P-51 module, minus the armament and a fuel tank in the fuselage that you'll leave empty most of the time anyway because it ♥♥♥♥s with aircraft performance. Get yourself a cheap stick and take some time to learn the free aircraft. If it tickles your fancy, buy whatever module interest you the most, and go from there.			"

												(Notice, I play on the standalone DCS client don't let steam hours fool you) This game is my life, I've been playing it on the dcs standalone client for a year now. I own almost every module, no sim in history has ever came close to the detail of DCS. All negative comments about prices for modules or it being not user friendly is mute. This is a hardcore sim, if you love aviation then you will love this game. And it's slowly becoming the only true combat sim left for props.(Even though the ww2 aspect of the game is still very work in progress) IL-2 battle of stalingrad has went the wrong direction. IL-2 1946 is good, but the online community is dead, and the game has shown it's age. War thunder isn't even a flight sim, that games sim battles are a joke.The only other good option is IL-2 cliffs of dover with team fusion mods, it mixes hardcore elements of engine management, but is more forgiving than DCS.The module price in DCS is entirely justified by the quality done, if you can't see that, then you just don't understand what you're looking at. I recommend downloading the standalone client from the DCS website, you can benefit from both the steam sales and the companies own sales, which when they have them are HUGE discounts like 70% off.If you are interested in this game, give the Su-25T a try, (It's free) it's one of my favorite aircraft still. And then bump up to FC3, if you manage to overcome the initial complexity of working the radar, then when you buy a full, entirely simulated module like the A-10C or MiG-21 then it will make life easier. Though I NEVER recommend a beginner to pick up the a-10c, because even the more simplified FC3 aircraft are too much for a lot of people.			"

												Thumbs up!!! Thumbs up!!! Thumbs up!!! With more than 200 hours on record, I can definitely say I have experienced the ins and outs of this game, absolutely wonderful!! Best flight simulation ever, most realistic physics proven by real world pilots, most authentic flight dynamics and systems utilization. This is not a pick up and fly game, many hours can go into something as simple as effective weapons employment of one aircraft. But upon learning and getting to know the machine or machines of your choice, you will be rewarded with some of the best experiences ever. Eagle dynamics is wonderful, that lack a little in the steam support department, but online forums will be your best friend. I recommend to anybody willing to put some time into a game and learn it, and anybody who isn't satisfied with substandard flight simulators like x plane 10 and fsx, which are still great, but after you get your hands on Dcs, you'll never go back.

												The closet you can get to sitting in the seat of military aircraft. This game is extremely immersive and all aircraft are beautiful modeled, in appearance, realism and flight physics wise.Think of this as a learning simulator. Aircraft you purchase come with a manual you have to look at to get the aircraft started. For those complaining about ""DLC"" cost too much or too much DLC. Do not think of these aircraft modules as DLC. Each plane is its own game pretty much that you will have to take the time to learn the insides and outs of to utuilize the aircraft properly.Most of the aircraft in the game (excluding free su25, and Flaming Cliffs aircraft) have click-pits. Click-pits being that basically ALL the buttons in the aircraft are clickable and have functionality. A WORD OF CAUTION: USE A FLIGHTSTICK. If you don't have a flightstick or hands on throttle and stick you're going to have a bad time.			"

												Very deep and in depth. This is A TRUE flight simulator, or more accurately: combat simulator. Flight dynamics  are spot on.  You go through a very complicated start up sequence to just start your plane, everything is manual! If you've seen real pilots start up a chopper or plane,  flipping switches all over, checking various pressure guages, engine rpms, etc... That is what you'll be doing here. And every plane has a different load out. The tutorial walks you through everything for the su25, and once you do the first few tutorials you'll get the hang of the game. One handy tip is to right click on the game in your library then choose the game manual! It'll show you all the tools for landing, taking off, emergency procedures, and combat.			"

												As a avid FSX player I was a bit skeptical going into thisBut after the first tutorial I fell in love with how detailed this game is.Recently I tryed a cold start with the P-51, I went through all the preflights/takeoff checklists thoroughly (I thought)Had a excellent rollout probably my best so far.. Although when I got to about 3000ft into my climb the engine cut out suddenly, couldn't for the life of me get it going again, even after emergency precedures (total flying noob). Ended up ditching in a field after afew minutes of gliding. Obvious pilot error there.The whole experience felt authentic. 10/10I am definitly going to purchase more planes to help the developers cause.			"

												DCS does what it does well, and for a free game it is great game for those looking to get into combat flight simulation.Getting more serious you will quickly find yourself craving more advanced cockpits and flight systems and that is where this game really ramps up with its DLC's.Enter: A10-C & UH-1H there are other great DLC but these are my two favorites featuring fully interactive cockpits and advanced flight controls.To put things into perspective, the operators manual for the A10-C is around 500+ pages of theory, procedures and checklists.If you just want the stuff you need-to-know there are cut down versions and plenty of videos online that cover everything from basic start-up to configuring the weapons systems, and using the flight management computer.I recommend grabbing the free game, get a feel for it and if you like what you try, grab the DLC's that interest you when they go on sale.There is a decent variety, just be sure to research the DLC's before you buy as some only have basic cockpits and systems while others are full simulations.

												Top-notch simulation platform.  I've been flying DCS since 2011, started with the KA-50, and it was exactly what I have always wanted in a flight sim: the full complexity of operating the flight, navigation, and weapons systems of a modern attack helicopter.  A-10C?  Same experience;  Highly detailed, fully-simulated flight, navigation, communication, sensor, and weapon systems.  This sim doesn't hold your hand and you get out of it exactly what you put into it.For someone looking for a less-intense entrance into combat flight simulation, try DCS Flaming Cliffs 3.  The flight physics are a little more forgiving, and the systems complexity is greatly towned down, all while still maintaining realistic performance capabilities and excellent approximations of real-world detection capabilities and engagement envelopes.I only have one word of warning to give:  Once you get a taste of DCS, you'll never be satisfied with the limited aircraft ""simulations"" implemented in Battlefield, ARMA, HAWX, and similar games again.

												Lets start with what you get out of this. Two planes (as of 2014: P51 trainer, Su25T Frogfoot) for free. The TF 51 (P51 trainer) is the more in depth of the two planes and is not for the feint of heart but should give you an idea of what the level of realism you should expect out of many of these DCS modules. Currently, DCS A10C, Blackshark 2, UH1 Huey, MI8MTV2, P51 and (Millitary) all have in depth flight dynamics and controlls with a fully interactive cockpit.Flaming Cliffs 3 is a module that comes with the F15C, MIG 29, Su27, Su33, Su25, and A10A. All of these aircraft have a slightly simplified flight model and do not have interactive cocpits. It should be noted though that this pack allows you to fly many different types of aircraft with the price of one module.Pros-Epic, Realistic, Online community is pretty awesome, quality online playersCons- Game engine can hold your system back (32 bit, runs on 2 cores, heavy on processor, only 1.5 gb ram), dated terraini detail, small community (though a quality one) Few aircraft choices, steam no longer supports serial numbers bought on DCS websight (steam serials are still supported by DCS standalone/nonsteam client though)Realistically speaking, this game doesnt offer a whole lot in terms of aircraft count like some of the competition out there. However, the aircraft are extremely well detailed and handle exceptionally realistically. In a dying age of flight sims, DCS is still going strong, with some of the most realistic aircraft modeling around, with a persistent community and invovled developers. "

												I really enjoy DCS World in VR but it took me a lot of effort.  This isn't specific to VR: flight sims generally take a lot of set up time.  I have a HOTAS with pedals and for each plane you have to map everything.  Fortunately once you have all of this completed after many rounds of testing the experience is pretty awesome.  In game the VR is amazing.  Head tracking is spot on and the cockpits are well done.  The VR user interface is fully capable but is not polished.  The traditional flatscreen interface is used in VR and you can't recenter in the game (that I have found).  If you want to experiment with flight sim then I highly recommend this.  The two planes you get for free deliver a lot of content (I have not purchased any DLC yet).			"

												Supreme, Amazing,Inspiring, Detailed,A place only limited by your Creativity, The modules Eagle Dynamics is developing are proving too be fantasitc. Espcially if they are as Detailed as Black Shark 2 or Magnificant 8, almost every switch is modeled. Would be fantastic with VR or some kind of Head Tracking Software, kind of like a IR pointer or something too help with use of Helmet mounted sights and maintaining situational awareness during dogfights! Don't try too get too deep without a Joystick, I did some research on the market and can recommend the one I'm using, hands down if you plan to invest into some Modules you should invest in a good JoyStick.Flaming Cliffs is the fastest I think that you can jump into cockpit, taxi too runway, Get airborne, and encounter bandits with very little knowledge of the Sim. You can practice intoductive stuff and learn the basic controls and familiarization with the planes. Once you learn Su25t you will be very familiar enough to jump into Flaming Cliffs, actually Flaming Cliffs maybe will be better tutorial too get you flying right away!Su25t will help familiarize you with Shikal in a faster eviroment for the KA50 Blackshark where most of the controls can be tailored and trimmed too your liking and there is enough overlap in all the Planes I have tried so far that you never are wasting time trying too reconfig Controlls too much after the initial learning as it's easy too adjust on the fly as you fine tune your prefferences. Than you can start Refining your Controlls too how you like it across all modules. Soon you will be a true ace of sim!Get flying! i Powodzenia Happy landings :)			"

												This is a well-designed and realistic game, and is a good choice for anyone who is interested in a realistic combat experience. The game has quite a steep learning curve, even for those who, like myself, are veterans of realistic combat and flight simulators, but once one learns how to handle the vehicles, and in particular the aircraft, it can be quite an enjoyable game to play.My one major criticism of the game is its severely overpriced downloadable content, which totals at nearly $700 USD - much more expensive than the cost of both the base game and all the downloadable content of most paid games - and I sincerely hope that the publishers reduce the cost or sell it cheaper as a bundle, as I for one will not be paying $50 USD for one in-game helicopter or plane, among other ridiculously overpriced items.In short, the game is very enjoyable if one enjoys realistic combat simulators, but I would not recommend anyone purchasing some of the downloadable content - which is ridiculously overpriced - unless Eagle Dynamics/The Fighter Collection reduce their cost.Konan T-A Lim.Sydney, Australia.9/3/2016			"

												DCS World is without doubt, my favorite flight simulator. It has been continuously expanding since I purchased it, and there are many highly detailed modules to purchase if you like this free base game. This is not a game you will learn to play quickly by any means. You will be doing a lot of research when you first start out. If you are expecting Ace Combat this will be a shock. Even comparing it to flying aircraft in a game like Arma 2 or 3, would not do justice to the detail and realism DCS has. With this base game you get the Su-25T. It is no fighter, but a slow, capable ground attack aircraft with some big fire power. If realism is something you are always trying to find when flying aircraft in games, than this is the one for you. And, the best part of this game is that the base installment  is free.			"

												Recommend but Buyer Beware!So let me start with that I've spend some money on this title. A-10C, Combined Arms, Flaming Cliffs, and the Campaign pack for A-10c (so far). I used to play Falcon 4.0 all the time back in the day, and I'm probably around a dozen hours into DCS. First thing to know is that this is more like a system of games that all work together in one interface, this is why the DLC seems expensive. Next thing to know is that apparently the steam version of this title won't pass the multiplayer server checks and the recommended way to install is purchase and get your license keys then download and install from Eagle Dynamics website (wish I would have known would have saved me a lot of time and heartache). The next thing I want to talk about is the mission / campaign packs, especially the enemy within pick for A-10C. While the missions are well thought out, the voice acting and dialogue is amateurish. To the point that I am wondering if the pack was fan made, yet I  got charged $10 for it. I'm glad the missions are well thought out and briefings are detailed, but for the extra money on top of $50 for the A-10C ,I would have expected better recording quality and to be given a choice of starting locations. That's one of my disappointments with DCS. In Falcon4 you could choose ramp (cold) start, runway, or flying.  D.C.'s has some separate missions for this but campaign missions do not give a choice. You start wherever the designer wanted you too. Finally, multiplayer, and I mentioned at the start there's some kind of oddness with the steam download. Reddit seems to think installing a ""pure"" version from Eagle direct fixes it. I'll try that soonOverall I'm going to have to give this one a 8/10  would def have still purchased these games, but I wish that some of these known issues were out there front and center for purchasers.  So all that said, if you like flight simulations, you won't regret this. I recommend you have or plan to purchase a HOTAS   I play with 3 monitors trackir, and the x-56 HOTAS. If your a veteran of any of the Janes games from back in the day or Falcon4 like me then you will quickly feel at home			"

Them.*  The multiplayer feature is wonderful, the community this game has is incredibly friendly and helpful. You will have no problem learning the basics with these people. Mission Editor is probably the most fun of all, I have never sat in front of a game for 9 hours straight and just set waypoints to the AI planes that will not affect the gameplay at all, just pass trough and it would look cool, you never get bored, trust me. Missions and Campaigns are very fun but sometimes frustrating, you get the hang of it with determination, though. Music. Damn the music is good, even though it doesn't play ingame, you can easily sit at the menu for 30min and enjoy the tunes, truly amazing.Although nearly all the modules are sadly cost a fortune, they are so detailed and it really gives you the feeling of the hard work that has been put into them. It really is worth it.It also is fun to properly learn a real life plane where you would actually know how to start it up if you were in it, it takes a long time but you get the feeling of the achievement of hard work. (Ahem A10C Ahem)Conclusion; guys, seriously, it's free... It won't hurt giving it a try, who knows, maybe you will like the starter planes and buy some others too? Hey, you can always refund ;)                                                 - 10/10 would air refuel again			"

I have seen a lot of combat sims come and go but none have ever been; as well put together, well thought out, realistic, had such a wide scope of details and interaction, nor had such an easy to use and stable online facility. There is also a wide array of single player and campaign missions (if you are not up for online interaction). I also have to give a big thumbs up to the constantly expanding and updating choice of vehichles (helicopters,tanks,planes) that are being made available to us. (standalone DCS already has a large back catalogue of vehichles and these will inevitably find their way into the steam stores at some stage however, in the meantime there is already a large selection of well known favourites available).I have to say that DCS world ticks all the box's, 1.flight charecteristics are amazing, 2.on board systems are detailed and relevant, 3.real world type damage that affects your planes abilities, 4.detailed weapons systems and management that actually get a bit of adrenaline pumping, 5.sound is fully imersive not to mention well balanced (no ear aches after prolongued play at full volume.)6.Graphics are jaw droppingly stupendous whether inside the cockpit or outside the plane graphical detail is heart stopping as is the landscape and objects/buildings/mountains/sea/clouds/sun (and I am only running NVIDIA 750ti ! I would love to see it on one of the latest generation GPU's the mind boggles...)I think the biggest tribute that I can pay to this simm is that: when I use air travel in the real world since DCS I know and can feel every thing the pilot is doing from take off to landing - though this can make for some nervous back seat driver feelings (""He's retracting those flaps a little early for my liking..."" ""I SAY ! STEWARDESS Could I have a word with the pilot please...^^ [air marshall raises eyebrowes] ;)Quite simply a 5 star release [disclaimer] this is not an arcade title ! YOU WILL need to know about flight and if you don't... Well DCS will teach you :)			"

												anyone who has played lock on will recognise this title ... same makers ... and its all the better for it now the free aircraft are great , well realised and fun , not much is as much fun as hopping into a tf51d mustang ... a p51 without guns and just barrelling around , then you start practicing landings and you see how the flight model works and changes subtly as you decelerate from 300 kts to 150 to land and taxiing with differential brakes , after this you'll spend an age learning how to cold start the engine and systems , and in spite of how heavy it sounds it draws you in ... after all a mustangs a damn sight more fun than a cessna after that you can try the su25 ... the soviet answer to the a10 , again its deep but not so deep that you will never get the hang of it but hard enough that complete mastery is after many hours ... think 100+ before your targeting in low light and doing pop up attacks now im no fan of the frogfoot but i enjoy deep sims so i splashed a bit of cash and got the a10c warthog package ... thats deep as in setting waypoints , radio frequencies , setting chaff/flare dispersions etc etc ... but its bloody good fun , its also fully configurable with a good flight stick , i have an old hotas cougar that i want to mod for this , but generally im using a saitek x52 ... also excellent for elite dangerous , in addition i use it with an oculus dk2 and quite frankly this transforms this from a game to serious immersion territory , i can blat around in my a10 looking out over the wings and scan all around and the sheer scale of the aircraft is there ... your looking right back down 40 foot of fuselage to the tail over the huge turbofans , then you see the weapons draped under the wings however you set its loadout ... its there in full effect , i may as well just join the usaf as im already there just without the BS side of things :) another bird i had to get was the f15c , not as fully realised as the a10c but great fun , imagine full afterburner runs down the valleys keeping below 200 feet contrails streaming off the wings as you pull g then going vertical breaking through the clouds and looking down at a beautifully realised world ... when your machines good and you have the magic accessories this simulation really is as close to flying as you can get , i used to be an raf engineer and a part time glider pilot so i do understand whats being attempted here and you just cannot get better and its free!!!! , you just chip in when its given you a taster of what the real military do			"

												Some people say ""oh no is so hard to learn all the stuff there"", well they are missing the point here, it ain't a game, it's a sim. So, the steep learining curve on the ""clickable cockpit"" modules is the most rewarding thing of the whole platform. Sure, you can strap yourself into an f-15 and start killing bandits in a couple of hours, but the real pleasure, the real immersion, the real deal is in the learing and the feeling of locking a ground target with a maverick 7nm away (it may seem easy, but it ain't!) or dropping a CBU-105 and watch the earth burn or dodging a sam launch almost kissing the ground with your wing is an adrelanie rush hard to match in pc gaming.If you ain't a real life pilot (like me), well this is the next best thing.

												Invest in a H.O.T.A.S  (Hands on Throttle and Stick) I was considering the Saitek Pro Flight X56 Rhino, but lately I'm thinking the Thrustmaster Warthog is the ideal way to go as the reviews seem to suggest the durability of the warthog and craftsmanship are far supior than the cheaply made plastic Saiteks that keep getting negative feedback.  Don't buy a simple joystick, would also recoomend Flight rudders.  This will help a ton, from there either get a Track IR 5 pro, for head movement to look around cockpit freely while flying, or if you have serious system and money VR would be awesome.  Consider 3 displays as well for more immersive experience.  This isn't cheap stuff but this is the game you want to get the best use out of these iteams.  If you are not keen on learning how to pilot a real aircraft this game may not be for you.  Though I hear Flaming Cliffs 3 has an easier learning curve however I have Ka 52 Blackshark 2 which you may need the real 400 page flight manual to be able to familairize yourself with.  All and all this is an epic military flight combat actuator.  Love the game!!!			"

												D(L)CS world is (quite obviously) a flight simulator game, and a really great one.The game is hard, unforgiving, and requires a lot of practice to properly play, but once you figure out you're not supposed to end up with your nose in the ground it's a lot of fun.It is important to note that, while the game itself is free, it's almost impossible to play properly without using a good flight stick (the T-flight HOTAS X by thrustmaster is a pretty good choice if you don't want to spend a load of money on the more advanced choices like the Thrustmaster Warthog or the saitek X-52) which adds some costs to playing.DCS world comes free with the SU-25 frogfoot known by many from battlefield 4 and the TF51D (an unarmed version of the P51 Mustang used during WW2) but for different planes like the A10 you'll have to get the DLC.TL;DR it's great if you don't mind to put some effort and money into it.

												This is a fantastic game. This game really stands out when it comes to detail on aircraft. The physics are fantasticly good like they were made for Joysticks. Control inputs are very smooth, fells good to fly and I really enjoy it.The are things that are sort of missing, but those are just minor ones. Otherwise I think DCS World is one of the best combat simulators I've played. DLC is very expensive, but it's definitely worth it. The detail, the dynamics, the physics, everything fits together really nicely and is unforgivingly fun to fly.			"

												I'll keep it short. If you want to learn how to operate Russian and American fighter aircraft this is for you. If you want to jump in a jet fly around and shoot stuff this is not for you. This is a very realistic simulator. I love it. It is the best I have ever played. I have invested about 17hrs so far am just getting the hang of the Su-25T and somewhat the KA-50. That being said I have probably spent at least that many hours watching youtube videos and reading. Highly Recommend!			"

												EDIT: August 2015. DCS World has really grown on me. The simulation of airplanes by third parties is very well done, even with some of them still in beta. Eagle Dynamics also has a great idea shifting the burden of module development onto third parties for the most part, allowing them to commit more manpower to features, engine upgrades, and other things we have yet to learn about. The World War 2 planes, while few in number (P-51, BF-109K-4, and FW-190D-9) are well made, and a blast to fly. Integrates seamlessly with the Tacview software so you can review flights later on in a similar way Red Flag debriefings are handled.You will need a decent flight stick, one with throttle control. The learning curve is steep. If you want to get the full experience, expect to spend a few hours learning how to start your particular aircraft, operate it's various systems, how it handles, optimum turning speeds, and how to evade missiles. If you stick with it, the payoff is very worth it.			"

												I played the standalone version before playing the steam version so have more hours ingame than steam says.DCS World is a fantastic simulator, but please note the sim part of the name... this isn't a game you are going to load up and be flying around like Maverick within the first 2 minutes.  If you are willing to learn how the planes handle, learn what the limitations on each plane/weapon/vehicle are and practice, practice and more practice then DCS World is an amazing experience and game.The two planes that come with the free version are perfect for learning how to fly, the DLC modules bring in more challenging planes, maps and campaigns.The free map in the Black Sea region is huge, with more than enough land mass and sea area.Work is constantly being done on the sim aswell to keep the graphics and sound up to date, the new 2.0 update in testing at the moment is fantastic looking.The free single player campaign for the SU-25T is interesting, the tutorials are informative and the included mission editor is easy to use and gives you the ability to create very advanced missions and campaigns.  Multiplayer is also an amazing experience.I'ld recommend DCS World to anyone with an interest in flight from both modern and WWII eras, even if all you want to do is experience flying and not interested in combat.Nominated for the ""I thought this game was cool before it won an award"".. award.

												After almost 90 hours in the game I can say this is truely a masterpiece in the making. Between the details and the amazing physics of the aircraft and flight. I will say if you want the full experience be sure to spend the money and get the Thrustmaster Warthog and MFG Crosswind pedals. I have paid for almost every aircraft available and I can say I do not regret a single one of them. The developers are always making it better and we will soon have the maps all in one version as well as the F18 and some much looked forward to WW2 aircraft, not that there isnt already enough of these amazing pieces of art but lets be honest there is no such thing as too many. Eagle Dynamics and all the aircraft developer companies have sucked me in and this is one of those games that you just wont regret. Everything was and is done right with this simulator. I keep calling it a game when in all honesty this is a pretty hardcore sim. Dont be scared when you hear hardcore though, you can make it whatever you want from relaxed to full on PVP combat. Many of these aircraft have all working buttons and knobs and require you to learn them inside and out which for many people is what we wanted in a sim this great. I have logged approx 45 hours in the A10C and have learned fully how to start it properly and taxi, how to trouble shoot problems and mitigate them in the air, How to drop bombs and use the weapons systems. Still much much more for me to learn and it will more than likely get hundreds of hours in the coming years alone. As for the mission editing it is fairly simple and with a few hours of learning you can make a very nice mission to your wants and needs. Again this simulator is fantastic and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to get into a really good combat flight sim. 11/10 stars from me.			"

												In one sentence, this simulator is fatastically complex but simple enough for anyone to use (if they have the patience) and will provide hundreds of hours of gameplay.I'd definitely recommend using some sort of HOTAS setup to play the game. I'm using a Saitek X-52 Pro which works well, but even with all the button mapping provided with it, I still find myself using the keyboard quite a lot to use certain systems such as the autopilot and with things like starting up the aircraft. I'd also recommend looking into TrackIR or another headtracking system, which will give you the full feel of flying the aircraft.The training scenarios are very well thought out, especially for the SU-25T, which is included with the base game free of charge. The scenarios go through every possible system in the aircraft, from startup to navigation to landing to countermeasures.The missions are fun yet difficult, which will make you want to run through them again and again. I've only successfuly completed a handful in the 10+ hours I've spent playing them. I haven't spent any time in multiplayer yet, but from what I've read and watched on the internet, it will be even better than single player.If you like flying, I'd definetly recommend this. Plus, it's free ;)			"

I originally got DCS World about a month after its release, but threw in the towel quite quickly as I found the systems and flight dynamics too difficult to get my head around.

Needless to say this is my favourite sim and am soon to graduate from the free SU-25T. 10/10 - Would Highly Reccomend			"

I keep calling it a game when in all honesty this is a pretty hardcore sim. Dont be scared when you hear hardcore though, you can make it whatever you want from relaxed to full on PVP combat. Many of these aircraft have all working buttons and knobs and require you to learn them inside and out which for many people is what we wanted in a sim this great. I have logged approx 45 hours in the A10C and have learned fully how to start it properly and taxi, how to trouble shoot problems and mitigate them in the air, How to drop bombs and use the weapons systems. Still much much more for me to learn and it will more than likely get hundreds of hours in the coming years alone. As for the mission editing it is fairly simple and with a few hours of learning you can make a very nice mission to your wants and needs. Again this simulator is fantastic and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to get into a really good combat flight sim. 11/10 stars from me.			"

This game is the reason I got into flight simulation!After watching about 100 videos of people playing & learning to fly in DCS, I bought an X55 Rhino, Oculus Rift DK2, a leather drivers-seat from an old Subaru, mounted in a simple pine frame... 6 months later, and I think I've only scratched the surface of what this game can show me... I've taken my setup 100's of km to demo to my workmates, family, & friends, most are simply breath-taken with what they experience (the rest get sick from VR ;) ).If you want to know what it's like to fly a real plane, but can't afford lessons, this is probably the closest you're going to get for at least the next decade... I can't recommend this game enough... buy it!... scratch that... fly the Su-25T & TF-51D for free... then buy it!			"

												I love this game because it's free to download and comes with a decent plane (The SU25T Frogfoot, ALSO CALLED THE CRATCH!) to show you the ropes about the game and guides you through everything without ""babysitting"" you like most games do. I like to think of the DCS ""game"" as a platform to access the modules and all of the modules are their own standalone game because the planes are so detailed and take a long time to master which would explain the pricing. Before you buy though, I would HIGHLY recommend you have a joystick, rudder pedals, AND a throttle quadrant as well as some sort of face track software/setup (FaceTrackNoIR, FaceTrackIR) and/or a multi monitor setup. These make the game much more enjoyable and makes it easier to focus on flying. Overall I think the developers have done a great job with this game and I would recommend it to all my friends looking to get into aerial combat simulation.			"

												This piece of craft is more than just a game, but a way of life.The most notable thing to mention is that this is not a game. Rather, this masterpiece is a fully loaded flight simulator much to the likes of Richard Burns Rally. The learning curve is steep and the 300-500 page manual is your friend.			"

												Love this game,  it's the best combat simulation I've played.  But give yourself alot of time to learn it once you start to learn the advanced functions of the game you'll really learn how much fun it can be.And come on who wouldn't want to crank up the Creedence and fly a UH-1 Huey 5 feet of the ground in hostile territory.Get a good controller and a good set of rudder pedals find yourself a couple friends and it really gets fun.  Works great with the Oculus Rift DK2 which makes the game even more realistic.			"

												This is a fantastic simulator and game. I've spent many hours before the steam integration and have bought a flight stick, rudder pedals, and track ir because of this sim. If you love hardcore simulations that require patience and a little bit of study then this is for you.There aren't as many planes as other simulators, but what this simulator has over ALL others is quality. Both free modules (SU-25T ""Frogfoot"" & TF-51D ""Mustang""), and the full modules (A-10C, Ka-50, Huey, Mi-8, P-51d and others) have very detailed flight models (physics) and fully interactive cockpits (for you button/switch lovers out there). You can fly all the modules this sim has to offer without a keyboard; as long as you have a mouse (to interact with the cockpit buttons/switches) and a flight stick/throttle for your HOTAS (hands on throttle and stick).Once you're comfortable in single player, you absolutely must try out multiplayer. I still remember my first couple experiences joining a multiplayer server in the A-10C (my favorite module so far). I joined their teamspeak channel and had a commander barking orders, ka-50's shouting rifle left and right, and the whole time I had an f-15c fly beside me who I thought was escorting me, but later I realised he was simply practicing his sortie/formation flight.The reward you feel for learning how to start, take off, fly/operate, then land an aircraft with this level of detail is an amazing experience. I warn you though, this is a simulation first and a game second so be prepared to put in time (around 10 hours) and effort towards the steep learning curve before you expect to have fun.			"

												My Steam game time does not accuratly reperesent my actual time in game as most of it has been on the non Steam version of the game...     This game is amazing. The attention to detail is incredible. The ir missiles even lock on to the sun. If you want a game that gives you the feeling of really flying a millitary aircraft look no further. This game has it all... I can't even imagine playing this in VR.     This game is Very well optimized and can (in theory) be played with just a keyboard. I would highly recomend getting a joystick. It will greatly enhance your experience. You don't even need something exspensive either. I started with a Logiteck Attack 2. Then a friend swapped me for an Extreme 3D pro. Both are very cheep joysticks. The 3D pro is really all you need and it's like $30 on amazon. A true HOTAS is definatly the way to go though and after a lot of reaserch I will be getting a CH fighterstick, pedals and pro throttle. Hopefully I will have my DIY trackir hat built here soon and will no longer have to use a mouse to look around. The thing is though, even with the cheap control setup, the game is tons of fun. I would try the free Su25T first. Give the game a fair shot. I actually thought it was stupid at first and quit playing after like an hour. I came back a year later and started learning off youtube. It hit me. The game was incredible. From there on out I put in hundreds of hours. I got FC3 and had fun with the jets. Then I stepped up and got the Ka-50 and A-10C on sale. Very good purchases. Yes they take some time and willingness to learn but they really aren't that hard. The aircraft are setup logically. Once you learn the basics all the advanced stuff will click into place. Multiplayer is great and lots of fun. Finnaly... GIVE THE GAME AN HONIST TRY. ACTUALLY ATTEMPT TO LEARN THE SYSTEMS AND IMMERSE YOURSELF IN THE TECHNICALITY OF IT ALL. YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE AND A NEW TYPE OF GENRE WILL OPEN TO YOU!!!      ps. Set curves of like 20-30 on your axises. It will make flying a ton easier. also... Slow smooth motions. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast. :)			"

												As far as old school simulator games go, there are still plenty of them going around, still alive by the modding community or it's general community at all. Among these was the pretty 'out of the blue' Lock On - Modern Air Combat, or as we called it back then - LOMAC. Amazing graphics, systems, physics, mechanics, it was a breeze of fresh air, no more we needed the piston planes simulation to sane it, we finally moved on to the modern battlefield.DCS World recaptures that sensation, and then amplifies it several times, and it's making it even bigger and better, with new modules, new mechanics, new looks and soon enough - a whole new engine, which will run smoothly and beautifully. Even if the modules are a bit on the pricey, i can't recommend it enough, buy just ONE module, pick one, MiG-21, A-10C, Flaming Cliffs 3, whatever you choose, you'll feel you're buying something WORTH. This is where we, lovers of speed, smoke, and fire, can reunite and rejoice.			"

												I flew the A10C for a while, thought I'm an aviation expert, tried to fly the P51D without reading the manual.""My compass is off by ten degrees, now I'm in Narnia.""The P51D has the most ironic labeling for its gun-sight ""NO HAND HOLD"". Watch its gauges for proper temperatures, RPMs, coolants, or you get the ""CLUNK"". Meanwhile you're manually trimming, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥is it annoying, it teaches you to be OCD about the bank and turn indicator, then the artificial horizon gyro. Every turn, you trim, every altitude and throttle maneuver you trim.I wanted to learn dogfighting, but I have to learn to fly again. Cause after twenty minutes of manuevers, I always clunk first.  This game is like the perfect combination between Arma and Microsoft flight simulator.  "

If you love aviation and modern day jet combat , this is the game for you!.However , to get the full experiance from the  game , you will need a joystick and throttle as the mouse and key board controls are not exactly easy to use.

												An absolutely incredible simulator that's improving all the time. Be warned though, this is not for casual pilots (i.e. the War Thunder or Ace Combat crowd). It's not a pick-up-and-play game. This is an ultra realistic sim, and the learning curve is steep. You'll find that most of the negative reviews of this sim come from people who were expecting something far less realistic that could be played with an gamepad. A HOTAS joystick & throttle setup is pretty much essential. There are currently six different third party developers developing aircraft modules for DCSW, so there are always new aircraft from many different eras of aviation on the way. The future for DCSW is a bright one. Highly recommended.			"

												TLTR; - ""There is no such satisfying feeling flying in a formation with a friend, blasting the top gun album on maximum and screaming over the microphone ""MAVRICK! I GOT TANGO ON MY TAIL!"".""If you feel that you are bored by the regular games that exsist out there, with the minimum sense of realism and technical complexity. Then DCS World is for you. It has the Realism and complexity.I cant even comprehend what DCS have managed to do! You have a fullblown simulator of most aircrafts, but not only that.Their systems, Problems and Funstuff are also reallisticly simulated. Ever wounder what the F*CK a R27ET is? This game lets you dive deep into how systems, missiles, radars and what not actually work. Becuase they are simulated to work like the real life.At first, sure, DCS is overwhelmingly complex, and you can barley get the hang of how even to lock a target at ground or air. Pleny of my friends have tried but given up shortly after a 10 minute try and just said ""no, not for me, to complex"".But if you stick with it, there is no such satisfying feeling flying in a formation with a friend, blasting the top gun album on maximum and screaming over the microphone ""MAVRICK! I GOT TANGO ON MY TAIL!"". Working together is beyond satisfaction. It is rewarding, it shows how grim and dangerous modern combat is. It lets you fear that one misstake you are going to make and see your friends in ruin.The best part is that you can try it for free, the su25 is plenty fun. Try it out, it wont hurt you nor your wallet.			"

												 If you are looking for a cerebral experience, this is it. Great niche community ages ranging from youngins' to actual pilots or crew chiefs online. So many videos for training, helpful forums and a huge update coming out soon 1.5 (hopefully!)   Didn't know anything about flying before this game, but after many sessions and beers, it grew on me. I can start the A10C manually in under 5 minutes now, including INS warmup. Highly recommended if you want a fun game that isn't mindless drull.   There are two types of cockpit layouts basically. Some aircraft modules have fully interactive cockpits. Others, have limited cockpits that utilyze hot keys. You get the modules that you want, and if you don't know or can't decide, watch a few videos online. Hell, the game is free and comes with two complimentary aircraft.   I have setup face tracking for this game. I built a three IR LED system for under $7, and there is a multitude of freeware out there to use. So stupid amazing. The game is also very mod friendly and allows rather easy export of .lua files to utilyze if you are building a sim pit. I have a few panels that I have already made.    As you can see, you can go easy and arcadey mode, or fully immersed experience. Enjoy!			"

Be warned! expect to read alot, learn alot and put alot of hours into learning the aircraft and how to operate it.  On the other hand you can fly the simpler flight models which just require simple keyboard commands to operate the systems.  Very well reccomended.			"

												This ""game"" is buggy as hell, a huge resource hog and includes a lot of bad translations.Yet, it is awesome. As a free game, it comes with a fully clickable and modelled P51 Mustang that lacks weaponry, but is otherwise a complete aircraft. You can do a 100% realistic ramp start from clicking all the little switches and learning how to use an old fighter plane. The game also includes the Russian SU25T, Frogfoot, that is softcore sim and is about equal to the american A10 in capabilities.I recommend this game and especially the FC3, Huey, A10C and Blackshark 2 addons. They add great planes and learning how to propely use these aircraft, from every tiny bit of detail will surely engage you for hours and hours.The game could have a dynamic campaign though, but other than that, it is a solid hardcore military simulation.

												I'm happy to say that after over 2 months of trying to get help from support that this saga is finally over.  In that time period there was never a single suggestion made to fix the problem, nothing but questions that had already been answered by the information I provided.  After telling me to wait for a refund weeks later I was then told that was impossible since I bought it through Steam.  Yet another fail by tech support as after making it clear I wasn't just going to give up and let them keep my $40, $40 that I got nothing for - no game play and no support - finally I was issued a refund via Steam.  No apologies for the complete lack of support I got, no explination, just a short message that they were emailing Steam.  Even in doing the right thing they showed how completely and totally incompentent their support system isNow that I can finally put this train werck of a game/company behind me anyone have a suggestion as to what I can spend my $40 on???  I'm sure it'll be more fun than the crap that DCS put me through.------------------------Never have I had such a horrible experience with tech support.  After 2 months of delays and not a single suggestion to try (only a few questions) and after being told to wait so they could process a refund the case was closed.  I then opened a new case and posted the story on their forums - the subject of ""Worst support I've ever received"" was changed to ""VR Issues"" and my account was banned for a month.  No message, I've read all forum rules and see nothing I've violated.  I didn't dox or otherwise call out anyone by name.  Just banned and can't even reply to any threads on the matter.I hope they do the right thing and issue me a refund so I can remove this review and we can simply part ways.  Until then I hope that at least one person will read this review and move on to some other game.  While different I play a lot of Elite Dangerous and as a space/flight sim it has similarities (VR and HOTAS support), skip this, I'll buy you a copy and teach you how to play it instead!!!!Original Review--------------------------After spending *many* hours trying to get DCS to run smoothly I'm finally giving up.  No matter what I do or how I play I get these little stutters every 3-4 seconds.  It's like the whole game pauses for an instant then is back to normal.  Doesn't matter if it's on 3 monitors or 1.  VR or not.  High settings or Low.  Stutter stutter stutter.  My PC is rather powerful, Core i7 4770k 3.5Ghz, 32 GB RAM, 250GB Samsung EVO SSD, Zotac GTX 1080.  I play many other demanding standarnd and VR games that all run butter smooth.  I'm rather disappointed as the experience in VR is rather fantastic but the constant stuter makes it an unplayable barf fest.  I'll just go back to enjoying Elite Dangerous which is incredible and performs beautifully.			"

												DCS World is one of the few games I can really enjoy at any time of the day.. Its communities (eg hoggit) tend to be quite welcoming and friendly to all types of players, and that is huge plus.. DCS of course, has a variety of aircraft, mostly purchased ones for around $40, I would recommend picking up A-10C ASAP. Graphically, the game is quite nice (in the air), but ground textures are lacking in certain aspects, but EDGE should in theory fix this, along with some performance problems on older rigs.

												DCS World is one of the few games I can really enjoy at any time of the day.. Its communities (eg hoggit) tend to be quite welcoming and friendly to all types of players, and that is huge plus.. DCS of course, has a variety of aircraft, mostly purchased ones for around $40, I would recommend picking up A-10C ASAP. Graphically, the game is quite nice (in the air), but ground textures are lacking in certain aspects, but EDGE should in theory fix this, along with some performance problems on older rigs. Overall, 10\10 gud gume 60 fps no crash			"

												This ""game"" is buggy as hell, a huge resource hog and includes a lot of bad translations.Yet, it is awesome. As a free game, it comes with a fully clickable and modelled P51 Mustang that lacks weaponry, but is otherwise a complete aircraft. You can do a 100% realistic ramp start from clicking all the little switches and learning how to use an old fighter plane. The game also includes the Russian SU25T, Frogfoot, that is softcore sim and is about equal to the american A10 in capabilities.I recommend this game and especially the FC3, Huey, A10C and Blackshark 2 addons. They add great planes and learning how to propely use these aircraft, from every tiny bit of detail will surely engage you for hours and hours.The game could have a dynamic campaign though, but other than that, it is a solid hardcore military simulation.

												A great simulator, however, not for the feint of heart. If you are looking for an Ace Combat style game, look elsewhere. The learning curve on this game is large. Whereas most games have a 1-3 hour learning curve to be proficient, 2-3 weeks is to be expected here. The effort is, however, greatly rewarded. With time and effort, and a pinch of anger management, you get a truly immersive experience. As far as DLC is concerned, that is where this game truly shows its colors. They can be a bit pricey, ranging from $10 to $40. It is well worth the cost, and the game is in no way diminished by purchasing a single or select few items as opposed to all. All in all, I cannot recommend this game enough for real world pilots and enthusiasts alike.			"

												Best flight sim on the market. It's really realistic, so it may be quite hard for new players. Don't download it if you expect something like War Thunder with F-16. If you really like having a less - arcade, realistic experience, and you have some patience, you will learn really fast.Devs put a lot of time and effort in every module (which have clickable cockpits), so there are only few planes at the moment, but there are multiple dev groups. There are 2 types of modules (DLCs): ---  Very realistic, with clickable cockpits (everything is funcinal just like in real-life): A-10C, KA-50, UH-1H, MI-8, MIG-21, P-51, BF-109, Fw 190D-9, F-86, C-101 Aviojet, Hawk T.1A - some of them are in Beta (as for now), but even those have a lot of features already (A-10C, KA-50 and UH-1 are 100% complete), also there should be F-15 and F-18 soon--- Other modules are from Flaming Cliffs 3 which is like more arcade version of DCS, but has DCS engine and absolutely compatible. Those FC3 planes are not clickable, so they have less realistic features (you don't have to press 40 buttons to start up, just push 4 buttons on keyboard, wait 10 sec and it's on), but it's still enjoyable especially for new players. DCS is free but it has only 2 free modules - SU25-T and TF-51D. SU-25 doesn't have clickable cockpit, but it still has many features - weapons, autopilot, radar and stuff, and TF-51D is fully clickable (but doesn't have any guns)Some DLCs have manuals, but even if they don't, just go on Youtube or Google. You can also use manuals for real aircraft, those have a lot of pages but they worth it.Multiplayer has a lot of servers but only few have more than 10 players.The downsides of the game - those are quite random but common.- FPS - i'm running the game with Radeon HD7950 (overlocked, equal to GTX770), sometimes getting 25-30 fps on low-medium settings - when on airfield, near some big town, or in multiplayer. But usually it's around 50, getting better when im flying and there are less cities around - may go higher than 60, like 90-120. But, some people say they having 50+ fps on ultra high. Those maybe Radeon drivers, or my luck- Bad synchronization with Steam - overlay doesn't work randomly or it doesn't count hours of playing (5 hours instead of 50)-Haven't noticed any gamebreaking bugs yet.Hope my review was useful, sorry for some misspells "

												One of the very few sims out there, and a great one at that.Insanely detailed, accurate flight and systems modelling, you'll feel like you're flying the real thing.Of note is the Helicopter flight dynamics, which are currently unmatched in their realism.More and more planes are being added, but as of June 11th, 2015, available planes ( each purchased separately, apart from the TF-51D and the Su-25T, which are free with the game ) :_A-10 A Warthog_MiG 29 A, G and S Fulcrum _Su-27 Flanker_Su-33 Sea Flanker_F-15C Eagle_Su-25A Frogfoot(These planes are part of Flaming Cliffs 3, and have no clickable cockpits, and reduced fidelity systems modelling )(These modules are ""DCS Level"" which means the highest attainable standards, with the exception of Top Secret systems ( most notably IFF ) )_MiG 21 Fishbed_P-51D Mustang_Mi-8 Hip_Ka-50 Black Shark_UH-1H Huey _F-86F Sabre_BAE Hawk_Fw190 D9_BF109 K4_C-101 Aviojet ( EB and CC version, latter is still WIP as of now ) _MiG 15bis Fagot_A-10C WarthogIn Summary, if you like spending hours learning to fly and operate military planes, this is the sim for you. It is however not recommended as a game, and the combined price of all modules is very high. I recommend you buy modules when they are on sale ( happening every 2 or 3 months ).One of my most played games.			"

												DCS World is a solid platform built on years of experience starting with Su-27 Flanker release back in 1995. I could talk about how awesome the flight dynamics are or how realistic the weapons modeling is and how powerful the mission editor is. But I'll save us both some time and recommend you download and play the free Su-25T and I'll guarantee you will be hooked. This is the bees knees of flight simulation and is worth spending hundreds of dollars on required peripherals i.e. Track IR, Eyefinity, HOTAS and Oculus Rift down the track. "

DCS is doing a great job on graphics, planes and cockpits.If ya want a game that has 'Much More' to it than run & shoot..... or sneak and hide, then you will like this game.There is a learning curve. So, if ya only want something like the ole Atari arcade games, then look elsewhere.I highly Recommend this!DCS keep up the good work! Kuddos to Steam for working with DCS. "

												I have been playing this game since it first came out.  I recently moved it over to STEAM for simplicity but at the end of the day this is uniquely one of the greatest simulation software pieces I have ever owned. EVER.  Since Falcon 4.0 (which blew away even Falcon 3.0) I have been in search of this kind of greatness. It has a learning curve that could only be called a ""learning cliff"" (stolen from EvE Online) but once you learn to fly The Hog you'll never be able to go into a crappy flight model again.  It is unforgiving in that you will need to do your homework to both fly and fight; but the reward is huge. I've now invested... most literally thousands of dollars on everything from the HOTAS Wartgog, the Obutto game seat, a SimPit, button boxes, iPad software, Track IR... and I am still looking at what other cool things I can add to further push the reality of this sim.What can I say you should do?  Get a good HOTAS (The Warthog natively works so well), get a TrackIR, and a big monitor.  Then start down the road of full enjoyment with this.  If you love flying, pick this up and XPlane 10, most of the hardware tends to lend itself to a lot of flying!  But I will warn you, once you get past that furst few hours of learning to fly, you'll probably end up wondering where you can carve more time out of your day to get into the pit.			"

												I got DCS with the Flaming Cliffs and MIG-21BIS addon.It's true that it takes ages for them to design and release an aircraft, but the result is a very detailed cockpit and after a while a balanced aicraft that performs like you expect.The learning curve is very steep, if you never got into military flight sims and have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue of tactics and strategies you will struggle alot. You will find yourself reading up on ECM-Jammers, Flares, Chaff, what you do when you get an enemy missile launch on you, etc. You will spend hours digging and searching for every bit of information. You will go and buy a decnt HOTAS flight stick aswell as TrackIR cause this game is so awesome.You will map keys after each fight cause you noticed:♥♥♥♥♥♥ it would be quiet advantageous to have this or that mapped on my stick! After playing this game you think differently about aircraft. Flew the SU-27 and did a pugachevs cobra once? Then you feel awesome as ♥♥♥♥. You will know how dangerous missiles are because the process is not just ""Ohh let me pop some flares / chaff"". You know you need to judge if its a Heatseeker or not and plan your defence on that.You will begin to start to think like a fighter pilot. Sit in a large aircraft traveling the world: ""Ohh that was a nice takeoff / That was a hard landing, glad the pilot nailed it"". Why do you think like that? The pesky airline pilots calling themselves ""captain"" are laughable. You know better than them how hard it is to fly a plane and what they do is nothing compared to that.10 / 10 after you play this game and someone would show you what buttons to press in your favourite aircraft you could fly it if you don't black out cause you're a gawddamn nerd that hates doing sports like me.

												It's the best flight sim in the world. There simply is no substitute for CAS aircraft simulation. Falcon BMS provides a great F16 simulator. However, for everything else DCS is superior in every way. The A10C is the most faithfully recreated aircraft in their line up. But you can still have a great time flying the Russian black shark. The feeling you get when you successfully start an aircraft from a cold start is amazing. You also get to try out the SU25 for free (and the modern version for a price). it's not nearly as fun as the A10C, but it still lets you learn the basic weapon systems. It's VERY IMPORTANT to remember that the A10 is NOT the same as the A10C. the A10 will get you a more forgiving ""arcadey"" aircraft (but still more realistic then something like say ace combat or battlefield, think of the old Jane's flight sims level). the A10C will give you the real deal. The A10C package does include basic tutorials for things like learning how to properly fly/start/land/engage in an A10. But things like working with JTAC will not be explained. So quite a bit of reading is required on your part.			"

												FSX gone military. You have to love flight, (which I do,) and you have to know the controls/general similarities among all aircraft (which I also know). This ain't War Thunder or IL2 Sturmovik or any of those types of games. This is a full-out sim.I, as a frequent FSX pilot and aircraft enthusiast, love this game. But, on the other hand, if you're one of those guys who wants to hop in a cockpit with all of the systems already running and not worrying about how to find the flaps switches, then DO. NOT. GET. THIS. GAME. Get War Thunder instead. It's still fun. Trust me. I play it.Let's focus on the main point. This game is absolutely free. Yes, I know, only two free aircraft. But they're incredibly realistic, plus it's not like real military pilots switch from aircraft to aircraft, just as I love flying the Boeing 737-800 in FSX. It's the plane I fly the most, and the same logic goes for this game. You get involved in one aircraft, you learn about it, you cry over the lost hours of your life spent learning how to fly it, and then you love it. You don't go 5 minutes into an SU-25 and then decide ""meh. I'm more in the mood for flying a MiG. Maybe after that I'll also fly a Mustang."" To sum it up, it's free, and it's either you love it or you hate it.			"

												This is a definite buy/download if you can invest some time and like complex games or simulations (or blowing stuff up). I was quite sceptic at the beginning but I still had my old joystick here and I thought: hey, it's free so let's try it. Flight simulators were always an alien genre to me but now I can't get enough. I bought the A-10C addition shortly after that, and was overwhelmed by its complexity (vanilla was already quite good).Do not expect to lift off in less than 10 minutes. There is so much to do that you basically need to switch to the manual for every button or switch. Sometimes the manual isn't enough so you search the forums for useful information and somehow you end up reading military documents about the maths behind escaping a missile. At least 50% of my time with this game included doing research about some specific systems and I haven't even tried them all and don't even fully understand those which I use frequently. But you know what? I have been playing this game straight for a week, my sleeping cycle is deeply disturbed (I go to sleep at 5 A.M and get up at 9 or 12) because it is so addicting. I also tried the included mission editor and it seems to have a whole lot of potential.There are a few downsides however: the campaign may feel quite realistic with much action going on, but it is missing some kind of story. Even though it is not as bad as  ARMA communications, the voices feel a bit robotic and monotone. I wish the AI would do some smalltalk even if it is maybe not appropriate.Another point is the map: it is huge, for sure, but after a while it becomes a bit boring. Not that it matters much, but I like looking out of the window when flying to the combat zone. However, along with the new EDGE engine, ED will bring out a new map afaik.I had a few performance issues during huge bomb dropoffs (dropping my entire payload) but all in all, it performs excellently for having so many units running at once.Also you need to be very, very patient. For example the navigation system on the A-10C needs around 4 minutes to start up and you really shouldn't move the vehicle until it is done. My best time from starting the game and taking off on the runway lies around 7 minutes and I repeat it for every single mission. And more often than not I get blown up before even dropping my first bomb. It can get quite frustrating.In conclusion, this is one of the most hardcore simulations I have ever touched and I will be touching it for some more time. it is deeply addicting and will lead you into buying more stuff so you can fight better oder try out new things (maybe a HOTAS instead of that old joystick). For those who have played other flight sims, don't wait. This download is well worth your time and the Su-25T model is really easy to fly in comparison to the A-10C. It has a few flaws, but you can easily ignore them while still trying what that button does... hey let's just push i- WHAAAaaaaaaaaa......I'd gladly give it a 9/10 and that one point missing is for taking my sleep			"

												If you enjoy ultra realistic flight simulators, have a joystick and are willing to pay a high price. Then get this game. I think everybody should try this game with the free modules, they honestly are a blast. If you like the Su-25T more then the TF-51D then I recomend getting the Flaming Cliffs DLC, All of thoes modlues still have realistic flight, but the cockpit is non-clickable. If you like the TF-51D then I would suggest getting basically anything else. I love flying the A10-C the most with its clickable cockpit. But I still enjoy flying the F15 from Flaming Cliffs. If you do not like either of them then I do not suggest buying any of the DLC. Also keep in mind, that this is a simulator, you are learning to fly REAL aircraft, so please dont complain that it is too hard.			"

												WOW! This flight sim is over the top! I just can't get enough of it. The flight models are superior to every other flight sim I have tried. The details of the planes and cockpits are beautiful and having the freedom to click every button and switch, just adds to the experience. The cockpit layouts are spot on. Every item is where it should be as in real life. Flight mechanics are awesome as well. As real as it gets for a flight sim! Learning how to fly these aircraft can be a challenge, but most modules have ""training exercises"" to help you figure out what to do. Flight manuals can also be found online, on steam or at the DCS website. There are also traning videos on Youtube. I personally enjoy the A10-C Warthog. The experience in the A10-C is intense and it is such a spectacular flight model. The other aircraft are awesome as well. Flying the Russian birds and hearing the Russian radio chat is great! There are so many positive things to say about this title I would be here all day, but I would rather be gunning down soldiers or blowing stuff up on the awesome missions or campaign! See you in the skies, pilots!			"

												DCS World alone gets you realistic sim level aircrafts to fly such as the Su-25T and the TP-51 trainer as free . Although, its not to PFM model with clickable switches it still packs enough realism like the Il-2 sturmovik.If you want to purchase DLC products which are often hardcore PFM models like A-10C and the Ka-50, please keep in mind you need a minimum of HOTAS joystick (not a simplistic level Joystick) and also take time to LEARN the manual and tutorial before going combat. The A-10C module is VERY HARD ( highly detailed model) and its very time consuming, If you don't have a good HOTAS Joystick, don't consider buying it, its only for super pro simmers. The Mig 21 is OK module and not that complicated like A-10C.Do a good research before buying the module coz most would be too hard to handle. Don't buy this if you dont have a solid pro joystick....especially the DLC like A-10C and the copters.If you guys are looking for PRO sim game, I say this is the game for you.The default DCS needs at least joystick like the Thrustmaster flightstick X or the Logitech 3d ...but HOTAS is very much recommended if you plan to purchase DLC.

												The DCS World is home to one of best currently available simulators. No cheap arcade nockoff but the real thing.The free Su-25T lacks a clickable cockpit and only represent a fraction of what this Sim can. If you want to taste what the world is like I still recommend to try this bird out.A very negative point:Comes with Starforce AAA. Starforce will generate a PC hardware code and will register your IP-address even if you don't want to. The data will be stored forever at the Starforce database. I see no option for a removal of the registered information on the Starforce website.Steam will not ask for confirmation of storage of information of the Starforce servers.

												If you are at all interested in combat flight simulators (both ww2 and modern combat era) I'd highly recommend trying this game. The fact that it's free and includes a sweet jet for free (the SU-25 Frogfoot) is enough to at least give it a try. It definitely has a learning curve, however, so don't expect to be doing any cool♥♥♥♥♥♥within the first hour or so. Lots of keyboard commands for micro management of all systems like engines, weapons, radar systems etc etc. So don't expect to be getting into some ""arcadey"" dogfights right after installing. This is more for the die-hard flight sim fans that enjoy a slow paced, realistic simulation of flying combat planes. It will take time and dedication to learn how to fly these planes and utilize them in combat.I love the map size it's huge and tons of♥♥♥♥♥♥to do online it has a very open world feel so you can do whatever (PvP/PvE) and not feel like you have to participate in any particular thing if you don't want to. The community is quite friendly and helpful so you'll almost always find someone to talk to and help walk you through figuring♥♥♥♥♥♥out. All in all, if you're into combat flight sims, this is definitely a game to try out. It's free, has a helpful community, and it has a great way of allowing you to play and enjoy the game at your own pace without feeling rushed or like you're falling behind in anyway. Personally I feel it's the best mix of realism and enjoyment (not too hard, not too easy, and very fun) in any flight simulator I've played so far so I'd give it a 10/10			"

												Disclaimer: I have hundreds and perhaps into the thousand hour territory on DCS World. I play on DCS Standalone so my Steam hours aren't exactly reliable.DCS World is a study level sim excluding the FC3 aircraft. This is many, many steps above series such as Ace Combat or HAWX. Even the FC3 aircraft are above the level of simulation you might see in something such as War Thunder sim battles. The level of enjoyment you have will correlate to both how into flight sims you are and how much effort you are willing to put into learning your aircraft(s). Do not expect to hop into multiplayer and shoot down a number of people on day 1. It's just not going to happen. However, if you stick with it, you'll find an amazing community that has done a tremendous amount of work towards turning this into  one of the best simulators out there (on par with Falcon BMS 4.33). Communities such as the buddyspike team create an atmosphere where teamwork and large scale coordination is not only encouraged, but crucial. In both single player campaigns and multiplayer full scale warfare, this sim is as real as it gets outside of flying the actual plane. I can't even begin to describe the feeling of being deep in the AO and behind enemy lines running all sorts of operations or having a GCI coordinate a large scale air war. The amount of focus and effort required is large, and the learning curve is quite steep. If you've got what it takes, I highly recommend this sim. The modules are without a doubt expensive, but as they are as close as a civilian can get to flying these aircraft, the price is more than just. Considering that you can spend hundreds of hours in each one of these aircraft, the cost isn't as bad as you'd initially expect. Plus, there's a ton of sales all the time on DCS Standalone. I rarely pay full price for any module.			"

												If you are really into action or really into Flight simulators then this is the game for you!You might think thats the DLCs are overpriced but if you know how to use the DLC then it is completely worth every penny.Best plane to start out with is probably the A-10c or the F-15c depends on what level of flying you like.If you are into helicopters I suggest the Ka-50 Black Shark 2 because its not to difficult to learn.If you get 10-20+ hours in the game you should expect another 100 just because there is always something to do.

												DCS happen to be ""the"" flight sim developers right now, and their numerous flyable aircraft offer a high degree of detail and realism that is unsurpassed in the military flight sim genre.  The Ka-50 Black Shark helicopter, and the A-10 C Warthog for example, are two highly detailed aircraft that will take most budding pilots weeks to get to grips with, let alone master.  Fortunately, DCS World provides a more immediate introduction to the flying module without the extremely high learning curve in say the A-10C, and with a reasonable joy stick, you'll be flying fairly quickly.  There are several aircraft to pilot, including the F15, Su27, Su33, Mig 29S, and the Su25.  The flight modeling is exceptional and level of world detail extremely high.  I would recommend having a fairly high end PC to really enjoy the physics and visuals in the game - it is processor heavy.  Ideally, you probably want to invest in a joy-stick and possibly flight pedals down the road, if you really want to immerse yourself in the art of combat flying.   I've been playing for several weeks now getting to grips with the Su-27, and it's been suitably challenging, offering a lot return playability.  Cranked up to full realism, and this quickly becomes a very, very challenging simulator - which of course is where a lot of the joy comes from.  Be prepated to be truly immersed in the flight environment.			"

												This game is one of the best free to plays I have ever played. Its the kind of game that you can play for hours and still not learn everything there is. I have played 26 hours at the time of this review and still haven't used the autopilot, weapon systems, and much more. Everytime I play this I seem to learn something I didn't know before. It does take a while to get a hang of and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody who gives up easily because you do need to crash a lot in order to get a hang of everything. It is a game that seems to reward those who put in the time to learn how to fly specific planes because it has a ton of keyboard bindings, some a necessity some a conveniance. The planes you get in the free version do a good job at showing two sides of piloting. The TF-51D is a plane that in the game requires some learning in order to know how to just start it since it has an eight step proccess to start the engine. Once you get the TF-51D in the air it seems to be an easy plane to learn because it doesn't have a very high top speed and therefore has less you can mess up with in things such as landing. The SU-25T is completely different because it makes everything on the ground easy but once you are in the air you can break your wings off if you turn too sharp (which I know from experience). The community from what I have experienced is very friendly and I don't hesitate to ask them questions because they are helpful for the most part, aside from the LCtrl+e+e+e jokes every once in a while. Overall this game is great, it is a game I would willingly buy which makes it even better that it is free. If you would like a game that can teach you something while you learn, this would be a great game to try.			"

												The free SU-25T is so fun, that I still play it despite owning all the other DCS Modules.  The attention to detail on all the planes is great, but the A-10C, Ka-50, UH-1 Huey, and the P-51 Mustang with their fully clickable and 6DOF (six degree of freedom, with TrackIR) cockpits are unreal.  They boast that you can use the actual flight manuals to fly these and I don't doubt it.  The systems on the A-10C are so detailed that it really does earn its ""study-sim"" moniker.  But, even when flying the less complex modeled F-15C or Su-25T, the amount of detail is impressive, and the flight-model is superb.			"

												DCS World is simply the best combat flight simulator I've ever used.Thoughts:1- THE THING IS DAMN FREE. You get an easy to fly Su-25T combat airplane, and another non-combat (non-armed) TF-51D Mustang.2- There are settings that allow you to make stuff easier if you are just starting out.3- I'm not sure if this should be you first simulator to try, maybe fly a Cessna somehow before getting into this.4- There are beautiful and realistic collection of modules that can be purchased.5- Manuals look cool on a desk when printed.6- I would love to have another ""map"" and a better scenery (which is coming soon!)Edit: NEVADA Test and Training Range Map is available for non steam users now.7- Since you saved some money not paying for the game itself, and before you get sucked in and buy every single airplane available, invest in a quality joystick.*The Steam version of DCS rarely get modules and updates on time, expect to wait a lot of time for new airplanes.

Now add to that that it is combat flight simulator and your joy will never end.My review is based on max realism settings, because true fly boys never play anything less than max hardcore.Shortly:- if you're looking for a game that will take you about 30 hours to master- game where you will wonder if that's just too many keys to remember or are you just getting old- game where before you even think of taking out an enemy you'll have to work out your approach, do the flyby and spot the ground targets first and try not to get taken out by SAM or AA guns in the process- game that will put your flying skills and intelligence to the ultimate test- game that will make your wife go insane from constant warning sounds- game that you can really play by stick and not just pretend you need stick to play it- you can very precisely tune entry level joysticks, so you don't get sudden and crazy reactions- not to mention how happy it will make you that you can finally utilize some expensive hardware (it will make you wanna buy all hotas and flight controllers which exists.- great game that is FREE?!- game where all the time you waste in it will be so much better wasted than in Counter StrikeLook no further, you have it all in this game. And did I mention it FREE?P.S. try to snatch some DLC on sales just to reward the great team behind this game!			"

												Absolutely love this sim, it's the most realistic thing you're going to get to the real deal. The A-10C DLC is by far the most accurate and detailed flight model when you factor in the weapons system, flight dynamics, model, etc. Other additions are great to though and ever expanding. DCS and third party have done a excellent job of extending the catalog. Make sure you read up on each module before you buy though as some may be more geared towards your style or bug tested.Be prepared to read, youtube, and find great people on the servers to teach you how to use various systems. Since the release of 1.5 (2.0 alpha in testing standalone) the performance has taken a huge leap (almost double my frame rate) it looks fantastic and really shows the future of this engine and just how well it uses the hardware in your rig.I highly recommend downloading and buying at least one module to support this fantastic team and all of their efforts.

												Very good game-edit(simulator) in my opinion if youre into fully relized aircraft etc etc the first two aircraft are free i reccomend learning to fly the TF-51 mustang with a joystick joystick to me is a must to fully enjoy thisbut once you get the hang of it buy the flaming cliffs three addon then if you still like it buy another plane of your choice if you want to but the free game by itself is nice enough just make an account and go on some free flight servers note-not all aircraft are 100% functional just most of the aircraft in flaming cliffs 3 and the su-25 you start with you need to know the keyboard short cuts for turning on your engine and electrical systems and such but all the single aircraft you pay for minus fc3 aircraft are 100% realized so taht 49.99 is tottally worth it --good for great emersion in gameplay this can act as a simulator and with an addon aircraft its better than anything else you pay for 60-80 dollars ---(Online play)---if youre going to play this online please obey server rules the server admin will kick and or ban you permenatly and it just pretty much ruins the experince if you take off from the taxi way unless its allowed and theres no one else thereover all online multiplayer is great even if you dont have all the aircraft but the money and the fun i say its totally worth buying an extra plane or  two after you get flaming cliffs 3			"

Fortunately I am not a normal person and I don't want to have fun so this game is perfect for me.A combat flight simulator with downright excessive attention to detail and realism. I can adjust the air conditioning in my plane. Why would I want to? I don't know. But I can.			"

												Absolutely love this sim, it's the most realistic thing you're going to get to the real deal. The A-10C DLC is by far the most accurate and detailed flight model when you factor in the weapons system, flight dynamics, model, etc. Other additions are great to though and ever expanding. DCS and third party have done a excellent job of extending the catalog. Make sure you read up on each module before you buy though as some may be more geared towards your style or bug tested.Be prepared to read, youtube, and find great people on the servers to teach you how to use various systems. Since the release of 1.5 (2.0 alpha in testing standalone) the performance has taken a huge leap (almost double my frame rate) it looks fantastic and really shows the future of this engine and just how well it uses the hardware in your rig.I highly recommend downloading and buying at least one module to support this fantastic team and all of their efforts.

												DCS is a combat flight simulator. It is designed to mimic realistic/authenic combat operations in military aircraft.Lets get this out of the way; you need a joystick (you dont fly planes with joypads!) and likely if you want to get the most of it, you may need to invest in more gear, such as rudder pedals, a throttle and even VR/Headtracking equipment.The DLC aircraft involved have steep learning curves (some more than others) but come with full manuals as well as tutorial missions of varying quality.Its worth pointing out that the ""DLC"" are not made by the company, but rather are small dev teams that make extra stuff for the game and use DCS as a platform for it. You are not expected to buy all, if any , of the DLCs.You can find reviews for individual aircraft on steam. The different aircraft DLCs are all fill different roles and have different equipment/weapons so you should investigate thorughly before purchase.You will also likely need a very good PC to run this optimally. Also note that there is a seperate non-steam version of the game, CD keys from Steam work for both, but CD keys from DCS's own store DO NOT WORK ON STEAM. "

												For those who do not want to read an essay here, I have three valid point for people who could be interested in this simulation game.1. It's free to try.2. It's the best war plane simulator out at the moment as my feelings go.3. Each ""DLC"" is a whole game on it's own. It's not only added content in the manner of new plane, but it is intended as full game with campaing. All this is then integrated in one world for Multiplayer purposes.And now for those whou would want to read a bit more. :)It's so damn complex it blows my mind. It simulates the whole plane, each part of the machine is simulated in some form. It depends on what dlc you buy but for example the A-10C or KA-50 (and others too) have fully clickable cockpits and simulated on board computers. You can do everything a real pilot could do. With combination of really powefull mission editor anything is possible.You get whole campaings for selected planes and even in the free to play basic package you can run a campain with SU-25 plane. Now when you combine this with multiplayer and really superb community, you get a package that can keep you entertained for years. Mercenary mission with your friends or with you ""clan"" are only the top of the iceberg here.I have only one con here, the game is really demanding. You will NEED to have a 64bit machine and highend CPU/GPU to really enjoy high details. This will maybe be solved when a new engine will be released (it's planed for this year) but I wouldn't put high hopes for this. Its mainly focused on adding DX11 support.			"

												DCS World is the best Combat Flight and Armored Simulator on the market, you really cannot find anything else better, especially for the price.I fly Lockheed Martin's Prepar3D, which is a professional flight simulator, but the Combat is unlocked for $700 and is really only intended for the Military.  DCS World is as good as Prepar3D and the combat already unlocked.  If you fly professional simulators, you know detailed simulated aircraft can be usually $40-150+, so this is much cheaper.  On sale, it is an absolute steal.  Combined Arms alone for $5.99 is worth it because you're getting the best tank and armored simulator you'll ever find, period.The UH-1 Huey is the only one I've seen with such detail and you would normally pay close to $80 for something like that for Microsoft FSX, Prepar3D or X-Plane.  So, for sale price of $15, its another steal!If you ever wanted to try a Flight Simulator, this is the one for you because the tutorials give a much lower learning curve.			"

												DCS World isn’t just a game nor a simulator, it is an experience.DCS takes you thought the highs and lows and it is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to learn, you'll spend more than 10 hours learning the aircraft, to attempt a takeoff and go down within 30 seconds. Then when you’ve taken off and your flying around, you’ll learn to shoot♥♥♥♥♥♥and make ♥♥♥♥en awesome explosion and then 30 minutes later u come to realize that there not that interesting at all and u start to realize how ♥♥♥♥en hard this♥♥♥♥♥♥is, BUT that’s when you start to test with their missions and you start to make your own and you learn the true hard part of DCS isn’t flying nor combat it is the mission editor and air to air refueling. For a second time BUT it is all good because you’re in the Russian A10 and you’re ready to bring some thunder to the MP of DCS. This is where you realize how♥♥♥♥♥♥you really are and that this is harder every time you play it but in the end of the day you still come back and it is the best ♥♥♥♥ing aircraft simulator experience you ever play.Thank you all From NICZZO20 "

												This is amazing, its not for all tho, its a simulator not your average game like warthunder, so the learning curve is like tryin to learn to pilot the aircraft in real life lol, ive spent hours reading operating manuals & watching youtube tutorials/tips, just to get a basic understanding on operating the aircrafts flight controls, modes, radar, navigation, weapons, countermeasures, etc etc... aswell as trying not to blackout from G-force in hard manuvers, ive still got a long way to go and a tone to learn but loving it all despite the work. I run on max settings and the graphics are amazing, at the minimum you need a joystick to play, i went cheap myself with a logitech 3d pro, but i know alot that have a full setup with seperate pedals/thottle controls which does help but i dont think its absolutely necessary, i dont have my own yet because of the cost but id definitely recommend a trackIR system to use in DCS, because in a dogfight its so easy to lose sight of your target, in my case anyway lol, by trying to look around with the keyboard while possibly evading a missle or trying to follow an evading target that maybe slipping in and out of your radar.

												DCS World is an unapolegetically realistic Combat Aircraft Sim. You know how you have all those dials, gauges, switches and stuff in your typical aircraft cockpit? Well in DCS they all actually mean something and have ramifications as to how your aircraft performs.I can't stress this point enough, DCS (Which stands for ""Digital Combat Simulator"") is a SIMULATOR. That means that it's less focused on traditional game design paradigms and more concerned with realism. Sure it's probably not 100% Realistic, I've never piloted an aircraft in my life (and never will due to medical reasons), so a real pilot would probably be able to pick at things. That's fine, to my understanding it's about as close as you can get with modern technology.Yes this means a steep learning curve, ESPECIALLY due to the fact that not all aircraft operate the same. They have different start-up procedures, binded to different keys (or differently placed buttons), different avionics systems, and different controls.I know that this is a turn off to most of you, but I'm giving it a thumbs up for one simple reasonIf you are just plain curious it's free!Yeah yeah there's a buttload of DLC which has most of the content, but If you try it and it's not your thing, no harm no foul, but if you take the time to actually play it, slowly learn how to operate your aircraft, and have the patience, focus, and willingness to try, try again, you are in for a treat!Because once you get used to it, flying these things is really freakin AWESOME! These things FEEL like jets, and to a degree, you are crossing miles of (virtual) landscape in pretty much a blink of an eye, and delivering a projectile at even greater distances in some cases with avionic-assisted precision! Just an awesome feeling I think!Also for those who like attention to detail, some of the DLC planes (including a free one you get, a T51 Prop-plane) actually have the ability to click on individual buttons/turn dials and cranks alongside the binded keypresses. Which is really neat!*Just remember though you are buying planes for an extra simulation experience, it's more of a self-study than anything unless of course you need to round out roles because I'm sure Ground attack/CAS isn't going to be what everyone wants to do in a Combat aircraft sim.

												I would highly recommend this sim for anybody with a passion for aviation!Make sure your system can handle it tho, as it can be very taxing on your cpu in multiplayer and in large missions.The most interesting things about DCS are (for me):- Lots of extremely high fidelity modules (expensive, yes... but quality comes at a price)!-The outstanding flightmodels; the helicopters and the warbirds are fantastic ( those are the machines I spend the most time in)!- The simulation of the systems of the different aircrafts is on a level you will not find anywhere else!- Lots of interesting multiplayer servers!- ....- And a great community!Try the (free) base game... and if you like it, maybe buy some of the modules. Be careful tho, as from experience I can say... once you start buying them, it will be difficult to stop :PI could tell you many more things about it, but that would cause me to write a whole essay... and I'm not in the mood for that ;) "

High speed fly by's or out manuvering a missile, Learning to hover a chopper or using the chopper to wreck ground forces who will return fire on you. DCS has a great design team and third party partners to keep this sim up and running till we all die from old age. I recommend this sim to serious gamers who want a learning curve, who want a rewarded feeling when you win an air battle because its tough. A person who likes to fly using ILS during a storm or wants to utilize their instruments because they work. Realism and updates to realism is what this sim is about. A community of folks who will help you learn your way until you one day are helping another learn to fly, fight, land in a shot up jet under tedious conditions. Enjoy DCS, I do!!			"

												DCS World is, quite simply, the combat flight simulator that I've been waiting for. From the get-go there's one thing that I have to make absolutely clear: *This simulator is FUN!If you are an aircraft enthusiast and always had the dream to fly, then this is your best bet - that is, if you are not a real pilot or if becoming one is not an option. The only things you won't feel when you strap yourself into a DCS World cockpit, are the G-forces. The instructional training missions are on-point and helpful, the missions challenging and fun, the learning curve steep and frustrating at times, the manuals as thick as a medical encyclopedia - but you know what, it's the package. I remember the days when I played Jane's USNF 97 and Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator, which were games that I couldn't get enough of. DCS World has replaced them with the same amount of, or even more, fun.Simply brilliant. "

												Probably the best and most realistic flight simulator on the market today. And on top of that you get to blow stuff up! What else could you ask for?-Modules I have tried out-A-10C: Most thorough flight simulation I have ever flown. From what I can tell all of the flight systems, computers, and avionics are operated exactly how they would be in real life and also have the same advantages, faults, and limitations. That being said starting it up from a cold start is always rewarding (If you do not mess something up along the way) but also very braintwisting. I have a much higher level of respect for the pilots who fly them for not just smashing their heads into a pulp trying to get the plane started up. The flight dynamics are exceptional also, and it's intricate weapon systems are very fun to blow up Russian tanks with.UH-1H Huey: I have flown hundreds of flight simulators, but they were all with fixed winged aircraft. I could not find a better way to learn the art of helicoptering from this jem. The Huey is a historical legend for it's service during the vietnam war among others, and its later civilian services that still continue to this day. It sure flys like a legend too, you will not find many complicated computer systems you have to spend days learning about in it. Starting it up is simply turning the right combination of knobs and switches. Flying it is not real challenge after spending enough time to get used to it. You will learn to hover it and land in the most obscure places possible. It's flight dynamics like any other DCS title is exceptional. From the basic increase in lift as the helicopter gains horizontal velocity to the more uncommon stalling. The developers really show pride in their work as many other aerodynamic effects are modelled in such as rotors breaking due to a high RPM and negative G environment. The weapon systems are really fun to mess around with, there is really not much to them apart from shooting a minigun in the direction of your enemies and watching the carnage.Flaming Cliffs 3: A great module for the less experienced flight simmers or casual player. Instead of focusing on a single high quality aircraft the developers worked on a great variety of more mediocre modelled aircraft. There are no interactable cockpits here besides closing the canopy. Apart from that, the planes are still modelled well for the status quo of a flight simulation. The F-15 included however has a very well modelled aerodynamics system that blows all the others in this module out of the water. Even though this module is much lower quality than the other titles, it is still very fun. And lets face it, cheaper too for the amount of content and variety it has.I would reccomend for more veteran flight simulators to stay away from this module as most of the planes are not very well modelled and some are just dumbed down versions of other aircraft in the simulation like the A-10A and SU-25.The F-15 is the plane that makes the module worth it, and as it is now only 10$ I reccomend just buying that instead of paying $50 on Flaming cliffs 3. The only reason I got it was it was on sale and was the same price of the F-15 at the time, so it just made more sense to buy all of Flaming cliffs 3 instead of just one aircraft included in it that was the same price as it. Free aircraft:TF-51: The TF-51 is a real fun plane for aerobatics if that is your cup to tea. It has a pretty good flight model and has a fully clickable and interactable cockpit, its flight and internal systems are just as well modelled.SU-25T: Although it is not exceptionally well modelled with the fact it does not have an interactable cockpit, the SU-25T is one of the most combat effective ground attack planes provided in the simulation. You will have plenty hours of free fun learning the plane's systems, flight characteristics and employing it's weapon systems successfully. A great plane to introduce new pilots or players to the simulation.			"

												There'a a lot to say about this game. Look for the TL;DR at the end.This is probably the best deal on Steam. You don't have to spend a dime and you get access to an increadiable game. It's a full blown simulator, so expect a decent learning curve, especially with the weapons and navigation systems, but the game comes with a full compliment of interactive tutorials. After a good Saturday of playing, I had a good handle on everything and could freely enjoy playing. Mastering those skills is something else entirely, but of course, part of the fun.Re-playability, for me this is probably the most important part of any game and for me, this game offers a lot of replayability, if your willing to put in some work. The game comes with a handful of missions, but the Mission Edditor allows you to create your own custom missions and it's a POWERFUL tool. Create a vast and complex mission or even campaign or a simple scenario for you to practice your shooting skills. If your savy, you can even use Lua to write your own scripts and really add complexity.You don't need additional hardware for this game, but a good flight-stick at the minimum will make the game a lot more fun. If you have some cash and want to get a HOTAS stick and throttle, that's probably the best way to go. I don't have one and don't plan on getting one and I'm quite happy with that. Certain actions take me a bit longer, because I have to hit CTL-ALT something.  TL;DR - If you're looking for a combat flight simulator, this is the best I know of. If you have some money to spend I highly recomend the A10-C add-on. Expect a decent learning curve with a high pay off. A lot of re-playability with the custom mission editor. Maybe get a flight stick.10/10			"

I have bought both the f-15c and a-10c (4.99$ and 9.99$ i think) dlcs and expected to get a full flight expeirience with each craft. the f-15c has no training missions which makes the craft absolutly worthless to me. the A-10 has a wonderful training program but they skimped out on any decent content campaing wise. thats only 2 of the 250$ worth of dlc and if they expect me to pay 49.99$ for a single plane they better ace the cheaper ones to show me what im getting. because of this the A-10 will be the only dlc ship i ever fly and my review went from one of praisal to one of disapiontment.""""""""""Reached 69 hours and got my first MP kill followed imediatly by my second... Followed imediatly by me spinning out of control due to excessive dive and improper nose trim adjustments.This Game is amazing. My review was at i time when i thought i understanded this game. I've logged a decent amount of time since then and fell in love with the Su27, and this flight simulator is absolutly fantastic. My advice is not to make rash judgments, take the time to learn everything properly and Multiplayer makes the game ( Although you will be blown up a lot ). Ask questions If you need help, obviously not everyone is willing to help but this game seems to have a fairly positive community.Also you can find a flight manual for the f-15 in the file location and there are plenty of tutorials on the web.

												This game is an absolute gem. DCS World is a true flight simulator that even incorporates modern AA and AG combat into it. I am absolutely positive that this is the best flight simulator made to date. Just to address one concern of others. When you download DCS, you recieve a free aircraft, the Su-25T (Frogfoot). It's a very capable aircraft and enjoyable to fly. Where people get upset is that there are lots of DLC module aircraft that you have to pay for. The thing people don't understand is that this game is made by a business and they have to make money. When they spend 3 years developing a module, a 2.99 price tag isn't going to cut it. The fact that they sell some of these for $10, especially with the low playerbase of the game is astounding. Instead of complaining that you have to pay for these aircraft, praise them for being so generous.EDIT: For some reason DCS only counts the time in game on my steam account as the time the game is launching. I really have at this time (30/09/16) approximately 230 hours.			"

												By far the greatest combat sim you can get your hands on. First module you should get is the A10C then get yourself the TM Warthog. Its the closest you'll get to flying the real thing.The A10C is one of the most complex aircraft in DCS. If you sort of know your way around the A10C the other modules become a lot easier to learn and figure out so its defintely a good module to start with and one of the cheapest.DCS takes time so if thats not your thing than its probably not for you. The manual for the A10C is 671 pages to give you an idea of how complex it is. This is the reason these aircraft are ""expensive"". You are basically flying the real thingI have a lot more than 83hrs as I dont use the Steam version			"

												Pros- possibly has more types of plane than any other military flight simulation- ok learning curve for flaming cliff package, you can get into dogfight in 1 hour- nice tutorial for most of the planesCons- no real dynamic campaign and the original campaign is not attractive enough, haven't tried the dlc campaigns though- mp gameplay is also a bit boring if you are flying solo, most of the mp servers are just simple dogfighting/ground attack without real missions and planningConclusionIt is a great simulator for military aircrafts, very precise and realistic reproduction of flying/weapons delivery procedure. But that's about all you should expect as a solo pilot, try to find friends and set up your own server for more indepth military air operation experience.			"

												This is the most awesome thing in the world since Fire&Beer and whoever doesn't play this 24/7 has NEVER lived!edit 23.12.2014; Been playing DCS:World now since 09/2012 and there hardly goes by a week I don't take time to fly for a few hours. Make no mistake, this is a flightsimulator at heart, no GAME. Even if there are planes with a very low learning curve, for the full 'DCS experience' you should read or watch the manual/tutorials.edit 01.07.2016: Still at it! With 1.5 & 2.0 we have lot's of new stuff. Best 2.0 feature: Collidable tree's!There are planes/helis for casuals, hardcore flightsim-nerds and of course newbies. If you want to fly the A-10C and still find new things to learn after two years (~600 pages manual) or a Su-25T where you can learn how to fly & kill stuff in a few minutes with a tutorial is completly up to you.WW2 era is progressing at a quick pace, at the time of writing there are two very active WW2 dedicated servers with fun& sometimes realistic scenarios although the allys are quite a little outgunned at the current point with only the P-51D Mustang, but that will change very soon.Don't expect any balancing to spare your feelings, if an engine is more powerful IRL it will be in DCS.I own all the current released DCS modules and promise you every full DCS module + FC3 is worth the money. No starforce DRM, buggy patch or delay development can destroy the immense fun I got out of this. This sim is the next  best experience to flying a plane RL we can get on the civillian market right now. X-plane/FSX/P3D have just inferior flight models and I have yet so see anyone of those do a comfortable 6dof-friendly & clickable cockpit like in DCS.Pro-Tip: You can fly the Su-25T & TF-51D for free! The latter is nearly exactly the same as the P-51D Mustang, only unarmed. With the Mustang you can really see what this Sim is about, Su-25T look what FC3 may be like.			"

												How to make a small community smaller! Tutorial by EDFor USA i think the price still the same. But gues what? Many of us don't live in USA.First: sell your game by modules. (With a fair and regional prices, just to increase your public)Second: Launch new modules with huge price difference in theses regions.Third: Increase the price of the oldest modules leveling all regions.Now watch the community splitting. People who complaim about the new price policy vs who dont care about.In Brasil 19 in 20 new pilots don't go forward because the high price on this hobby. But now we have the solution. Let's kill all possibilities to newcomers removing regional price.			"

DCS World: a great flying simulator, and it's FREE!I'll write down a fast review, because I haven't got much time to spend on this.I'm playing this game as my main flight sim. Is the game fun at the beginning? No, not really. At the start it was just frustrating. The commands are hard to learn, and not intuitive. I couldn't turn on the plane.Then I got it, and started playing. I liked it. So I went to the store and bought a flying joystick.Logitech Attack 3(fun fact: I bought it for CHF 5.- (€5 circa) NEW!)I bought the F-15C Eagle too. (not fun fact: I bought it and the same day it went 50% off. ♥♥♥♥ my life)It's a really good game, the physics are really realistic and playing with friends is fun! Formation flying and dogfights are really satisfying.Pros and consPros:-good graphics-good planes-good dedicated servers and community-physics are good!Cons:-learning curve-a really hard flight sim, don't bother downloading if you're not looking over to spend time on learning how to fly a planeFinal rating:Well, I rate it 9/10 'cause it's a really good sim overall.AS I SAID, let go of this game if you're not gonna invest time in learning it. It's not install&shoot. NOT. AN ARCADE. GAME.I've seen negative reviews saying ""too realistic"". Dumbasses downloading a flight SIMULATOR and whining about it being what it is supposed to be.EDIT 29/04/2016: The ""switching windows"" bug is gone, and now the interface is really smooth and good!

												Horrid support, sketchy missile dynamics, they ban people who show broken parts of the planes or the game itself, they updated steam regional prices which made it more expensive than normal currency exchange rate and when there is a problem between steam and dcs what they suggest is stop using steam. Why do you release it on steam if you are going to give no support for steam users I'm definitely not going to buy stuff out of their sketchy website which you get no support whatsoever.Don't mind my game hour as I've been forced to play it from standalone.

												The basic DCS World is not very exciting, but once you start adding the DLC aircraft then this quickly turns into one of the most amazing flight simulator I've played.I don't think it's very fun to try flying these aircraft with a mouse and keyboard, maybe if you enable ""Game Mode"". I own every DLC released to date but I mostly fly the UH-1 and the A-10C, using the Thrustmaster Warthog HOTAS joystick and throttle, the Saitek Pro Combat rudder pedals and TrackIR from NaturalPoint. Yes, that's a lot of gear (and advertisement), but the DLC cockpits are SO well made, it's amazing!Speaking of DLCs, this game does not feel like a DLC scam. The companies that have made the aircraft in the ""single aircraft"" DLCs have done amazing jobs. Fully interactive cockpits with ""six degrees of freedom"" movement (you can move in three dimentions inside the cockpit) make for a very immersive experience. The personal reward of being able to cold-start an A-10C, taxi to the runway, take off, navigate to your destination and safely land again is a great feeling!This is to WarThunder what Arma3 is to Battlefield; it's a step-up in realism for the ""gamers"" that are looking for more than bunny-jumping, headshots and ""lulz"".

												A few of my friends have been playing this for a while, and I've been dying to get it. I recently built a decent computer and decided to take the plunge into throwing hours of my life at the screen.  I bought the F-15 module just to try it out, and although disappointed the F-16 has not been modeled (Yet), the Eagle is a stellar combat platform. Coming from a background in civil aviation and being type rated on Cessna 172XP, I can vouch for how realistic the flight model feels. It really (to the extent that my controls can convey) feels like you are being buffeted by wind at low speeds, you can ""feel"" the aircraft as is starts to lose lift, and after a few hours you start being able to read the aircraft, when it is about to stall, the best roll to turn, AoA for climbing at the edge, you become one with the aircraft. Switching from one plane to another really throws your head for a loop. They've really got the effect of feeling what the aircraft is doing damn near perfect. I don't think even FSX models ground effect as realistically (read: scary as F***) as this game does. It truly is a simulation. Pull the stick back and cut the throttle, as the aircraft starts to shake and the wing starts to dip, adrenaline kicks in. It is unreal. I've never gotten such a physical response from a game before. The weight of the weapon and fuel payload is completely dynamic. I found myself flying touch-and-go landings for hours, working towards getting my glide slope and flare *just* right, only to restart and realize my pitch angles and approach speeds had to be entirely different from when I ended the last time, due to being fully loaded again. This is not a game you can pick up and start dominating in within a few minutes. You need to dedicate hours upon hours learning the airframe you want to excel in, and stick to it. It will frustrate you, it will make you never want to hold a flight stick again, but once you get your first kill, or the first time you successfully take on fuel from a flying tanker, the amount of excitement you feel is incredible. Getting sweaty palms from holding the aircraft perfectly in formation so as to not get a fuel boom in your turbine is great. Getting a radar contact at 80 miles, and have to watch his blip get closer and closer, until finally entering the weapon effective range had me on the edge of my seat. I find myself running through my last sortie in my head while I'm at work, thinking of what I could have done differently, better tactics to use, strategies to try. It is amazingly addicting.    I've logged 14 hours over the last few days, and I see myself putting in quite a few more late nights, flying hundreds of sorties. I haven't even delved into the online world yet. I am hesitant simply because I know there are thousands of people online who would make me look like I've never even flown a paper airplane before, and I don't want to make a fool of myself. Yet. :)I think the only downside to this simulator is quite simply how steep the learning curve is. I'm sure there will be quite a few people who can't take off, get angry and say this game is broken. Take it slow, do the lessons, and most importantly, READ THE MANUAL! Yeah, most of them are close to 200 pages, but like I said earlier, your first kill will make that completely worth it.I would highly suggest that if you are an aviation fanatic, like a challenge, and want to get as close as you can to pushing the throttles to the forward stop in a variety of combat aircraft without joining the military, get this game. I can only sit back and wonder how they are going to improve DCS:W in their second iteration, because from my perspective, the mechanics of it are spot on.			"

												This game is a great combat simulator! The best i've seen in years. This game will test your awareness and reaction to the combat enviornment. Some people might say , ""This game is hard , can't even learn how to fight."" To assure everyone , yes this game may seem hard , but if you learn how to play by learning start up processes for planes , and the different modes on every aircraft , in a week or a week and a half , you should be golden! It's worth getting in my opinion because this extremist enviornment filled with combat challenges me to the bone. You have to pay attention to fuel , radar contact , incoming missiles , BVR targets (Beyond Visual Range) , SAMS , and much more! Trust me , you wont regret getting this game.			"

												Amazing game a must have, If you love Fighter simulators then your in for a treat, it has a big learning curve to it, but all in good time and practice you become a great fighter10/10Edit:That was my past review I thought well now Ive gotten the gyst of it let re-review it. inb4 long♥♥♥♥♥read hope it helpsFirstly you do not need to have a HOTAS Joystick and Throttle or rudder pedals, its a bit more difficult but its still do able. The First im gonna say 50+ Hours I played with my Logitech Extreme 3D Pro $40 Joystick (I live in Australia), I played Su-25T, FC3 and Partially A-10C. I played them all comfortably the only thing that was needed was to remember more keybindings etc for the A-10c and Su-25T, FC3 all the important stuff was able to be bound to my joystick regardless the point is, for a free simulator that has a amazing engine and crazy realism to it all you need is $40 for a joystick and any extra money for modules and you can play. I bought the HOTAS Warthog around 60 hours into the game still dont have rudder pedals but thats fine I just use the 'Z' and 'X' keys thats it, if you love Military aircraft and you plan on enlisting one day then install this game, do it you wont regret it, if you love a challenge this is the game for you. To lay it out ill put some pros and cons below.Pros:- The SU-25T and PF-51 Mustang are Free- The best Military Aviation Simulator on the market- Aircraft are being added all the time for example Leatherneck Sims is working on a F-14 Tomcat model which is gonna be amazing- All eras of Aircraft from 40's all the way to current.- FC3 is more of a easier version but still in relation to the realism flight.- Plenty of Single Player missions and servers to play on.- Graphics are beautiful on this game as well as the sound.- Performance is good even in MP, I have a 8 year old GPU and a Quad core CPU and with come custom settings and Mirrors off I get in SP 40-60 FPS and in MP 30-40 FPS- If you buy it from the website or steam you can still play with eachotherCons:- It has a big learning curve- There are only a few tutorial missions for standalone modules, there is no Tutorials on FC3, F-86F, Hawk only to name a few.- SP missions do tend to bug out sometimes not all the time- In the same sense that it is cheap it is also expensive with each module going for about $40+- not all of the modules are on Steam, the ones on the DCS website are available on there for a while before it gets released on Steam. For example 14 out of the 17 available modules are available on Steam not including terrains or campaigns.- You need Rudder pedals for rotary aircraft I tried and wasn't able to fly without themSo in short this is a great simulator it has its cons but its so worth it for the pros of the game. Some advice if you are thinking about spending $500 on a HOTAS Warthog, ask your self this are you going to make Simming a hobby or is it going to sit on your desk and collect dust? Simming is a expensive hobby so unless your going to use it dont bother. If you want to try the game out use a cheap joystick like the 3D Pro, if you are going to play moderately grab yourself a X55 Rhino it has HOTAS Functionality and so I have heard its a good joystick, if you know you are going to sim a fair bit at least 3-4 times a week and put hours into the game get the HOTAS Warthog and some rudderpedals. Also if you see the modules F-15C, SU-27, SU-25 and A-10A for DCS dont bother they are $10 each they are all included in Flamming Cliffs 3 Module as well as the MIG-29A, MIG-29S and SU-33.So do I recommend the game to everyone? Yes give it a try you may like itFor aviation enthusiasts? Why haven't you already installed thisFor people who want to make simming a hobby? Go buy a HOTAS and modules to your likingI absolutely love this Simiulator and if you love Military Aircraft you will too, I hoped this long♥♥♥♥♥essay helped in your desicion.			"

I find myself running through my last sortie in my head while I'm at work, thinking of what I could have done differently, better tactics to use, strategies to try. It is amazingly addicting.    I've logged 14 hours over the last few days, and I see myself putting in quite a few more late nights, flying hundreds of sorties. I haven't even delved into the online world yet. I am hesitant simply because I know there are thousands of people online who would make me look like I've never even flown a paper airplane before, and I don't want to make a fool of myself. Yet. :)I think the only downside to this simulator is quite simply how steep the learning curve is. I'm sure there will be quite a few people who can't take off, get angry and say this game is broken. Take it slow, do the lessons, and most importantly, READ THE MANUAL! Yeah, most of them are close to 200 pages, but like I said earlier, your first kill will make that completely worth it.I would highly suggest that if you are an aviation fanatic, like a challenge, and want to get as close as you can to pushing the throttles to the forward stop in a variety of combat aircraft without joining the military, get this game. I can only sit back and wonder how they are going to improve DCS:W in their second iteration, because from my perspective, the mechanics of it are spot on.			"

												If you're looking for an arcade-y flight sim similar to Ace Combat or War Thunder, this isn't it. But if you're like me and you wanted a rich flying experience, DCS World brings that and much more to the table. I don't have nearly as many hours logged as some of the reviewers here but I can safely say that I'm hooked on this sim. In my opinion, the two must-have paid modules are Flaming Cliffs 3 and A-10C. FC3 is the bridge between the ""arcade"" and pure simulation aspects of DCS World, though it's by no means an arcade game at all. My preferred aircraft in FC3, the F-15, still requires a good deal of practice to get used to flying and fighting in, but once you have developed some proficiency with it, it's fantastic. It's always satisfying to go head-to-head with human opponents and actually have to work in order to get a kill.On the other hand, the A-10C is pure simulation. There's a lot of buttons and switches to learn, but if you do the training missions, you'll have a good foundation to work with. Do them a couple of times just to be sure you have a basic knowledge of what to do in certain situations and with certain weapons and flight systems.A couple of caveats: you can get a basic flight stick, but a HOTAS (Hands On Throttle And Stick) is highly recommended. I use a Saitek X55 (which has its own interesting quirks but I digress) but there are some others out there on the market. If money's no object, I'd recommend the Thrustmaster Warthog. Whichever you choose, make sure the stick and throttle have buttons for you to bind some of the critical controls to (landing gear, airbrakes, countermeasures, etc.) The last thing you want to be doing in a dogfight is taking your hands off the throttle and stick to mash buttons on the keyboard to deploy chaff or flares.Having some sort of headtracking peripheral wil also go a long way to improving how immersed you are in the sim. It can be a bit of a pain having to use the mouse to look for enemies, especially if you're in an air-to-air fight. Another example is in A-10C, during a cold start, there's a couple of switches behind the throttle that you have to flip. These are normally obscured from the default viewing position, but if you have a TrackIR or something similar, you can ""lean"" down, see, and flip them accordingly. That said, DCS World is probably my absolute favorite game across the board. There's always something to do. You just have to be willing to put in the time to learn to fly.			"

												It is an amazing simulator, probably the best one out there. I bought the Flaming Cliffs 3 Addon so far and it is tons of joy, it is quite a bit challenging to learn the ropes if you are new to simulators (like I am) but once you get into it, you'll have a lot of fun.   Russian and American planes both have different avionics, making them feel different (and as such you have to learn to use both separately). Still trying to get used to the radar, but locking on and firing with missiles is piece of cake once you learn how to (watching the tutorials for both russians and americans twice did the trick for me).So, all in all, if you are looking for a very realistic simulator, definitely give this one a shot because the basic game is free and has the Su-25 and the TF-51 in it, which by themselves already offer a lot of fun, and from there you can decide whether you want to get into the game more.P.S. If you ever see me in a multiplayer game (I still have yet to play it), go easy on me. I'll most likely be an easy target for you anyways :P			"

												This is a Sim not for those who simply want to jump in and fly arcade style.On my computer I can only run it at MEDIUM settings and get arroung 17 - 20 FPS  it's playable but I've only played free flight and some of the training, so not sure how it would go with more happening.My specs:Windows 7 Home Premium (64bit)SP1Intel Core i7-2670QMCPU @ 2.20GHz, 16GB Ram, Nvidia GTX 560M 2GBI have a few bugs when I first try to load it up it tends to freeze running 'Task Manager' (CTRL ALT DEL) then going back into the game without closing it down seems to get things going.I have no idea why that works.There is a very large learning curve involved here with so many keyborad combinations and my old Microsoft Sidewinder joystick really is not up to the task, if you are serious about this sim you will need a decent joystick to fly with.Personally I enjoy games that are much simpler to fly IE Wings Of Prey but that is just me.I can see there is a lot of entertainment to be had with DCS,  especially if you team up with some friends.In conlusion.  Yes it's a great game. Lots to remember, decent computer to play a full graphics.Will I play it? Most likely not. To much else around offering the simpler game play I enjoy.			"

												I had not plaied any flight sim games in some years, until last week. My freind was talking about DCS, and being free I figured Id give it a try. Hands down the best flight sim I have ever plaied, and it has brought back the love I have for avaition. 10/10I will say  however it is not for thoses who want the casual flying of a jumbo jet, or island hopper. Even the simplified planes require a good amount of practice with, and tweaking of controls to fly well, and operate well in combat. The ""full"" sim planes are a blast to figure out and when you get it right you feel like you acomplished something. The ""simple"" planes give you the ability to get into combat faster since you do not have to spend all your time just geting an engine started, or maintaining settings while in flight. If you are looking for a real combat flight sim, this is it. ""It's just plane awesome!""			"

												Hugely detailed sim, can't stress it enough how much I'm in love with the DCS series of aircraft simulators thus far. The advanced flight model aircraft with fully functional cockpits are about as close to the real thing as you can get without actual military sim equipment. And ED along with other 3rd party devs are continually releasing new aircraft to build more possibilities for the game and it's multiplayer. And having this single platform bring all previous and upcoming sims into one environment is genius.And the base platform comes with two free sims, a Su-25T (rivals A-10 Warthog with it's massive arsenal, it's powerful and easily capable to be able to hop right into multiplayer without spending a dime) and a trainer version of the P-51D, for aerobatic fun.Note that this pretty much expects you to have a joystick, don't expect to play on a keyboard, unless you buy the Combined Arms pack that lets you take control of vehicles and fight it out on the ground.Absolutely no reason not to give it a try. Unless you hate planes or something. But what kind of monstrous, awful person actually hates planes			"

												If you are keen on flight sims then DCS World is a must have.  I'm interested in WW2 aviation and enjoy the DCS experience.  If you are new to flight sims and want to try a ""propellor"" sim I would recommend ""il2 Battle of Stalingrad"" before trying DCS.  DCS would probably be too over-whelming for the first time flight sim player.  BOS would give a more satisfying experience.But for the flight sim grognard there is a lot to like about DCS.  Fully clickable cockpits, very nice flight model, competitive AI and the option of jets.  Plus DCS WW2 is coming soon.Good support on the DCS forums.			"

You really have to know how to fly and navigate or this is not the Combat SIM for you. Others who compare this to ARMA3 or other arcade games need to get a life. This is a Combat Sim not a XboX Controller game. There is very steep learning curve and you really need to RTFM and do the Training missons to know how to use everything in the aircraft. I fly the A-10C, KA-50, and Huey alot. I do have many years of Flight Sim experience so flying them is no issue with me.

												This game is simply amazing. I found this game browsing Steam and decided to give it a try. Given that the SU-25T module is free, I figured that it would be low quality and very limited in its playability. The complete opposite is true! The plane proved a pleasure to fly and I thoroughly enjoyed the challenge offered in mastering the plane. The first time I was able to take off from an airfield, find a tank convoy, attack it successfully, and return to base, I was sold. The game sucked me in and I knew I had to buy some new modules. I decided on the A-10A, F-15C, and SU-27 modules. The planes are beautifully modeled and each one offers a unique approach to their specific role. Although the learning curve is steep (especially steep for the A-10C, I hear), the reward of mastering an aircraft is unmatchable in comparison to any other game I've ever played. The game offers fantastic gameplay for those who are into heavy ground-pounding aircraft like the A-10 or SU-25 and for those of us who dream of being the Top Gun and dominating the sky. I haven't tried any of the helicopter modules, but they're next on my list. Those looking for a challenging game and are military jet fans should definitely try this game. 10/10!			"

												This game is a great combat simulator! The best i've seen in years. This game will test your awareness and reaction to the combat enviornment. Some people might say , ""This game is hard , can't even learn how to fight."" To assure everyone , yes this game may seem hard , but if you learn how to play by learning start up processes for planes , and the different modes on every aircraft , in a week or a week and a half , you should be golden! It's worth getting in my opinion because this extremist enviornment filled with combat challenges me to the bone. You have to pay attention to fuel , radar contact , incoming missiles , BVR targets (Beyond Visual Range) , SAMS , and much more! Trust me , you wont regret getting this game.			"

												Amazing game a must have, If you love Fighter simulators then your in for a treat, it has a big learning curve to it, but all in good time and practice you become a great fighter10/10Edit:That was my past review I thought well now Ive gotten the gyst of it let re-review it. inb4 long♥♥♥♥♥read hope it helpsFirstly you do not need to have a HOTAS Joystick and Throttle or rudder pedals, its a bit more difficult but its still do able. The First im gonna say 50+ Hours I played with my Logitech Extreme 3D Pro $40 Joystick (I live in Australia), I played Su-25T, FC3 and Partially A-10C. I played them all comfortably the only thing that was needed was to remember more keybindings etc for the A-10c and Su-25T, FC3 all the important stuff was able to be bound to my joystick regardless the point is, for a free simulator that has a amazing engine and crazy realism to it all you need is $40 for a joystick and any extra money for modules and you can play. I bought the HOTAS Warthog around 60 hours into the game still dont have rudder pedals but thats fine I just use the 'Z' and 'X' keys thats it, if you love Military aircraft and you plan on enlisting one day then install this game, do it you wont regret it, if you love a challenge this is the game for you. To lay it out ill put some pros and cons below.Pros:- The SU-25T and PF-51 Mustang are Free- The best Military Aviation Simulator on the market- Aircraft are being added all the time for example Leatherneck Sims is working on a F-14 Tomcat model which is gonna be amazing- All eras of Aircraft from 40's all the way to current.- FC3 is more of a easier version but still in relation to the realism flight.- Plenty of Single Player missions and servers to play on.- Graphics are beautiful on this game as well as the sound.- Performance is good even in MP, I have a 8 year old GPU and a Quad core CPU and with come custom settings and Mirrors off I get in SP 40-60 FPS and in MP 30-40 FPS- If you buy it from the website or steam you can still play with eachotherCons:- It has a big learning curve- There are only a few tutorial missions for standalone modules, there is no Tutorials on FC3, F-86F, Hawk only to name a few.- SP missions do tend to bug out sometimes not all the time- In the same sense that it is cheap it is also expensive with each module going for about $40+- not all of the modules are on Steam, the ones on the DCS website are available on there for a while before it gets released on Steam. For example 14 out of the 17 available modules are available on Steam not including terrains or campaigns.- You need Rudder pedals for rotary aircraft I tried and wasn't able to fly without themSo in short this is a great simulator it has its cons but its so worth it for the pros of the game. Some advice if you are thinking about spending $500 on a HOTAS Warthog, ask your self this are you going to make Simming a hobby or is it going to sit on your desk and collect dust? Simming is a expensive hobby so unless your going to use it dont bother. If you want to try the game out use a cheap joystick like the 3D Pro, if you are going to play moderately grab yourself a X55 Rhino it has HOTAS Functionality and so I have heard its a good joystick, if you know you are going to sim a fair bit at least 3-4 times a week and put hours into the game get the HOTAS Warthog and some rudderpedals. Also if you see the modules F-15C, SU-27, SU-25 and A-10A for DCS dont bother they are $10 each they are all included in Flamming Cliffs 3 Module as well as the MIG-29A, MIG-29S and SU-33.So do I recommend the game to everyone? Yes give it a try you may like itFor aviation enthusiasts? Why haven't you already installed thisFor people who want to make simming a hobby? Go buy a HOTAS and modules to your likingI absolutely love this Simiulator and if you love Military Aircraft you will too, I hoped this long♥♥♥♥♥essay helped in your desicion.			"

												This is THE BEST combat sim I've ever played. The realism is outstanding and it's fun to play over and over. The amount of variables that can be controlled is almost overwhelming at first, but in a good way. The whole setup allows for a whole lot of freedom to plan an attack or a counter attack or to pretty much fight the enemy anyway you want. I really can't wait to see what they have coming in the future. It's hard to find a game that I truly get excited about these days but this is definitely one of them. They even have aerial refueling. Man is it hard but that's part of the fun. The only issue I have, and it's not really about the game design itself, is that I wish there were more American combat aircraft. I hope it's in the works but I'd really like to fly an AH-64 on a sortie in the Middle East or fly an F-22 and bomb the crap out of ISIS. There really is almost an unlimited amount of expansion as the creators didn't box themselves in with this game. The game is totally outstanding, even for Russians. :) :) (BTW that's why there are so many Russian aircraft)			"

You have a feeling that it wants to be as realistic as possible and it definitily is. That's why it's pretty much complex and hard to get your hands on a plane and it gets even worse if you wanna handle it properly. But If you are into aeronautics like I'm, this part is gonna be a lot of fun. It's just like you would learn to fly the real thing. Killing your first target, no matter if it's an air- or a ground-target is very satisfying and rewarding.			"

												Great flight sim that involves combat aircraft. If you're curious about flying and if you'd like something like this DCS being free is a great point to give it a shot. You're only able to fly the SU-25T which is a clunky russian jet, and the TF-51D which is an unarmed version of the P-51. Any other aircraft you'll find yourself having to pay for them to be able to fly; but they are very much so worth the money. They painstakingly recreate these aircraft with all of the bells and whistles of the real deal, down to the weapon loadouts, the systems on the aircraft and even the instrument panels are accurate to the real deal and if you so choose you can click the switches and simulate pressing them yourself rather than pressing a keybind on your keyboard.Controllers/joysticks are easy to configure and the mission editor lets you configure custom missions to fly as well as the multiplayer is fun. If flying is your thing, or could be your thing definatly give DCS a shot.			"

												Amazing Sim. With so many modules available and more coming this game is fantastic. The realism is amazing and once you get more familiarized with the controls and settings you can easily spend countless hours flying. Recently picked up the A-10C Warthog module and it is absolutely incredible. The realism and immersion is through the roof with total control in the cockpit of pretty much every switch / knob / dial and button.  I'm looking forward to and hoping for an F-18 module that has the same kind of control and realism in the future as that is one of my favorite aircraft of all time. Can't wait to see what they make next!Edit* 3/23/15Still flying in this amazing sim. With DCS 2.0 (hopefully) around the corner, it just keeps getting better! Picked up the F-86, MiG21BiS, FW-190D, P-51 and FC3 which includes the F-15 and Su-27 advanced flight models and still having a blast with it. Hoping that a sale comes soon on steam so I can get the rest of the ones I'm missing.Mission editor = countless ways to enjoy the sim and get better at flying in different roles/situations. Great Devs/community that keep the spirit alive and lots of resources out there to educate yourself in the ways of military aviation.  KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!!!			"

												One of the few recent flight simulators on Steam that is, well, actually a flight simulator. And a good one at that. If you have an attention span, enjoy rewarding, but grugingly difficult gameplay, and want to feel like a pilot, or simply want to fly around the Black Sea in one of the 2 free planes that it comes with, it's worth trying. Unless your computer can't handle it, there are few reasons not to play this game.			"

												If you're looking for an arcade-y flight sim similar to Ace Combat or War Thunder, this isn't it. But if you're like me and you wanted a rich flying experience, DCS World brings that and much more to the table. I don't have nearly as many hours logged as some of the reviewers here but I can safely say that I'm hooked on this sim. In my opinion, the two must-have paid modules are Flaming Cliffs 3 and A-10C. FC3 is the bridge between the ""arcade"" and pure simulation aspects of DCS World, though it's by no means an arcade game at all. My preferred aircraft in FC3, the F-15, still requires a good deal of practice to get used to flying and fighting in, but once you have developed some proficiency with it, it's fantastic. It's always satisfying to go head-to-head with human opponents and actually have to work in order to get a kill.On the other hand, the A-10C is pure simulation. There's a lot of buttons and switches to learn, but if you do the training missions, you'll have a good foundation to work with. Do them a couple of times just to be sure you have a basic knowledge of what to do in certain situations and with certain weapons and flight systems.A couple of caveats: you can get a basic flight stick, but a HOTAS (Hands On Throttle And Stick) is highly recommended. I use a Saitek X55 (which has its own interesting quirks but I digress) but there are some others out there on the market. If money's no object, I'd recommend the Thrustmaster Warthog. Whichever you choose, make sure the stick and throttle have buttons for you to bind some of the critical controls to (landing gear, airbrakes, countermeasures, etc.) The last thing you want to be doing in a dogfight is taking your hands off the throttle and stick to mash buttons on the keyboard to deploy chaff or flares.Having some sort of headtracking peripheral wil also go a long way to improving how immersed you are in the sim. It can be a bit of a pain having to use the mouse to look for enemies, especially if you're in an air-to-air fight. Another example is in A-10C, during a cold start, there's a couple of switches behind the throttle that you have to flip. These are normally obscured from the default viewing position, but if you have a TrackIR or something similar, you can ""lean"" down, see, and flip them accordingly. That said, DCS World is probably my absolute favorite game across the board. There's always something to do. You just have to be willing to put in the time to learn to fly.			"

												Amazing game a must have, If you love Fighter simulators then your in for a treat, it has a big learning curve to it, but all in good time and practice you become a great fighter10/10Edit:That was my past review I thought well now Ive gotten the gyst of it let re-review it. inb4 long♥♥♥♥♥read hope it helpsFirstly you do not need to have a HOTAS Joystick and Throttle or rudder pedals, its a bit more difficult but its still do able. The First im gonna say 50+ Hours I played with my Logitech Extreme 3D Pro $40 Joystick (I live in Australia), I played Su-25T, FC3 and Partially A-10C. I played them all comfortably the only thing that was needed was to remember more keybindings etc for the A-10c and Su-25T, FC3 all the important stuff was able to be bound to my joystick regardless the point is, for a free simulator that has a amazing engine and crazy realism to it all you need is $40 for a joystick and any extra money for modules and you can play. I bought the HOTAS Warthog around 60 hours into the game still dont have rudder pedals but thats fine I just use the 'Z' and 'X' keys thats it, if you love Military aircraft and you plan on enlisting one day then install this game, do it you wont regret it, if you love a challenge this is the game for you. To lay it out ill put some pros and cons below.Pros:- The SU-25T and PF-51 Mustang are Free- The best Military Aviation Simulator on the market- Aircraft are being added all the time for example Leatherneck Sims is working on a F-14 Tomcat model which is gonna be amazing- All eras of Aircraft from 40's all the way to current.- FC3 is more of a easier version but still in relation to the realism flight.- Plenty of Single Player missions and servers to play on.- Graphics are beautiful on this game as well as the sound.- Performance is good even in MP, I have a 8 year old GPU and a Quad core CPU and with come custom settings and Mirrors off I get in SP 40-60 FPS and in MP 30-40 FPS- If you buy it from the website or steam you can still play with eachotherCons:- It has a big learning curve- There are only a few tutorial missions for standalone modules, there is no Tutorials on FC3, F-86F, Hawk only to name a few.- SP missions do tend to bug out sometimes not all the time- In the same sense that it is cheap it is also expensive with each module going for about $40+- not all of the modules are on Steam, the ones on the DCS website are available on there for a while before it gets released on Steam. For example 14 out of the 17 available modules are available on Steam not including terrains or campaigns.- You need Rudder pedals for rotary aircraft I tried and wasn't able to fly without themSo in short this is a great simulator it has its cons but its so worth it for the pros of the game. Some advice if you are thinking about spending $500 on a HOTAS Warthog, ask your self this are you going to make Simming a hobby or is it going to sit on your desk and collect dust? Simming is a expensive hobby so unless your going to use it dont bother. If you want to try the game out use a cheap joystick like the 3D Pro, if you are going to play moderately grab yourself a X55 Rhino it has HOTAS Functionality and so I have heard its a good joystick, if you know you are going to sim a fair bit at least 3-4 times a week and put hours into the game get the HOTAS Warthog and some rudderpedals. Also if you see the modules F-15C, SU-27, SU-25 and A-10A for DCS dont bother they are $10 each they are all included in Flamming Cliffs 3 Module as well as the MIG-29A, MIG-29S and SU-33.So do I recommend the game to everyone? Yes give it a try you may like itFor aviation enthusiasts? Why haven't you already installed thisFor people who want to make simming a hobby? Go buy a HOTAS and modules to your likingI absolutely love this Simiulator and if you love Military Aircraft you will too, I hoped this long♥♥♥♥♥essay helped in your desicion.			"

												If you have a Rift CV1, you need to try this sim out. One of the best VR experiences to date. With a HOTAS and rudder controls, it's out of this world. Be sure to set the display settings in the game's display options to the VR preset, otherwise you may experience some frame stuttering issues when you move your head around. Not only is the VR experience great, but the simulation physics and flight feel great. Haven't seen a flight sim this good since Falcon 4.0 or FSX.			"

												DCS World 8/10     -OverallExpensive to some as you pay for individual aircraft. (Wait for sales to buy them)Amazing detailed aircraft in and out. Very technical, expect to do alot of reading or video watching to learn to operate all the systems in these aircraft.Joystick is a must for control, more so for heli's.     -Graphics Fairly typical of most modern simulator games these days but its More about the gameplay with DCS.Cockpit detail, and distant outside world looks good. Close up however trees and other objects are limited in detail.Again this game is more Simulator than eye candy.     -GameplayA game you will have to put some effort into to enjoyA learning curve for most.Amazing attention to detail. (eg very realistic wobble during intial rotor spinup on heli's)For true simulation lovers only.Have another device handy for looking stuff up.     -PerformanceDCS will push machines to get decent FPS with high or ultra settings.

												If your into SERIOUS combat flight sims you will LOVE this game!  That said...if you like the ""pick up and play"" style of flying games you will not like this.  You actually have to spend time with the manual and watching youtube vids to learn the systems of these aircraft to be effective in DCS.  It will take some time and effort....but theirs a huge feeling of satisfaction once you can command these aircraft effectively.  You feel like your in command of a real military war machine with all of its systems at your finger tips. There is a  game mode setting in DCS that simplifies everything to ""pick up and play"" style of simplicity. It makes the flight physics alot less realistic...and basically turns DCS into ""Ace Combat"" style of gameplay. Keep in mind every online multiplayer server thats worth anything (full of player)s to play competitvely DO NOT ALLOW ""game mode"". If your not playing DCS in full simulation mode then you will find it very difficult to play online.  All the most popular multiplayer servers ban ""game mode""....even some of the more trivial game options are not allowed.			"

												This game is for everyone who likes fighter aircraft and wants a good (not perfect) simulation. In the base game you only get 2 planes so I would recommend purchasing a DLC (Flaming Cliffs for example) if you enjoy the game. The game also comes with a mission editor which is very detailed but still not to difficult to use. If you aren't sure if you should get this game you can give it a try anyway it´s FTP after all.

												This is probably the best combat flight sim ever made.  It's not a ""game,"" although it is a whole lot of fun.  It takes time and effort to learn the aircraft and their systems, but it's very rewarding to get to the point where you can take off on a multiplayer server and actually be combat-effective.If you're on the fence, I'd recommend starting off with the SU-25T (the free Russian attack aircraft).  The cockpit and HUD are in Russian, but with the manual, youtube videos and google, it isn't too bad.			"

												Bellissimo simulatore.Preso da poco, con DLC Su-27, dopo avere giocato con l'unico aereo disponibile nella versione free, forse la prima volta era ancora più spartano come simulatore, insomma non era preciso come adesso dopo gli ultimi aggiornamenti, ora sembra più reale, gli effetti G, le armi sono prefettamente simulati, dipende da come si imposta il simulatore dalle opzioni di gioco, la grafica risulta più dettagliata e più fluida, insomma fa più FPS di prima, ora e molto più giocabile, nella prima versione la grafica era un mattone, metteva in difficoltà pure una HD 7950 all'epoca, ora gira benissimo con dettagli al massimo su una R9 280X equivalente di una vecchia HD 7970 Ati, essendo un simulatore richiede una buona CPU minimo un quad core 4 GHz e 8 giga di ram, AMD o Intel.

												 This review is many years in the making. I got involved and DCS about five years ago, but just with in the last year I have gotten more serious in learning some of the aircraft I have purchased over the years.   It's takes time and patience to learn each individual aircraft.   You need to study manuals, and you need to do your own research.  I started with the A-10C but have become extremely attached to the BF109 K4 lately and spend most of my time dogfighting online.  This is by far the best sim out there, nothing compares.  Xplane 11 is a clunker compared to this game. (I own Xplane 11) I have purchased several modules on steam but I play the game via the most up to date version off of the DCS website and I also use 2.0 with the Nevada map.  Looking forward to the new Normandy map!  Love this game, well worth the $500 or so I have invested so far plus justified a 970 GTX purchase a couple years ago.  See you in the skies!

												The best military flight simulator out there. But as many negative reviews show: this is not a game. It is a study sim with some gameplay elements on top. I started playing a few weeks ago and I greatly enjoy it. You will enjoy DCS World if:- you want to learn about aviation and want to understand how real military aircraft work- you enjoy reading 600+ page technical manuals, forums and wikipedia pages- you enjoy spending hours watching tutorial videos on youtube- you own a HOTAS, TrackIR and can memorize a lot of keyboard shortcuts- you have a lot of spare time - you enjoy steep learning curvesPersonally I love the experience. I currently have about 40 hours of game time logged (and have spent at least twice as much time reading manuals and watching tutorials). Yet I feel that I still have so much more to learn. It is awesome. I would definitely recommend DCS World (and especially the A-10C DLC) to people who know what they are getting themselves into. If you are looking for a relaxing game where you can jump into an airplane and shoot things, better look somewhere else.			"

												An amazing Flight sim, not for the casual gamer I would suggest but for players who want to spend all the momey into getting a top notch flight sim and like some other top flight sims out there some body looking to spend the money time efort into learning how to fly weather it it is recreational flying, bush planes or working your way up to flying for an airline, I myself am a real world pilot and been flying bush planes for 20 plus years now, And I am always on the look for a top notch flying sim to keep logging hours in different type of situations I might find myself in my own plane getting into and being prepared for the worst case scenario possiable and to not panic when I have cargo or customers on board that are relying on me to get them to there destinations and back safely, And also enjoy sitting back in my flight seat and picking all sorts of air planes from a twin otter to a 747 and flying from a point of intrest maybe half way around the world to another place or airport that seems intresting, If you are a serious flight simmer I would recommend this to all and the great add ons it has to offer plus the many other top notch flight sims out there, So sit back and enjoy the thrill.

												If you're into combat flight simulators look no further. DCS offers a chance to step into a legendry aircraft with unparalleled precision and accuracy true to its original design. Granted you may be reading a book for about a month until you're at a minimum proficiency with the aircraft but the payoff is worth it. The sense of achievement that you get when you learn any of these aircraft is amazing as it's not just a case of pumping the throttle to maximum to take off like other plane games. The future is very bright for this simulator as it is ever growing with more developers creating different aircraft for different theatres of war i.e. WWII / Korea / 80's/ Modern.			"

												If you're a fan of Flight Simulation and you're looking for a thrilling combat experience, then DCS is the one you should choose. No other software would be able to provide you more realism and get you closer to what a fighter pilot really feels aboard those powerful machines. The numerous controls are hard to handle at first and I recommend you to read the flight manuals to familiarize yourself with the numerous instruments available to you. The tutorials are too basic and don't allow you to put in practice what you've just learned as they are just a bunch of videos. So the flight manuals are really not a luxury you should pass. Dont worry they are free but It would take some hours to read it all as it's pretty consistent.On a personal note I'm not pushing for gender equality but if you could add a female voice for the pilot I would gladly appreciate that. ;) "

												This is a highly detailed SIMULATOR more then a game. if you want the simples of cockpits then the FC3 is where it is at with the F-15 or SU-27 and A-10A, if you want that full on clickable cockpit then the other modules is where its at but there is a large learning curve like about as close to learning to fly/operate the real thing as  you can get.

												If you're a fan of Flight Simulation and you're looking for a thrilling combat experience, then DCS is the one you should choose. No other software would be able to provide you more realism and get you closer to what a fighter pilot really feels aboard those powerful machines. The numerous controls are hard to handle at first and I recommend you to read the flight manuals to familiarize yourself with the numerous instruments available to you. The tutorials are too basic and don't allow you to put in practice what you've just learned as they are just a bunch of videos. So the flight manuals are really not a luxury you should pass. Dont worry they are free but It would take some hours to read it all as it's pretty consistent.On a personal note I'm not pushing for gender equality but if you could add a female voice for the pilot I would gladly appreciate that. ;) "

												This game is really fun to play with some of the DLC's.If you like simulation games, or realism shooters, that kind of stuff this is a game for you!It has the most realistic simulation in flying fighter jets by far.It also has this for helicopters and other vehicle's.You will get emersed into the game and have a great time with friends.It has some downside's like all games and for me they are:If you do not know anything about planes or helicopters and stuff, don't buy it unless you want to learn, this game is alot about learning new things.If you do not have a joystick, defenetly don't buy it, unless you are getting one, it's pretty much unplayable without a joystick. and i mean to get the full simulation you need atleast a joystickIt can get a little hard remembering all the keybindings, and you might need to print out some pre flight check manuals, or just startup manuals if you are new cause its a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to alt+tab this game.Overall its a really fun game and best flight simulator i've played so far.

												If your into SERIOUS combat flight sims you will LOVE this game!  That said...if you like the ""pick up and play"" style of flying games you will not like this.  You actually have to spend time with the manual and watching youtube vids to learn the systems of these aircraft to be effective in DCS.  It will take some time and effort....but theirs a huge feeling of satisfaction once you can command these aircraft effectively.  You feel like your in command of a real military war machine with all of its systems at your finger tips. There is a  game mode setting in DCS that simplifies everything to ""pick up and play"" style of simplicity. It makes the flight physics alot less realistic...and basically turns DCS into ""Ace Combat"" style of gameplay. Keep in mind every online multiplayer server thats worth anything (full of player)s to play competitvely DO NOT ALLOW ""game mode"". If your not playing DCS in full simulation mode then you will find it very difficult to play online.  All the most popular multiplayer servers ban ""game mode""....even some of the more trivial game options are not allowed.			"

												The worst thing about this game are the prices for the more in-depth cockpits, but most likely if you spend that much on them in the first place, it will be very worth it. DCS is nothing short of amazing. It feels awesome to fly the planes, the learning curve is there, but after a few days, it's all down and good. The planes have weight to them, and even the simplest of maneuvers and procedures can't be done by just jumping in and acting like you know what you're doing.If you aren't an experienced pilot, no worries. You can start with circling airfields and landing at others, move onto some strafing runs, go to bombings, SEAD, and by then, you'll probably have purchased FC3.Speaking of FC3, researching the expansion will likely tell you that you need the others, which isn't true anymore. It's an awesome expansion for learning to fly. FC3 is basically the bridge between the SU-25 and aircraft like the A-10C.It's a great game, and it's free to start off. If you like aircraft, whether it be FSX, ArmA, IL-2, or any other simulator, you will like this game.*Also, even though the photos show the SU-24, and some other planes, you cannot fly any planes that aren't A). the SU-25T, or B). listed in a DLC.*			"

												For those who hate the easy life and simple routine of classic military-based games, get this ""I'll ♥♥♥♥ you up as fast as I can"" simulator. Seriously. It's hard, you'll need time to learn which button does what and which light means what, and when you think you can fly, it will shoot missiles at you. I'ts exactly like a girlfrend.I started like ""meh, I'll give it a try"", and now I'm like ""MUST. BUY. EVERY. MODULE.""; it's one of the most rewarding games you'll ever play, get it now, you'll thank me later.However I recommend to use the non-steam version, where modules and beta updates come first.Little downside is the absence of dedicated servers, so expect a bit of lag sometimes.

												I downloaded this game just because it was free, then not two weeks later bought the X55 HOTAS just for this game, and I have to say, money well spent with almost 120 hours logged now. (Most of my time is offline)UPDATE: At over 220+ hours spent in this game I have learned so much. Days and days spent reading manuals and pretty muvh studying how to properly use different aircraft in different scenarios. After a while though Single Player had gotten a bit stale, so I decided to join a Fighter Wing (Pretty much a clan) and I have not been happier. Flying alongside other people in an organised fassion has truly shown me what this kind of game can become. I do not regret a single second that I have spent on this game, and do not plan on stopping any time soon10/10 for me			"

												I have played this game quite a bit. This game is very detailed in ariel combat. This is a learning simulator so if you have the patience to take time to learn the plane that you would like to learn than this game is for you. The detail in the planes is so amazing! The one plane that I instantly fell inlove with was the A-10 Worthog. I really like this plane because you have to turn on the engines like if you would on the actual plane and thats not all. You also need to learn how to use the weapons system and radar systems just that are exactly how the plane is used in realy life!Anyways this game is a really fun game if you are into combat simulators.

												Very, very realistic and detailed flight simulator. Been playing it for about 2-3 years, just recently got it on Steam. I recommend most people to at least try this game, as its free and you get the SU-25 to start with, which is actually really fun to fly after you learn it. If your not a big, ""Flight - Simmer"", you can always get the Flaming Cliff 3 pack, which is more arcadey. This is by far on my top 3 favorite simulators list. Always a joy to play and have fun in. If you end up trying the game, I highly recommend a joystick, or else it wont be as fun. Track IR as well, but only invest in that stuff if you really enjoy the sim.10/10, Excellent Simulator!			"

												As a simulator, the fidelity is amazing. Everything is reconstituted in game from the tiniest details in the cockpit to the slightest nuances in aircraft behavior. Even compared to other simulators on the market, DCS is top-notch and possibly the only modern simulator to allow modern-day air-to-air combat in addition to a decent selection of older jets ranging from the skies of Vietnam, Korea and WWII.Pros:- Beautiful graphics- Supremely realistic- Good selection of aircraft- Good selection of single player modes, campaigns, and settings- Relatively healthy multiplayerCons:- Somewhat hard to get into for beginners- Not all aircraft have a tutorial section- High cost of individual aircraft- Modern air-superiority jets basically require TrackIR or equivalent to efficiently operate the off-bore sights			"

												A true flight sim for any pilot enthusiest, especially if you are considering a military career. this isn't a game that u just jump into and expect to start flying. you need a basic understanding of flight instruments. if u get an add-on with a clickable cockpit, you will have to spend hours going through the training courses just to know how to start and operate the aircraft systems. you really cannot claim to master any aircraft without putting at least the standard of 40 flight hours into each aircraft. The sense of accomplishment as u struggle with one apect, then turn it into an easy task, is what keeps me playing. When u get that perfect 3-point touchdown with the p-51, then start doing it over and over, u really feel like its a major acheivement. At this point, i only have 50 hours on the game, and i still feel like a noob. im very confident with the p-51 now and ill be going into the A-10 add-on next. As to physics, i cannot say whether they are absolutely realistic or not, but i am highly impressed. If u put the time into the game and really try to learn how to fly, thats when u get the entertainment factor out of it. It greatly helps to buy a dlc with clickable cockpit also and i will tell any pilot enthusiest to get this game. "

												Absolutely the best flight experience available on the PC.Here are some considerations:-It is a *simulator,* don't expect an arcade experience, even in the simple flight modes.-Combat is very real, and therefore very difficult.  Success is very satisfying, but be willing to take the time to learn how to succeed.-Despite some reviews the platform is exceptionally stable and functional, but the user interface is not intuitive (that's to be expected considering the scope of the simulation).  Again, it will take some time to learn.-Multiplayer is super fun, but know that it's a session-based environment, not open world.-Some modules (aircraft) will offer more content and detail than others, so do a little research before you purchase, and only purchase aircraft you are genuinely interested in flying.If you're a fan of aviation simulations, patient, and willing to learn, you will thoroughly enjoy your experience with DCS world.

												The two free aircraft that you get are very fun to fly, and decent to introduce the game to you. This is a combat flight simulator with a command element to give the ground units more realism. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in aviation, or flying aircraft. This game does have a slightly steep learning curve, but that is countered by video tutorials available at the main menu of the game. I highly recommend that you visit the developers website, and download a copy of the checklist for the aircraft that you wish to fly. Then print it out and keep it handy, or download it to a tablet. The graphics are not bad for a flight simulator, but are not cutting edge. The multiplayer is not bad, but depends on the server and its mission. Most multiplayer missions are community developed, and not all aircraft are available in every mission. Their is also no in game VoIP feature, so downloading Teamspeak is a must for voice communication. All and all a good game, but better if you pick it up during a sale.			"

												I am not an expert on flight simulators by any stretch of the imagination, so fair warning, I may be naive or ignorant in my assessment of this game. That said, by far I believe DCS World, and what I have seen of its addons including DCS: A-10C Warthog, to be the most comprehensive and realistic modern combat flight simulator series I have ever seen. Many thanks to the developers for making the base game available for free on Steam. There's a lot included in DCS World to appeal to both the hardcore flight simulation crowd and to educators.There are some minor omissions and simplifications from DCS World's default aircraft model, the Su-25, compared to its DLC packages in terms of the compexity of the cockpit's controls and graphical complexity, but what is available is so impressive to me I can't complain. Even this simplified model is more complex than many flight sims I've experienced in the past.It's a good sign that some of the original companies which designed aircraft featured in this series are assisting with the development of the game/simulator, alongside the usual industry veterans. The sound design, user interface design, controls, mission editor and scripting system all seem to be quite well-executed. The game supports flightsticks, HOTAS and TrackIR, as well as (a rather inappropriate method of control in my opinion) the Microsoft Xbox 360 Controller alongside a mouse and keyboard.I've not yet completely explored what the game has to offer in terms of difficulty levels, or rather, aircraft simulation settings, but my advice is that people who are looking for a casual, pick-up-and-go flight simulator should do their research or probably look elsewhere, as the game may be far more complex than expected. That said, you can't beat the price, so I would insist that you test the game out and see what you think of it first. There's plenty of tutorials in-game as well as available on the Internet to help you become accustomed to the Su-25's basic startup/taxi/takeoff/landing procedures and usage in combat.If you are interested in online multiplayer, there is a thriving community of DCS World players online these days. I bet there's a wingman available to help you out.Overall, at a first impression I consider DCS World and its expansions to be an excellent value for its cost. I look forward to buying the expansions.			"

												Where to begin....I've owned this game since the beginning. Loved Flaming Cliffs, etc..bought Blachshark when it came out. Very difficult, steep learning curve and I played it here and there, then I got an Oculus Rift and everything changed.....Suddenly I'm sitting in the cockpit of these planes looking around, these that I've dreamed of flying, looking at pictures as a kid (there where naked girls too but I've always loved stuff that flies). Now I can't get enough and I've got several of the planes figured out. What a difference a nice VR headset makes.My only ctriticism of DCS is the trainging missions aren't consistent. Some are great and narrated like the A10, others are not narrated, one set is narrated in Russian (maybe I have a head start for when trump sells us to Russia?), it has English text at least. I noticed also in some training missions, mapped controls don't line up with the directions. I've been able to work around it all. It just feels like they all should run through a scrubbing/standardization process before it's released.That said I can't get enough, steep learning curve warning though, it's very realistic. Tons of hours and I still rarely get through a mission end to end without crashing.			"

												Put simply, this is the platform for what are probably the most comprehensive simulations available to the public market today.  Once you've had a taster of the included content in DCS: World you'll be gagging for more - where the first port-of-call should (in my opinion) be DCS: Flaming Cliffs 3, bringing you a wider range of aircraft and immersive campaign.  Still not enough?  There are a few more aircraft to choose from, and now that some development is being outsourced more are coming thick and fast!			"

												I have read  in a couple places and they keep talking about adding motion control support for Vive. When exactly will this happnen? I know people think that it would not work but have you playde Time Machine? The motion controllers work fine with it. The left controller is your flight stick, im sure it can be programed easily for DCS. The right stick can be many things, has anyone tried Universe Sandbox? With a key press on left stick where the grip is, you can open up a display on top of the left stick without giving up control of the flight and select menus or selections using your right controller. The right controller can also be used to virtually touch the switches and turn knobs all by holding down the trigger and using the motion of turning or pushing. It can also be your throttle, hold down trigger, move forward for thrust or backwards for cutting engines.♥♥♥♥♥♥ if I could code, I would be all over this in a heart beat. Thanks for listening and please let me know if this is possible? "

												The DCS World SoftWare is Amazing, you get a Free SU-25t Fighter Jet, but once you add the A-10c WartHog, it's the most accurate and challenging Figher AirCraft Simulator I've ever used, keep in mind that the developers created the A-10c Simulator for the Army & AirForce for training, so you can imaging how intense it is... but don't expect to learn it right off the bat, you need to read the A-10c Flight Manual, and the A-10c GUI Manual, also do all the Training Missions to get familiar with the AirCraft, but, for those that just want a casual Jet Fighter Game, there is a ""GameMode Physics"" and different setting for G-Force, and Radio Assists, as well as becoming Invincible, UnLimited Fuel, UnLimited Weapons, etc...I highly recommend the DCS World coupled with the A-10c WartHog Add-On Module			"

												A truly evolving combat flight simulation. The platform started as Lock on: modern air combat in 2003. Since then, the developer decided to part ways with Ubisoft and successfully made a niche for themselves. DCS world is the ""World of tanks"" for modern flight simulation. Its still in its infancy with the scope. Things are constantly being updated/added and it has become a premier flight simulation. The graphics engine is dated with more CPU intensive processes, but the engine is due for a change with a revolutionary new EDGE (Eagle Dynamics Graphic Engine) that should be released this year. The planes are represented in painstaking detail. The physics for each plane is the most accurate representation in any flight simulation, including military trainers.The base game is free and allows you to fly the Su-25T and TF-51D. But the others can be purchased through addons. There are two lines of DCS addons:DCS: xxxx  :: Fully detailed aircraft including clickable cockpits. You need to spend 3-5 min just starting up the aircraft. Just like pilots in real life.DCS: xxxx Flaming cliffs :: A study simulation. There are easy one button presses to get the systems/avionics going, but the aircraft physics is still modelled very much like the DCS counterparts.At the end of the day, this is one of those MUST PLAY SIMULATIONS if you like flying aircraft. They still have a way to go with limited campaigns, dated graphics etc.. but things are improving with every version.Gameplay: 8/10Graphics: 7/10Audio: 7/10Replayability: 9/10MUST PLAY. ENDLESS HOURS OF ENTERTAINMENT.			"

												For those who thinks the golden age of flight simulation is gone - this is the one we've been waiting for. DCS World, and especially the A-10C, has more detail and complexity than anything we've flown before - combined. It has an extremely steep learning curve, but when you get it down you will find the complexity very rewarding.			"

												I have never in my life been as challenged in playing a game as i have in this one. At times it feels like you can't do something or that a city is simply too well defended by SAMs. And just when you feel as though you are defeated and can no longer complete your mission, you decide to ask for some help. and everyone is extremely helpful. It doesnt matter if you are a vet or a new pilot people always help out and (almost) never put others down. I love this game with a passion. The fact that the aircraft are 1:1 replicas including flight models is amazing! There is a plane for every job and no 1 plane can do it all, it truly is a team effort to win. I give this game a solid 10/10!			"

												I have read  in a couple places and they keep talking about adding motion control support for Vive. When exactly will this happnen? I know people think that it would not work but have you playde Time Machine? The motion controllers work fine with it. The left controller is your flight stick, im sure it can be programed easily for DCS. The right stick can be many things, has anyone tried Universe Sandbox? With a key press on left stick where the grip is, you can open up a display on top of the left stick without giving up control of the flight and select menus or selections using your right controller. The right controller can also be used to virtually touch the switches and turn knobs all by holding down the trigger and using the motion of turning or pushing. It can also be your throttle, hold down trigger, move forward for thrust or backwards for cutting engines.♥♥♥♥♥♥ if I could code, I would be all over this in a heart beat.

												DCS world is a great sim. However it does have a huge learning curve, for those who like the hard core sim where every buttion and switch is modeled in the aircraft look no further! lucky for people who aren't so hard core there is the Flaming cliffs 3 module although this module still takes a bit to figure out how to use the planes some you tube vids and some button mapping to a good quality joystick and dogfighting is a blast! FC3 adds the f15C, su-27, these planes are pretty easy to fly (you dont have to pull 20 switches to fire a cannon). After playing a bit in FC3 and finally getting the hang of radar and beyond vis fighting I found DCS FC3 to be and enjoyable and challanging sim, dodging Heat seekers by dropping flares and pulling hard 7-9G turns only to have the missile pass beneath the belly of the aircraft by a factor of meters is such a rush, and then winning your first airvictory and then your first combat sortie is somthing that instills a sort of pride in you.TL;DR: DCS world modules like A-10C,BLACK SHARK 2, and other stand alone planes are more suited to the hard core players (even though there is a game mode it's not very well explained) FC3 with a small amount of learning can be a rewarding and fun module for the Sim junkie. (ps look up youtube tutorials as they tend to explain how to use the systems better i found this one helped alot with the F-15

												DCS is not for those not willing to learn how to operate aircraft by the book. I currently have all but four of the modules for DCS and find the ammount of detail put into the systems of each aircraft amazing. I find it awesome that I can get into my MI-8 and start it up per the actual aircraft's checklist and then operate it like the real thing. The graphics are great, especially the aircraft textures, considering that the game is growing in age. Hopefully we will see the release of the new EDGE engine soon and the graphics will be back up to par. I highly recommend this simulator for flight enthusiasts, combat flight enthusiasts, or even casual gamers, because you can tweak the options to suit that style of play. It is however much more fun and more of a challenge to try and learn the systems when in full realism mode.			"

												If you are a hardcore flight simmer, then this is your stop. The game features the most realistic flight models you will ever find in any commercial flight simulator. It is a true joys to fly any aircrafts in this flight sim.However, those realism also come at a price. The game is very complex and casual audiences will find it not very accessible for them. The learning curve is very steep, so if you are just looking for some casual flight sim this is not for you. This game is for a hardcore simmer only!			"

Personally, I recommend Robert Sogomonian's YouTube tutorial series on the Su-25T to get you started. It's a great experience to take off, fly a route, destroy some targets and land safely; all on your own. Recommended!			"

												Aesomely realistic. You can't get more fun out of a modern day flight simulator than this. Although the multiplayer doesn't have the biggest community, it's still a blast, and really, watching your missile blast an enemy aircraft apart is simply . . . awesome.The free version with the Su-25T attack jet is fun, and if you can pick up Flaming Cliffs 3, well you're all set. Fighter jets make DCS way more fun.The fighters are quite realistic, even if DCS only calls FC3 a ""mid-fidelity"" sim. The F-15C, Su-27 and Su-33 Flanker are a blast to fly. Launching missiles from over 10nm away from the E/A is just so satifying, especially for a veteran of WWII sims. Speaking of WWII sims, DCS is releasing DCS: WWII soon, starting with the Fw-190 D-9 this August, and adding the Bf 109 K-4, Spitfire Mk. IX, and P-47D soon after. The WWII Normandy theatre map is getting released in Q1 2015.Download this sim, and remember, the additional modules are all the fun.			"

												Disclaimer - non steam user, transitioned to Eagle Dynamics own version a long time ago. Hours are far from correct.I'm far from a stranger to flight sims and I have tried pretty much every sim worth checking out. And I have to say that DCS outshines pretty much every competitor! If you're a flight geek this pretty much is a must for you.There's something with this game that speaks to me in so many ways.  From flying a CAP in the F-15 or the brand new Mirage 2000c, going in for a gun run with the Hog, hugging the ground with Huey or simply making a nice vfr in the L39.Yes it's hard in the begining, yes it takes sometime to learn but the sense of accomplishment you get from this is hard to find anywhere else.I can't express enough how good of an experience this game really is! The only complaint I might have had with this game would have been the slightly dated graphics. But with the release of  (the FREE) DCS 2 that complaint is gone.			"

												This game is so great, you can simulate the entire Latvian Air Force.Step 1: Get in four Mi-8 helicopters.Step 2: Somehow damage one of them.Step 3: Never repair the damaged helicoper.Step 4: Be left with three helicopters.Step 5: Wait for NATO to help you.			"

												Its a great game, dont let the difficulty intimidate you. You could get all the gameplay you could ever want out of the su-25,  as long as you lookup tutorials on youtube or fallow the ones provided you will get the controls down. Eventually you will want to fly something else, on the cheap (10$) you can get a f15 or a su-27, both are amazing aircraft, most will prefer the su-27 because you will like taking off from a carrier, albeit a russian angled deck carrier. I went with the f15 because i wanted to try a western designed aircraft. If you really like the game and want to shell out more money than you can buy aircraft around the 50$ mark like the mig 21 ,spitfire, mirage 2000, f-5, to name a few they are all great aircraft but you can go a long ways on a 0$ or 10$ investment.

												The game is great but the DRM is horrific.The Developers say that the DRM is not intrusive which is true unless they decide to block your keys.So if you spend money keep in mind that they can revoke your right to play the game any-time they want and there is nothing you can do about it.Other than this I totally recommend the game.

												This game is a kind of simulation of airplanes. You are able to fly certain planes in a simulated environment in military missions. There are many planes available though most are extra dlc's, you only get the soviet SU-25T for free, which is still very fun to play. Generally you should have a joystick with thrust and use either TrackIR or something like FaceTrackNoIR to control your head movement in the cockpit. Also important to mention is that the different dlc's (also called modules) with their planes have different simulation difficulty, some have a non-clickable 3D cockpit with simplyfied flight model and some like the A-10C require you to basically learn how to start up and fly the plane in a way you would do in reality with all it's buttons, switches and so on. Overall it is a great game, not the most accesible but the free plane is great to explore whether you like this game and you can always decide to go more hardcore with other planes or difficult missions. Aaaaand you also get the free mission editor/campaign editor which allows you to create your own content. So all summed up, you like flight simulation and fighting jets? Try this, it's nice.			"

												Having played FSX I first tried DCS World not expecting much difference. I was wrong. The learning curve is HUGE!!! Whereas in FSX I was able to figure out the throttle controls and a few basic commands then off I went, DCS requires patience, commitment and above all else a sense of humour.Whereas I was apparently able to fly a Boeing 747 within minutes on FSX, on DCS Black Shark it took me two hours of youtube tutuorials and mouse clicking to figure out how to get the engines of the KA-50 started and get the rotors going, then I got two inches off the ground and crashed the bloody thing! The graphics and feel of the game are both superior to FSX and there are tonnes of youtube vidoes on how to get the various aircraft started and fire the weapons (which isn't a case of ""just pull the trigger"") and you feel like to have learnt something when you finally get the Su-25T to take off without nose diving seconds later. I have gone from the basic DCS World to now owning the Flaming Cliffs 3, MiG-21 and Ka-50 Black Shark modules and am looking forward to purchasing the L-39 when it come out.			"

												I have never in my life been as challenged in playing a game as i have in this one. At times it feels like you can't do something or that a city is simply too well defended by SAMs. And just when you feel as though you are defeated and can no longer complete your mission, you decide to ask for some help. and everyone is extremely helpful. It doesnt matter if you are a vet or a new pilot people always help out and (almost) never put others down. I love this game with a passion. The fact that the aircraft are 1:1 replicas including flight models is amazing! There is a plane for every job and no 1 plane can do it all, it truly is a team effort to win. I give this game a solid 10/10!			"

												If you want to feel like a real pilot, but you financialy or phisically  can't afford to be a pilot in real life, than this is the game for you.Years ago I played Lock On - Mondern Air Combat and one day I thought, wouldn't it be awesome if there would be a game with these awesome grapics and realism and they made the cockpit fully clickable like in Falcon 4 Allied Force wich I played at the time too. They must have read my mind, because a couple of years later, this game showed up. Back then it was Black Shark (World and helo in one, later they sepperated everything).This game is  awesome and relatively perfect. This comming from a man that would love to fly a jet in real life. DCS World is free and comes with one non fully clickable cockpit SU-25T. The rest of the modules, wich holds one fully clickable cockpit aircraft, you need to buy sepperately. This is kind of ideal. Why? Because you don't have to buy the airplanes that are incrdibly ugly to you. If there is an airplane you absolutely love, buy ther module. If there is an airplane you absolutely hate, let it be and don't buy the module.  What I don't like is that the modules are so expensive. And with expensive I mean that every module, wich means one airplane or one new map, are all priced like a full, brand new, well liked and antissipated game. wich menas 50-60 euro's. No Idea what it would be in Dollars. The airplane modules I can understand, but a map? Well, that is a bit much in my opinion.However I do love the game very much. Beautifull graphics wich you don't see much in games. Super realistic aircraft where you have to use the cockpit buttons to set up weapons, navigation systems, radio's etc. This is the game for all of us who can never realize our dreams of becomming real pilots.

												So I spend some time in the tutorials figuring out the controls, then load up the ""Dogfight"" mission. 1 SU-25 vs 2 A-10s? Sounds like fun.Attempt the first:I fire both Aphids head on, both track for flares. We pass each other and start to turn, and it is at this point that the Ace Combat reflexes that loom threateningly in the dark corners of my mind whenever I boot up a flight sim decide to pounce. I forget that I am flying an SU-25, not an SU-37, and attempt to execute a j-turn. It goes poorly. (For details on exactly how poorly it went, see the verse about the passenger liner from the song ""Albuquerque"" by Weird Al Yankovick.)Attempt the second:I fail to achieve missile lock during the first pass and circle around. We mauever for a while, I manage to tag one of the Warthogs with my first Archer and kill it with the second. I manage to get behind the second Warthog and fire both Aphids. Both go for his flares. I close to gun range and we enter the horizontal scissors. I take a snapshot and miss just before I overshoot. I hear him fire his gun, and dive to try and evade. Several seconds later I notice two rather peculiar and alarming things: A, my plane has decided that it wants to be upside down now and wont take no for an answer, and B, I can't pull out of the dive. Approximately 3.72 seconds before I make an impressively large mess in some poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥'s wheat field, I look behind me and notice that roughly two thirds of my plane have mysteriously vanished.10/10 Would fail to notice getting lit up with a GAU-8 all over again.

												   Doubtlessly, the best military aircraft simulation, no pros and cons here. If youre looking for the best experience with crafts like A-10, SU-25, MIGs, F-15, others, + variety of choppers - it's your choice. Specifically For F-18, F-16, F-14 look elsewhere, VRS things for Flight Simulator X, falcon BMS and others.   MUST HAVE, before even thinking of purchasing this one:- TrackIR (absolute MUST);- joystick and throttle (best if Thrustmaster H.O.T.A.S);- rudder pedals (many would argue,  but thats a MUST, cuz you'll never get to use wheel brakes and yaw axis correctly  with else);- capable PC (stronger the better cuz performance in this is a question of life and death sometimes);- touchscreen monitor as wide and big as possible (optional, but VERY recommended, rids you of constant mouse  usage. anoying when right hand always on stick then mouse then back);- voice recognition softwere and mic (useful for issuing radio comands and requests) - persistence and patience;Expences are high, and be ready for it. Be ready to spend hours, months and years learning and practising everything, and youll be very surprised of the result, it's like nothing else in PC gaming on my experience. Its not even a game, sometimes it's a hard brain work but that very rewarding when the mission is 100 % complete			"

												DCS: World is definitely an amazing simulator. It by far outclasses others due to excellent flight models, a multiplayer that makes sense, easy-to-learn mission editor, and a large amount of detail. Even Flaming Cliffs 3 aircraft have more detail than something like War Thunder.Actually, DCS excels at detail; for instance, the A-10C. It is the epitome of PC-based simulators, with most if not all of the real plane's functionality and flight characteristics. Another example is the Ka-50, and really any of the rotorcraft. They basically are the best in their class, with the full range of aerodynamic effects you'd get from the real thing- retreating blade stall, translational lift, ""oh♥♥♥♥♥♥my blades just up and left me"" (hopefully not IRL), etc. Another thing is Nevada Test and Training Range. It is a huge map; most of Nevada, in fact. Even some parts of California. The entire Las Vegas city and suburbs are present and amazing. Even though it's not out for steam yet (as of updating), I'll leave this here.			"

DCS World is flight simulator first and throughout with a steep learning curve. However its free-to-play model does make it accessible to trying it before investing in expensive add-ons. Performance and PlayabilityPerformance wise the game runs really well on my medium-high machine, was able to easily max out most of the settings and with no obvious issues, and it can be quite visually nice to look at. The game also runs without issue on Windows 10 for me.

AircraftThe game comes with two aircraft; a TF-51D ""Mustang"" WW2 Fighter, and a Su-25T ""Frogfoot"" Attack Jet. Both are modeled with considerable detail and offer realistic flight models. The aircraft can be modified with different payload / weapon options. Aircraft addons you buy may offer even more realistic flight behavior depending on what you buy.

By: Vetron




NOTE: Because this game caters towards relatively hardcore flight mechanics,  I would recommend if you are a new pilot to flight simulation (i.e. never flown at all in other simulators) start out with more accessible titles (such as Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition[ http] or X-Plane 10 Global[ http] as of writing this) until you have the grasp of the very basics of flight, and then come back and work through the training missions included. Jumping right in might just lead to frustration if you don’t really have a handle on the basics of flight, as its easier to learn from the point of how to fly the specific aircraft, rather than how to fly a plane in general. At least in my opinion anyway (and no means a dig at the game).Free to play limitsThere are no obvious limits or restrictions in place that I could see. You are really only limited by what aircraft you can fly, most of which you have to purchase separate.Free Flight (Instant Action and Fast Missions)DCS World comes with both pre-set instant action scenarios, as well as fast missions. The fast missions allow you to select the aircraft you wish to fly, then set the start location and enemy difficulty – and generate a combat scenario where you can put your aircraft to the test.

Missions & CampaignIncluded with the free-to-play portion of the game is several stand-alone missions for the SU-25T, as-well as a scripted campaign. There is also several training missions as-well. There is likely several hours’ worth here, and you can of course just install user created missions or create your own. ConclusionIf you want a combat flight simulator, with emphasis on the simulation then the free-to-play DCS World is recommended.GoodPair of detailed aircraft (with many more to buy)Realistic Flight modelsSelection of available missions and campaignFree-to-playNot so goodNot as wide selection of content as other gamesLimited scenery			"

												Being a long time flight simmer I'm really happy about how DCS world brings flight and air combat to our PC screens. Great Flight sim with a lot of attention to detail. The world is beautifully rendered with lots of, hills, valleys, towns, cities, rivers and thousands of trees all over the landscape. Aircraft are beatutifully rendered inside and out, they sound thunderous and the flight physics feel pretty accurate to me. Mind you, to my disgust I've never had the chance to fly around like a excited wide eyed lunatic in an F-15 or an A-10 but aircraft feel responsive to a host of factors in the air from cross winds, to the weight of your loadout, temperature, altitude etc. Honestly a lot of the time I have a great time just flying around enjoying the sensation of flight.

			Flathatting: An unauthorized low level flight. Terrorizing the locals free flying in the F-15c...with some roadtunes.		

This sim does have a pretty steep learning curve and will take some time to learn each aircraft and it's systems. Modules can be expensive but its best you chose an aircraft you want to learn and master it as each aircraft functions fundamentaly differnt. I would treat each full price module has it's own simulator. There are cheaper modules available as well that are not as expensive or as detailed that will still give you a pretty awesome flying experience for a fraction of the price. I will definatly say that this is not a casual game. I see lots of reviews from people saying wtf I coudln't even make it off the ground etc etc. Its really recommended you RTFM or seek out some tutorials. I would also recommend some form of HOTAS setup for the best experience. More content is being added frequently, I'm particulary looking forward to DCS 2.0 going live, which includes Las Vegas / Nellis AFB and red flag campaigns, as well as the addition to the release of the F/A-18.Lastly, performance wise DCS is pretty CPU intensive. If you have a decent CPU, you will certainly get better performance. Though some easy ways to boost performance is to decrease water detail and civillion traffic ( streets are populated with scores of moving vehicles and trains) There are also guides out there for other ways to tweak performance.

												Love DCS. Unfortunately I don't have TrackIR or an Oculus Rift DK2 so I feel I'm missing out on a bit of the immersion. Logitech Wingman Extreme 3d Pro joystick does me but having to enable the joystick config file every single time I play is annoying.Flaming Cliffs and what it does needs more of an explanation as I ended up buying F-15 AND flaming cliffs which was a waste. I've bought the enhanced versions of both A-10 and Blackshark 2 which are fantasticly authentic with cockpit buttons.I would love to see more British aircraft and helicopters... in particular WWII aircraft like the Spitfire and Harrier.Tornado and Jaguar ... and of course the AH-64 Apache Gunship which I'm told was scrapped as module because the team responsible were making the E variant which is currently still in service and classified... they were told to drop it.I'd be happy with the D variant rather than a mod skin over the Blackshark 2 which doesn't really do it for me.Waiting with baited breath for the Hawk module to drop in price on steam as I've paid enough and I'm not forking out another £25+ to fly a Hawk.Can't wait for DCS2 and DX12 graphics. My pc is upgraded and ready to go for it.			"

												Put simply, this is the platform for what are probably the most comprehensive simulations available to the public market today.  Once you've had a taster of the included content in DCS: World you'll be gagging for more - where the first port-of-call should (in my opinion) be DCS: Flaming Cliffs 3, bringing you a wider range of aircraft and immersive campaign.  Still not enough?  There are a few more aircraft to choose from, and now that some development is being outsourced more are coming thick and fast!			"

												DCS was a rocky start for me, but once I picked up a cheap Joystick I got hooked.I've racked up most of my hours from this summer alone, Everything from Flaming Cliffs 3 to the Ka-50 Black Shark and the classic A-10 with so much more content on the way.  If you like Military Flight Simulators this game is for you.			"

												Hands down the best flight sim around. If you have ever thought about wanting to fly a plane or helo, this is as real as it gets. This Sim will take time to master but it is all worth it in the end. The SU-25T Frogfoot is a great starter plane with simplified inputs. If you are looking for something a little more complicated the A-10C, Black Shark 2, MI-8, UH-1H and P-51 allow you to touch every button in the cockpit. I would highly recommend all of them.			"

												Okay two caveats that need to be addressed right off the bat:1)This game that you are downloading is module-based. So all you get from the free download is the P-51 and Su-25. Fun, but not super content-rich,2)Do not buy this game if you want to jump in a cockpit and go blastin'. You will be disappointed.Aside from that, I love this game. I was a big Ace Combat fan as a kid and always wanted something more technically challenging. It did take me a few months to gain a firm grasp of the controls, mission editor and combat tactics, but if you want to pretend to be a real fighter pilot, this is the one. Who knew trapping on a carrier or just even successfully flying a CAP would be so fun? Tons of official (Nevada map coming next month) and user made content (lockonfiles) and a really fun mission editor. Where else can you attack a US Navy carrier group with an armada of Backfire bombers and simulate how that would really happen? Plus, the first time you spot a target, evade his missile in a cloud of flares, then bang a Sidewinder or R-73 up his tailpipe is just really something.tl;dr- Its a bit of a serious game (DCS is to other combat flight sims what ArmA III is to most tactical shooters. Its hard to figure out), but the level of realism and authenticity is unmatched.10/10 real (fake) pilots only			"

												Hello, This is DCS World, it's not Get in and play, you need sometime to learn how to control your aircraftFirst; you start with Su-25T and then you can buy some aircraft, This sim has a big fanbase and also a Great Dev Team The Sim is Growing Greatly in the Future, There will be a new Engine with great graphics and there will be F-18 and F-14A Tomcat hopefully this year or the next, and you don't need 500$+ Dollars to play this Sim all i advice you with is Logitech X3D Pro if you can't buy State of the Art Joystick. This sim is the best i've played in a long time, it has alot of Tutorials and some great AI to fight and compete with. You need to Keep Calm in the air and keep your Eyes peeled on the RWR(Radar Warning Reciver). Fly Safe Regards.....        Col.Eddison			"

												Hello,this game is a piece of art. Some say it is the best mil avio sim there is out there. Even with its free module you will find yourself capapble of doing many tasks and missions (using the wide weaponary). But don't think you will be able to hop in the game and start doing all the ace manuevers and tactics. You will have to put your mind to it and approach it with the atitude of learning new stuff. Game is in no mean necessary to be played as if you are a real pilot. You can take it casualy, but you will still need to take notes and be patient. The feeling of reward after succeding is huge. After you master the Frog, you can try out some of the other modules and see what suits you. You might be a Ground pounder or a Fighter guy. Or maybe a rotor head ? You can go back and fly some of the older gen planes as well. New modules are being brought out often.Some tips I have are:- Take notes !!!! - Get a Stick (even a cheaper one)- get yourself a headtracker (TrackIR, Facetrack(homemade TrackIR)- As much as you all love steam, I recommend getting the standalone game as you will be able to use all the avaliable mods on the forums (terrain, texture, sound, liveries) - register on the forums so you can see what new content there is from the community ( mods, screens, vids, news and projects) http://forums.eagle.ru/- if you are using a single monitor I recommend playing the game in Windowed mode(it is borderles so you wont see a diff) as it allows you to alt+tab a lot easier without any issues    And last but not in meaning. If you ever have time, check out the mission editor tool. It is a powerful tool where you can unleash all the imaginary missions you ever had. Has lurning curve as anything in this game.I've been flying the A-10C for 3 years(nearly 4) now and F-15C for year and a half and I am happy with the amount of time I've inversted in this. Don't be scared that you won't be able to do something or it is too complicated. No such thing. If anyone wans help or tips for those two modules I could help out :) cheers and see you in the sky. Shoutout to the 104th server, the best pvp server !P.S: If you wonder why I have so low game time. It is because I play the standalone version. I downloaded the game on steam just so I can write this review.Don't be scared to ask me any questions about the A-10C and F-15C			"

												This is an amzing experience. YOu can really feel like you have flown an aircraft. Luckily there is a GAME mode if you dont want to spend hours learning how to really fly, but if you do, you can.I personally dont want to yet, but maybe in the future... you never know.It really does push the graphics though, and my brand new, bought for VIVE, 980 struggles above medium graphics. I can see the new 1080 doing it justice and DCS can probably still push that card.You need to be careful what you buy, add on wise, as some dont work without other parts.I have spent ages just flying around, and after a little research for nnew places to fly I found that Nevada is coming, including Vegas which should be cool.Die hard sim fans already know about this I am sure, I can only tell you guys that you should rush out and buy the VIVE to really make it worth having. I spent a full day in a multimillion pound British Army simulator, and the VIVE experience on DCS is better!If you just want to fly around, make sure you go into the settings and find the options for GAMEPLAY and choose GAME.This is an awesome programme, without a doubt, and the marriage with VR is made in heaven.

You can meet great people who will help you learn how to fly, land, start-up etc.EDIT: I forgot to mention that you can create your own missions and make your own campaign.

												DCS World + A-10C + Flaming Cliffs 3Yes, this game is worth the money. I got the A-10C first in 2011 but I never really got into it. It wasn't until Dec or Jan when I really started flying. The hardest part about this game is trying to figure out what you need to bind to your joystick in order to not just fly but be affective at bombing or dogfighting and what not else. After that youtube and Eagle Forums are you best friends. Flaming cliffs came shortly after I became proficient in the A-10. I felt like I needed something fast to fly and when you can mod aircraft like the F-14, F-18, A-7, F-4, and the F-16 into the game using fc3 aircraft as a cockpit base, it really adds to the worth. Since DCS has a large ammount of AI aircraft with accurate flight models, modding these into the game is more than flying an F-15 skinned to look like something else. Be sure to check it out.			"

												Only for aircraft enthusiasts. In the military genre, this is the most hardcore sim there is. Be prepared to invest weeks in learning and mastering an aircraft, anywhere from a start-up procedure, to weapon employment, to a successful landing. All that barely scratches the surface though. Flight maneuvers, countermeasures, situational awareness, and understanding enemy capabilities is imperative.The Caucasus map is free and you simply purchase the modules that interest you. Continuous upgrades and dev support is present. New maps and aircrafts are always in production. There's something for everyone included in this sim.			"

												I am just drooling being able to fly in the helis and planes, in the game. I am no pilot, no nothing, but just flying in DCS makes me feel good! I am not really sure whether it's realistic or not (well it is harder to fly and plenty of things to take note just to fly, so I guess it's more realistic than the others.), but how each plane is structured to its details just makes the whole game/sim really cool.Note:Not for those who wish to get on and just fly. (You can with some of the planes but even then, you won't start doing really special things in an hour or two. You might even have trouble landing even after 1 week, depending on how good you are. At least I am more on the casual side.)Don't follow my steam time here.. I switched over to use the official launcher for the game.			"

												An amazing sim with a powerful flight model, that is aging well. constant updates and 3rd party development keeps this game relevant for years now. however graphics optiumization has taken a serious backseat. i have a powerful rig with GTX 1080 and I cant even get it to run smooth in VR, 2D monitor is buttery smooth. Mission and campaign  editor is a powerful and complex tool making replayability a grand adventure. however due to the fact that aircraft may come from different developers, the quality for each aircraft varies. I have since bought the mig-21BIS, FC3, A-10, and combined arms addon packs on sale and I have come to realize the sheer amount of quality research done on the flight model and avionics to make this game shine. Going to military aviation conventions and bookstores, I have bought books from the 60s 70s 80s and 90s on some of these aircraft and the information is valid and relevant. The free aircraft (SU-25T) is a great aircraft to learn in and is still my go-to primary plane. it teaches you to be conservative with the controls and gives wide range of targets and attack methods to hit. its also well armored and surprisingly fast in a level dive run-in, so you can take some flak before having to RTB. DCS World is the best all-around modern combat flight sim in my opinion at this time, any improvements they make are just additions to this fact. I have tons of fun in IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad, and im not sure how the WW2 aircraft in DCS compare in realism to that as I do not own those modules. When speaking to my uncle (Who is a SU-25 Pilot) he explained that the engine control is reasonably simplified and automated ingame as most people dont have enough buttons on their keyboard and flight stick for that task, but besides this fact, it is modeled very close to the real thing, and a person practicing procedure in DCS could learn to fly the aircraft fairly quickly with a training program. The sim in general has an issue with scale. speeds and distance are scaled down and vehicle models scaled up to create and illusion of a larger playable space and save on processing power. He noticed it during takeoff as passing runway objects appeared to be moving too slowly relative to aircraft speed, and it is a subtle factor to the game to improve performance			"

												Im new to the flight sim game and also new (as many people are) to Virtual Reality, with this being said I have played a few games on the HTC Vive (which is what i play this game on)Im prone to motion sickness in games, first noticed years ago on the game ""doom"". but i didnt really get the motion sickness from this game.I loaded up DCS World not expecting to much and was instantly blow away by the cockpit detail and the realism of it all, i remember just looking out at he wing and engine of the plane and i felt like I was on a real plane, i haven't been in a fighter plane but i have flown in commercial airlines.There is a hell of alot of keys, for example: to start each engine, air brakes, wheel brakes, wing extenders which you can see on the cockpit dials change as you use the keyboard to apply each item. For me maybe because i dont have a joystick and was flying via the cursor keys, this was the only down side to the game as i had to lift the Vive head set off my face to see the key to press which when your trying to land the plane was a real pain and led to many crashes.If the VIVE controllers worked and you could grap the the joystick to steer the plane and push the cockpit dials to lower wheels, apply brakes etc this would be awesome.

												Super steep learning curve, but incredibly rewarding once you get it right. Other than a couple tutorials, there is almost no hand-holding at all. I wish it were a bit easier to play through, but can't really blame the developers as this is a 'simulator' more than anything.I played most of this in VR on the Vive; and is the closest I've come to the experience of flying in real life from any game. The translation of the interface to VR has much to be desired, but can easily be overlooked by everything else that shines in this game.			"

												DCS is a very good simulation but I recommend not to use the steam version - use the non steam version from the dcs website instead. You get acces to air vehicles earlier then if you would using the steam version.You need a joystick and lots of patience in order to play - pedals are not a 100% requirement.Very good fun if you got the right guys to play with!

												I have to say,  with all the garbage out there for $50-$60 I would rather spend it on a beautiful designed and extremely accurate  aircraft, this is absolutely the best flight , combat simulator out there, not even close. It can be a bit frustrating at first, but spending a hour or two a day if you have the time to get to know the aircrafts is so rewarding. Hands down if you like simulators? Dive in.			"

												You'd be hard pressed to find a more realistic combat flight sim out there that still offers the beauty and variety DCS presents. However, a caveat: it is very hard to play this game well without a HOTAS and a headtracking solution. Regarding the latter, FreeTrack worked well for me, and materials for the tracking rig only cost around $20. There's a forum post somewhere with dll files you can use to make it work with DCS.Also, I successfully played DCS for quite a while on a three-year-old laptop with a 2.0 gHz processor and integrated graphics. The framerate was suboptimal, but I could still play competently. Reviews suggesting that this game is unplayable without a thousand dollar system are inaccurate, probably posted by people who have never tried it on a cheap rig themselves or consider anything under 25 fps unplayable.

												This game is probably the most immersive, detailed flight simulator out there! The flight dynamic models are very accurate and simulate the real-life aircraft very well indeed. In my opinion, the A-10C Warthog Module is well worth the price, simulating all the instruments and flight controls (from the ejector seat to the climate control), providing an extremely detailed level of gameplay However, the game isn't very beginner friendly and takes a while to familiarize with the controls, keybinds and aircraft operation. The game can also consume performance at times. Despite this, DCS: World (providing the SU-25T and the TF-51D aircraft for free) is definitely worth the download, regardless of which modules you additionally purchase. In terms of simulation, this is the best of the best. 10/10			"

												This is kinda like FSX/X-Plane, but without every airport on the planet. In turn you get explosions, good visuals, and ""accurate"" systems in the paid modules.I have a lot more time in this game that what Steam is reporting, since it's installed stand-alone. The opinion below is based on openbeta 1.5.3 with NO paid modules:Pros:-Free Su-25T-Large map-Lots of missions and an easy mission editor-Frequent updates to add features or fix bugs-More modules are available(for money), but each one I've tried is great-User-made modules exist but are far less complicated/accurate-FC3 aircraft work in DCS, so you can get a handful of basic aircraft for cheap-Lots of modsCons:-You'll want more than 8GB of RAM to play online-Net code can be...buggy...at times-Each update fixes a couple bugs and adds a few moreOnce 1.5 and 2.0 are combined into one, I think we'll see some improvments overall.

												If you like flying airplanes then you will most likely love this game. like others have mentioned , the game has a steep learning curve and aside of love of flying , it takes patience and willingness to learn before you get to enjoy flying. but then the experience is really rewarding. if you really love flying then you will also love the learning process. now in my book there are 3 types of fans when it comes to flying games . lets see ...1- the first type only want to grab the stick (or keyboard) and start shooting down bandits and bombing ground targets without having to mess with anything else. if you are from this type then go for battlefield series , HAWX or War Thunder..etc. don't bother with DCS . you will have hours of fun with the other titles that I mentioned. and trust me , there are some really good ones out there and I've personally tried most of them . 2- This type of fans love flying and don't mind getting into some details about planes but they don't want to get too deep with all aspects of flight mechanics and details. if you belong in this category , look up ""Flaming cliffs 3"" on steam and leave it on a tab and then continue reading. 3- These are plane nerds. they want to know what all the instruments and buttons do in an airplane. they want to get a realistic experience of flying and have no problems putting time and effort to learn so. if you belong in this category then why the hell are you still reading ? go download DCS and have fun . thank me later. Now ... if you are the first type ... don't bother with DCS. there are tons of other titles that will bring you hours of fun. DCS is for the other 2 types . if you love flying but don't want to go too deep into anything other than basic flight mechanics , then you're in the right place. DCS has ""non-clickable cockpits"" in different planes where you don't have to know what every single switch does. you just have to memorize a few keyboard shortcuts and have a basic knowledge of reading the instruments which is really easy if you're willing to do so . you will get to feel how a real plane flies without having to dig into books to be able to start your aircraft. BUT here is the thing. you can by FC3 and get so many planes at a decent price . if you go for DCS you will have to buy each plane separately (expect for the 2 included in the free version) . the choice is up to you. but KEEP reading .Finally if you are from the last type , then you just have to grab your stick , hop in a plane and start your journey. there are clickable cockpits in the game where  you actually NEED to know what every single switch does in order to be able to start up , take off , navigate ...etc. its pretty much like knowing how to fly a real plane and believe me , there's an ocean of details that you can enjoy messing with. look no further because DCS not only brings you a realistic experience , but it has better graphics and in-game physics than all the other flying simulators on the market right now. go look for yourself and compare this gem to FSX or FG and see the difference. As a final note , some say the planes are expensive. I believe for the amount of detail that the planes provide you with the prices are decent . but before purchasing any , make sure you look for teh frequent sales on the DCS' website. usually you can by all planes for %70 off (and more if you purchase multiple planes) so then you won't have to cry over your empty wallet . just keep an eye open for sales and you will get a really good deal . I say again , if you're from the second type , consider going with DCS:FC3 . you will get pretty much all the planes in one package instead of having to buy them separately.			"

												Ok so the game looks good and it is indeed a flight sim. The first thing you need to ask yourself is 'Can you fly a SU25t frogfoot?' if the answere is no then don't worry because there is a tutorial in place with DCS world that talks you thru the take off and landing procedures etc. So now you need to ask your self 'can you fly any plane whatoever?' if the answere is still no then here begins your problem because there are no tutorials available in game except a few videos showing you whats what which are next to useless if you haven't ever flown for example an F15 eagle or a P51 mustang then you will need to do your own research on how to fly them. I started the A10 campaign and managed to take off as the engine was already running but once I did I found that I was just a piece of metal in the sky because I couldn't operate any of the systems to use my weapons and even if I could I didnt have the first clue about how to effectively use them anyway. So why does this game get a 'thumbs up'? because it is a good creation so much effort has been put into this that it deserves nothing less, a 'thumbs down' would suggest a bad game which is unfair and I can imagine that when you take off in multiplayer with your buddy and fly in formation that this on it's own would be extremely satisfying let alone completing missions from the hangar to take off to battle and back to landing...I'm just totally incapable of learning how to fly an acutal plane without having actually gone to flight school first. This is a good game but requires a lot of work just to be able to do the basics.			"

												Looks good, to damn hard to set up, i have tried to setup the basic Thrustmaster USB joystick with throttle. Its just way to complecated and fiddly. just as you thick youve mastered the basics something weird happens with; views, trims, flight, automation. None of it makes sense. It will appeal to a very small target market. I'll give it one more hour before i uninstall. Would not play regulary enough to justify the cost of the DLC content. What i would like to see is an even more dumbed down version for newbies to flight sims and a magic button to setup joystick controls, even loading a named controller from a database would be good.((it needs a BF3 mode - switch on, login, join game, shoot stuff otherwise its just a flightsim)(There are no three week training courses to teach all the details of this game, so many will not bother. the guides are good, but if you cant grasp the basics after ten minutes EPIC FAIL))Vote yes/no    eer.. uumh.. Yes just! which is a shame as so much work has gone in to the game, there are just to many hurdles to get you hooked.			"

												This is the best modern flight simulator in the market right now. DCS World is seperated into two types of modules: 'DCS' level and 'Flaming Cliffs' level. DCS level aircraft such as the A-10C, the KA-50, and the UH-1 require an understanding of aircraft avionics to operate them. Most procedures are 80-90% accurate. Flaming Cliffs level modules have the the same quality of flight modeling, but they have simplified avionics. This means it requires a single button press to start the engines for example. I highly recommend this title if you have an interest in military aircraft simulations.			"

												If you like flying airplanes then you will most likely love this game. like others have mentioned , the game has a steep learning curve and aside of love of flying , it takes patience and willingness to learn before you get to enjoy flying. but then the experience is really rewarding. if you really love flying then you will also love the learning process. now in my book there are 3 types of fans when it comes to flying games . lets see ...1- the first type only want to grab the stick (or keyboard) and start shooting down bandits and bombing ground targets without having to mess with anything else. if you are from this type then go for battlefield series , HAWX or War Thunder..etc. don't bother with DCS . you will have hours of fun with the other titles that I mentioned. and trust me , there are some really good ones out there and I've personally tried most of them . 2- This type of fans love flying and don't mind getting into some details about planes but they don't want to get too deep with all aspects of flight mechanics and details. if you belong in this category , look up ""Flaming cliffs 3"" on steam and leave it on a tab and then continue reading. 3- These are plane nerds. they want to know what all the instruments and buttons do in an airplane. they want to get a realistic experience of flying and have no problems putting time and effort to learn so. if you belong in this category then why the hell are you still reading ? go download DCS and have fun . thank me later. Now ... if you are the first type ... don't bother with DCS. there are tons of other titles that will bring you hours of fun. DCS is for the other 2 types . if you love flying but don't want to go too deep into anything other than basic flight mechanics , then you're in the right place. DCS has ""non-clickable cockpits"" in different planes where you don't have to know what every single switch does. you just have to memorize a few keyboard shortcuts and have a basic knowledge of reading the instruments which is really easy if you're willing to do so . you will get to feel how a real plane flies without having to dig into books to be able to start your aircraft. BUT here is the thing. you can by FC3 and get so many planes at a decent price . if you go for DCS you will have to buy each plane separately (expect for the 2 included in the free version) . the choice is up to you. but KEEP reading .Finally if you are from the last type , then you just have to grab your stick , hop in a plane and start your journey. there are clickable cockpits in the game where  you actually NEED to know what every single switch does in order to be able to start up , take off , navigate ...etc. its pretty much like knowing how to fly a real plane and believe me , there's an ocean of details that you can enjoy messing with. look no further because DCS not only brings you a realistic experience , but it has better graphics and in-game physics than all the other flying simulators on the market right now. go look for yourself and compare this gem to FSX or FG and see the difference. As a final note , some say the planes are expensive. I believe for the amount of detail that the planes provide you with the prices are decent . but before purchasing any , make sure you look for teh frequent sales on the DCS' website. usually you can by all planes for %70 off (and more if you purchase multiple planes) so then you won't have to cry over your empty wallet . just keep an eye open for sales and you will get a really good deal . I say again , if you're from the second type , consider going with DCS:FC3 . you will get pretty much all the planes in one package instead of having to buy them separately.			"

												(You may notice that I have 0.0 hrs on record playing DCS world, that's because I play it through the Eagle Dynamics DCS world launcher.  I had that originally with some DLC before Steam offered it.)As far as I know Digital Combat Systems is the only software company that is dedicated to making true to life simulations.  If your into flight simulators, and you love the military planes, this is a must have!  The DLC that you buy for this is well worth it.  These are not your run of the mill games, the learning curve is quite high.  But if you dedicate the time to learning the sims you will know what it feels like to be a combat pilot.  Hell it took me multiple nights of playing just to learn how to start up the A-10!  And you think that it's easy to take off in a P-51 Mustang, that's what I thought too until I went turning to the left on the runway smack dab into a building.  I didn't know that you need to compensate for P factor.  Hell, didn't know what P factor was until started playing this simulator.  What I'm trying to say is that when it comes to simulators for the PC, it don't get any closer to the real thing than it does with DCS simulators.			"

												This is by no means an arcade game, and it takes a bit of time to learn the controls and tactics. Once you're over the initial 'hump' this game is very enjoyable and has a very active multiplayer/teamspeak community, which often organises 'training' sessions with more experienced players. 10/10 would fly again.

												Looks fantastic, except for the excessive loading time between each stage of the game - for example mission briefings and loading the mission is simply too long. After each screen I was returned to desktop whilst the next section loaded (slowly) This really detracts from any kind of immersion in the game.Note: I was playing the non-steam version of the game, which states 3GB ram as a minimum. Steam shows 6GB ram minimum. I have 4GB, so this may be why I was having long loading times between sections.			"

												If I had one word to describe DCS it would be rewarding. You start off knowing nothing but eventualy with a lot of studing you start to figure things out, you learn how to start the aircraft, how to fly them, how to fire weapons, and how to dodge missiles. This game is not for the faint of heart though, you have to study ALOT for the more detailed aircraft in order to even be able to get off the ground, but if you dont mind studying and you love flying I would suggest you try this game IMMEDIATLY.

												DCS World, one of the best games I have played in a long time. DCS Simulates combat in a great way and offers a wide variety of things to do, though at the start you are locked with air to ground until you buy DLC. You recive two starting aircraft for free, the TF-P51 (no armament) and the SU-25T (armed) thankfully the 25T, although having a steep learning curve, is still very easy to operate as certain DLC aircraft require weeks of practice to be able to fly and use effectivley. Steep learning curve and all I would highly reccomend this game as it maintains realism, allows you to fly more modern arcraft, which is not something super popular with multiplayer capable air combat games, and is enjoyable no matter wat you are doing.

												I've never played a simulation game before. This one seemed very realistic from what I could tell (I've never flown a plane before). Me and my friend had a blast trying to learn this game. I found DCS World to be very entertaining and sometimes comical mostly because we were SO terrible at it. I do highly recommend it and one day want to come back to it, maybe if I get a joystick or just have more time. This is a game that definitely takes practice. There are dozens of control keys and combinations that you have to remember just to fly and land a plane, and another couple dozen for combat. That's like a memorization game in itself! Me and my friend joked that if we could successfully fly this plane then we could head over to the local airport and probably fly a real plane. Funny but the game is so detailed that it's most likely completely true!			"

												Anyone who wants to feel the thrill of fighter jets and bombers - you can not miss this.This is as hardcore of a simulation you can get. You need to really learn the planes (well, most of them at least) in order to fly them well, and use them in missions. You need to know that you need to arm your lasers and targeting pods before you can blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up. You need to know how to work the radios when contacting JTAC or ATC.Want to drive a tank instead? Go right ahead, just pick up the correct DLC first.I've heard poeple complain about the price of the DLC. Well, yes, they cost as much as a new game, but you know what? They are new games. These planes are incredibly detailed.If you want the real deal, the real feel, do not miss this title!			"

												I tried DCS once before and did not have the patience to learn how to operate any aircraft. Recently, I gave it another shot and now regret giving up on it.The aircraft look and feel great. Multiplayer servers are stable and sharp, and a good place to practice your piloting. DCS is continually updated, and a new terrain engine can be expected in version 2.5. A Swedish Viggen will be released soon, and F-14 is expected beyond that.The only drawback to DCS is the absence of many iconic planes. DCS World includes aircraft from several eras of flight, from WWII to the late Cold War. Many planes have a contemporary; A-10 for Su-25, Sabre for MiG-15, et cetera. However, I hope to someday see the inclusion of a flyable Phantom, F-16, Mig-25, MiG-31 and others. DCS also has the potential to be a platform for simulated naval engagements, and the inclusion of more naval aircraft would also be interesting.			"

												THE Modern Combat Simulator. Great Multiplayer. Very powerful editor that allows you to design whole campaigns. Just do yourself and the developers a favour and get the non-Steam version. You get bigger discounts on sale and the devs get all the money they deserve. Plus Early Access Modules like the Nevada Map are only available for the non-Steam-version. For WWII planes I prefer Il2 BoS/BoM as it delivers the much more polished overall package. For anything 50s and newer, helicopters and stuff, get DCS.			"

												I've spent about 120hrs in this flight sim in the ED standalone(non-Steam) version.Most of them using TM warthog hotas, oculus rift cv1, mfg crosswind.Modules I've spent most time in is A10C american striker, and some in FC3 (F15C and SU27), plus quite some time in the KA-50 attack helicopter.And MAN this is really an AWEWSOME sim!!! Really focus on details, extremely low price. 20 USD for A10C i.e.The level of depth is just astonishing. And the ingame interactive tutorials are great. Also combined with a 673page flight manual for the A10C, and maybe even if you buy maple flag missions a10c basiv flight training (10usd), you really have it covered.I've put all other games and hobbies aside for this in 2016 and have not regreted it.Buy if you're ready to read up on this study sim :)You can also start airborne etc if you have not learned how to start up etc. Ofc.

												This is a game that needs time to learn.Time to learn how to keybind, time to learn how to start up an aircraft, time to learn how to target enemies, time to learn how to destroy them, time to learn how to use countermeasures, time to learn how to land. Then once you know those, you need time to learn how to fly at night with night vision goggles (on some aircraft).You can be happy with the game without the need of a flightstick, IR, or pedals. They do add more to the enjoyment, but if you can only use a controller, this game still works with you.If you dont like learning how planes/ helicopters work, I dont recommend this for you. If you take the time to learn it, you will be rewarded with explosions and burning carcasses that were once your enemies.Take the time to learn the free SU-25T and you will see how fun it is to kill ground targets. That is just a taste of how fun DCS can be.			"

DCS World is a free to play extremely realistic flight simulator.The first thing I am going to mention is the ""DLC"". This isn't DLC even though Steam lists it as DLC. If you go to the website you will see them being called modules. They are each their own game but you need the base of DCS World to use them. Don't call them overpriced because for 50 USD each you can get an A-10c, Huey, FW-190, MI-8, Bf-109, MiG-21, MiG-15, or an F-86F Sabre. These are all modeled to the exact detail as the real plane. This means the buttons, switches, levers, and everything else can be used.One thing that bugs me about other reviews are the ones that get mad over the modules or the people that say the game is too realistic. Don't buy this game if you aren't willing to learn. It took me forever to understand this game and frankly I still don't. This simulator is not an arcade game.Pros-Great graphics after the update-Runs well-Extremely realistic-Satisfying-FunCons-Slightly unstable-Takes a while to load but this doesn't really matter "

												If you're looking for a game to go 'trolling some n00bs' on with your mouse, keyboard and all the assists you could dream of... Then the market is flooded with games that cater just for you. Unfortunately for you though, this is not that game. Even in 'Game Mode' (with assists) this is far from an arcade game. Expect the learning curve to be in the hours not minutes. This game is difficult, you will need the tutorials, you will need to set up, tweak and retweak your controls, you will need to read the flight manuals and you will need to put some effort into you hunting down your target and securing that first kill. When you do all of those things and get that kill, it really does feel rewarding.At first glance one might look at the pricing and think this is some pay-to-win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when they see the price of the modules.... Let me tell you this. You don't have to buy the modules The Su-25t is a formidible fighter, capable of Air-to-Air and Air-To-Ground attacks, it is packed with one hell of an arsenal so you don't need any other module. However, having purchased the f15C module I can give you my honest impression of what this game is.Back in the day when I had my first computer with an el-cheapo flight stick I had a stack of flight sim games, mig29, f16, f22 Rapter and so on. These games all did the same thing, were often made by the same people, just they were packaged differently and you took control of a different plane. DCS World is no different. These modules are DLC to allow you to get an advantage over the opposition, they are simply a new simulator. DCS (in my opinion) is simply a free to play engine. So you get all the maps and physics but then you choose the simulation experience that suits you. The level of detail, the depth of the controls, the handling the maneuverability of the F15C that I bought is totally different to the SU-25t, in fact the whole experience is different... It's a very different plane for a very different purpose. That's what it all boils down to. My only negative point is that I don't have VR :( VR would really change the experience. The long and short of it is... If you're looking for a combat flight simulator and are willing to put the time and effort into learning how to fly I strongly recommnd this game.			"

												Pretty good overall, just a few bugs/glitches when you go from the Main Screen to Multiplayer aka the servers. Also, camera angles are a bit glitchy at times, but that may just be my controls being jerks.  I would buy the DLC, that is if it wasn't like $50 for ONE DANG CRAFT! If it were about $20, sure, but well, $50 is one Steam card! I could get Turbo Dismount, Next Car Game, and Broforce and something ELSE for the price of one BC(Buyable Content)!  Minus these few problems, it is a GREAT simulation. My favorite part is the misson editor. You get to make weather patterns, place units, and more just on the base game! So, great job Eagle Dynamics! Keep it up! :)			"

												Why are the negative reviews such a joke? Technical issues aside most of them are either ""too much simulation"" or ""too expensive aircraft!!"". What the Hell do people expect when they read ""simulation""??? As for aircraft prices, well yes they are expensive and yes i only buy them on sale. That beeing said, you will get your moneys worth. The ""full"" aircraft like the a-10c or mig-21 have as much content as whole other games. But i guess they would require to read the manual, do the tutorials etc. and or worst of all read mission briefings/look at maps! No not all aircraft are equal, mig-15/f86 lack content at the moment of writing, fc3 gives you a lot of planes but once you tried the ""full"" ones you rapidly lose interest. Missile ""behaviour"" could be better, as in a more logical flypath-simulation and stuff like target painting for and from wingman is surely missed.DCS World is not perfect by any means, but it does not deserve the many negative reviews by uniformed people!

The ""DLC"" are high fidelity representations of an aircraft, in my experience, all the ones I bought, (huey, a10c, BS2, gazelle) are amazing and 100% worth the money. Multiplayer is where Dcs really shines, OP BLUEFLAG being a very good example. All in all, I would recomend this to anyone interested in flight simming, but a HOTAS and a trackIR are basic necessities.			"

												The game is a lot of fun to play, for a simulator, has a lot of dynamic environment that is set to make the player feel like they're flying in real life, really love the thrust effects on the jets, has a very basic Mission editor, very easy to use, setting up single player scenarios, multiplayer scenarios or even some free flight and training missions, and every mission has it's own difficulity/visibility options that you get to check/uncheck for your preferences. First I've tried the free version of the Su-25T mastered it then got the FC3 DLC to master too, the game gets a little difficult at the beginning and seems very hard to master, with all the key-rebindings for your flightstick, but there are quite handy forums which you need to check to  help you with all of these, so I pretty much recommend it for those who love realism, dealing with the G-force and playing tactically at flying.However, here's my negative thoughts about it, but now, before you carry on and reading, know this, I know that lot of people might know things about this game better than I do, so they might tend to disagree or agree but please try to read this and think of the way that you could develope the game cuz I sure am trying to point out a thing or two as a point of interest.1•Really loved the Su-25T it's a SEAD & Anti-Ground Target Suppression attack aircraft, and I really loved seeing the basic Su-25, but I did not like the way the cockpit was built, the HUD seemed a bit slope hanging the corsshair right at the top of it, that is almost not visible or easy to shoot targets with, especially when trying to engage evasive maneuvering air targets, plus, it seems possible for me to switch between the Gun and the master-arm or the missile mod, but it's just impossible to switch from a missile to another, I tried it but it just did not work, knowing that fact that I double checked re-binding the keys for that and still it's a no-go.2•I noticed that you're releasing aircrafts that are pretty old, yet on your loading screen description, it says that the real manufactorurs of the aircrafts have nothing to do with the modules represented on your game, may then try releasing newer aircrafts, at least matching the new in-service Su-35B Flanker instead of the Su-27, the Su-37 Terminator instead of the Su-33, the F-15C with it's new processor and modern radar scanning systems, the Mig-29A/G/S with the modern MiG-29K with it's electronic and touch screen navigation screens?Su-25 1978.Su-27 1982 ~ Su-35S Flanker 2007.Su-33 1987 ~ Su-37 1996.F-15C 1976 (introduction).I'm pretty sure you won't have any problem estimating the 5th generation aircraft's SuperManeuverability (SM) abilities in your game, neither will you have problems publishing any aircrafts from the previous list of aircrafts provided above.3• During my test aerobatic flights that I've been doing for the last 20-30 hours I was able to perform some good maneuvers, one by the other until I came about the most crusial Russian aerobatic maneuvers with the Su-33 and the Su-27 which were the 360 Kullbit (Frolov chakra) and the Cobra (Pugachev Cobra) back spin, I was not able to perform any of these maneuvers until I got to know that these maneuvers can only be performed by using the Vectoring thrusts, and you guys did not privde this optic in the Russian 4th Generation Su-27 and the Su-33 which was rather disappointing for an aerobatic airshow lover, here's the video explaining what I meant  by these maneuvers exactly.


YouTube™ Video: Paris Air Show 2013 - Su-35 vertical take-off + Air Show (HD) 

			Views: 5,785,511		

			The Sukhoi SU-35 made a stunning performance at the Paris Air Show 2013. There were a few maneuvers I have never seen before and sometimes this skilled pilot made it very difficult for me to follow...		

4• And last I'd really love to see more interactive accessories in the aircrafts cockpits, (e.g.) one can simply choose to press buttons on their keyboard/flight stick, or Active the mouse clicking (Left ALT + C) and ticking the radars, flaps, gear and missiles even on non-fully simulated aircrafts, just the simple accessories for a good feeling's sake.Thank you very much for reading here's some of the new 4~5th generation cockpit's pictures.http://walkarounds.airforce.ru/avia/rus/mig/mig-29smt/airforce_ru_mig-29smt_070.jpgCheck more on google, the web's your bestfriend. :)			"

												If you like REALISTIC gameplay you will love this game.  If you are a fan of arcade shooters - something that anyone can play and be good at in a matter of minutes then you need to move on there is nothing to see here.  I am a vintaged gamer and have yearned for a game like this.  The physics model, graphics, attention to detail, immersive environments, a steep learning curve that keeps you coming back for more is exactly what I crave in a game.  I enjoy the BF4's of the world when I need a quicky but when I want to get serious I play DCS.  I built a PC specifically to be able to play this game.  I am a serious rookie but am enjoying the learning process and look forward to adding to my peripherals in the future to make this even better.  Thank you, DCS!  This is a what I've been waiting for.			"

												На данный момент единственный в своем роде симулятор боевой авиации. Если вы ищете приближенных к реальности боевых действий, либо хотите реализовать себя в виртуальной пилотажной группе - это игра для вас. Настоятельно рекомендую Джойстик и Track IR, либо его аналоги. Добро пожаловать.			"

Even without the MiG21, even the flaming cliffs 3 aircraft are well modeled - NOT 100% REALSITIC -. Overall this sim, is so... perfect. Yes, I just said this sim is perfect. 10/10.PS: This sim isn't balanced for multiplayer since it's accurately modeled, don't expect to be shooting down f-15s in a MiG15 with ease.PPS: Steam only records time played 50% of the time so I actually have more like 30 hours, not 12, which I know still isn't all that much.

												Best sim ever!!! Got into this sim when I saw a DCS: A-10C module on a 75% sale, and decided to give it a try.In the beginning, it was a big frustration. The learning curve was steep and the tutorials were too few and not very helpful. Imagine learning to swim with a float for 15min and then being thrown into the sea without any aid. Decided to give up within 3 days of purchase.Eventually I began to sit down, listen to the tutorials, take notes, view videos and check out the eagledynamics forum for beginner's tips.Took me a month before I was able to employ the guided munitions on ground targets, another month to practise taking out multiple targets in a single pass, and yet another month to effectively use the GAU-8 gun and CBUs. All that done with a trusty gamepad and the good 'ol keyboard. Picked up a Saitek x52 after a while and it's the only game that I enjoy besides Total War.After a year, and I'm dodging SAM missles in an A-10C and started larning to fly the F-15, SU-27, SU-25 and MIG-29. Not a pro, yet able to be an effective threat.Pros:1) Great detail and modelling of the aircrafts and weapons (literally see the animation of weapon deployment in every single detail).2) Great graphics and atmosphere (night landings and combat are a real challenge)3) Decent third-party support (tutorials, missions and mods)4) Huge map5) Fun multiplayer6) Sandbox-style fight sim7) New learning experience on every mission.Cons:1) Bad optimization (choppy framerates)2) Limited modern jets3) Limited tutorials and missions4) Feels like the whole game is in beta at times			"

												(WARNING, this is not a Video game as Battlefield, War Thunder and so on, it's a Combat Simulator. You will need to have at least a proper Joystick for this to be enjoyable. I let a friend borrow mine and I tried to play without it... That didn't go so weary well)Okey, for god sake Steam, put in a button so I can have between like and disslike... So I don't have to sit and have this dilemma to thumb up or down. After 15min I gave it up The entire simulator itself is just... Magic, I never knew that a aircraft simulator when I can look around in the cockpit and and pull, press, and switch on everything and it actually DO SOMETHING, existed!!! I'm not sure you can find anything better then this that both looks good, sound good, and with so much details, and the feel when I fly... Words can not describe how wonderfull this is.I only have one problem, and I both understand and not undstand why. And that is the price to buy the other aircrafts. Fine, if we say this newly released MiG for 44,99£ that's acceptable for my part.But when this 3 year old airplane cost as much, just no. Put down the price a little Plz. Maybe put down the price on one jet would be fine so those that is new to this and can actually put in maybe 25£ or even 30£ to give this Simualtor a try out for something different would be really nice. If they really enjoy it, I don't doupt they will buy the rest after. I will get the Huey later that's for sure when I can already see how wonderfull this simulator is with details, but that's me, don't be so sure if other will think the same. I think that could help.  Other thing I hope will happen, but it doesn't bother me, but could be a nice thing:-See my body in the airplane and he stretch his arm to press or switch (and i'm talking about an option you can turn on and off to have this) (PS. I just found that it's a thing, don't know how I missed that)-The ground people and my pilot when he bail out to have some proper animations when they walk, I mean, the animation is really awkward. -when I turn the camera when I see from the pilot view when I bail out that he to move his head, I don't think that should be much of a problem to fix, by the thought of how many other things they done. -It could be fun if the aircraft didn't just turn into a pile of nothing when it crash hard, it could just be fun for the enjoyment to be in the big crash when the aircraft flips around and slide over the ground when you make that enormous crash to the ground. Specially if I fly a jet in high speed and slowly get the belly of the plane closer and closer to the ground, and then just BOOM! I turn into nothing on the ground but smoke. -Maybe the things that is stationed on the ground could have some physics to? First time I tried to start from the ground, my right wing hit the stationed Helicopter, and that Heli was hard as a mountain. I don't ask for something super advanced, just that it maybe could move or something. I have some more, but eeh, getting to long now, those are the most ""important"" if I can name it so when it comes to those details. It might see as nitpicking, but it could make this simulator more immersive if you know what I mean.Other then that, it's free for god sake, you get a nice propeller plane free to mess around in. And a Su-25T if I remeber correct now, but in the Su-25T you can only fly it, not press any buttons and so in the cockpit. But you can do that with the other plane. So if you looking for a nice simulator, look no further.			"

												Dont buy, unless you are a glutton for punishment, have TitanX in SLi, and it is the only thing you intend to try and do for the rest of your life.Why?`Its too annoying`.:More?:Longer version:-Even a Haswell i7 gaming rig with 16Gb Ram & an Asus GTX1070 Strix (8Gb VRAM) will not run this at the highest settings at 1080p. @ 1080p ffs.And, after an update, the Thrustmaster HOTAS Warthog controls (& Saitek Combat Flight pedals) refuse to re-map beyond auto-axis. So, I gotta ask;- `Are they now employing chimps to code parts of the game?`.Thats $600+ of gear wasted on this trash.Life`s too short for this dogshyite.There is also not enough communicaiton/instruction as to how to proceed to get any of it functioning.Its also probably why NVidia refuse to have this game in ""GeForce Experience"", its so bad (as of Nov 2016).This gaming rig should kill this title... (as it dominates so many other flight/space/games); so it is the DCS devs (and the people with them) that are `At fault for Not refining the game to a point where it is accessible to the majority of customers`.So....... I will say...

												Let me start out by saying that there is literally no difference between this version and the standalone version of DCS 1.5. Sure you can buy two more aircraft on the DCS store page than there are currently on the steam store and updates are more frequent(constant bug fixes and rarely any new content) but otherwise they're basically the same game. DCS World looks pretty but the AI sucks, the mission editor sucks and the vanilla campaigns and missions are generic and boring af.The AI in this game is so s-tty that the AI controlled P-51 goes vertical in a dogfight. YA HEAR THAT! The P-51, a WWII era prop plane, goes vertical in a dogfight! The AI flies the P-51 like its a f-ing fighter jet! The jet ai is constantly spinning and turning in a vertical dogfight while using full afterburn. The ai in DCS World is more likely to run out of jet fuel than get an actual gun kill. If the ai controlled aircraft in DCS isn't pirouetting through the air like it has gone full r-tard then it's probably flying into or straight through the ground.Also, just so you know. The Russian devs had to nerf the heck out of American missiles so that the game would be fair for people flying Russian planes. In real life the AIM-120B/C would be about 66% more effective and have double the range whereas the R-27R would perform like a Vietnam era AIM-7D and hit nothing 75% of the time.			"

												I really hope the game developers read this review....The GAME NEEEDS CHECKPOINTS!!!For a simulator that is focused on ultra realism there are some things missing for sure. The game is really fun don't get me wrong, I love how the game really focuses on the mechanics of flight and how important the physics play into flying. This review is all centered around the Huey Mod as this was the one I'm really trying to master. 1) The training/tutorial sucks. I know this a beta but for someone who never played a serious helicopter sim in his life this definetly took some time getting used to. The training only had a few videos and then it plops you in and its almost like ""ok you got that quick vid, you got it!"" no,,,,no I didn't...Thankfully there were some awesome Youtube vids that I was able to turn to to explain the finer points. Theres no training on how to land effectivly, no training on how to land or fly in exceptionally windy conditions, No kind of video or training explaining what things will trigger or cause failure...just boom! oh great...my engine is on fire...no idea why...Theres no training on how to work the complex radio system, in the campaing its just goes ""ok set the ADF to this..."" Had no idea until I had to check Youtube (a godsend) The game is fun no lie, the ultra realism is very apealing to someone who's always dreamed of flying a helicopter (Huey mod) but the game (in the campaign especially) would be alot more fun if there were checkpoints along the way that you could respawn at if you died. I get that mistakes are going to be made, but I've been stuck on one particular mission for a very long time as the mission has you trecking a very sizable distance and along the way you can make a mistake and boom dead...no chance to repeat or replay from a landing point. Frustrating to say the least!In the end, would I recommend it? Yes, for those who want a ultra realistic game that literally feels like you're flying a huey...but be prepared for a spotty training videos that leave alot to be desired and know that the ultra realism means that if you die....have to start allllll over.

												This went from being one of my favourite games, and best flight simulators, to a total mess.The devs are rolling out updates that just seem to make the game progressively more buggy and unstable. MP servers are dying because of this. Just now, the game ended up using all the RAM in my 16GB system due to a memory leak... It also takes years for every little plane module to be added in the game. I'm guessing the studios doing the devving must be doing it as a part-time or hobby thing...			"

												It's great. Truly. This game is pretty awesome. Only problem?DLC's. More precisely, their prices. In Lithuania, for example, to get all the DLC, you need to pay 800 euros. Thats like, an entire average job paycheck. It's redicilous and makes no sense.Good game pretty much ruined by greedy developers(don't go all 'they need money to develop games' and stuff, thats not an excuse to limit the entire playerbase to the 1% imo.)Heres some advice. Get IL2 1946 for 10 bucks, install the CUP mod and boom, you have WW1 planes through to modern era jets with a lot of campaigns if you wish to install them, and hundreds of hours of fun.			"

												The best simulator out in the market. it will be even better when DCS 2.5 will come out and more modules like the F-14. You start with SU-25T and TF-51 that are o.k but when you buy the clickable jets like the MIG-21 or the A-10C that are amazing you really enjoy what's the game can offer you. I recomend to download the stand alone version for quicker updates and more jets that are not available in steam (for now Viggen Mirage 2000 and Spitfire) and you CANT play this game without a controller even a cheap one will be fine but for the A-10C you will need something more expensive (i somehow managed to go around it with 30$ controller not every cheap joystick have the ammount of buttons that mine does)			"

												-THIS MIGHT JUST APPLY TO ME-Im finding the control of the aircraft to be troublesome. Meaning that my control inputs both through my flight stick and keyboard, are either not read, delayed significantly, or have very weak input, which is a shame because it makes the control of the aircraft almost impossible. With that said, the game does look cool, and enjoyable, however, I am unable to experince more of the world, its combat environment, or other features like that. Once again, my issue may just apply to me, but be warned, it is a show stopper. I have to not recommened this game for that reason.			"

Those servers that are still working are lacking players and mostly u are up in the skies just to finish off casual targets like a stationary trucks or a free flight maybe even with no weapons. It was fun back in time but now this game is obsolete. i own like 95% of dlcs and i can say that most of them are good only for a free flight. what? U wanna fight su-27 on Saber good luck m8.

												Note: This review is for the Vive version.Pros:Free to play if you like the Mustang or FrogfootTracks head movement well while looking ahead or to the sidesDetailed cockpits are neatCons:Head tracking is extremely jerky from about 4 o'clock to 8 o'clock even on the lowest settingsDefault head positioning is somewhere about three inches inside the headrestAll UI elements track to the head so things on the outer edges are virtually impossible to read, including instructions during the tutorialsFor Vive owners at least, the detailed cockpits are basically eye candy, since there's absolutely no interactivity at all, meaning that to do anything you have to keep lifting up the headset to see the keyboardSerious, Egregious Cons:The game didn't respond well to keyboard input; I had to press each key combination between 10 and 15 times before it would acknowledge the input, assuming it responded at all.  Due to the nonresponsive keyboard, I wasn't even able to exit the game.  I eventually managed to force quit the game with some fancy mousing, and discovered that DCS had actually disabled my keyboard completely, which would explain why even Ctrl-Alt-Del wouldn't work.From the reviews I've seen I'm sure DCS World is playable and possibly even enjoyable, but it certainly didn't give me the opportunity to experience that first-hand.

												Thought I'd go over this piece of software once again.Out of the box you get 2 airplanes:- The TF-51 is the training variant of the famous P-51 and gets no weapons. If you just want to learn more about flying and working the Mustang, this is great. If you're looking for anything combat related it's worthless.- The SU-25T was part of the Flaming Cliffs expansion for LOMAC almost 10 years ago. ED praised it for the enhanced realism but not much has happened since then. Like all FC3 planes it ONLY uses keyboard commands instead of an interactive cockpit. It flies like a brick and russian avionics are not the easiest to work with, so this isn't really a gift to new players, it's a reminder that you get what you paid for. ""You paid nothing, so you get this (in contrast) ♥♥♥♥♥♥ plane. Please buy our DLCs.""You won't be flying anything else until you pay for it but you get access to multiplayer and the mission editor. What you're gonna do with the latter, besides training missions when all you know is a crappy ground attack plane, I don't know but it's a nice bonus for those more advanced (who probably bought some DLC already anyways).Speaking of DLCs (excluding FC3): Full price for one highly detailed plane isn't anything new and learning the plane over weeks or months will make it well worth the pricetag, after all that's what you bought it for, right? If not, ED offers 'game mode' which turns DCS into an arcade game ""for new players"".Well, you're not really learning from 'game mode', nobody cares about it and yet it's a selling point. Are there seriously people who buy a full price module and turn on game mode, which makes the module worth maybe 5€?Flaming Cliffs 3 can be fun but is weak as a simulator. As mentioned on the SU-25T you don't get an interactive cockpit in any of these planes. You're lucky to find a switch that moves when you press the corresponding button. Some of it is due to classified information, which in the past led to the cancelation of other modules like the F/A-18E or SU-27SM, because without these information you can't accurately simulate the plane. Makes sense.This makes ED a bunch of hypocrates because they ""demand high quality from 3rd party developres"" while at the same time recycling some 10+ year old content. Yes, there have been some updates but I still feel like playing the same ancient simulation again.I also feel this way when I look at some of the non-flyable planes. The graphics aren't an issue since you rarely see these up close, but their flight models are. The MiG-25 for example can fly with only one wing and the weapons will just hover in place. It's a known problem for years, but it hasn't been fixed.Well, AI can be too dumb to fly anyways. I can't recall how often I engaged multiple bandits on the highest difficulty, just to find half of them circling around somewhere (at stall speed) instead of getting behind me, like they are waiting to be tagged in.Ground forces don't have noteworthy AI at all. They either sit in place or follow waypoints, even roads if desired. Once engaged however they will scatter a bit and then just sit there, waiting to die. All they do to defend themselfes is shoot back when you get into range. I think it's balanced by the fact that AI can see through trees anyways, making forests 100% worthless as cover. At least amphibious vehicles can cross rivers if the bridge is destroyed.Multiplayer in a flight sim should be the greatest thing but for 2017 it's really bad.For starters, there is a memory leak somewhere that ED seems to deny exists. A well populated server can reach 30+GB memory usage in a few hours, ultimately resulting in a crash. There is no dedicated server to at least get rid of all the unnecessary graphics data nor a command line parameter to automate the restart. This causes problems on the player side too. If somebody joins there is a chance the whole server will freeze for a second because the server is doing something I suppose. After all these years of online multiplayer this is pathetic, even for a sim.The majority of servers are bad anyways. The same old training mission used as a template, misplaced aircraft that get damaged on spawn, idiotic placement of ground units, worthless AI settings, team stacking even though most PvP missions offer the same planes on both sides (which also makes visually telling friend and foe appart almost impossible, even when zooming in to try making out the insignias) ... and let me ask: why would you include the unarmed TF-51 or any other WW2 plane in a PvP mission with modern anti air? Trying to simulate ""The Final Countdown""?Bottom line:Simulations have always been special, including DCS' precursors but I don't see the leap into the next generation. Quad cores aren't fully utilized, same with RAM, partially worthless AI, lack of polish across most areas, no official server/admin tools, long lasting issues getting denied and never fixed. Even if DCS is the best military flight sim out there, it's still bad.			"

												Fun game, but the amount a DLC costs is pretty ridiculous and I'm pretty sure a lot of people would back me up on this. I mean, the amount of money you'd have to spend to get at least half of the dlc for this game would be equivilent to buying 5 $60 games. In some cases though it is worth it, but the fact they don't really have muchf freeware planes, let alone a helicopter.			"

												VR mode is amazing... Well it could be. How the hell do you wanna use a mouse or keyboard with a HTC vive on your head? The HTC Vive commands appear as 2 left hands (that's fine for me when it gets to flying) and you can't simply use the commands with your ""hand"". Why? This game can give you serious motion sickness in VR. I will buy this game as soon as it comes with hand controls.			"

												I think that this game is a very good flight sim what lets it down in my opinion is the lack of default control pad support the free to play version comes with partial support however thats a joke and the dlc I bought for £25 stated that the DLC had full control support which was a untrue statements as there's no gamepad support at all. This game is only good if you like to use keyboards and mouse , joystick and pedal might work better but I don't own this so cant say whether it will work out the box.I like the game and would love to play it but its impossible to play base in lack of support,  all games should have all support for all types of imputs the way it is now no but if they address this issue then yes but until then I've shelved my copy.

												Not for me I'm afraid. This game is insanely heavy on controls/key bindings and the dlc is insanely expensive too.I don't doubt it's a realistic flight simulator to the point of being virtually identical to the real thing, but you need to basically stop the rest of your life to learn everything. Even binding controls to your joystick still leaves semingly zillions of key strokes to somehow swat and learn. I would imagine it's probably less of a mental strain to fly the real thing!If you like dedicating countless hours of your life just trying to remember what's next, then feel like you've achieved a miracle just by landing again, then this is for you. But aside from boasting about it on a forum you're not going to get much regonition compared to a real pilot!For me when a game stops becoming fun and becomes a tedious chore to manage, then it's time to go elsewhere. I want to enjoy my down time, not be pressured like I'm in some exam! As an air cadet many years ago I flew DH Chipmunks - and that was really fun as it meant something. Only for the hardcore enthusiast I'd say, and the richest ones too.   "

												Frankly DCS has become a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ The framerates are horrible, it hangs up every minute for a minute. When joining a server there is a 50% chance it crashes when loading the map, a 50% chance it crashes when loading the player list, a 50% chance to crash when you get into the pit and a 99% it crashes when you actually lift off.I liked dcs once, it's a good sim. but they just messed it up lately, particularly when they merged it all into DCS World the performance went down the drain.Then there is all the WW2 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t when we're waiting for F-18, EFA2000 and such, pumping out old, easy to make aircraft to milk the last penny out of everyone. What's the point of having an F86 when the other team just picks Su27? You're ♥♥♥♥ed 99.99% of the time. All the aircraft are ancient, outdated models with the exception of the A10C or are with a basic flight model and no clickable cockpit, or both.They promise releases at one date, and three years later they deliver.And DCS STILL lacks a modern multipurpose aircraft that can deploy both A2A and A2G munitions. Yes, sure the MIG-29 can drop a bomb or two. But that's about it. And of course it's with the basic flight model, without clickable cockpits or any guided weapons against ground or naval targets.Then there are the prices. Yes, the a10 is worth it. When on a sale for 75% off. But a map for 50 bucks? Then some ancient pewpew WW2 prop aircraft for another 40 bucks? Or an ancient Gen3 plane with missiles that miss 95% of the time and no radar? No thank you.DCS itself is good. The software though is crap, performance is terrible.As an alternative I recommend Falcon BMS. It runs smoothly and is actually a more accurate simulation to begin with, even if not as visually pleasing. On top of that it has the dynamic campaign feature, where DCS has only mission based missions with no save function. And of course it's free, developped by the community. You do need Falcon 4.0 for that though, which is less than 10 bucks on steam. And with that you get BMS for free. Yes, it's not as easy to set up, but it's gotten a lot better and you only need to do it once anyway.Of course the F-16 is the flagship in BMS but there is also plent of other aircraft you can fly. The F-16 is a fully capable multipurpose aircraft with air to ground radar, targeting pod and SEED/DEAD capabilities as well as limited anti surface (ships) capabilities with the harpoon missile.There are different maps, all of which are totally FREE, made by the community. Currently avaiable maps are the korean peninsula with parts of japan and china and russia (default, comes with the game); balkans; israel with syria and parts of egypt and jordan and others, as well as some other maps.

												If you plan on having a VR experience with this I can't recommend it. It isn't tailored for it, especially since it only allows for mouse and keyboard which, with a headset on, is not ideal. Not just because of it's complicated button scheme that you will likely screw up on multiple times, but because your mouse is never locked in game nor does it work properly. I kept opening files and apps on my computer just trying to use the mouse in game. It is free so I can't complain but it's a shame. Uninstalled all because the control scheme wasn't thought out for a VR experience. I personally believe you could've easily implemented VR controller support, if not for steering then at least for the engine start ups, buttons, switches, etc.			"

												I really wanted to recomend this game however there are certain things that alone would not be make of an issue but as you keep finding them you just want to give up. For example the menu music is very load for headset user. You go to audio and lower it and nothing then lower other audios and nothing and finnaly turn all sound off and still no change. Seem you have to restart the game to get it to notice you changed the game volume. The next issue I had was the game hung. no biggie not the first game to hang. I closed it but now steam believes the game is running so I have to launch the game from the game folder. there is nothning in my task manager that shows and thing like DCS or run.exe. I am sure a reboot wil fix it but I just want to play.So wierd things like this happening and forcing me to restart the game to see if the change to things like volume will stick. The final one was my Joystick. I have the X-55 Rhino and DCS fresh install does not recognise the throttle. At first I thought it was my setup so I tested it in windows devices and printers it works just fine. I then fired off War Thunder and it worled just fine as it did with elite dangerous. I did research and followed 3 different ""fixes"" none of them work. Seem the game has issues with this joystick.So at my wits end I cannot recomend this game for these reasons			"

												I can not recommend sorry. War Thunder is better for both the beginner and expert. It also has some awesome areal dog fighting.PROS:-Nice graphics-It does the job as a flight simCONS:-Greed. I could never endorse a game which charges over $600 for DLC. I understand the base game is free. However, lets say you purchase the P-51D Mustang. $29.99 invested in the game. Not bad for a flight sim. But for you $30 you can fly 3 planes. Thats it. Pretty poor for a flight sim. Say you want to fly a MIG 21. The game is now an $80 investment. This is simply not good enough. If you want dogfighting go play War Thunder. If you want a better flight sim experience go play FSX or even better...X-Plane.			"

Found the cockpit very nice in VR, but was unable to figure out how to start the plane or take off, looked though options and found that everything is mapped yo keyboard...... no good if your in VR!!!i see the option to map to an Xbox controler, but it is very complicated, you have to map each key yourself, there is no standed ""use controller option"" ended up just leaving the game for that reason. game looks like it could be amazing in VR in the devlopers can make it easy to fly with a VR headset on your face and an easy button mapping for controlers.This review is for using this game in VR only, and should not impact any users playing it useing a screen.VR Version rating:  1/10			"

So you may have to wait 24 hours to a week or more to get the ability to play the game you have already registered and played on multiplayer.And censorship in the Steam forums by moderators is a problem as in their own forum.Directly from a moderator:""Furthermore; if you have any questions regarding moderation of your posts, please contact a Moderator through the private messaging system, as public dicussion of administrative or moderator actions is against forum rules.""If you look, usually it is inaction that is being commented on; weeks of it.Their mods run the steam forums the same way.  Russian censorship!In the Eagle forums these problems are an infestation.They could fix most of these problems by simply putting a server in the EU or in the US.  Many things are blocked coming into the US and they acknowledge that.  But the problem lands on the customer and the literally one guy they pay to help!Update to the original review:After almost a year since my requests (Jan 2015 to Dec 30 2015), finally received the password reset email; I hadn't tried since then.  The best part is, it's all in Russian.DO NOT BUY PRODUCTS FROM THIS COMPANY EVER!  THEY SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM STEAM PERMANENTLY, ALONG WITH THEIR COMRADS THAT SENSOR THE FORUMS!			"

												After years of developping still there is no save option for mission so players can not built more complicated missions or campagins. There is no dynamic campaginIf you wana to have fun with formation flying things like that buy it. If you count that you  can play complicated missions, capturing towns, airfields, something like battlefield or ARMA but on simulation level (what would be nice), dont buy it. Because nobody has not made such a mission on campagin but it is posible to make-devs dont care about itIts a good game, nice looking, phisics is also on very good level you need to spend some teens of hours to learn how to fly and fight that is realy nice. Almost everything is very good here except of one thing.Digital Combat Simulator can not simulate big military operations, MMO etc. It offers tanks, artilaery, planes, helicopters, ships, AWACS, EWR, AA and many many more + posibility to take comand over vehicles/groups or even drive them but for what? there is no dynamic campagin. In multipalyer guys has crafted some good missions but they are concentrated mostly on PVPing on air than on gound that cooperation (but it should be opposite because it real planes only support military operations but the most important ground forces are). DCS has few misions built in, if you want more you have mission editor, then everything you have to built self!!!  If you got bored of PVPing or formation flying then you have to become a GAME DEVELOPER and spend thousends of hours to create good mission/campagin to play (like me, I spend more time in editor than in air/ground). To built something good on good level you need to spend houndreds of hours to create mission, I will not tell about dynamic campagin (some thousends hours). Developpers dont planing to make online dynamic campagin (join/leave when you want and choose automaticly generated mission to do in online campagin) but it is posible to create it but they prefer to create new modules for $ then something what is missing for years here. just look here:over 100 pages...answer from ED? IS not posible due to overstress of PC. It is posible when you make deactivating object witch are not necesery now (players are far). I have implemented over 200 groups and over 4100 objects. Its working. 4200 is unstable.In my opinion, Its beter for devs to produce more modules for not finished "" DCS wrold"", because its easier and faster to do, than realy needed stuff like dynamic campagin.P.S dont tell devs that DCS has not been thought throught well...you will get BANNED :D			"

												This game uses antique Starforce DRM, which will deny you your content unless you're lucky and it decides to activate.  The game has arbitrarily locked me out of the game I've bought. I can watch the AI play the missions without me while the ""automatic"" activation never ends. It looks great, but I can't help but feel that I've been robbed.			"

												This is a hardcore simulator, massive number of controls.  The interface is understandably poorly implemented, as the majority of the people who will like this game are aviators, or at least people who enjoy step learning curves.The audio controls are terrible, they don't update without starting the application.  They also have different audio levels for the launcher app and the simulator app.  The process of switching between the launcher and the simulator is horrifying to watch.  progress bars going backwards, screen flickering.This is not a fun relaxing game.

												This game's a little over my head in terms of detail. The controls allow you to manage far too many different aspects of the plane for my taste. I did finally get the hang of flying, but after trying and failing to arm and use my weapons for the 30th time, I know this game is not the one for me. Maybe I'll try again sometime when I have some hours to memorize the keys and their modifiers, of which there seem to be a couple hundred.This is not a game for simple people like me.			"

												At first look this game looks amazing, looks like the ultimate flying simulator for flying simulator fans.the graphics looks amazingly detailed and high quality.The controls are are detaild down to the cockpit lights, and the opening and closing of the cockpity roof.At first look this game looks incradible... that is until you find out the amout BUGS in this game.Game haulting bugs, and bad UX. for example: when trying to finish the tutorials (without them you wont be able to play the game), if you restart the tutorial, the tutorial will get stuck on the instruction. which will make you close the game trough Windows , since there is no other way to close the game when in mission, making you frustrated from all the long loading times you have to go trough. every time you start a mission at the main menu, the game completly shutsdow and opens up the mission instance, i have no idea why they did that like that, but that makes loading time 3x the normal loading times for this kinda game. eventually i was tired of waiting in loading screen, and tired of exiting and entering the game, so i had to uninstall. I have to say i looked up the solution for the game haulting bugs of this game, and saw no reffence to them except some QA employees telling other people who experienced these bugs that ""we couldn't replicate it on our computers"" excuse, you know... ""it worked on my computer"". that just show the indifferance of the developers to bugs in the game.To bad because what could have been maybe the best flight simulator for PC is complitly unplayable due to inefficent QA and bug solving.All in all - potentially a great game, unplayble due to bugs, long loading times, and bad UX.I give it 3 out 10 (beacuse of the bugs otherwise it would get an 8 or 9)			"

												I downloaded DCS world earlier today, it took a long time to download (around 11 hours) but i was excited to play it because of all of the positive reviews on the store page and because i enjoy plane simulator games. However, after the long wait, i was ready to play the game i had wanted for quite a while, but never had a good enough computer to play, this christmas i bought an NVIDIA GTX 750 TI so that i could run more games on PC, i was excited to play and opened DCS world for the first time, straight away, a small black window, a console window, appeared, after a few seconds it vanished and the game booted up, i adjusted the resolution and put the game onto highest settings, loaded up the free flight mode and then, i was kicked out of the game onto the desktop, after a while it loaded back up and loaded free flight, it kept doing the same thing, once i decided to wait and eventually, free flight loaded.i couldn't wait to play, i tried to turn the plane, and it went spiralling out of control into the poorly designed, two-dimensional, badly rendered textures of the ground, the plane then exploded. i waited, the game never respawned me, instead i was taken to an airport ingame, and forced to watch a random aeroplane sit still, i tried moving the mouse, pressing keys etc. but nothing would happen, i pressed on Esc and clicked on quit, i was kicked out of the game again for a while, then my entire desktop went black for 5 minutes, i pressed Ctrl+Alt+Delete but DCS would not close, it eventually loaded the game again, and it crashed instantly.I rate this game 7.5/10, not enough black screens			"

												I would NOT buy into this. Their customer service is the worst that I have ever seen. It is a nice sim but they take their time with everything and always delay things, saying this is how it is, oh please...find some people with some experience and stop working part time. If you dont believe me just look at their track record! You can download it for free and you do get the Su25, I actually want you to download it. Then post on their forums about critique and you will soon be banned. zthey take years to develop new things, this is because they dont have any competition out there, if they did there would be a little more sense of urgency in their work and how they treat their customers. They have 3rd Party Devs that create modules and never release manuals for them (Belsimtek), then they expect you to learn by flying it...really! Its a nice sim but not worth to buy modules full price, they have sales once a quarter, if you do want to give in them get the modules when they are 75% off.			"

												Don't buy for casual fun. Go with microsoft flight simulator. Don't think the developers realize one is sitting at a desk with a real job and the fact a ""game"" is supposed to suspend reality for most part and be fun. Why is COD such a good game??			"

												I'd love to give an in depth review of my ""experience"" playing this flight sim, but said ""experience"" can simply be summed up by using four words. This game crashes constantly.			"

												This is a complicated enough game that tutorials are pretty necesary.  I've played complicated sims before like Kamov Hokum, but each has it's own level of detail for targeting/controls so you pretty much need to learn each sim.The problem is the tutorials are broken.  The spacebar is used to proceed through the tutorial, but even with the default key mapping I enver changed, it does not work.  Googling found lots of other people with same problem.  I finally found a key mapping that managed to get the tutorial to start, but then later it froze again and nothing I did would get it to proceed.  Seems like the tutorial, something that is very linear, should be easily testable with default control settings, but apperently even after numerous reports from users, they haven't bothered fixing it.

												I downloaded and attempted to run this game with the occulus rift.Boy was that a mistake.The menu and HUD ignore head tracking, so you can't rebind any of your keys, or even see what they are already bound to because your eyeballs are not meant to see and read text at the very top of your vision. You were meant to move your head so that it enters your field of view.The game itself is completely unplayable in VR. Everything has its own complicated keybinding ( Ctrl + Shift + Del = turn on power, F5 + num9 + roll your face on the left half of the keyboard is turn power off) I'm sure plenty of basement dwellers enjoy that kind of immersion but it is COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE while you are wearing a VR headset.Why?Because you cannot see the keyboard to execute the overly complicated commands.Duh.Maybe this is a revolution in gaming. I will never know. Don't bother with this if you were hoping for an engaging VR experience.			"

												Be very careful what add ons you pay for, as some are way overpriced. UH-1H is awesome. It has tutorials and a campaign. It was a little overpriced as it did not come with any unique maps. I got it on sale so it's been well worth the price.F-86 on the other hand was a complete rip off. Even on sale at $30 it was overpriced. It is the plane. That's it. No tutorials, no maps, and no campaign. I think there are 6 missions. I notice the WWII planes are the same which is why I haven't bought any. Until DCS offers free maps, tutorials, and campaigns like with some of the other planes at the same price DON'T buy. Total rip off. It's to bad because there is some huge potential. Get IL-2 if you want WWII planes. Cliff's of Dover with mods is great. Battle of Stalingrad is still lacking a true campaign mode but is still far better than DCS with nothing. If I could I would give DCS both a thumbs up, for the modules they have done right and a huge thumbs down for the rip offs that they have release of late.			"

												Seems like a very nice simulation. Unfortunately keeps crashing on my PC. You can't get direct support from the developer. You have to dig through forums and boards.I've got no time for this...I'll just pass on and continue with one of my seamless games...			"

												I can see where this game is coming from, its graphics aren't the best but still alright.I tried to like this, I really did but the controls are so unresponsive and slow.It's one of those games where you need to put MANY hours learning the controls and how the jet feels and flies.			"

												If not immediately, then give it a minute... You will notice how annoying the camera views are.... None the less, your a clever chap, try and change the camera views, invert the horizontal axis if you wish... its still♥♥♥♥♥♥ cockpit and aircraft view are opposite... Going back to MFSX or X-Plane. Gosh! I just wanted to blow crap up anyways			"

												Downloaded the inexplicably 20GB open beta that contains only 2 planes and waited several hours to try on my oculus.  Had it crash immediately on the briefing screen right before a mission on every setting I can think of.  Noticed online that this is a very common problem with seemingly no solution.			"
