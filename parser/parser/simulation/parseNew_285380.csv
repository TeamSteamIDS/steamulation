								It is too glitchy, when in the menu it just scrolls through on its own. I have tried to restart it but nothing works.			"

								No wheel support? Even if it`s Early Stage, it is a must if you make a game with trucks to drive. I had to remove my G27 in order to be able to navigate thru menu.No support for Track IR 5. Poor menu. Can`t hear the AI traffic sounds, and also the truck has no real sound. There is too much work ahead for this game and i`m sure that this game will never be completed. Same fate as Fernbus Simulator. Premium price, premium price for a bus also and poor development. This game is heading into that direction.Not recomended.			"

								Well I couldn't wait for this game to be released today. But what a dissapointment. No wheel Support at all and i did manage  badly to get my pc 360 controller to work but its still not good. I was not impressed with the graphics compared to Ets2 or other driving sims I have. For a game in ""Advanced Stages"" it's very poor. Avoid for the time being untill they have got it fixed. Needs Wheel support and done to the standard of other good sims with ffb. I think Multi screen support would be nice  too. I am a fan of  Early Access but after playing with this for about 30 min i gave up as its not playable in its current state.			"

								In its current state I cannot recommend this. As others have said no steering wheel support which should be in the game from the start of release. When in the game there is no clear instruction/tutorial as to what to do. I couldnt find any cargo or delivery point to go to. The map wasnt very clear because it doesnt show where you are. It seems to me that at the moment all you can do in the game is drive the one truck with no real purpose.Refunded and will wait to see if it improves. I hope it does			"

								Maybe its because it's a new game and there aren't a lot of video's to show you how to do it but I find it a really dificult game and not really good explaned.. Your getting in to the game without any tutorials or anything you can read a quick tutorial but I don't find it really help full it would be better to have a real tutorial because know your just put in the game and you need to find it on your own			"

								Since this is a early acces, there is a lot to do. However, this game has the potential. The driving mechanics are pretty good, I didn't expect that since I put more then 350 hours in ETS2.Give this sim a change, there are many things to add in the upcomming patches which they addressed!

								Update: There is a video showing how to set up the G27 wheel and the LIMITATIONS of using the Unity Engine.When I made my review, I had not seen this video. The wheel works reasonably but not fine enough, accelerator pedal is nice and works as expected, the brake pedal is pretty good ~ clutch not supported ~ I can't find the vid now!!! Not a release candidate IMO. No Wheel or Pedal controls:Wheels and Pedals are essentials. Unplayable.			"

								Unbelievable, a game that is more terrible than Fernbus Simulator ... Respect.The facts:Negative:- intro is not skippable (annoying, but ... yeah whatever)- ANY joystick, wheel or whatever is interfering with the main menu, i.e. depressing the clutch, brake or gas or having the wheel turned even a slight bit in any rotation makes the gui go crazy and skips through all buttons. Comparable to pressing and holding the TAB key in a web form or something like it.- you  have to use combined pedals (thrustmaster t500rs), or else you have to hold gas and brake depressed equally in the middle in order to operate inside the main menu- you need a third foot or a rock to perform the same to the clutch pedal, or else it does the same skipping stuff in the bottom botton line (input menu, for instance).- you cannot declare any deadzone. my t500 is set to maxium turning degree, which is 1080. i need to perform almost half a rotation in any direction to make the truck turn. but as if that was not annoying enough, the wheel ingame makes also almost half a rotation, so you are not able to follow the track, even at below half city speed limit.- you are not able to configure a button or a key for ""right turning signal"". the ""button"" or menu entry to click on is simply not activated for click events, this is ridiculous.- no trackir support - you have to look around with your mouse.pros:- graphics are ok, not awesome of overwhelming, but okall in all, i cannot recommend the game at the given time, due to that very, very crappy gui and the too minimalistic configuration settings of the input devices. although it was released five days ago, some of these issues, like the unclickable turning indicator config button thingy, are indicators to the project management's internals.""I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production.""

								As the game is still being developed I understand some things are not finished and that they need a lot of polishing. As far as I saw the game, the game has a lot of potencial to become something awesome. Very cool mechanic that you can walk around the truck and enter the truck at your own choosing. But how do you exit truck? Tryed clicking everything, no help. Some issues that I had: Gps screen - hard to see gps route with it being purple and roads brown. Unzoom the screen a bit, currently you see the turn as you are doing it Front axle -  wheels at wierd angle when you do full lock Key mapping - it might be better to just map stuff to one key (like lights) and just cycle thru options Accelerator - there is noticable lagg when you press the accelator, you hear jump in revs but truck movs 1 sec later Wheel - no wheel support ( I read that it's coming soon) Mirrors - not adjustable jet (or i couldn't hit the butons) Zoom - Needs interior zoom Cruise control - Not there and so needed Sound - Too loud in the cab, like sound was recorded inside hood and just pasted in cab Air - tweak air consumption, and shortage of air shood lock all axles from moving and not just lock steering on front.All in all, the game has a lot of potencial and I'll keep on following and playing.Full review here :

								I can see potential in that game. I hope the developers add controller support as they said. Driving will be much better. Now it is awful... really awful. Many Problems with the menue. Had to disconnect all my gaming devices and reboot Windows 10. Do i recommend this game? Not easy to say :\  51% Yes, because the roadmap looks promising. ;)			"

								For an early access game, it is very developed. The bad thing is that it doesn't have a tutorial and you need to read the Input Options in Options before you start because you will need to know what keys are used for what action. The truck has real automatic gears and there is no option for simple automatic gears like in ETS. Keep this in mind because you will need to switch to reverse and press forward to actually back up. Personally, I like this type of simulation, although they should add the simple one as an option for not scarring some players away.If you played Farm Expert 17 then you are familiar with this type of driving. You will need to press R and T to go up and sown into gears. They are as follows when looked down from the driver seat to your right: +D  D  N  R  -R.  Look at that knob and press R or T till you get the idea of how it works.I can run the game on low with minimum lag but I saw the game looks quite good at max graphics. It acctually looks better and it is better optimized then Bus Simulator 17. Hopefully, the devs will work further on optimization.I am only driving with the keyboard, as I do the other driving games, so from this point of view, the truck runs pretty smoothly on streight roads but it is bit wonky on trurns. There should be added a turn sensitivity slider They need to do a little more work on this turning too.If you don't feel like you want to support this game development by paying 15 euros for it, then do not to buy it at this stage just for giving a negative review. It has potential and it may be worth to play later on when it will be officially released.			"

								Maybe hold off buying until the game starts filling with content.With Wheel support and controller support just been added to the game, its making great progress in the right direction, even though these features should of been a must from the get go. Although not all Wheels are supported, included the G27. Menus and overall interface are still lacking and need a polish up. No direction of what to do from Start up. as of right now i cannot really recommend buying untill some sort of career mode is added. i know there is deliveries that can be made but i dont know what purpose they hold because i have not played the game long enough to find out. With the game being updated as quick as it is i believe this will be a good contender with ETS and ATS.			"
