												This looks like a game that is still in development.  The manual, and some of the text within the game is in French while the rest of the text, and the audio is in English.  The AI assistant you're given is incredibly annoying because the speed, and intonation of her speech is random, and wild.  She sounds like a lunatic!  The game has a learning curve, for sure, but good luck with that unless you speak French.  If you've played resource management games before (like SimCity), you may have an easier time picking this up, but that doesn't mean you'll want to play.  I actually own the very latest SimCity, and that gaming experience is a smooth pleasure compared to this game.  It stutters, and lags with every click.  When it does work, it's a dull mess.  It's an eyesore of a game, too.  Like an old DOS game.  Embarrassing.  It's not worth $1 because it's useless without a lot of other players involved, and no one is going to want to join you in this nightmare.			"

												God damn it, this game is bad.I got this thinking: ""Well, I bet this is so bad that it's funny"". Guess what, I was wrong, this is NOT a so-bad-it's-good kind of game, no, this is just plain bad, let me tell you why:-Buggy as hell.-Nice concept, but HORRIBLY implemented.-Really slow.-Crashes a lot.-Bad sound quality.-Little to no gameplay.-IN-GAME STORE, where you have to pay real money to get in-game money. Why in the world would they think that someone would buy that?!       In conclusion, don't buy this game, not even for a joke or because you think it'll be funny, buy Bad Rats if you want that.			"

												Just don't. Even if this game were free getting it is a terrible idea.Pros-Cool conceptCons-Grammatical errors throughout-Looks like something straight out of the 90s-Events for individual cities are limited and incorrect-Crashes often-Those grammatical errors could quite possibly be killing me.This is obviously a low-budget game and is not worth the money. With that being said, if the devs update to fix errors and add things it may change my mind.			"

												How bad could the game be for a dollar? Amazingly bad. Spelling problems everywhere, some of the game isn't even in english. The UI looks like it was put together by a 5 year old and the interface has so many bugs that it's unplayable. I would go as far to say that this is one of the few games steam should PULL from the market right away. Before more people get scammed!			"

												I'm sure every single free game on steam is better than this game. The loading is extremely slow, graphics are awful, and the game manual is in French. I don't write very many reviews but I just had to with this one. Also, I would expect a game I paid for to be just that. Paid for! You can't message anyone without a premium account. Also, you can buy currency in the game. Thank you eversim for ruining my day.			"

I mean, if you're into that, then this game is your match, however, like a foot fetish, most people just aren't into that.

												Do not buy this game, it is broken and badly designed. Some bugs include the game changing the language to French and menus not showing up when clicked. The grammar and spelling is terrible too. You also have to play for an eternity before anything happens. The one part I enjoyed is sending messages to other players but I doubt I will ever get a response.

												Right from the start, I am greeted with technical issues and constant lag. Opening any type of menu causes a long loading screen and unresponsive window. The design is very very poor, it runs in a window that frequently won't respond and it looks straight out of dialup. There also appears to be no way to change the size of the window. The settings menu... what settings menu? There's an option to turn off the annoying tutorial bot that constantly bothers you, but that's about it. There is absolutely zero sound in the entire game, I think that speaks for itself. The gameplay is completely esoteric, tedious, and for me boring. You can't progress much into the game without buying credits and premium, which is gonna cost you more than the game itself! The community of this game is consistent of either trolls, or people who invest their soul and heart into this game, there is no room for fun. I only got to play as a politician without paying 10 dollars for another character (nope), but from my experience there is nothing to do as a politican without any power, which makes the start of the game working to try to have fun eventually. Journalist and artist seem like more fun and open characters from what I have seen, except all you're going to be doing is designing articles in hopes that people will like them. One of the few positive things I can find about the game is the reason why I bought it, it's a very unique idea that could have been done well if the developers weren't in over their heads. Final Evaluation-----------------Pros: Unique idea, Many mediums to interact with the community, Low price ( 99 cents as of this review ), Room for creativity, Realtime simulationCons: Lag, poor design, bad community, no sound, tedious, microtransactions, frankly boringScore - 2/10			"

But there's only so much you can polish a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ No matter how much you polish it, it's still a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ And by polish I mean, you can add pictures from your images. That's about the only thing this game can do properly. I think I was one of the first people to buy this game, judging there was an 80% off sale for the first 10,000 people to buy it, the community hub was empty and I'm sure the two other people who bought this game are very dissapointed, just like me.Please, don't buy this game, it means your giving money to these peeople.

												Oh dear lord, thank you, thank you so much. Ladies and gentlemen, we have been graced with the worst MMO of all time. I was lucky enough to pay a mere dollar for this game, yet they have the audacity to charge 5 times as much for this. How bad this game is can not be summed up in words. It doesn't work. I have a decent internet connection, and every time I click on something the game freezes for 5 seconds to load the next bit of text. Every. Single. Button. Your secretary? Speaks with one of those fake♥♥♥♥♥robot voices. And she does a horrible job of telling you what to do. I set up a profile and then BOOM I'm forced to make a schedule that my character will follow for the day. In real time. It's like farmville except you don't need to be there to play it, so what's the ♥♥♥♥ing point? I don't even think there's a goal, I just clicked on places and events until my schedule was filled up. And that was it. Nothing to play, I don't even know what to do anymore. I spent a dollar on this. That's a dollar that could have gone to cancer research. I just stopped the cure for cancer from happening by playing this game. Oh well, I got a good laugh out of it. If you want an MMO to play with your friends and have fun, please, god please, look elsewhere.			"

												World of Leaders is somewhat interesting for what it is, which is basically a browser-based mostly-text role-playing simulation game. The goal of the game is to reach the top of one-of-three professions, either politician, journalist, or musician/singer.  World of Leaders plays very similarly to this developer's other game called The Race For The White House, so if you have played that game then you know what to expect. I'm hoping they will continue to update and improve this game in the near future, because it seems unpolished and full of translation issues. I enjoyed their previoyus titles, so I am hopefull and enthusiastic about this one, but so far in reality there are better games out there covering the exact same topics/themes/professions with much more depth. Specifically I'm talking about a game called  Popmundo [www.popmundo.com\], which I played for 8 real years, becoming Mayor of Toronto, an infamous rapper. fathering 11 children, and leaving a trail of scandals in my wake. ...Almost like a real life Toronto Mayor!   This game is nowhere near as polished or deep as  Popmundo [www.popmundo.com\] yet, but this review was not meant to be an advertisement for Popmundo, so I'll just stick to talking about WoL. Pros: +Plays Like Race for the White House. If you enjoyed that game, you may enjoy this game. +You can create and control up to 3 characters. (one from each of the three professions) +Role-Playing encouraged with the ability to upload and create original essays, videos and/or etc +Extensive world map. An excessive amount of cities which you can base yourself out of.Meh: ~Currently has a small player base, but it is slowly growing. ~Small player base means very little social interaction. ~Small player base means you can begin the game as a city's mayor if the position is vacant. ~Hopefully the game will be updated and improved upon in the coming weeks and months. ~The game plays out in real time. There can be very little to do at times.Cons: -Overpriced. Similar games can be played free of charge. -Micro-transactions. Extra playable characters cost $7 each. Pay real money for game money. -Seems like the text was poorly translated using an online translation website or similar. -Some in game text appears in french. -Interface can be slow to load various screens, and rarely the game can freeze altogether. -The gameplay may appeal to the casual facebook crowd, but are Steam gamers too jaded & blasé?I'm not sure that I feel good about recommending this game, but I would not want to NOT recommend it and add yet another bad review to the already massive amount that it's already received. It's rough around the edges, but it is not such a bad game. I enjoyed Race for the White House and I am enjoying this game as well for the time being. It does not take long to play each day, or require all that much attention to succeed over time, but the game allows you to participate as much or as little as you want in terms of developing your character through creative writing or uploading other media. Don't expect to jump in right away and be a Boss. This is the type of game you play little by little over a long period of time. I guess I recomend this game, but only if you understand exactly what type of game it is beforehand, and only if you enjoy playing these type of games.			"

												Wow, this game is a great addition to the class of games that my friends call ""Boring games that Derrick loves""you seem to play as one of the characters from Eversim's nice geopolitical sim Rulers of Nations.  I liked Rulers of Nations, and this game lets me be the mayor of a small town in North Korea, yay!but dont take just my word on it, you better read some other reviews			"

												I think the game is a very interactive and social game, so in order for it to really start being enjoyable as participation grows.   It is not a game that is played for the graphics, but discussion and expression. I think the game has a very lose plot to it because you are supposed to be creating the character for it.  Maybe I have too much imagination and you guys have non.  Even if it is pretty expremental I see a lot of potential, especially if characters such as yourselves take the roles seriously and put more thought into it.  I think it is a brilliant game so far.

												Great idea, but not ready for playing.....yet.Hopefully, there will be many updates to this game that give you something to do in the game. Right now it is very simple, but I do like the mmo aspect to it.Unlike other users, the game has never crashed for me, but the loading time seems long for what it loads for.Overall, I think you should just get the game while it is .99 cents, which really isn't that much, and hope that it updates.

												Great sandbox, Beware though that this game relies on you too much to drive the gameplay. A politicians life after all is not easy and mistaking this game for a task rather than actually being fun is a possibility. Lastly what did I pay 0.79 GBP for if this game is free on there website??			"

												Despite the other reviews I went ahead and got it. I figured what the heck $1. I've played other games like this and if you have to and enjoyed them you may like this one. Yes, it is what I would consider BETA status. However is fun, interactive, and unique. I have not found many bugs. More so just a few times having to go back to something I just did. Save work properly in case dc. Game has hiccups in connection, few, but noticable when writing and stuff. I had 1 DC the entire time I played for 6 hrs. Game just needs more players in it or AI players. The manual...guy"" who posted...yes IN game the producers are French it seems or European. Go to the games store page and at right, player manual!...it is Steam and should open in your language; mine being English. Game was rather easy to pick up once you figure out stuff it gets really easy. 1 hr or even 3 of f'ing around and the next time you play you should be able to do you entire next game session in 5-30 minutes and part of that is if you plan ahead and what character you choose etc. Politician being hardest. Currently the game has almost zil for players ""contesting"" positions of power so get in while you can, seriously $1, garauntee you if you've played this type of game or like politics you will enjoy the $1 it is on sale for right now. For $5 though I would say while in beta, not worth it for $5 but it will be once enough people start playing. You can set stuff in advance to so you can probably afk for a month and your character should still do stuff if you use scheduler. Granted you may want to be on daily for popularity points and so your popularity doesn't drop because no login. It doesn't look like it drops much either.			"

												The overall thought on this game, which is more of a social experiment, is that is a failed rat trap of a team with a low budget. Words cannot come to my head to describe the intentions of the producers. What this game is absolutely null, if it can be said that this is even a game. This text-based governmental conspiracy-control loony bin has overwrought my nerves with cognitive errors and fullstops. People who linger on this worthless five dollar atrosity somehow find enjoyment and basic ability to provide bland and wortheless ""articles"" on political events that have never happened. Throughout observing this shoddily put-together epileptic monstrosity, I found myself befuddled by even the meer underlying concepts of this clipart-esque microsoft era visual horror. In all honesty, I fail to even maturely comprehend what this game is. What is it? Why does this exist? Who sat at an executive board for these geographic political simulation companies and perked his head up and said, ""Let's make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ forum board like ""GAME"", with confusing HUDs and GUIs that will probably give most of its players catastrophic anuerysms,"" then he stroked his bear manaically. The rest of the team did not hesitate to agree, and so the bandwagon rode off into the blissful horizon of World of Leaders. Through the course of twenty minutes then, they pumped out this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ What the hell is this. What the hell. WHAT THE HELL.			"

												It's the sort of game I like, as it is very comprehensive and explores so many real life factors in politics and public life. However, it is also slow (1 day in the game = 1 day in real life) and very, very laggy (though they might fix that). I'm not sure if this game will catch on with others.			"
