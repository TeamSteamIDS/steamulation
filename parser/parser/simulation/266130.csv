												If you, like me, are a fan of the genre (tactical turn-based squad strategy games) then this is definitely a gem!Similar games: SWAT 2, Jagged Alliance, XCom-series, Deadline, Door Kickers, Arma TacticsHowever! In comparison to most of them, this game lacks alot of complexity, depth, the missions in this game are quite small. It is rather a small game focused on the encounters, plan your attack and execute it.The tutorial was very easy to understand, the game interface is simple and intuitive.The sheer amount of equipment available makes it interesting to replay missions, being able to try new tactics to finish them.Graphics are quite nice.Sound/music is good.Character customization feels adequate.Good weapon customizations.I understand that the game is converted from mobile, which seems like a good job, however some more hotkeys would be lovely.(Check my profile for screenshots)Reminds me in a good way of classics like SWAT 2.Finally someone who is able to revive the genre! This game coupled with Door Kickers are the only hope left.			"

												As with all iOS games sold to the PC, the lack of actual complexity becomes a glaring issue quick. For what its worth, the game couldn't have been named more aptly. Its a good breach and clear simulator, but has barely any game worth mentioning outside of it. Which is a pity, for the combat is fun and functional, without ever feeling too micromanaging which is often a problem with turn based squad tactics. If devs would actually take a game like this, and flesh it out with an actual economy, politics, base-management, an overall objective or even an open-world perhaps. Basically anything resembling a game outside of the combat simulator, this would actually become a quite good. As with pretty much all games you can play with your thumb on a tablet, this is a waste for PC. Do not buy at full price.			"

												10's across the board. I have to say I wasn't too sure about this game, it looked interesting but it seemed like I would get bored with it pretty quickly, I even considered pirating it first, but then bought it on impulse and omg was it worth it.It is so much fun, stacking up and breaching rooms honestly never gets old. If you're like me and are an avid Arma player, Tactical Shooter and Strategy Fan, this game is right down your alley. It reminds me a lot of the old Police Quest: SWAT games. I hope to see a Breach and Clear 2 someday with the ability to Rope down from a ceiling or helicopter, use a seperate sniper team as support, as well as the ability to use chagres on walls, and also stack up multiple times during a mission. That being said I still love this game and see a lot of potential for future titles.PS. The music is fantastic.			"

												Solid little tactical strategy game.That said, gets repetitive FAST and, in my opinion, in no way justifies the price tag. Pick up on discount only.Also, if you're a completionist, don't pick up AT ALL. There are some achievements that are ridiculously grindy, requiring hundreds of hours of gameplay from a game with like 20 hours game MAX.			"

												This game is basically Frozen Synapse, except with detailed graphics and soldiers that are modelled after real-life counterterrorism squads. This is not inherently a bad thing, but it should be noted that this game does a few things differently:Firstly, you have less control over your soldiers than you do in Synapse. Sometimes your soldiers will feel like doing things that you didn't tell them to do. This can sometimes be good, other times bad. For example, I sighed relief when one of my soldiers was smart enough to turn around and shoot at an enemy that had flanked him, but other times I wished that he would keep his original target and let his buddies take care of the bad guys creeping up on him.Secondly, there is no way to order your soldiers to wait. This can be a problem if you want to synchronize time-sensitive manuevers (for example, rushing into a room after your teammate's flashbang has blown). You can order your soldier to walk in a little circle to burn time, but that's not always viable when you're pinned down by enemies. This means that the tactical aspect is a little watered-down compared to Synapse.Thirdly, this game has character progression. Soldiers accumulate experience, gear, and level-up. This process is fairly enjoyable, and there is also an extensive character customization system which allows you to pick your soldiers' clothes, hats, weapons, accessories, etc (there are no female characters are available though, which is somewhat disappointing). Synapse had none of this. Fourthly, there is no ""preview"" feature. This is unfortunate, because planning attacks before you finalize your turn is an extremely useful feature in Synapse. In Breach & Clear, you just kinda have to visualize everything beforehand and roll the dice. Sometimes this is fine, as this game is far more forgiving than Synapse is - You won't die in one hit if you make a mistake, for example, as all your soldiers have health and evasion stats that help them survive longer.Lastly, there is no multiplayer. At all. Which sucks. This game seems perfect for playing with your friends, but instead you only have the option of playing against the lackluster AI.So, I'm kinda torn on Breach & Clear. It does some things right, but it is also lacking in other ways. Frozen Synapse is a superior game overall, but it isn't going to give military genre fans their fix of atmosphere the way this game will.In this respect, that's where this game does right - It does deliver a solid tactical experience against a backdrop of beautifully rendered (and diverse) hand-crafted maps.So really, my choice to recommend this game comes down to the question of whether I had fun playing the game or not. At the end of the day, my answer is yes - I definitely did have fun playing Breach & Clear. I'm just glad that I didn't pay full price. I'd recommend you do the same.			"

												Recommended, but only if you really like the genre - turn based tactical. I do like the game, and I will probably get 10-20 hours of gameplay out of it, but I can already spot some problems.- Poor weapon variety. There's lots of AR-15 and M4 varieties, with similar stats, but no AK-47 (despite that you can play as spetznaz) or weapons of other origin than US/west Europe.- Poor gear variety. With a few exceptions, you can add something that adds a single value. For almost the same price, you can get a bonus of 5, 10 or 15. Why would anyone ever buy the +5 gear?- Poor mission variety. 35 SMALL maps. 3 different missions on each (hunt, defuse, extraction).- Bland AI. Nothing surprising about it's moves.- No sidearms, no magazine count, no reloads.- Poor use of grenades. If you want to use a flashbang, then use it on turn 1 and move into the room on turn 2. There's no way to tell your squad to wait until after the detonation before they move in. Which leads to the next point...- Poor ways to coordinate your movements. You can't tell op 1 to wait until op 2 arrives and then move together, unless you wait a full round. Which might hurt your score.- Poor damage model. Everyone always fight to the death. Injuries have no negative effect, armor only adds HP.None of this is game-breaking, but my impression is that they should have added more features and more complexity to the game, and definitely bigger/more maps. At the 15 euro pricetag, I recon you get your moneys' worth but only if you are really itching for this type of game.			"

												Breach & Clear is an interesting marriage of Frozen Synapse's hybrid turn-based/real-time style of tactics gameplay with XCOM: Enemy Unknown’s customizable class-based soldiers and carefully-constructed mission levels, then given a Counter-Strike terrorists-vs.-special-forces makeover - right down to the almighty flashbang grenade.Upon first starting up the game, the player will be greeted by a series of screens to set up their first squad.  They can choose from a variety of different special forces outfits from around the world, from the American Navy SEALS to the German Kommando Spezialkräfte, among others.The player can choose the faces, names, and soldier classes for each member of their 4-man squad.  Each of the six classes has a unique role to play with their special abilities and passive traits, and having to choose which to bring and which to forego should be carefully considered, as it will significantly affect how you approach different situations from that point on.Every mission starts by selecting which entry points to place the soldiers at before they storm the room, or otherwise enter the combat area.  Enemies inside rooms that have no open doors cannot be seen (conversely, every enemy in an outdoor area can be seen), meaning you will sometimes be storming a building blind.  As such, the player has to carefully survey the map layout, note cover near to every door, and account for every angle an enemy might be waiting at before breaching the entrance.  Sometimes it might even be favorable to split your team into two groups of two as opposed to keeping all four together.At the start of each turn, the player will issue orders to all four of their soldiers during a “planning phase” - where to move (and along what path - an option XCOM sorely neglected), what direction to face, what inventory equipment or special abilities to use.  When everything is set, all four men will simultaneously execute your orders in real-time during an “action phase”, as will the enemies act.  Some of the enemies’ actions are proactive, and some are reactionary - especially in response to any grenades you throw.  This is unlike Frozen Synapse, where the enemy soldiers will follow their turn’s orders to a T regardless of what yours do.This also leads to an important interesting factor introduced in Breach & Clear that XCOM notably fails to consider: noise.  Guns are loud, and if you hear a bunch going off in the next room, most militiamen would go check out what’s going on.  Every gun you give your soldiers and some modifications you can apply to said guns have a “noise” trait which affects how loud the weapon is.  The louder the guns in your squad, the more likely an unseen enemy in another room will come and investigate.  This can lead to some real “Oh shi-” panic moments if your men are caught flanked or out of cover when this happens, especially in areas with many closed doors and little cover - such as the living quarters on a cargo ship.  To account for this, the player must carefully position their soldiers to cover the squad’s flanks at all times, or trade in some lethality for low-profile, silenced guns.There is a half cover/full cover system similar to the one in XCOM: different objects in the environment will either provide moderate or significant protection to the soldier behind it, depending on the object’s size.  There is one notable difference to XCOM’s implementation, especially on the higher difficulties: barring sniper rifles, soldiers shooting at each other from cover to cover will often have a very hard time actually scoring hits.  This forces the player to use all of the tools at their disposal to outmaneuver the enemy and gain flanking shots, rather than simply relying on a boosted aim stat.  This really strengthens the tactical depth of an otherwise relatively simple set of mechanics, which is great - it makes the fundamentals easy to grasp, but achieving victory is a very deliberate process that rewards planning and smart execution.The soldier progression and customization system adds that XCOM-like personal attachment to your men.  As the player completes missions, they will unlock items for your men to use.  These items range from weapons and attachments to body armor and helmets to cosmetic-only elements like camouflage and sunglasses.  Each man can also be kitted out with two inventory items - typically a grenade of some kind or a medkit, or a revival defibrillator if your squad lacks a medic.Completing missions will also earn each soldier XP.  As they level up, they will unlock new class-specific passive bonuses and, eventually, a powerful special ability that can only be used once per mission (for example, a Fireteam Leader can provide a “morale boost” that grants a large stat bonus to the entire squad for one turn).Leveling up soldiers also allows the player to choose what stats to upgrade on a given soldier, whether it be how fast they can acquire targets, how far they can run in a turn, the effectiveness of their class bonus, etc.  This lets the player choose whether they want to make a squad of jacks-of-all-trades, or to specialize their soldiers to excel at certain things at the expense of others.  For example, Breachers (the grenade-tossing class that often leads the charge) might find specializing in health and target acquisition useful so that he can more effectively fight as he crosses open ground.With the variety of mission environments offered by the game’s numerous mini-campaigns, collecting a range of gear - sniper rifles, machine guns, loud and silenced weapons, fast-but-light and slow-but-sturdy body armor, etc. - is important to maintaining a flexible force, especially considering that every level can be played in three different scenarios with varying levels of enemy numbers and emphasis on speed.  Overall, the persistent soldier system and surprising amount of content offers a considerable amount of gameplay for such a small title.Despite all these features, Breach & Clear is not without its flaws.  The relative simplicity of the movement system compared to the one in Frozen Synapse - mainly the lack of an option to tell a soldier to wait a couple seconds before moving - can sometimes make synchronizing your soldiers’ actions difficult.  This is especially noticeable when attempting to follow a flashbang grenade into a room; it won’t stun your own soldiers, but it will give the enemy a moment to pepper your men with bullets as they enter before the grenade goes off.Additionally (and this was an enormous gripe that I had with XCOM: Enemy Unknown, too), all the voiceovers are in a standard American English dialect, regardless of which international commando outfit your soldiers belong to.  Not only, but the vast majority of weapons in the game are ones used by the United States and Canada, despite the wide international breadth of options for the men themselves.  This can likely be attributed to the game originally launching with only American and Canadian task groups, with the others being added only later.  Given the size of the team making the game (spoiler alert: it’s pretty small), this is somewhat understandable, but it's still disappointing that I can't arm my Spetsnaz team with the latest Kalash AK-12s and have them bark responses in their native tongue - or at least in a cheesy Russian accent.These blemishes, however, are relatively minor stumbles on what is, at its core, a very satisfying experience.  While the soldier progression system isn't quite as fleshed out as XCOM's, and the unit movement system not quite as intricate as Frozen Synapse's, the two fused together with the game’s own handful of unique features make a very fun and surprisingly deep tactics game that is both easy to pick up and complex to conquer.  For only $15, I would consider Breach & Clear worth checking out for any fan of tactics or small-scale strategy.			"

												2 out of 6 stars. Not recommended.The game just feels unfinished. It seems to have had a few good ideas that never got implemented or got abandoned later. It lacks a lot of essential features of a tactical combat game and some features (breaching charges, flashbangs, no reloading weapons) are implemented in a very sloppy, bad and pointless manner. The game is also short, missions lack variety.Overall the game feels rushed, sloppy and incomplete. I had to check back the store page to make sure its not an early access alpha game. This game had potential, but I'm very disappoint that the devs released it in its current state.If you want a tactical close combat game, go play good old SWAT3 or ""Door Kickers"" which is available on steam and a much better game on the same topic.For a more in-depth review, check the pros and cons list.Cons:- Worst of all, you cannot coordinate and time the moves of your squad mates with one another. You can forget about simultaneous entry into a room from two doors. You can forget about a SWAT-style ""throw in flashbang and then whole squad moves in once it goes off"". This is a real game killer which makes the game lose a lot of tactical depth. - The above point also makes a few weapons (like said flashbangs) useless. You will be using frag grenades 99% of the time. Things like door wedges that were vital in a game like SWAT3 when used properly? You have these here, but the maps are so small and simple and the action so fast and so straightforward that you will never really have a need to use them.The game has a lot of guns, but most of them are unbalanced or useless.- Short and repetitive. There are just 7 maps (Afghanistan, Turkey, China, Germany, Mexico, Russia, Colombia) and 5 missions in each, which gives 35 missions in total. It sounds like a lot, but it is not. Each mission takes just around 05.-3 minutes to beat. These are really very simple missions, forget about complex missions like SWAT3 had. There is also a bomb-difusal mode and a ""evacuate your squad from the site"" more, which sadly take place on the same mission maps as the regular mode. The maps are also uninspired and feel bland, no real mission briefing worth mentioning. No memorable locations.  I think only the china map feels any novel and that's because it takes place on a freighter. The maps just feel laz and unfinished, though the graphics are often pretty ok for a tactical game. - AI is forgettable. I have not seen it do anything outlandishly stupid, but it is static, lazy and fails to ever surprise anyone. - No snake camera or anything of this sort. Most of the time you just need to go into a room and ""spray&pray"".- No CS gas. The game has an option to buy gasmasks for the squad, but its decorative only. Seems like a feature the devs decided to abandon.- No formations. No prone stances, no crouching etc.- No hostage rescue missions.- No arrests or wounds. Opfor will always fight to the death.- No secondary handguns for your team. You just have your main assault rifle and that's that.- While weapons have a rate of fire, they do not have a magazine size and there are no reloads. Very unrealistic and sloppy. Again, this just makes the game feel very rushed.- The cover system (while it has a very clear and good UI) is very hit and miss as far as gameplay goes. Example: I have a wall behind my back, nothing in front between me and my opponent, but the game treats me as being in hard cover because of that wall BEHIND my back. - There are several SF units to choose from, including spetsnaz. But sadly these do not have accurate gearfor the most part and spetsnaz comes with no Russian weapons whatsoever (despite AI opfor sometimes using russian weapons). So yeah, again feels sloppy and unfinished. - Breaching charges are very poorly implemented, you can only use them on the initial entry door at the start of the mission, not for doors withing the buildings. Same with lockpicks, just usable on main door. That is just absurd. Pros: - I like the ""plan moves than have a few seconds go in real time"" mechanic. The game itself is played in turns. You plan your moves, then the actual action occurs which takes several seconds of real time. Then the action pauses, you can again plan moves, then the action real time segment continues etc. This allows for tactics, while the actual turn being played in real time does depict the chaos and ""split second"" nature of close quarters combat. - The whole option of customizing your weapon right down to scopes, grips etc is fun, but again feels unfinished.

												I write these impressions as someone who's played the game on IOS and now a little on PC. Perhaps the closest analog to Breach & Clear would be Frozen Synapse's asynchronous turn-based tactical combat, with a dash of XCOM's classes and SOCOM's aesthetic. Each mission places you in control of a small squad (each country has a small perk, i.e. SEALS have faster reactions). Your team consists of different classes, each with special abilities. For example the medic can heal a soldier or heal himself, the Fireteam Leader can draw all enemy fire to him, the Weapons Sergent can lay down suppressing fire, Intelligence can jam doors. As you level up, your troops unlock new abilities. Your weapons are equally customizable, from optics to grips to gas systems. Limited use gear like flash bangs and snake cams provide more strategic options.Gameplay wise, Breach and Clear is all about the tactics. Place waypoints, aim line of sights, move to cover, cover your angles. Since enemy placement is randomized, you can never rely on one tactic for each level, instead always playing smart and considering how best to approach a room without leaving a blind spot that could bite you in the ♥♥♥. Don't do that, don't plan well, and your men will die. Your missions will take you across the globe, from Afghanistan and Russia to China and Germany, from simply taking down enemies to defusing bombs and reaching extraction points. Each requires you to play a bit different. The tactics to breaching a room is different than setting up to defend an area while defusing an explosive or moving to the extraction area. While Frozen Synapse is certainly more complex, I actually prefer the realistic special ops aesthetic and the laser focus on close quarters combat and breaching compared to FS's sci-fi virtual style. And this isn't some crappy port either. The game runs silky smooth, the controls feel great, and the visuals have definitely gotten a nice upgrade. Setting up waypoints and firing angles feels even better with a mouse than touchscreen.Visually it's not Crysis or Battlefield, but neither was Frozen Synapse. And Breach & Clear makes up for its visuals with cool little touches such as your troopers realistically leaning around cover to fireI'd definitely recommend Breach & Clear if you enjoy tactical gameplay with a realistic edge.Edit: PC additions include new weapons and maps, improved visuals, a permadeath setting, and probably some other stuff I'm not aware ofWill update the review once I've played more, tried out permadeath			"

												Not bad, but it feels so unfinished, it pegs itself out to be a military training tool during the games intro sequence and it isn't, it's an unfinished game. Don't buy the DLC either, it sucks in every possible way, unless you like having green blobs and red blobs moving about a blue screen.The gameplay is entertaining enough, you can set field of view and there is a bit of a tactical element but you can't prioratize targets, you can't tell your men to throw a grenade then move in after it goes off (leading to several instances where one man has thrown a grenade and the other instead of waiting then moving has charged in and blown himself up) and you can't use any form of snake camera to peak through doors. Purchasing weapons is stupid. first you complete missions in the fastest time possible to unlock the 4 star rating, then you need several thousand £££ to buy the gun and the accessories like scope, suppresor, light ect. with the most expensive accessory being superior to the others in every way leading you to wonder why they included the possiblity you'd buy one of the ♥♥♥♥♥ier ones. The stats for the guns vary wildly, with the FN P90 being far far less accurate than a shotgun which is more accurate than the first few assault rifles you unlock and the TAR21 being as accurate as a sniper rifle.The AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and comes in one variety, so long as you set your field of view to point at them, even on the hardest difficulty, you will win relativley easily.The levels begin to all feel the same and use the same level design for all three modes of play. this is only broken up by the fact a harder difficulty means more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ enemies and enemy placement is slighlty random (you play the same level more than oce and you know there will be 2 enemies in that room somewhere but are they stood near the coffee table or that bookcase 4ft away) There are enough levels that this isn't a problem though.The tips that appear during loading screens sometimes seem to refer to elements of the game that don't even exist, stating their is a ranger training mode that all teams can participate in when thier isn't. When it doesn't gives these tips it provides out of date or incorrect ""facts"" about the military groups you  can play as.And to top it all off this game is no longer being developed so all these problems will remain, have fun getting used to them.

												First and foremost, I got this game for like 3,74€ or whatever, and for that price it's right on the mark. The normal price of 15€, however, is way, way out there for a product like this. That's why the thumb down. The female voice in the opening sequence is talking about how this is ""the most advanced tactical simulator which revolutionised the world of urban combat and is used throughout the world for training puposes in various military forces"" etc. Well that's just utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, like claiming Paranormal Activity is actually composed of real life footage. I would describe this piece of software as a ""silly little game"", rather than a tactical simulator, and if this is ""most advanced"" I really wouldn't want to see what the less advanced versions look like.Basically you have a team of four dudes (why is it always four? the SAS apparently assaulted the Iranian Embassy in London with some 30 soldiers, against six terrorists. The Russian military assaulted the Moscow theatre in 2002 with some 200 men if I remember correctly...), who you will use to clear rooms of enemies in scenarios which last about 2-15min of real time, and some 7-40 seconds of game time (talk about blitzkrieg! :D) There aren't any terribly complicated tactics or techniques involved, you can tell your men to walk from waypoint to waypoint, stay still, or throw a flashbang or a granade. Firing at enemies is automatic. You give commands to your men simultaneously while the game is paused, and then press OK and the gametime advances by some 5 seconds or so, during which you have no control over what happens. After the 5 secs it's another order-giving turn in pausemode, and so on. There is no command to wait for two seconds and go, which means that when you're about to assault a room you either throw in a flashbang first and wait until the next turn to go in, by which time the effect of the band has already worn away. Or, you can charge in right away with another soldier while another man is deploying the bang, which means that the guy assaulting the room has already dispatched all the baddies and maybe taken some damage himself by the time the flashbang goes off.Completing the missions give you experience which improves your soldiers, and money which you can use to buy new gear and weapons. Some of the gear is strictly cosmetic, and has no impact on gameplay, such as sunglasses or uniforms in funny camos. For some reason one of the bulletproof vests is by far the best, with a +145 bonus to health (or something like that), while all the others have something like +20 bonus to health. And the superarmour is not even the most expensive one, and it has no drawbacks... :D and yeah, in the true videogame fashion, the soldiers have a simple numerical value of health, which means that it doesn't matter how much lead they eat during a mission, if they finish with at least 1 health left they are ok in the next mission. Incredibly advanced and realistic.So yeah, all in all, it's a casual little tactics game, with hardly any real substance and very little flavour or immersion. Maybe the devs made the opening video first, and actually intended to make a realistic tactics simulator, but once they had the graphics somewhat ready they just thought ""f*ck it, anyone fancy a pint? Just wrap it up and publish it on Steam."" I'm glad I only paid that four Euros for it.			"

												Can you imagine directing Seal Team 6 in their takedown of Osama Bin Laden? Well, now you can perform similar types of missions on a much smaller scale with a lot less meaning. All you need is Breach & Clear, which is a tactical strategy game along the lines of XCOM: Enemy Unknown, but with a focus on realism. You take command of US Navy Seals, US Army Rangers, Canada’s JFT2, and other highly trained military squads in global missions. Before you even begin the game, there are a number of decisions for you to make, including which of the real-life elite military groups to purchase and play as (US Navy Seals, US Army Special Forces, US Army Rangers, Canada’s JTF2, etc.), what to name your squad members, what their physical attributes should be, and which class each should represent. The chosen classification will bestow the given individual with a related special ability, with more earned as each person levels up through experience. You can also outfit each soldier with unique weaponry, attachments, uniforms, helmets, and the like. Better  equipment can be unlocked and purchased as you progress through the campaign. There are several locations to play, but Afghanistan is the only one unlocked from the start, so you’ll begin there.You are presented with a top-down/isometric viewpoint of a set of rooms wherein enemies are hiding out, invisible to your omniscient eye. Your goal, as the game’s title suggests, is to breach the location and clear it of all hostiles. Most maps have multiple breach points, so you can select where you want your soldiers to enter and how. Each round involves a planning phase and an action phase, much like Frozen Synapse or any of the Rainbow Six titles. For each soldier, you select where you want him to move to, as indicated by circles that appear upon an invisible gridded floor.Additionally, you determine each soldier’s vision cone at each waypoint, of which you can have several in a single turn. This ability allows you to own every angle, as the saying goes. Buttons are available to allow each soldier to use his special ability, too, such as laying down suppressive fire, tossing grenades, and more. When you are satisfied with your plan, tap the Breach button to watch the action play out. Soldiers will engage enemies automatically when one is spotted or they are fired upon, allowing you to see the enemy location from that point forward.  Any soldier standing next to an object is considered to be in cover, with the protection aiding them in surviving a firefight.The action phase lasts a few seconds before you are allowed to adjust your strategy in a new planning phase. The level ends when all members of one side have been killed. If you are successful, you can earn stars, experience, and money. Stars are used to unlock access to gear, weapons, consumables, etc. Experience offers you 5 points to add to each soldier’s stats at each new experience level, which can be used to boost health, accuracy, reaction, speed, etc. Money is used to purchase the items that you’ve unlocked. Each scenario can be played in multiple difficulty levels, with each offering stars to earn. You’ll want to replay each mission several times to nab the stars needed to unlock everything that you can. The gameplay is engaging and it gives you a lot of control over what happens and how you conduct your business. The focus on where to move, when to move, and where to train your focus are the essence of the game, and I applaud the devs for not trying to add too many options that could overwhelm the player.Graphically, the game looks terrific, with an impressive level of detail if you really drill down. The choice to use real military units and real weapons is commendable, as it offers a great sense of authenticity that’s lacking in similar titles. The sheer number of weapon/attachment/uniform combinations available for each soldier is dizzying. The environments have plenty of places to utilize cover and nooks in which to hide. Character animations and movements are great, and you’ll really need to act responsibly to escape unscathed. Switching between a top-down and isometric viewpoint is only a button away, and dragging to pan, twisting to rotate, and pinching to zoom ensure you’ll always have a great angle on the action.All of these options and deep levels of gameplay are all well and good, but they happen to be in service of a game that quickly becomes repetitive. With the exception of the level designs, which are really well done, every level is played exactly the same. You choose your tactics, choose your positions, choose your path, hit the Breach button, and then watch the action unfold. There is very little variation to the gameplay, and after a while you might find yourself getting kind of bored. The lack of any kind of story to put anything in context here just adds to the problem. You have no idea as to why you’re doing any of this, who you’re fighting or even who your soldiers are. The one thing the game does extremely well however is its marketplace. Here you will find a plethora of guns, lights, grips, IR devices, suppressors, and gas systems which you can buy and equip on your weapons. You can also buy various gear that you can outfit on your squad and some of the clothing will even give you a stat boost. If you are the kind of person that loves to collect items like this, then you will find reason to keep going back into missions to earn some more cash.Breach and Clear provides a strategic RPG-style look into the world of Special Operations that provides an unusual spin on both the Strategic RPG genre and the military gaming world. Breach and Clear is a solid title worth playing.			"

												It's not bad, but it's not the best Strategy Game I've played.Graphics and animations are acceptable, nothing too fancy. Gameplay and mechanics are easy to pick up with a ""straight to the point"" tutorial that teaches you what you need to know for first time players, and the experience and customization systems are fairly decent.How does the game play?It's a ""Pre-Planning"" style strategy game that's broken up into ""Phases"", Similar UFO or Frozen Synopsy. Simply put, you start each Phase by giving your soldiers orders, either to move from one location to another, deploy a grenade or equipment, etc. Once you have a pre-planned set of actions and routes set, you hit the ""Breach"" or ""Exicute"" button to watch it play it. It's a fairly basic system and it works fairly well, but the only problem I find with it is that the game's intro boasts about how this is supposedly a ""Realistic Tactics Simulator"" but if your soldiers are suddenly engaged by a new threat, rather than react accordingly or like in UFO halt their last action and pause for you to give them a new order to finish their phase, they just continue to follow the path set out for them. so if you give a soldier or soldiers to breach and clear a room and there's a wall of enemies on the other side waiting, your soldiers are going to continue walking into the hailstorm of bullets and taking hits instead of doing the more ""realistic"" thing and withdrawing back to cover.Aside from that though, it's a decent game. Would I recommend it? Sure, I can definely say that if you like turn based tactic games, give it a try. Personally I think another game like ""Door Kickers"" is a bit more ""realistic"" in terms of CQC Tactics, but this game is decent enough on its own.Overall Personal rating: Fair/Average. Nothing Too special about it, but can't find much bad about it either.			"

												This is definitely a fun little game to play for a while here and there. It has a respectable selection of maps and difficulties, and has a good concept of strategy. It is nothing spectacular, but it is certainly enjoyable for short amounts of time now and then, but it does get a little repetitive after a time.			"

												This game tries to come across serious, but when you play it, it tries to be playful and funny. The game's intro tries to tell you that it could be used for special forces to practice their tactics but has an unlock system which allows you to unlock gold plated weapons that do more damage than the non-gold ones.The interface doesn't feel great and you can't string complex tactics together; for example you can't throw a flashbang and have the team wait for the flashbang to go off before moving.I also didn't have fun playing this game; I found it more frustrating than anything. I had a lot more fun playing 'Door Kickers'.			"

												The game like Frozen Synapse or Door kickers but much more limited than these.Pros (if you consider them as such):* fancier graphics* soldier personalization like choosing skin color and camouflage pattern* variety of weapon parts to upgrade (but most modifications are just different pictures of the same part with the same stats)Cons:* unhandy controls -- I all the way struggled to understand what my soldier is going to do* lack of control -- forget sync ups or waits which you loved in Door Kickers and Frozen Synapse* huge size and resource consumption (relevant for laptop owners)If you like this kind of games and get it free or cheap you can try it but better go for Door Kickers which is really a gem.

												So yes, way better than I thought it was going to be.  XCOM meets Rainbow Six is a fair remark here.  It's not nearly as complex or involved as either of those titles but can be just as fun. I am writing this review approx 3 hours into gameplay and I enjoying every minute so far.  I am playing on Normal mode with Permadeath enabled for the extra tension during the missions.  (note even with perma death you are given ONE chance to revive a killed soldier, you also get increased XP from missions).Each completed mission is given a rating of 1 to 4 stars and you earn cash and XP based on your performance.  As each team member levels you get points to spend on some basic skills/attributes such as response, accuracy, health etc.  and much like XCOM each operator will become specialised in a particular role and have a unique attribute to suit.  You also have different types of missions to choose from such as bomb disposal or terrorsit hunt.  These missions take place in maps accross the world each area with its own unique styling.You use your cash to buy improved weapons and gear which also affect certain attributes such as accuracy bonus with weapon optics. So there is a mini review for a game I only decided to play as an after thought. I might actually complete it!			"

												""Yes"", because there is no ""I don't know"".Breach and Clear is a tactical, turn based, isometric... I dunno, shooter? Can you put this into the strategy category? Who knows, let's go with thing. So it's a tactical turn based isometric thing, yeah got a nice ring to it. Now when going into the game I have to tell you, unless you are as excited about the prospect of breaking doors and killing people as I was, which pretty much sums up the game by the way, you won't be impressed. Graphics are... dated, soundtrack-- well I would comment on it by I was listening to my own music while playing so I really don't remember, I am sure it was alright. The options menu also was lack luster, it sure wouldn't impress TB much. But enough from the technical side of things, honestly there is not much to say about it anyway as you might have noticed.In B&C you start off by forming a squad, you can choose between one of 7 types of special forces from all around the world, and when I say all around the world I mean half of them are from the US/Canada. Anyway, you pick your special forces and create your teammates, each one of them can have different specialities like Breacher, Fireteam Leader etc. Note, that, depending on your type of Special Forces the stats of your soldiers will change.I have to say that when I started the game it was really fun, it felt quite cool to get your team through a mission, though I suppose that they weren't all too challenging in the first place. The game feels tactical, and as you progress through the missions the better your soldiers and your equipment gets, which allows for a different approach while breaching.But here is where the problem of this game lies, it's easy as hell, at least on normal difficulty with perma death. Why? I hear you ask, well first off, perma death doesn't mean anything since you can quit the mission if your soldier died, and oh hello, here he is again. But more importantly, the progression system of B&C is flawed, the higher the level of a solder, the stronger he gets, makes sense right? Think again, since a single mid to high level soldier could probably clear out levels alone without too much trouble. Another criticism I have is that I didn't care much about the soldiers, when I played XCOM: Enemy Unknown and a soldier died, I was devastated, maybe if perma death would work I wouldn't have that issue, but as it stands I do. Not that this is game breaking but it was something I felt was missing.So, what is my conclussion? Well, like I said, I don't know. This is a solid game that can be fun, however I think it got weaker as it went on especially since the two, secondary modes B&C has, Bomb Defusal and escape plan felt kinda boring compared to terrorist hunt(the ""kill everyone"" mode). Did I enjoy my time with Breach and Clear? Yeah, most of it at least. Is it a great tactical experience? Meh...TL;DRGraphics: DatedSound: Ok? No idea, wasn't listening.Options Menu: That don't impressa me much.Gameplay: Solid and simple gameplay, easy to graps. Good fun....Flaws: ....at first, then your soldiers get OP and it gets boring.Notes: Probably a good idea to turn down the volume a bit. Shots are loud.Verdict: Buy it on sale. Then you'll get your money's worth for sure.Price: 14,99€Devs: Mighty Rabbit Studios ,	Gun.

												Breach & Clear is a tactical turn-based squad strategy game. At the beginning it is pretty easy, but on the hard difficulty its a real challange and needs good strategy. The grafics are not the best, but they are good enoth for a game like this. You can completely design your own squad. From their Skills to their weaponcolor/Cloth/Weapons. I would really recommend this game and if you wanna complete all the challanges with 4 stars than you will have to investiage a ton of hours in it ;()  "

												Firstly it's important to note that contrary to its advertising and the game's intro, Breach & Clear is not a simulation. The game has more in common with call of duty scenarios than real life counter terrorism operations. Soldiers acquire perks and weapons are only effective a fraction of the range of their real life counter parts. It would also be hard to argue that the soldier classes bear much in common with real life soldier roles instead displaying strange attributes like the intelligence specialist's ability to disappear. The combat itself is fast paced and interesting. It doesn't often feel cheap except when your squad isn't leveled enough to tackle a map. There aren't any game breaking flaws in the combat system  which is more than most tactical level turn based combat games can boost. The game offers incentives to use fire and movement realistically and the ability to flank and suppress means the player has to keep their team on the move. Perma death thankfully can be enabled which gives a lot more weight to the player's decisions. The game uses a WEGO system for the turns but you'll hardly notice because the AI doesn't move around much. Enemy classes don't offer huge variation but they do provide enough to allow the designers to create some interesting tactical puzzles. Heavily armoured soldiers can cause your team serious trouble if they can close with them and snipers obviously operate at the other end of the spectrum. The graphics are quite nice with your soldiers displaying the weapons and gear you issued them with. Everything is clear and easy to interpret except some more obvious fog of war would be nice so players would be provided with some idea of which areas had been cleared. The spotting system is balls, soldiers can see through walls and some items completely negate the fog of war completely. This game certainly could have taken a few lessons from the original Xcom in that department. The level design is often pretty good but the game's original platform holds it back. Maps are too small and quite clearly were designed with short playtimes in mind. They get better as the game goes on but it feels a bit strange that multi story buildings are absent and the game's attempts to emulate this by making assaults on large buildings take up multiple missions doesn't really feel convincing. The game modes provided are Terrorist hunt, bomb diffusal and escape which are all pretty much self explanatory. They all change up the maps slightly but in the long term aren't enough to keep things from going stale. Bomb diffusal maps feature the ever annoying enemy reinforcement spawns that are the bane of several srpgs but within the context of this game they work extremely well and give the mode a bit more tension. The game tries to keep the player's interest by offering what seems at first to be extensive customization options, but realistically half the weapons and gear offered aren't ever really going to come in useful. The outfitting screen could also do with some work as no indication is given how prospective weapon and gear purchases differ from what is already equipped(unless you click back through some menus). Unequipping all the modifications off a weapon can be quite tedious as well. Besides tactical combat, the game doesn't offer much else and what's there feels somewhat lacking. The potential of the system is never fully explored because the maps never really get that big and the squad size stays at four men. Insertion methods never change with rappling and helicopter assaults never making an appearance. This lack of variation results in the game getting a bit stale after a while. It can feel a bit half ♥♥♥♥♥ at times too with some design choices(no ability to use smoke is the most glaring one)leading to the player's units taking unavoidable damage in some situations. That said fire and movement in the title generally works well and dumb tactics are often punished. The market isn't exactly swimming in squad level turn based strategy games so this is a welcome addition.			"

 Breach & Clear 	 Pros: + Nifty Gear+ Loads Of Maps+ Three Game Modes: Terrorist Hunt, Bomb Defusal, Escape Plan+ Has a smooth flow to the game. Cons: - Gets Old- Never was a huge fan of the top down or turn-based style in general. Review I have mixed feelings about this game. Breach & Clear is a tactical, top down, turn-based game which you take control of a four squad team. You buy their guns and all the attachments for their guns and the uniforms for them. You actually get really attached to your squad. Seeing them start out with all the same gun, all the guys had almost all the same skills and nothing really separates them from each other, and you are only able to win on easy. After sometime you are then able to buy each of them their own type of gun and special attachments to fit their style. Seeing them grow as a soldier and grow as a squad. It really hurts when one of them get shot down when your on permadeath mode. The game does get old once you have almost all the best gear and it kind of feels like grinding. If you are into these types of games I suggest buying it on sale.This was Curated for PC Beta Gaming if you would like to follow us the link is below: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG#curationIf you liked this review please give it a thumbs up.

												If this game was in open alpha, I would surely have given it thumbs up. It features a plausible game mechanics, dated but nice  graphics; the missions are fast-paced and action-loaded. However, as with many games that try to avoid micro-management, the developers seemed to forget at times that the game is intended to be played by a human being. There is a ton of interface constraints which I cannot help but call stupid, like being able to throw grenades only at the beginning of the turn, excluding any movement for that soldier, or being unable to command soldiers to wait for a specific number of seconds to ensure simultaneous action. Another issue is balance. To name just one example, the UAV is like a legit cheat which shows all position and movements of all enemies throughout the mission, even inside buildings, which renders the recon class absolutely pointless.But the most glaring disadvantage is the lack of tactical possibilities. I mean, in a tactical strategy, where are the smoke grenades? Where are those nifty hi-tech gadgets like motion scanners? They would be a lot more fun to use than the aforementioned UAV. The scarcity of the tools offered to the player quickly makes the missions monotonous - Breach & Clear, Rinse & Repeat - making the game suitable to kill off half an hour from time to time, but not more.These are all correctable flaws, and it's a pity that the developers released Breach & Clear too quickly, without testing not only stability but also playability. The should have invested more effort into their product.			"

												I really recommend this game, especially for the sale price. It is alot of fun and im not even done with it I just had to make a review for it as it is alot of fun. If you enjoy xcom, but you don't really like the aliens this is the game for you.You choose your squad type from a selection of real squads and you make 4 characters which you can choose different types for like Medic,Breacher,Fireteam leader, etc. and there are 3 gamemodes but my personal favourite is ""Terroris Hunt"" where you have to breach into a building and clear all the enemy's. This game has leveling for your troops and when they level you get to allocate points to stats and also at some certain levels you can unlock abilities for your troops.The loadout customisation is also very good as you go through missions and earn money that you can spend in the maketplace and buy item's like helmets,vest and weapons, as for weapons you can also but addons for weapons like silencers, sights, flashlights and more that all add stats to your chatacter.This game is definately alot of fun and especially for the sale price I really recommend that you get it.

												First to get this out of the way: No, this is not like X-Com.Yes, both are somewhat turn-based strategy games, but they play vastly differently as in Breach & Clear you plan a turn for your entire 4-men team and then everybody executes these moves at the same time. Including you and the bad guysThat's not a bad thing, however. In fact, it's a pretty neat concept, although not entirely new.  It's always nice to see some varitey in the genre, and only few games handle their turns the way B&C does.Hoewever, where B&C doesn't manage to hit the spot is the challenge.In B&C most missions are either too easy or too hard.If a mission is too easy, you simply ignore all the little intricacies the game has to offer, so for example you rarely if ever set waypoints or plan your men's field of view. Instead, you just charge in, gunning down every enemy on the way.If a mission is too hard, this is often the game's fault, when the random generator for example places one of your men right in a room with four foes nearby, leaving him no chance for survival.I still had fun with the game, but overall I can't recommend it wholeheartedly. There are just too many good (and better) strategy games out there.			"

												B&C is alot like XCom, a bit like Frozen Synapse, a bunch of squad based loadout marketplace and RPG elements and fairly quick missions. There is quite a bit of customization for your weapons, gear giving buffs and negatives to stats. The game also features a lot of real world high-end small arms.There is currently about dozen different level sets, all with unique tilesets and progressively varying terrain and baddies. several different difficulty settings, a lot of replay value I've also found thus far.Mission rewards are dependent on performance, basic indicators. Hardcore & Softcore character deaths are avialable- Die forever or just for the mission depending on how you want your squad to be.Several country SF are avialable for squad creation (more then one squad avialable at a time), each seem to get their countries rifle/basic eqp. of choice in the beginning, which is good attention to detail.If you really liked the core combat system of Xcom, and can for-go all the base building as well as Sci-Fi elements and go for just character customization and being in the current era. I do also recommend it if it goes on sale and any one likes a good RPG-TurnBased-SquadCombat game.			"

												I've barely got my hands on the game, but absolutely love it so far. I found this game really suits me for cuople of reasons. One is that it's not overly complicated. You can easily learn and master the controls and fundamental gameplay in minutes after the tutorial. Each missions are not too long, just enough for my rather short concentration. Now, that does not mean this game is shallow. It will give you quite a bit of options you can take, as well as tactical challenges you will need to work around.Second is the Stats/Gear system. You can build your own squad with operators with different class, stats, and gear. Since there are 6 classes and only 4 operators can be in a single squad, you will need to adjust your strategy depending on what kind of operator is available.The third is the overall ""tacticoolness"". If you are firearms/military enthusiast, you will probably appeciriate this game. Most of gears and wepons dipicted in game is realistic, as well as appropriate. Authentic weapons and tactical gears from manufacturers such as Surefire, LaRue, First Spear, LBT, etc... are availble at your operators disposal and you can kit up your team of real-life global warfighters, ranging from 75th Ranger Reg., German KSK, Canadian JTF2, Russian Spetznaz, and everyones favorite, SEAL/DEVGRU. You can outfit Army SOF with BALCS and DCU, give the seals JPC and Airframe helmets. Sadly there are not too many variations at the moment. I hope the devs add more choice of weapons and gears.Some ways, this game really reminds me of Medal of Honor: Warfighter. Gameplay aside, you can feel that the creators of both gmaes defnitely put a lot of effort into military authenticity. However, the gameplay is enjoyable, but ordinally and really not outstanding. Overall, I reccomend this game to anyone looking for casual tactical game and like guns and operators operating operationally.			"

												Breach & Clear is the kind of game that is easy to learn, but takes some serious skill to master. While you will spend a lot of time staring at the different locations to put your limited team, once you end the turn and the action starts it's over in a flash. Getting sub 15 second clear times on multiple room levels is one of the fuzziest feelings I've gotten playing a turn based game and the game does a good job of trying to teach you the idea of efficiency of movement.If you, like me, grew up playing the OLD Rainbow Six games, then this will feel very familiar, as you plan out the movements of your team every turn and then they rush to execute that plan. Play with Permadeath on, it adds an element of stress in the later levels when there's some very hard to handle corner and hall combinations that the enemy will easily take advantage of even on the easier AI settings. Great game, 9/10.			"

												this is a great game, for about the first couple hours; then quickly becomes a repetitive chore to grind through missions to unlock new weapons and gear, and even then after you unlock everything, theres nothing left to do besides play through levels with overly repetive mechanics. the developers promised to proivide steady updates to and improvements to the gaem as well as listen to community response for new ideas to implement, yet with nearly every idea shutdown or ""already in the works"", and month since a developers has responded to a comment, nothing has progressed besides a poorly implemented Spetnaz squad using incorrect weapons and a silly look to them. the developers dont care enough to continue to improve upon their game by adding new ideas and listening to the community, instead they seemed to just want to cash in on lofty goals that they never planned to meet.

												its a good game but sadly it gets repetitive and boring really quick, you creat and play with your fav swat team from different special forces like navy or spetsnaz, there is 3 mods in the game ( terrorist hunting, defusing bombs and escorting you team out of the battlefield) in the same 7 locations yep thats right the same 7 locations, you will play and visit them soo much that you will get bored after 2 or 3h and of course no story mode just the 3 type of missions.leveling the team takes ages and 70% of the achievements are absurd and hard to get, for exemple ""KILL 53,594 enemies"" that's one insane achievement and as prove 0.3% of people have it, you can kill like max 20 enemies per mission so i will let you do the math.the graphics are mediocre nothing outstanding , simple gameplay with basic tactics to use.in the end i recommend this game for those who like strategy games but in my opinion 14.99$ is too much , normally it shouldn't be over 9.99$ so grabe it on sales6/10			"

Interface looks like a direct port from mobile, without a single paradigm adapted to PC mouse and keyboard (except Ctrl+Z, that is): no RMB, camera rotates at fixed angles only, you can't edit given orders (you can only cancel them one by one starting with the last one), you give orders and you select soldirers with the same click (you can do it accidentally) etc...Interface is a real fun killer here.

												This is really quite good.  It rewards thinking, and just when you think you've got it under control, the difficulty spikes, and you have to reconsider what you were doing.I'd really like to be able to use the middle mouse button to drag the map around instead of the left; I'm constantly setting waypoints in places where I don't want to go.  An ability to change the order that your team uses for the inital breach would also be good - the only way I could find to stop my medic being first through the door was to create a whole new squad :(Annoyances aside, this is a less-stressful version of Doorkickers, with a reduced character count, which makes setting up your team just the way you like it more satisfying.  It's effectively turn based (plan 5 seconds, watch 5 seconds, repeat), and I find having a fixed duration turn more enjoyable than hovering my thumb over the space bar wondering whether I need to change plans or not.  The full price is fair, and on sale it's a great buy.			"

You have a bite-sized mission structure that allows you play as much or as little as you want with no real commitment to a lengthy campaign.

												military strategy game with lots of potential and managed to do most of the things right too.pros-engrossing! -every time its a new experience. even though the maps are (seem to be) small there are many variables that can provide great replaybility. and after a few minutes you'll WANT to master every map or try it with different loadout or different classes in your squad or just turn up the difficulty level/perma death.music- not many tracks but enough to create that sense of urgency and tension.perma death- level up a soldier to level 15+ and then see him die hurts a lot.progression- unlike many other games where level progession is usually just about higher number in stats, here you can see the difference between leveled squad member and a rookie.  devs have done good job but*(see cons)cons-difficulty spikes- play a map 15 times with perfect strategy - spike the difficulty and see your team getting hammered! the AI literally becomes stupid (like wont shoot while moving when the enemy is strolling right in front of them, their range shortens, enemy AI become bullet sponges even when they have no armor and snipers just become invincible unless you are 4-5 paces away) every now and then you feel that enemy sucker punched you below the belt.absolutely no in-game help- there is one kinda useless tutorial. it teaches only the basic movements. there is no ingame notifications (even about features like market place, upgrading gear etc.) i saw the market 1st time i started the game after that the game never offered/mentioned that i can visit the market place and buy stuff in between maps(and game sucked me in so much that i completely forgot about it). i played 1st four maps(repeated a few times too) and when i came back to main menu i saw the marketplace. another example- i bought a sniper rifle (probably one of the costliest gun) and had no idea how to properly use it(no tutorial). when my 2 snipers died i decided to go back to assault rifle but couldn't sell the sniper :/ really disappointed coz snipers(enemy snipers too) are awesome in this game if used properly. yet another eg. i bought 4 suppressors and 2 different guns(2 each) only to realise that one gun model doesn't support silencer & it wasn't mentioned on the gun's profile page :( which is bad coz money is hard to get in this game AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT!no lone-wolf mode- every time a squad member dies the game forces you to go to squad menu(in main menu) to choose a replacement. only way to play lone wolf is to keep giving 'hold' command to rest 3 soldiers which is time consuming.2nd-tier perks - they just come wayyyyyy tooo late. you get them when you are rank 30 :( and reaching rank 30 is really time consuming. i have just one guy at level 17 and now the progress is really slow.only way to level him fast is to make him kill max. enemy which means putting him at high risk and sooner or later the enemy sucker punch them.(i have lost 2 level 15 guys already)inconsistant point awarding ?!- i am not 100% sure about it but i don't understand how points are awarded after each mission. and the difference here is not of 50-100 points.Overall i would recommend this game to every one who loves strategy military games. if you liked xcom or older rainbow 6 games pls give it a go.

												I walked into Breach & Clear hoping for some serious copy of former SWAT series. What I got was a sort of XCOM copy. Although the games tactics may appeal to you, some of the lack of attention to minor details may upset you. I got this game on extreme sale and would recommend you do too.Plain and simple, this game is no where near the level of what SWAT 3 or 4 was. Still to this day, there hasn't been a SWAT game that has managed to immerse the player as much as those two have. Breach & Clear is a top-down turn based swat action game where your main objective every time is still simply wipe every enemy out on the map. It's fun at first, but the lack of diverse objectives make the game redundant. At the very least, opponents do move about the map when you initiate contact. Meaning, if they are not taken out and you do not having any squad member watching your back, they may sneak up on you. Upon starting a level, the player can scope out what entrances are available and can tell each officer where to start. The game play itself is not bad. You are in control of four units in which you can tell them where to move and how to move. Choosing movement paths was decently done. Say for instance you would like to go down an open hallway as it can be a little tricky sending one unit at a time to deal with the danger. The system in place lets you choose multiple points on where the unit should go (so broken paths) and additionally, let's you choose which way to face. This latter fact is important in providing the appropriate cover for your units. If your unit is caught off guard due to not looking the right direction, there is a good chance he'll be shot and may go down. The movement itself can be modified as a unit can be told to walk slower to increase his accuracy and allow other units to catch up or overtake. Grenades and flash bangs are available to use upon purchase. Yes you heard me right, this police force has to replenish it's supplies after every run. Every time you use it, you're going to have to replace it if you want to use it again. There are some units that are able to throw and continue their movement while some units spend their turn throwing the ordinance. This dependence is directly related to the classes you choose. For instance, a fire team leader has the ability to draw fire, a weapons sergeant can use his suppress fire ability to possibly save a comrade in trouble, a breacher can throw a grenade and continue to move along his path instead of ending his turn, a medic (I'll leave this one up to your imagination) and a direct action soldier can go in quietly. Depending on how you want to go in, it's really up to you to choose what's the best combination. I use a fire team leader, a medic and two breachers just because I like making noise. Each individual can upgrade (level wise) as you progress. You can upgrade stats such as accuracy or speed to improve your character. As well, their weapons can be modified with special sights or with fore grips. What drives me extremely mental in the game is the fact there is a pause after every turn to tell you it's the next phase. I believe that could have been done by being a lot more subtle.The graphics themselves are okay. Their nothing extremely over the top or triple A, but simply okay. The player can maneuver the camera but it can never go exactly where you want it (or if your an explorer don't count on looking around too in-depth). What is nice is that sometimes the camera will go over the shoulder when shooting down suspects or going through a door. The sounds are okay as well. Gun shots sound more or less similar while there is no real dialogue going on. Honestly, it's an alright game if it's on sale. I'm not recommending it because truth be told, I'd rather play XCOM or UFO when I start playing this. I also don't like the fact it's turn based and how the equipment scheme was set up.RATING : 6.9/10Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface C+ Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ScreenShots  Be ready to see this after every move What a few downed enemies look like Multiple room breach with two separate teams at two different locations  Camera shifting angles Can you see where my units are exposed Multiple arrows showing my breach tactic Camera will often go to this angle when initial breach occurs "

												Awesome. Just........Awesome. If you like tactical military sims, this is a great purchase. A friend gifted me this as a birthday present, but I would probably have purchased it in any event. This game is defintely worth the 17 CDN, if you like turn based tactical games from the third person perspective. Games that are similar to this are Frozen Synapse, and XCom Enemy Unknown. Weapons are upgradeable, tactical gear and equiptment to make your soldiers more efficient on the battlefield are also upgradeable. Enemies toughness and difficulty scale nicely through the difficulty levels. Different nationalities garner different bonuses. I am playing Canada's JTF2 right now and am finding clearing a level without taking casualties a fun and rewarding experience. No crashes or bugs so far that I have found. The graphics are good for the type of game it is, and the sound is well done if a little sparse. Only two hours in but I will not be uninstalling this game for a long time. As of now I have not found anything about this game that I do not like. I will update this review in the event that I do. Recommended. 4/5 stars.+Updated Review at 11 hours of gameplay.+I am really enjoying this game. Absolutely worth the asking price, even more so if on sale. I would like to see a button that returns all unused items, from squads that are idle, to the main inventory, like in Xcom Enemy Within. Aside from that I have no complaints. Still 4/5 stars.			"

												I loved this game on iOS, and was excited to see it come to Android (I have an iPhone and a Nexus 7 2013). When it finally came out for Android, I bought it (a second time) only to find it was slow, poorly optimized, choppy, and hard to play. I gave them a pass, since it is hard to optimize for all the different Android devices out there. But I should have taken a hint. The PC version, from what I can tell, is the tablet version with mouse controls. Woohoo. Everything is way too large, the graphics are unchanged, textures are horrific. It also sucks to start over each time you change devices, as the game is very 'grindy' to get new stuff (expecially when you've beaten all the maps before and are just going through the motions). Overall, when a PC port comes out, at a higher price, I expect something new, not just a ported control scheme. I'd take a refund if I could, but this being Steam there's no chance of that.			"

Get your 4 soldiers to clear out an area as quick as possible for the highest score.Your team is limited you can't switch around different classes in your team, you have to make a new team if you want to have play other classes. When you start the game you have to make a team right away, you can't change game options or anything else first.It's an ok game,  lacking depth.

												Bearing in mind that I bought this game hoping it would be like XCOM...This game's novelty wears off quickly. There are a limited number of maps and the player's missteps can be corrected by repeating the stage. This turns the game into nothing more than an achievement grind once you've learned the maps. PROs:It is very satisfying to enter a room blind and clear everyone in it in one turn. This is done by way of choosing a path for each member to take as well as controlling the areas where they are to look.When your team members level up you can increase their stats. These stats can increase things like the distance moved, accuracy, speed of acquisition, as well as class based skills.CONs:Limited number of maps and enemy placement turns this game into rote memorization.Quickly boring.Neither PRO or CON:Rogue-like in that some equipment became available only after a certain number of stars are achieved. Said stars are awarded based on mission success rating: 1-5.			"

												First of all let me say, I wouldn't pay the full price for this game.. But if you're a fan of turn-based tactical strategy games & it is on sale, this game is a must buy. I'd probably describe this game as a stripped down version of X-COM. Instead of killing aliens around the globe, you are put in ""raid"" type scenarios against terrorists. Unlike X-COM though, there is no real story, you just complete missions & earn a number of stars depending on your performance. As you gain stars you unlock more levels, gear, etc. You earn silver each time you complete a mission, which you can use to to buy the new gear. You can make more than one squad & you can chose what Branch they are, such as SAS, SEALs & Rangers, etc. You're men level up allowing you to allocate points to certain attributes & they gain perks relative to what they specialise in. At the end of the day, this game is a fun strategy game with a heap of levels & difficulties to play on. The graphics, sounds and controls are basic, but good & overall the game is a great time killer. So I would definitely recommend this game if its ON SALE. I would not recommend it at the full price of $15 which in my opinion is a joke.			"

Product received for free
												My friend gifted this to me a few years ago, after we were discussing its success on the mobile platform. It really didn't develop much past that. I'd buy it for the current sale price ($1.69 CDN) but I would not spend 16.99 on it.Pros:-Fun, easy gameplay-Satisfying seeing your custom units engage enemies-Different ways to build teams-Good on low-end computersCons:-Gameplay is limited in controls. Either you hold the entire turn, or walk to a certain point. If you have 2 people on either side of the door and want to make an entry without getting them both killed instantly, you need to make one take a few steps back and then move through the door, which hinders how far he can move in the turn.-Customization is good but needs fixing. A JPC does not offer as much protection as over vests in the game, and its just as heavy as some of the other vests.-Fix CADPAT uniforms.-Again, I get this is turned based, but why can't I tell them to wait 2 seconds before entering so the frag or flashbang can go off?That's basically as far as this goes. Again, development did not seem to continue after it made its transfer to the world of PC gaming. It's a fun game, but I'll stick to it on my phone.			"

												Only cost $2 and at the time of writing already have over 2 hours played. Worth the money? ABSOLUTELYWould it be worth $20, prooobably not, it's a mobile port.  At least has WASD for the camera and a few PC graphical features, it is optimized perfectly well.  But it definitely feels clunky, not quite as in depth as Frozen Synapse but it's at least military so I dig that.The customisation is pretty average, lots of options that are very similar to each other, a bit surprised they didn't let loose and add heaps of models/skins/weapons for the PC version, hopefully there's mods out there that fix that.Good fun and feels incredibly satisfying when you pull off a perfect breach and clear without taking a hit.  Good game to pick up for the work PC or if you're travelling or even just bored on your main rig and want something a bit different. "

			Views: 64		

			An awesome Indie MOUT (Military Ops in Urban Terrain) strategy game. In the first episode, I enable permanent death and clear the first two missions.		

This game gets and deserves much of the praise that it gets.  It's a strategic doorkicking strategy game with enough content featuring 3 modes currently (Terrorist Hunt, Bomb Defusal, and Hostage Rescue/Escape).  You control 4 operatives from the Rangers, SEALs, SpecOps, Speznaz or other such organizations through each area in a series of phases where you issue commands.  The ""special"" element to this game is it's perspective concept and ""owning every corner"" by controlling the direction that your guys are looking as they enter and clear each room.  The shooting on it's own is fully automated if the soldiers are looking in the right direction but it does allow you to aim thrown grenades and medkits only work on nearby allies.  The enemies will react to noise and often charge out of rooms so covering doorways is still a concern (or you can use an intelligence soldier to wedge the door)Certain weapons get unlocked in the store as you achieve a certain number of stars but any completionist out there might want to revist the stages to aim for the 2100 stars achievement.  I found a certain amount of ""violence of action"" was required to 4 star the missions later on.The problems with this game lies in it's somewhat hollow customization options when it comes to the marketplace options as outfitting each unit feels more like equipping Stat-sticks rather than anything new an improved (especially when it comes to gear).  The consumables make the game much easier if you're willing to grind out a few of the previous levels to pick up a few defibilators (completely negating permanent death) and UAVs but for hardcore fans/gamers they might choose to avoid those completely to artificially amp the challenge.  The level up perks and stat increase from grinding experience makes the game a snap for anyone playing on harder difficulties but struggling with a particular stage.The other issue is that the gameplay itself feels tedious as you continue on through it's somewhat repetitive missions of pointing your guys at enemies and watching them do their thing.  The context for the missions is very thinly described on a mission brief but not integrated into the game very well (as you have to escape to the main menu between each mission in order to even read this excerpt).  I found very little keeping me attached to the story or my unit itself without some personal imagination on the ""terrorists"" we're hunting.  I'll still recommend the title for being a foray into something different but it's not without it's own set of issues.			"

												Over all I really enjoyed playing Breach & Clear but as with everything there are always things I would like to see changed or included in the future. The graphics are a port from a mobile game so the visuals do leave a little to be desired, and the stop and start gameplay can get a little annoying after a while. I would have liked to see the ability to view the whole mission from start to finish as a replay that you could save and upload to YouTube (or similar site) later. I also think that with the introduction of a level editor or multiplayer component of some kind, but hey that’s just me. But the biggest issue with the game is actually its price currently the mobile version of Breach & Clear is listed at $4.99 while the Steam version is listed at $14.99, currently it is on sale for $9.99.The games publisher has defended this price difference by noting that everything is included in this version of the game out of the box unlike its mobile counterpart, some fans are still finding this hard to swallow but if you haven't played Breach & Clear yet and don't like to game on mobile devices than it is worth playing especially while its still receiving a discounted rate.

It is casual turn-based tactical game, do not expect some deep tactical expirience.Pros: 1. Nice gameplay2. Casual turn-based tactical game3. Weapons and squad customizationCons:1.

												I would like to give this game a nice rating, but since I've bought & installed it, it hasn't worked. I've opened a ticket with their support but I'm awaiting a resonse for 2 days nows. I can't say I'm happy. I think this may end up as a waste of money. I don't even know how to go about getting a refund. So far their customer support is lacking. If things change, I'll update this post.Customer support finally came through. They solved my problem easily,. It took awhile,. but better late than never. For anyone having the input not supported issue, here's the solution:  1) Open the start menu, in the search bar type ""regedit"" and hit enter.2) In the registry editor go to: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Mighty RabbitStudios\Breach & Clear3) Modify the following values (*make sure to switch from Hexadecimal toDecimal*):        - Set *fullscreen* to 0        - Set *Screenmanager Resolution Height* to 768        - Set *Screenmanager Resolution Width *to 1024        - Set *Screenmanager Is Fullscreen mode* to 0This will allow you to set the game to run as a small window - you can thenchange the settings in-game to whatever you prefer. Thanks,Breach & Clear The game is great! I wish I had more time to play it.			"

												I really can't recommend this game to anyone who has played Frozen Synapse or any other Game like it before.Seriously,  it's an arcade shoot 'em up with elements of S.W.A.T. and Rainbow Six, nothing more. It's capable of getting you fun for about 5-8 hours but thats it. After some time, when you have managed to get your gear together and level'ed your soldiers up, you're just packing together and waltzing through the maps, spraying infinitive ammo all over the place. This whole game could be fun with proper mapping, a better AI and at least some story elements, but unfortunately, nothing of this will happen as mods or maps can't be installed. Might be the backside if you take a software that was released for another platform and set it up for sale on PC (Breach & Clear was developed for iOS) . If you like an arcade experience in this genre for every now and then, get your hands on it. If you have other intensions, like game play depth, tactical, realistical gameplay and at least some story, spend your bucks somewhere else.			"

												Breach & Clear started out as a excellant, one of my favorite, iPad games.  I was a little concern about how well it would ""upgrade"" to the PC. I was concerned it would just be a rehash, but to my delight it is not. Full support for resoultions and proper mouse and keyboard controls.A very unique and tactical minded game, highly recommended. Build your squad, load your weapons and gear, and start the missions. As you complete missions you gain stars to unlock more missions and more game modes. Your squad also levels up, allowing you to distrubute points in different areas. And a nice replay feature after each mission.TIP: You gain stars for finishing missions, the better the score the more stars, stars are used to unlock more missions and modes. Don't be afraid to start at Easy level or Normal level, that will give you more stars because you can replay each mission at each level for a full set of stars.Get this game if you love tactical planning and excution. Great job GUN!			"

												This game is fantastic. I know saying ""This game is like X:Com"" seems to be thrown around a lot these days. I don't always agree with people when they compore games to X:Com but this game is spot-on. From the ability to manage full squads of people to customizing almost everyhting about them. You can also choose from a wide array of weapons and weapon attachments in a way that seems to pay homage to the loadout scheme in games like Call Of Duty. It's absolutely simple to learn and pickup. It's as if someone took Frozen Synapse/Call of Duty/ and X:Com and blended them toghether pretty damn seamlessly.If you are a fan of tactical shooters or military based games in gereral this game is a MUST OWN. I can say I was not expecting to have so much fun in the short ammount of time that I was available to play it.-Casey			"

												Summary: Lacks depth, unhelpful and ugly interface, bad platform port.Game is highly lacking in many things, feels bland and annoying.You're immediately greeted with a very unhelpful squad creation menu that not only gives you minimal information on all the choices but also doesn't allow you to change/undo choices. You can make another squad after but it apparently costs in-game credits.The origins as a portable game show greatly as the controls are very simply and obviously designed to be played with a single finger, and there's been no effort made to make this more ideal for PC.If you like watered down mobile game ports, go for it.

What is Breach & Clear?Breach & Clear is a tactical top-down squad-based stratergy game. The goal of the game is split into 3 Types! You have the (Lets call it) Terrorist Elimination where you have to clear each room and area of terrorists; Bomb Defusal, where you try find the bomb hidden in one of many rooms and when you do find the bomb, you have 25.00 seconds (5.00 seconds per phase) to defuse the bomb and/or defend the bomb whilst 1-3 other soldiers defuse it; Then you have Escape Plan, Terrorists have attacked the building your sqaud was in (why they were in there is a mystery) and your 4 squad members are spread around the buildings and have to fight their way to the extraction point.Why SHOULD you buy it?Its Quite a fun game that only hardcore RTS or Hardcore Stratergy fans would fully enjoy. If you aren't a hardcore RTS/S Gamer. THEN BREACH AND CLEAR IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR YOU.What are the positives?Well, since the Mobile one is free and is tied down by in-app purchases. This is the best way to go. To get this game, it's most recommended to get it on sale. I've got a spare copy in my gift inventory just if the occasion arises to pull it out.It's also got cool unlockable weapons as you progress, Every campaign is just a certain amount of stars to unlock and not $1.99/£1.99 for single things.What are the negatives?Only the price, really. £10.99 may sound reasonable to a true hardcore fan but it's unreasonable since it's onsale almost all the time meaning that you should just pull out a stove, get your tent set and get camping. The game goes as low as £1.59 for most sales.The other ""drawback"" is that you have to think of how ♥♥♥♥'s gonna go down in the missions. One wrong step and you'll be raging or be mad due to the lack of skill you probably have or just how unlucky you are.Is Breach & Clear Collection worth it???Sorry, no. For one example, there is the price. For another example is how bad the other games are. And for the final example, the Original Breach and Clear is all you need as well as mod support. Random Banter: Why not add mod support?It'd be funny if we had mod support. Imagine this: BLEACH & CLEAR. The guy on the front would be replaced with a clorox bleach bottle. I mean c'mon! Who doesn't want to fight as Clorox Bleach and vs terrorist bleaches. That'd be ♥♥♥♥♥ epic. Or How about Warhammer crossing over. It'd be another fun game mod to see. I dunno if the game has mod support but I'm still waiting for the sequel ""BLEACH & CLEAR"".			"

												Breach and Clear is good for what it is, a squad level turn based strategy game(though it meshes real time mechanics into it). That's the short version.The long version is that this game does well to cover a market that really isn't thriving right now. For so long strategy games have been more about commanding large armies rather than smaller squad levels of highly specialized soldiers. The few that do attempt this are either outdated or poorly executed. Breach and Clear provides a breath of fresh air to a genre that seemed stuck for a long time.I will admit, the gameplay is rather simpe and somewhat repetitive, but still will suit true strategy/military genre fans out there. You are allowed to control 4 man squads of some of the world's best specialized combatants (American Special Forces, Army Rangers, Navy SEALs; German KSK; British S.A.S.; Russian Spetsnaz; Canadian JTF2). In this squad creation of whatever force you decided to pick(you cannot mix and match, if you pick Rangers, all four members of that squad are Rangers, but you can create multiple squads), you create four operators each with default skills and loadouts(the loadout is by default the M4A1 SOPMOD, the skills vary somewhat based on what kind of force you pick. Special Forces, for example, will have higher health stats by default). Upon creating a squad, each member of the team you create must be assigned a role, and depending on this role he will have special abilities and skills(the fireteam leader provides bonuses to his squad as well as being able to draw enemy fire, for example). As you complete missions, your soldiers will  earn experience, thus allowing them to upgrade certain stats, such as health, movement speed, accuracy, etc. Also, with each successful mission, you earn moeny to buy new gear and weapons for your operators(only qualm I have about the guns is that they are almost all American used weapons, most of which AR-15 derivatives, so there's not a whole lot of variation there).When you start a mission, you are given an aerial view of the area of operation(this is the main viewpoint for te entire game). This will allow you to examine the area before sending your guys in. Once content with what you see, you can select which entry points you want your guys to stack up on(most maps will have at least two entry points, though there are several that have just one). You can divide your team to tackle multiple entries and cover more ground, or you can keep your units together and lessen the risk of one of them going down. When you send the guys in, you have a movement stage, where you coordinate where you want your guys to go, what direction they cover, what actions they should do, etc. Once you got all that figured out, you can execute, and your guys will follow your orders to the best of their ability. Be mindful, when you activate this and they start moving, the enemy starts moving to, and will therefore react to your guys, this is where turn based strategy meshes with real time strategy. Assuming that your team is well equiped and your tactics are sound, you should be able to complete the missions without many casualties.So the gameplay, unfortunately, doesn't vary much. The same principle is applied over and over. But the gameplay is solid and once again those who enjoy this kind of commanding style will be pleased. Overall, I'd give it a solid B rating. Could be more varied in terms of gameplay mechanics, but what it does offer is well rounded and well executed.			"

												I find this game extremely addictive, as well as effective in the genre it tries to replicate. In the settings it allows you to set a ""Permadeath"" option where if your squad members die, they are gone forever. This allows players to get connected to their squad as they progress through their career. And the act of losing one in battle can not only effect players emotionally but also can effect the squad's dynamics as you lose the benifets that that experienced soldier had. I highly recommend this game to all who love hair-raising Turn-Based Stratagy games.			"

												Squad-based breaching simulator where you use advanced tactics to eliminate multiple enemies in turns using the most elite warriors on earth. You create the 4-man squad using 6 different specialists (fireteam leader, breacher, medic, etc) and then take on 7 campaigns, (8 with dlc) each packed with 5 missions, in 3 different game modes. Terrorist hunt is pretty straightforward, bomb defusal comes with time limit, so it can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ and in the escape plan you exfiltrate your squad. Each succesful mission grants you experience for your soldiers, money and silver stars to unlock new weapons and to create new squads. I enjoyed the game cause it has replayability value and comes with some challenge, but the weapons could be more optimized and there were some lame bugs to interfere with the gameplay.			"

												This is one of those games you play when you are just a little too smart for solitaire. While it is a fun game where missions only last a few minutes, it lacks the depth to make it one of those that keep you spellbound.PROS:Quick missions that are suited to filling small gaps of time.Semi-realistic in the urban-combat senario.Easy to get into without hassling about tutorials.CONS:The game becomes repetitive very quickly, so the boredom sets in sooner than with a really good game. The replayability factor is very low.Every person decides what entertainment is worth in a Dollar amount to them. Bear that in mind in figuring that you'll probably only play this about 3 days out of every year. If that often.To the uninitiated, this may seem a valuable training-aid in securing hostile urban territory. If that is what you think, it will be less painful to just shoot yourself. No 4-man team will ever insert to clear any but the smallest maps in this game.This is not the sparkling gem of all games, but it's not the worst out there either. Far more could have been done with the idea, but it seems almost like this game was developed by one guy during a couple of coffee-breaks. It could have been a lot better, though. I hadn't played this game for a couple of years, but I took two squads up to about L20, and now I'm done for the next few years. I also noticed that nothing new was done since I played last, so don't expect new content unless you build it yourself.While I would reccommend the game, I'd not do it at the $15.00 price tag. Personally, I don't think it should cost even a third of that price, but ultimately, you decide. I think $5.00 is a fair price, and the Frozen Synapse DLC should be thrown in free at that price. Just my $0.02.			"

												Breach & Clear benefits greatly from the same game design that many smartphone games these days profit from; simplistic design, addictive gameplay, and tons of replay value.Starting out, you can design a four-man team from your Tier-1 unit of choice, including US Navy SEALs, British SAS, Canadian JTF, Russian Spetsnaz, and more. You choose a preset face for each team member, from about 20 preset faces, and then you select their role in the unit; team leader, breacher, intelligence, medic, etc. Each unit gives a special stat bonus (the Spetsnaz give two bonuses), and each role has unique skills that benefit the team, such as the ability to throw a grenade and move in the same turn, to revive allies, or to draw the fire of all nearby enemies so your teammates can move safely. The customization continues as you level up your characters, allowing you to upgrade their skills as you would in a regular RPG, increasing their hit points, accuracy, etc., as you see fit. The final touches on your team comes in the form of gear, such as helmets, that can add health to the wearer, various vests that differ in weight (which affects movement speed) and health bonus, weapons (the game includes a large arsenal of automatic rifles, shotguns, submachineguns, etc. to fit any role.. and oh yea, you can customize those too), and finally cosmetic stuff such as face paint and the clothing that your operator wears. Hell, just playing around with the customization in this game can be very impressive, but naturally the fun doesn't really start until you starting breaching doors.Breach & Clear scenarios are divided into the standard kill scenario, where you must breach a location and kill all of the targets, a bomb defusal scenario, where you must breach the location, find the bomb(s) and then protect the bomb while it is being diffused, and then an escape and evade scenario where your team is already in the thick of it, and you need to help them fight their way out of there. All three modes are available right off the bat, with higher difficulties unlocking as you receive stars for completing missions quickly, and with minimal casualties.In order to accomplish each mission successfully, you must effectively utilize your moves/turns, which are commands that decide the actions of your teammates in 5 second intervals, and the general goal of each turn is to do as much damage to the enemy as you can, while taking as little damage in return. Naturally, you can choose to run and gun willy-nilly on lower difficulties, but higher difficulties, and the later missions, require effective teamwork within your unit, utilizing tactics such as covering fire, taking advantage of flash bangs and grenades, and properly clearing rooms in a way that covers all of the corners. In the end, what you have is the satisfaction of planning out the perfect raid, followed by the even more satisfying task of watching the assault play out, and then finally basking in your own excellence as you successfully clear an entire compound of terrorists in under a minute, without getting so much as a splinter from the door you just blew up to take out the first three terrorists you came across.Sure, the game is repetitive, you don't think actual Special Operators grow tired of clearing the same kill house for the 1,000th time? The break in the monotony comes when you change tactics, when enemies decide to spawn in new places (yea, enemies change spawn locations), or when you decide to change the kit for your team. Want to go all-out stealth, with no armor and silence weapons? Go ahead. Want to go loud, with heavy armor, helmets, shotguns and machine guns? Feel free. So really, the monotony only comes from a lack in creativity. There are tons of ways to go about tackling every single mission in this game, just remember; slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.Right now, I give this game a solid 9/10, but I would certainly love to see some stuff added to the game to make it even more awesome.Hopes for future updates:More military units to choose from (MoH: Warfighter definitely got this right)A wider range of weapons beyond just rifles and a couple of submachineguns, shotguns and a sniper rifle.More breach options, please. No bang and clear? Prybar? Having a class that can breach through a wall would be awesome as well (Again, Warfighter covered these very well)Hostage/VIP rescue missions (grab and extract, or escort)Stealth missions			"

												i played this on mobile for hours on end. its definitely a fun little niche game but they haven't seem to have developed it for pc at all. the gameplay gets boring and repetitive quite quickly, with only new weapons, attatchments and maps to bring you back past the 1-2 hour mark. sadly, i paid full price £10.99, forgetting about sales and leaving my pc on with it running for an hour so i could not return it. only buy if its on sale. also the dlc is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tps. does anybody know what's happened to the developers? deadline seems to be a flop and i don't see any activity			"

												It's a fun game, and an enjoyable time killer. It's simple to learn, and if you play it like it's meant to be (you know who you are) it can be challenging with permanent deaths and the randomized placement enemies. That said, It feels like it's missing.... Things. The first thing I noticed was that there is no ""replay"" button, or theater mode. It seems like the game lends itself to such a thing, and there's none to be found. The next big thing would be the amount of maps/missions available. You'll be repeating the same ones over and over quite a bit levelling up your men (note: only men), and it gets a tad boring with no user made maps, or dlc maps to be seen.In the end, it's probably one of the best time killers I own. Until there's more to it, that's all it's going to be.			"

												Brief: Perhaps overly simplistic (and I'm a big fan of minimalist design), but fun. Long: Not a bad entry into the ""plan and go"" strategy market. It's got some dubious design decisions (e.x. the inclusion of free-to-play grind-for-gud) and has the mechanical/tactical depth of an iPhone game, along with some extremely unrefined cosmetic items and general unpolished wierdness, but it's a pretty fun game regardless.By far the game's most vulgar and cardinal flaw is its total lack of player-usable AKs.Verdict: Easily worth five U.S.A.

-Highly Recommended Title-You breach, you clear, you get level ups, you get access to more weapons and gear - you breach and clear again.Picked up B&C on sale for $4.99 USD - and this game is one of the best for value for money.The tactical side of B&C is engaging - and rewarding, and I dont feel that this is at all like an ""arcade game"". It seems realistic enough for my tastes.It could do with a bit more polishing - but for the money - I no complain.B&C is similar to the old school S.W.A.T and the more modern xcom or frozen synapsis (of which there is a dlc for B&C)Visuals are of medium to good quality - as are the sounds. There is no real tutorial to speak of, but the game is fairly easy to pick up. There were a couple of things that I though could be improved, and those are:a) extending the in-game options to include screen resolution/graphics settings. b) once a character is directed to throw a grenade or flash bang, there was no ""cancel order"" - but by selecting another playable character - this seemed to cancel the throw.Thats about the worst I could find in this game.  Pick up this game on sale or not, your choice - either way, it's alot of fun -you wont regret it. And it's the only title I have scored a 10/10 so far.Go forth and breach....then clear!Score: 10/10 "

												I see many people writing about how this is a terrible PC port of a mobile game, or about how the gameplay gets repetitive or stale. At one hour into it so far, this game has become one of my top ten favorite strategy games for several reasons. Not only does it have a huge bevy of missions to choose from, it has a large section of gameplay devoted to customization as well as (optional, sadly) PERMADEATH - my favorite aspect in any ""hardcore"" game.The gameplay is easy to learn; I was able to figure out how to play in roughly 15 minutes. The problem comes with tactics - in true to life fashion, what can go wrong WILL go wrong, and the came is fairly unforgiving. On the base difficulty and the first mission, I still lost a squadmate after he got shot in the face for getting a little too hasty, which, ironically, is what cemented this game as a favorite of mine.If you like games that challenge you, like strategy, or enjoy blowing things up, I heavily recommend Breach and Clear as an excellent choice - especially during the Steam Summer Sale, while it's half off.

												I was fortunate enough to have this gifted to me - I had been eyeing it for a while now.If you are into squad-based tactics games, then this should suit your tastes. The tutorial covers the game mechanics very well, although the gameplay is a bit lacking in depth if you are used to more hardcore tactics games. As you plot waypoints for your 4 squad members, you can click on any gridpoint in their routes and switch where they are facing, effectively allowing you to cover maximum area and actually ""check corners"" as you move. The action points come in the form of your ""speed"" rating for each character, as seconds are passing throughout the stage. The game captures the intensity of what I would imagine a real ""breach and clear"" situation would be like pretty well. If your ""turn"" is over and bullets are still flying, the game will enter slow-motion and you will even see characters in the process of falling to the ground if they've died.The character level progression is pretty fast, and you can repeat/grind levels fairly easily.The length of the game is decent, there are 3 game modes (terrorist hunt/bomb defusal/escape) for each location, and each location consists of several stages. The customization in terms of gear is not too expansive, but still very nice. You will unlock weapons as you beat stages and earn ""star"" rating points (up to 4 per level), but all the other equipment is available to purchase immediately.Something I like to do over and over is click the ""replay"" button after I've planned out and executed my moves for the round, watching from different viewpoints.Aesthetics are nice, nothing too fancy. Using cover is easy as the shield feedback will immediately tell you what level of cover your character will have. The ""undo"" button allows you to cancel any waypoints/actions you may have planned out.Overall, the game is very fun if you are into this type of gameplay. Price-wise, I don't think you would miss out on too much if you wait for it to go on sale, however, I think it is worth the current price.			"

												Breach and Clear is a turn-based strategy game in which you control four members of a squad of your own design. While there is no over-arching story, the game offers plenty of scenarios and challenges to overcome.Pros:  There's quite a bit of content: three types of gameplay (""Terrorist Hunt,"" ""Bomb Defusal,"" and ""Escape Plan"") across 35 settings (in seven campaign scenarios). That's 105 levels in the core game.  On top of that, there's a lot of replay value here, especially if you care about earning achievements, acquiring different gear, or improving your mission rating.  I've read that this is an import from iOS and Android. In no way does B&C feel like it;  it feels as if it was designed from the start for the PC. This, of course, is a very good thing. Many details, whether aesthetic (such as first-person perspective views using the first four number keys), or mechanical (such as the ability to drag and move paths that have already been placed) are welcome. Offers seven different, specialized squads to play, as well as dozens of weapons that open up as you progress.  Also offers several personnel types (Medic, Intelligence, Weapons Sergeant, et al), each with their own perks and preferences. Thoughtful (and occasionally complex) level design, coupled with a clever mix of random and strategic mob placement, offer serious challenges and extend the playability of the game. I spent nearly two hours, failed attempt after failed attempt, trying to take out Gus Fring's a cartel's meth drug lab; when I finally succeeded, it felt good.  There is the option of Permadeath (yay!), and even a ""Memorial"" area where you can view your fallen heroes. Nice touch.Cons:  The tutorial is so bare-bones that the game has an unfair reputation for being shallow, when it's simply that players are never taught correctly about the deeper features and functions available to them. The number of stars  (the game's rating system, from one to four stars) you get is, for the most part, entirely time-based. That is to say, losing team members obviously makes your rating go down, but it will also drop to a one star rating if you go past a certain time limit, no matter how well you did on the actual mission (even if everyone survives with health intact). This seems, to me, to be a bit unfair. Give me two stars at least for completing it with everyone alive. In the last campaign of the ""Terrorist Hunt"" mode (in Columbia), my soldiers simply refused to open doors, often walking right up to them but not bothering to swing it open (maybe they were busy setting up the Livestream). In any case, changing the rules this late in the game wasted valuable turns staring at the door's presumable lovely wood grain instead of killing whoever stood behind it (although this was inconsistent, even on the same map...some doors they'd open, others they wouldn't, so this was more likely a glitch than a design decision). Enemy AI can be wonky. If mobs are facing the opposite direction, they may not even notice you. I had my whole squad throw open a door and walk past an apparently deaf cartel member only two tiles away. Also, Snipers can often see through walls and high obstacles, but this mainly just affects corners. There is no real story to speak of. That's fine, but it would have been nice to have some kind of feeling of accomplishment at the finish line. ""A winner is you,"" or ""Conglaturation!"" Anything would have been nice, particularly because some campaigns promise a big finish and never follow through. For example, in the Columbian campaign, you are told you're chasing a major drug lord throughout his compound; the game leads you to believe there will be a massive shootout on the roof, complete with a helicopter waiting to take him away, only when you get there - no drug lord, no helicopter.   In ""Bomb Defusal"" mode, terrorists can suddenly appear behind you, coming through the door you've just breached! What the heck is that? You can't sell an item you already own unless you have enough money to buy another one. Makes no sense to me either, but apparently it does to one of the developers, so there it is. A few of the 64 Steam-specific achievements are just plain broken, and support is, from the forums on Steam and the developer's own website, most likely not coming.The Bottom Line:It may sound like I'm complaining, but I'm really only nitpicking. This is a solid effort that provides a lot of hours of fun. There's nothing here that a patch couldn't fix (not that I'm expecting one; it seems as if the devs have long since given up on supporting this). It's just that Breach and Clear is so close to being a really special, great game that it feels like a bit of a shame that the developers didn't feel the need to take better care of it after the birthing process. As it stands, though, B&C is a very, very good game, but one which requires some time, online research, and experimentation to truly see its depth. Recommended.			"

												If you like tactical action shooters, this is not for you. If you like Slow paced, tactical planning and preparation, you will enjoy this. The combat is clinical, because it is carefully planned. You pre-plan all your actions and then press an 'execute orders' button.

												Buy this game if you like X-Com, but want something that takes way less time to play. The level of detail is low, the sounds aren't very good, but despite all of that I still find it fun. There are lot of upgrades you can get for your squad mates and despite the game being very, very simple, I find myself replaying levels and changing the difficulty to get a new experience each time. I don't feel like this is a game I would pay 15 dollars for band be happy, but for <$10 I think you'll get 10 dollars worth of fun from this. It's always nice to have a game that you can jump in quickly and jump out quickly for when you need to kill 10 or 15 minutes.Final: If the game is on sale for less than 10 bucks I think it is worth it, the game isn't going to win any awards but it is a fun way to kill some time and the level up upgardes and customization makes you want to replay it.

												Hmm... the best way to describe this one is probably my favourite way to describe mediocre games.  Meh.  It wants to be a strategy game but I find the gameplay to be very flat.  With the character the control structure, waypoint system that's pretty dull and whatever this mess decided to call ""gameplay"" it just falls short.  It's like that army recruit learning to use grenades that pulls the pin, counts to three then throws the pin.  This may appeal to extremely casual players, or people who don't play more interesting, graphically superior and more tactically sound strategy games - and I guess that makes sense since this is really a mobile game ported to PC.  Oh, well, at least I got it on sale.  Don't fall for it.  The reviews that mentioned it was like other strategy games - them folks is crazy.

It remains a good game until you unlock everything, all stars, all guns, which can be done in a little under 15 hours. With the recent release of Breach and Clear: Deadline, this game has been forgotten, and it will remain as it is at its current state. It is a high quality game, but do not purchase unless it is at a discounted price, it is not worth $14.99.

												While the concept is good, the actual execution is lacking. Many of the expected tactical options are either missing or only unlocked at higher levels, and it often comes down to either hiding and sniping behind cover or advancing straight at the enemy. The first few maps have an intenseness that is needed, but as you progress to bigger, more open maps, it becomes a chore to clear out the area and there is little in the way of breaching.			"

												A simple tactical game. Dont go beyond that. Does not come close to its competitor Frozen Synapse, but delivers what  promises in parts, getting impossible not to compare each one.Despite having a description on page extremely tempting, promising a highly tactical and complex game, is hardly so.Strategies and options are simple, basically limiting the positioning of soldiers and their handling in each phase. You simply enter the room and see the shooting happen. You can break down doors, throw tactical devices like grenades and flashbangs, and choose which way to look. Nothing else. The game is an infinite looping entering the room, get lucky for the soldiers first shoot the enemies and start all over again.A typical game for mobile phones that was poorly ported to PC. It is very clear looking at the layouts and menus of the game, very badly adapted.Some soldiers have certain specific skills for each class, such as locking doors and having improved reaction time but also by the structure of the game such skills make little difference in the time of action.The graphics are typically mobile. Few animations make the game boring (like terrorists falling in the same position) and the sound effects are amateurs.Despite being a mobile game badly ported to PC it's a little amusing. There are options to purchase equipment and a wide customization possibilities. Probably as the game grow with their development (giving more respect to the pc's users) it can become better.Briefly comparing the competitor, are almost two different games. The complexity and tactical strategy are much deeper in Frozen Synapse.I'm not recommending the game, I suggest you wait more to spend your hard earned money and go for Frozen Synapse.Give a score 06/10 with a certain twinge of conscience.I hope you enjoy my review, any questions just ask in my profile.

It's fun and challenging or casual and cool to see it all work out!  I want to see more patches and updates with graphics or animations.  This game is real awesome.			"

												I do recommend this game but with two stipulations.The first is that you pretty much have to be either a completionist, or like me, just cycle through your games. This game does have replayability (To a certain extent). The drawback is that it get's repetitive quickly, espescially when your trying to save up for new guns or attachments.The second is more of a recommendation, buy the game while it is on sale (Currently 2.99, definitely worth it). Because of it's existant but faltering replayability (And the fact that you earn everything you need for a good squad fairly quickly) it does get old quickly and doesn't feel very fleshed out. So, my synopsis? The game is fun, but in kind of a flash-gamey way. Don't expect this to be the next game you no-life for the next year, but to get you through brief patches of boredom on occasion it should do alright. (7/10)(P.S. Just a side note, with 7 hours in the game atm I have two fully geared squads that are carrying among the most powerful and expensive weaponry/armor I can currently buy [One squad has all CTARs, the other has all P90s, both have every slot filled with the best attachments]. This game may be repetitive in it's design, but not too horribly grindy.)			"

												Nice tactic strategy, where you assume role of special unit forces and deal with terrorist threat.Game has several modes, each bringing new variety to gameplay - not just classic ""clean the enemy"", but a bit more. There is nice variety of weapons, even though one can imagine much more of those. Each weapon has different range, damage output, noise output ... add this to different roles for each team member and you can build quite a lot of loadouts.Your team can be chosen from many different, not just regular SWAT unit, but US Seals, russian Spetsnaz, JTF and much more. Possibility to camouflage them from several different variants, name them as you like (glory to my SG team :) ) and hooray to battle.I find the game quite funny and relaxing, you might even spend a lot hours in a row, especially when you will be hunting for ""perfect game"" (no injury, as fewest rounds as possible) and so on. People who like to try different loadouts will love the game, most of the people would enjoy it for a bit at least.			"

												This is a truly enjoyable game, its not just for those of you who master strategists, the difficulty settings are diverse enough that complete newbies can come and play, whilst still enjoying themselves and the challenge that 'easy' brings, however, the strategy masters are also catered for with the addition of the harder difficulties which pose immense challenges. This game is truly a gemstone, I've only played around 7 hours as of now, however i've enjoyed every part so far;from building my squad and upgrading them with better weapons and attachments to kicking in doors and picking locks before eliminating a room full of terrorists. Filled with plenty of different maps to play on, it provides hours of deep strategic gameplay.This game is unbelieveably good, I'd seriously recommend this game to anyone, regardless of whether you've played many turn based strategy games before or not. This caters for everyone.10/10, Would purchase again.			"

												I must be honest and say that I was a bit sceptic when I looked at the pictures from the game, however I decided to try it out nonetheless, after I finished my old SWAT 4 game. (It is a pretty unfair comparement, which also made me give this game a chance regardless the bad impression from the pictures) And I must say Breach & Clear surprised me positively. You can chose what kind of gear, equipment and clothes your team is going to wear and use on the small missions throughout the game which is a plus in my oppinion. Besides the customization abilities you can pick how you wish to approach the enviroments and how to back your team up, you can even chose which role you wish to be (Medic, leader, breacher etc etc) not to forget you even can name - ALL - of your team members as you like, a nice little detail. Besides that you can pick which difficulty you wish the game to challenge you at range from easy to ""insane"" so theres a difficulty for new players and veterans who doens't play other kind of games, or just because you as a player want a nice challenge. I will upvote this game because it's actually quite fun and time consuming when you first get the hang of it. I will recomend this if you as myself like tactical games as SWAT, Police Quest etc etc. - If you're in doubt buy it.			"

												I didn't know this was an iOS game...until a few minutes after playing the game that is. I got this thinking it would be fun to play the Spetznaz, but as far as i can tell there is literally no reason to pick anyone but the American special forces because they all speak in American accented english, and the only thing worse to me than a baddly accented cast is one that isn't even accented at all. Hell, they could have plugged voice lines in to google translate and had the voice actors say their lines in broken Russian and German for all i care, i wouldn't have noticed and it would have made me happy to know they at least made them speak the right langauge.Now that all the hate is out of the way, for what irked me it was a simple and somewhat fun game for the twenty minutes i gave it. I wish it was fleshed out more, maybe an economy or base building, but since its not i can't really say its worth the $14 i paid for it. If your going ot port an iOS game to the PC, you have to not only change it to fit the controls, but to also fit the price your asking for, if it was a better version of the iOS game and not just the same than maybe, but since its the same they should have priced it like it is, as a fun little I-pad game you play now and then, not like a full game your meant to play for more than a few weeks just a few weeks before going ""Nope, not playing this again"" and deleting it from your computer because its not worth the hard drive space to keep it on there			"

												I saw this game featured on the Autumn sale and seemed like a decent game for the 5$ asking price.The best way to describe the gameplay is a mix of Frozen Synapse Lite and XCOM. Units move along a path you designate and face in specific directions, engaging any enemy they see. Unlike Frozen Synapse your units can take cover behind objects and units in cover are much more durable as in XCOM. There is a major emphasis on flanking and use of grenades to flush out enemies. The game offers three game modes based around the same set of maps. The first one is straight up Seek and Destroy where you move through a level and clear it of enemies. The second involves getting to and defusing explosives. And in the third mode your units start in the middle of the level and must fight their way clear.The game is not without issues and lacks polish in many areas. The game's mobile origins are very clear in the setup of the interface and the level-based progression system. One point in it's favour is a detailed options menu for controlling sound and game resolution. Something which many games lack, especially mobile ports.When you first start the game up it immediately forces you to create a team of soldiers. First by picking the unit they come from (Navy Seals, JTF2 etc) and a class for each character of the 4-man team. However since you haven't even done the tutorial yet you will have no idea what stats do and what classes mix well together. Annoyingly each class has a set of perks you can't even see until you make a squad and examine a soldier's stat page.Every soldier starts with a set of basic equipment matched roughly to what they would use in real life. You can upgrade each soldier by unlocking and then purchasing new equipment. Progression is linear in that later more expensive equipment is better in every way. Weapons can also be upgraded with components such as a new trigger or gas system to modify the statistics. However these upgrades can easily produce weapons that break the game or weapons that deal no damage at all. In all honesty whatever assault rifle your men start with is perfectly adequate and most of the specialist weapons like the light machine gun or shotgun are useless.Soldiers can also wear various clothing and body armour, but this is another area where the lack of polish shows. Hats can clip through hair and beards. No matter what they are equipped with your soldiers have a tan coloured pistol belt that probably won't match the other things they wear.The third mission type is extremely silly. The premise of having your men escape the level is good, but the implementation is terrible. Your men start scattered around the level with each man in a mexican standoff with 1-3 gunmen standing not 10 feet away. 90% of the time all you have to do to win the level is to hit the end turn button, watch your men gun down everything and then spend a couple turns moving them to the exit. Personally I just pretend this part of the game doesn't exist and stick to the first two mission types.--All in all I would recommend this game for sale price only. There is fun to be had, but don't get into it expecting Rainbow Six. The developers are working on a new game called Breach and Clear: DEADLINE which promises to be an improved version of the game built with the PC in mind instead of the mobile platform. Sales of this game can only help them in that endeavor.			"

												Don't get me wrong the game is fun but there are problems as well. I will update my review if they update their game. The attachments for the weapons are really unbalanced there is one vest you can buy that give your men something like +175 health while the others for the same price will give them +5-10. I don't know if you had to pay for this vest in the phone version or what? Plus many more weird things. When I select a different trigger the picture doesn't show it on the gun. Silencers lower damage come on in Call of Duty that makes sense but this is a simulator. Many weird things with the attachments.Weapons are weird as well. You can only buy two weapons at the beginning and even after unlocking a third the gun your guys start with is better... So I'm not sure wny they would give you an option to buy a new crappier one?Tool tips would be nice. There are 6 classes but you can see the differences while lining them up at the door. It would be nice if you could tell this. There are a lot of places more tooltips would come in handy.If you your walk up to a door they open it. I wish there was a way for them to sit next to it without opening it. Not a huge deal you just after to remember this when telling them where to go. They also need to put a restart put in the game. If you lose a couple guys you have to either finish the map, kill your other guys, or get out of the game to restart. As soon as your are done with the map you can restart so its not like they don't let you replay the maps.Overall this is a fun game. But I think if I could go back in time I would have waited to see if they patch it first.			"

												I miss the old strategic tactical games like SWAT 3 & 4 and so I though this purchase would be great for me. While game is presented as a hyper realistic tactical game, it feels like a flash game in it's execution. The UI is awful and you can't have your men synchronise their movements or time things specifically.There are many small bugbears I have with this game, you can't swap soldiers position in a single move, you can't throw grenades over cars, you can't really do things that would make this game in any way realistic...

There is no background story around the various missions, the user interface isn't very polished, the movement system is limited, the character development not too interesting, the graphics just ok, and the maps quite small.This game is an interesting mix of various features found it other games, but that's the only thing I find likeable about the game.

												I bought this game because I like X-COM a lot and thought this might have been a good alternative before a new ""real"" PC TBS game came out and for once there were more than US units and British SAS, including one of my personal favorite : the German Kommando Spezialkräfte or KSK for short.So I ""created"" my unit, I use the word very loosely as there are not a lot of physical customization available for your soldiers, still better than what BF4 of COD do though, I entered the game and blazed through 3 environment, about 15 missions, with barely a scratch on my men, starting to think ""Ok this is starting to stink badly..."", only to finally start getting some pretty serious opposition in the next environments to the point where I finally had to start thinking how not to get my me killed... even though calling the enemies ""mentally challenged"" would make the COD AIs look like rocket scientists.So the game does offer a fair deal of challenge in later stages.But what about ""The Gear"" ? Yes with upper cases because that's what gives an 8 year old playing COD wetdreams. One word defines my whole experience on that : ""disappointment"". To explain it better the customizations options for clothing and apparel is giving a decent choice but : the plate carriers and chest rigs all look the same and the arsenal  comes straight from your average US armory. Why is it a problem ? Well, because the armory is an AR-15 based orgy (seriously, you got more than 20 variation on the M4/M16) and a couple things more ""original"" live a 1st version TAR-21 and SCARs seen thousands of time before... where are the real guns like, I don't know, Aks, HK416/417, FAMAS, G3 or even the base gun all KSK use : the G36K (and I found that many people think only the C exist)... I have more variaty in my own armory.Also : where the hell are the side arms ?Also one might think given the realistish approach the gun stats may have reflected their actual use in real life, but in fact is a linear progression where the next gun is better only by virtue of being unlocked later.Graphics and animation are less than appealing but as stated in many other reviews the game was mainly built for mobiles devices but given the price tag on this game I seriously cannot excuse the lack of work put in textures that seemed to have just been stretched and ludicrous animation (special mention for the pathetic door kicking at initial rounds).This is not acceptable at all for a 15$ game !In the end I had some hopes for this game but fact is this game does not just fail to deliver, it is simply a money grabbing operation on TBS amateurs such as myself and all the Kikoolols thinking they could become SAS by snapping their fingers (thanks Modern Warfare...).To sum it up : you want a real TBS game, just type X-COM in the search bar and save yourself.

												Fun, but feels unfinished. Small bugs here and there - when in inventory you may equip items but they don't appear on the inventory screen. AI is DUMB, DUMB, DUMB!!!!Graphics are so-so - little in the way of effects and color. Textures are bland and there are no lighting effects. Everything feels very low resolution. Level design is somewhat boring. Nothing has really stuck out as a cool level. Figure out what doors to breach when and you can pass the level every time.			"

												I'm kinda torn on Breach & Clear. It does some things right, but it is also lacking in other ways. It manages to deliver a solid tactical experience against a backdrop of beautifully rendered (and diverse) hand-crafted maps.At the end of the day, however, I had fun playing Breach & Clear. It managed to genuinely entertain me. I'm just glad that didn't pay full price. I'd recommend you wait for a sale and do the same.

												Bought this for under USD3, and I have to say, at this price, it's a real bargain. The game is quite simple, and engagingly so.  Essentially, there are missions (at increasing difficulties) at various locales, i.e. afghanistan, turkey, china, etc. and you set up your squad to complete these missions, with the least no. of casualties to your squad and at the quickest time possible. Succeed and you will be rewarded with experience points (to level up your squad mates) and money (which you use to buy better equipment). It's that straight forward. Downside to this game is that there is no storyline at all, thus, if you fancy a story-driven game, look elsewhere. I'd reckon the game would really benefit from a solid storyline, that will coax the player along. As is, the missions feel too ""piecemeal"", and as such, there is a lack of continuity.If you have purchased the game and is struggling, here's a tip :- Use as many waypoints as possible! And with each waypoint, cover the required angles. And also, use cover!			"

												One of the better tactical games out there.  Several out there will tell you otherwise because of a few reasons.  Some complain about the graphics being dated, well I am an old school gamer from the Atari 2600 days so lemme say that great graphics do NOT make great gameplay.  I'd rather have a blocky ugly game that plays great than some photo-realistic crap that simply isn't fun just pretty to look at.  Another group of players will say there's no varity in weapons, equipment, etc.  Folks being a former active duty U.S. Marine I can tell ya that in the real world you don't always get ""varity""  you get what your issued and make it work.  You improvise, overcome and adapt.  Those are the two biggest complaints I see from some reviews, most of these only have one sentence and in no way justify their complaint on the game in any way.  There is plenty of weapons and equipment and as you unlock harder difficulties you'll fond plenty of challenge and replayability.  There's no one way to beat each scenario, you can try different approaches each time and see which works best.  Graphically the game is just fine and reminds me of the models used in the original Rainbow Six, whuch was way better  than its better looking sequels.  Plus this is available for iOS now so you can play on the go.  I think multiplayer is the only thing I'd add or improve in the game at all.  I highly recommend this title to any fans of urban combat, close quarters simulation.  One of the best, period.			"

												Check your corners.  This is a great game that forces you to think and plan out the moves.  Your operatives are good, but if you don't plan and think about your moves, they will get downed by a barely literate moron with an AK and an itchy trigger finger.  The game plays smoothly, has RPG elements, with an easy to use interface and missions of increasing complexity.  The wide variety of units in the game is also a plus, both specialist operatives and differing national groups.  I might be happy simply because JTF2 is in the game.The game has a lot of potential, and I recommend it for anyone who enjoyed the original Rainbow 6 and all the planning that happened before the mission.

												First of all, this is my first review, so if I wrote it in the wrong way, tell me how to write a proper review.Breach and clear is a turn based strategy game in which you control 4 spec ops troops and either eliminate all terrorists in the map, defuse the bomb, or get to the extraction point. There will not be multiple objectives in one mission.Pros:High Customisation. in guns you can attach lights, IR systems, sights, different triggers, and gas systems and muzzle attachments, note that you can't customize all of them on all guns. You can change the kind of armor they wear, helmets, etc.Not too hard (but not too easy)EXTREMELY enjoyableGood graphicsCons:Gameplay gets kind of dull, since there is very little plot (what you get is something like :A small group of terrorists have taken over a small american buisness in afganistan. Clear out the building)Extremely cheap voice acting (all the different special forces all have the same voice acting, Spetsnaz speaking english like americans, that doesn't sound right does it? Where are the SAS's british accents?)Voice acting lines are few and dull, when one of your guys is getting killed, I excpect him to say something like; I need support! Or something like that, instead, they say nothing.No multiplayer at all, I hope the devs are working on it, I'd also like a level editor or something like that.Overall I would say 8/10			"

												Okay. First of all, this game is HIGHLY addictive, be warned.But, there's some major problems with this game I've found personally.After levelling up my whole squad to 35+ and unlocking most of the guns..the game lost my save files and causes me to start from square 1 with a whole new squad.I don't know if that is a common problem with other people, but this has happened 3 times to me. The first two I was only just into the game so was only slightly annoying, but when I lose 10+ hours of gameplay, it is infuriating.Secondly, many achievements do not unlock first time. Eg. achievement to finish a map under 5 seconds. It took me 8 attempts till it finally registered that I completed the achievement.Tl;dr - I would recommend to get the game. You will get addicted to it. You WILL get very annoyed. And you may possibly lose all your hours of progress and get even more annoyed.			"

This game feels like something from the year 1999. You shoot bad guys and they just sort of slump over and are stuck in whatever last frame of animation they end up in before your next turn starts. It doesn't feel authentic. The game is interesting but I get it, it's a simulator first and then a game. Like, the kind of simulator you would use to train at work if you were a Navy Seal or Special Ops-type. If those jobs meant working in an office. I recommend this game but Jagged Alliance and Frozen Synapse are 2 much MUCH better versions of this game.			"

Its all about loadouts and team tactics in a SRT/BC format. The DLC is kinda what ever but it is a must if you are going for 100% achievements. The game is highly replayable and has some semi tough difficulty settings. Silver (the game currency) is a little hard to make a ton but once you getr your first team/squad to all rank 30 its not to bad. The game also features a hardcore mode so when you die ....well your dead I for one like this feature in alot of games.

												10/10I loved the old Police Quest: Swat games, Jagged Alliance, XCOM, Door kickers, Dead State, Omerta, Shadowrun etc etc and I can say that by far this is my favorite plan-n-play style of game. The only thing that would make this game better in my eyes  would be the ability to pause anytime you want and change the tasked orders. (Like Door Kickers or Jagged Alliance 2 Back in Action) It's a bit more realistic when you can pause and give your squad new commands instead of watching them take 10 bullets in the back before dying because you forgot to set a squad member to check a corner or an enemy pops out of a door right after you pass it.

Breach& Clear is a perfect blend of XCOM & classic Rainbow 6, so fans rejoice!Graphics 8/10.Gameplay 10/10 (outastanding!)Sound 8/10Variety 8/10My only gripe with it is that I've spent 9 hours straight playing through all the missions and I want MORE!Seriously though, in the current game market and for a price of 10$ this is a must-have.

												A surprisingly deep strategy game. I'm impressed in a good way :o) I wish they'd hired someone who knows how to build a proper interface, but it's functional and with a little fiddling you can get your guys to do what you want. Minor quibble. I'd recommend giving this game a try if you like strategy games.			"

												I love it. Not only is it like Rainbow 6 and X-com it is also like Full Spectrum Warrior and X-com. Im a fan of such tactics on a micro scale to take me away from war strategy games such as Empire series, StarCraft Series, or Supreme Commander Series. I also like the RPG elements of leveling up your individual members and the arsenal of weapons and accessories.			"

												Here's my review for, Breach & Clear !! **Early Review (2h gametime)** (7.6 out of 10.0) Overall.Before you start reading (this review is kinda long) you can just take a look at my screenshots to see what this game is about.http://steamcommunity.com/id/xDMikeW2k14/screenshots/?appid=266130&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewallNow to my review :First Look: I didn't know what I'm about to witness of playing this game because I don't play simulator games so much. And especially tactical simulators.My first run was near 2 hours. I enjoyed this game and played the first mission, 5 times.This game has very much to offer in terms of difficulties,missions,equippments,replayability,roles and ofcourse the main reason we purchae this game - tactics.Gameplay: Gameplay is very simple once you get used to it (I got used to it very fast and the tutorial was short and clear).You have 4 characters, each one has same options and your role is to control them.Besides that, there is the map itself which has easy acess to it (all you need to do is to move the cameras to your like, and manovering the soldiers on the map.)Me as a hardcore tactical fan player I like to complete each mission on the best side so it took me around 15-20 minutes to complete a mission but after you do the same mission few times you do it faster and easier, and while still enjoying the mission. (8/10)Cons: 1) Repetetive. 2) Full Members each mission (Annoying thing is you can only use all 4 members and not 2 or 1 or 3.)Gameplay Styles: 1) Go loud and use breaching equippment / Loud weapons / Frag grenades etc2) Go quiet and use silencers / lock picks / Flashbangs etc3) Split your team through the rooms or work with all of them togather in each room.4) Enjoy your time in investing and planning each mission to your liking and your own tactical strategy.5) Difficulties - 5 Difficulties. (8.5/10)Graphics: Only saw one map so far but each room looks realistic with objects and tactical props (Walls/Big Closets etc that can block the A.I view so you can take cover behind them). (5/10)Cons: 1) Lack of FPS. I get this is a sim game but they did add fps moments but I'm not feeling it cuz it's only in start/end of the mission. it would be better if we could switch between FPS and Map-Look modes of the cameras but oh well I guess it will take the tactical-strategy element of this game.Equippment:What can I say about this one.. 4 Sections - Weapons , Gear , Headset , Consumeables.There is an in-game store (Buy/Sell items from the money you've earned in each mission).In each section there are many things to buy include Vests/Guns/Gun Parts/Suit Colours/Camos/Grenades etc..Some of them are locked, you need to unlock them as you progress through the game.There are also stats like Speed/Accuracy/Noise etc in some of the equippments. (7/10)Cons: A bit more organized menu would be better, and there are some items I don't think I will use.RPG Elements:I should talk about this one cuz there are 6-7 special op teams you can choose from.6 Roles to choose from and stick them to your soldier. (Not sure yet if each team has different roles or not)Stats in equippment items and Money to invest in equippment.Level up system to your soldiers. + XP.Choose how your soldier will look like, and colour your guns. (6/10)Enjoyment: (9/10) I'm sorry but this is one of the best tacticla simulators I've played.. I can invest all my time in this game figouring out different tactics/ways to approach into the enemy.Repetetive: (6/10) It is but still you enjoy playing this game.Replayability (9/10)Frustraiton (1/10) - Early review but as long as you know what you do in this game.. You're fine.Boredom (0/10) - Nothing so far.			"

												Very polished tactical shooter in vain of Frozen Synapse. Decent customization even though the weapon and gear models look too similar. The weapons are balanced and there are several nice levels which can be enjoyed in 3 modes: Terrorist hunt (kill everybody), Bomb Defusal, survival/escape. Graphics are decent but not eye-popping. Far from it, actually. The human models all look pretty much the same even if you select different characters. Mediocre at best and could have used a more vivid style and color palette. The gameplay itself is turn based tactical battles. about 70% of the maps are indoors and use tight corridors and covers to keep the action pumping and the rest are outdoors which focus more on tactical play and choosing the best ways to strike.Your squad of 4 (which you can create yourself and customize) level up as you gain more stars in missions and more XP. You also receive money to purchase new weapon upgrades and gear. You choose specifically which attribute to level up for each soldier (e.g. accuracy, speed, special ability, reaction etc.). This all helps to give the game longevity as well as harder difficulty settings which make the game much more demanding. I'd also like to note that the music is pretty cool.I only wish there was a ""Restart Level"" button in the pause menu because you need to go back to the main menu every time you choose to restart a level mid play.All in all, a great bargain game and I'd say it's worth the full price even though there aren't many maps to play around in (there are new ones in a DLC though). But if you liked Frozen Synapse or want to give the games a try I think you'll like what you find here.			"

												TL;DR get Doorkickers insteadFor five bucks more you could get Doorkickers which has better gameplay, way more unique levels+campaigns, more modes (hostage rescue, VIP escort, heists in addition to bomb defusal and just search and destroy), doesn't recycle maps nearly as much (to be fair Doorkickers does recycle some levels), an in game editor allowing you to create your own levels and mod support. This game is $4 on the Apple Store and the only difference (apart from it being on a PC rather than an Apple iPhone/Pad/whatever) it has in app purchases. Also, the developers have the guts to claim that real life Special Forces units use this as an educational tool for real life in the intro (

 ). So your telling me that this game, which started life as an iOS game, is considered the 'Most Advanced Training Tool Avaliable', over Vitural Battlespace 1 or 2 (which was developed specifically for militaries to train soldiers), or even ARMA or just actually getting of your ♥♥♥♥ and doing actual training? I admit I have no back ground in the military but I'd bet my entire bank account that the claims made in the intro video is complete B U L L S H I T. If it wasn't for this claim, I would have probably just kept the game as I bought it on sale, but if the Devs want to lie to my face like that, I'm taking a refund.  "

You have to go back to the main menu and restart and it all happens again once the first shot hits.

												I thought this was a tactical squad combat game. To be a tactical squad combat game certain elements must be present. Such as the ability to change stance, from prone, to kneeling and standing, and receive modifiers to accuracy based on stance. Also select fire mode which also modifies accuracy versus rounds fired. This game has neither. Its very arcade. For those who played Brigade 7.62, or Jagged Alliance Back in Action, Soldiers at War, Soldiers of Anarchy, X com, Hired guns, Silent Storm etc... you will be disappointed. This is a 3D arcade game. Nothing more. My bad in a way for not researching more. But the pictures and vid files really make the game look detailed and tactical in a way similar to the games I listed above. But it is not, it only masquerades as a tactical 3rd person POV squad level game, oh did I mention it is very arcade?			"

												Breach & Clear is an actual training manual for rifle-team leaders.  The scenarios are serious, realistic opportunities for you to learn how to set up a mission team, how to position them for maximum mutual cover, how to carry out a mission without loss of members of your team and a constant improvement of real-life skills from scenario to scenario.  I recommend this for SERIOUS military types who want to improve or develop abilities to lead and plan for real rifle-team missions.  A+ / 5*			"

												So I bought this game for $5. Played one full hour and am completely hooked! This game is Frozen Synapse with amazing graphics, in depth tactics, but minus the time manipulation.  The weapon customization is very good. There is a large amount of weapons and attachments to buy with the in game money. Along with gear and camo. Your team members gain XP, and through leveling up you can customize each character to play as you wish under specific skills. All in all this is the best $5 I have spent on a game in a very long time, and I give this game a high reccomendation to those of you that enjoy a fast pace turn by turn strategy game.			"

												I hate turn-based tactical games. But when they are done right (because most arent) they are great fun. Its a genre that requires special attention to many details. Breach and Clear does all of those details right...even in the weapons and gear customization sections; an entire section that I was happily pleased to find, use, and have it actually matter in the game.This was obtained for $6 on sale but I wouldnt be mad if I had paid full price.

												It's something I start up every once in a while when I feel I don't have a lot of time. It starts up fast, the missions are short and it's good fun. Everytime I end up playing longer than anticipated and rarely do I regret it. The game isn't something I play consistently, but on an every-now-and-then-basis I enjoy it a lot. Definitely happy with the purchase. :)			"

												A fun game to play around with for a few hours that has limited replayability. This is a tactical strategy game that has you take command of a 4-person team that ""breaches and clears"" small areas. You command each unit individually, controlling things like their exact movement patterns, which way they will face, equipment to use, and so on. Has a huge amount of superficial depth, meaning that there is a ton of stuff to the game that doesn't really seem to impact it all that much, like unit stats. My unit with the worst reaction time, worst accuracy, and using the weakest gun would regularly clear out rooms of 2-4 enemies effortlessly, while my unit specially designed to kill enemies would fail to kill a single enemy out in the open. Despite this, it's definitely worth picking up and playing around with if deeply discounted.			"

												I don't understand why there is so much positive reviews, I can only explain this with fact that there is not much games like this, so people have very low expectations and happy to have any kind of game like this.This game has same problem, as all recent attempts to make remake of Jagged Alliance, or Brigade E5/7.62 High Calibre series game. Maybe even worse. Much worse.Dull models, dull art, dull animation, dull and ugly UI, non intuitive controls/UI. White standard fonts without outlining, in the dull gray boxes. Upon realizing mechanics of this game, that in fact it's very bad turn based game with square grid, and not smart pause planing game like previously mentioned - you will just hate it.My recommendation - if you want recent good game in this genre, you better go and get Doorkickers, they maybe be 2D, and look like some silly casual arcade/puzzle in a first glance, but in the end, it's much better looking game and playable game. It has its own flaws, but at least it's playable and fun game. If you want smart-pause tactical 3D game, get latest Jagged Aliance remake - it suck because performance issue, because it's sometimes unpredictable when things that happen are non-intuitive and not really realistic (acting not according to real life logic), and annoying in general, yet it's still better game, you can have at least some fun. If you want turn-based square grid tactical game, go and get - XCOM: Enemy Unknown (yeah, shame that this game is absolutely not even close by quality to XCOM, i would like XCOM quality game but more serious with little bit more realism, and without aliens, but about special forces... but no luck, this game is not like this).Now thinking, even Rainbow Six (the original one) would be a better game (you can plan your actions, and then just watch how everything goes), and even maybe more reasonable tactical simulation (wtf is with this intro, saying that this game is used by military to train? is this a joke?)

												Breach and Clear is not the kind of game you would expect it to be, walk into room, shoot things, kill things is what you would have expected to be doing with your time on Breach and Clear, but as soon as you begin the training mission it becomes very apararent that storm into a run guns blazing is not the only way to do things. You get to create a squad from seven different military forces (SAS, Seals, Spetznaz etc) and create the characters from scratch naming them and giving them a specific role within the team (medic, team leader, weapons sergeant etc) and as you play missions with them they earn XP and level up, you then earn points which you allocate to a specific skill tree on that character, relatively simple to anyone who has played a game about gear or character progression. The game is very user friendly, after playing the short 5 minute tutorial I felt like an expert, the key important features and commands you can issue to your squad are used repeatedly in the tutorial to get you used to them and the features that arne't reinforced are very easily and quickly learned, whether you want that soldier to go in that door or one soldier to throw a flashbang then the other storm the room and take out the hostiles, if you want to do it you can! Another feature that makes this game well worth the money (grab it for $3.50 now while you can) is the endless replayability, make new squads then replay each mission on the hardest difficulty experimenting with the different mechanics each time you play it!Overall Breach and Clear is quite frankly perfect, there is nothing wrong it in my eyes which earns it a 10/10			"

												Basically, it's a simplified version of Frozen Synapse. It's tons of fun and very well polished for a mobile port. Most things in this game are done right, but there are a few huge flaws about that keep it from greatness. First off, there's no multiplayer mode... Really!? A turn-based strategy has no multiplayer gamemode!? Secondly, the camera controls are a bit wonky. You'll get accustomed to it, but it just feels off. Finally, there isn't a story. You're just dropped into singleplayer missions. There are 3 game modes and about about 95 missions in all, which will give you about 15 hours of game time, but they dont have much replayability, so once you play them, then they're done... I got it in the humble bundle and I can say it was easily worth that price. If you enjoy games like XCOM: Enemy Unknown, Frozen Synapse, or Jagged Alliance, then you have no excuse to not buy this game.So, lets review.Pros:+Great addicting gameplay+Large amount  of character and squad customization+Decent visuals for a mobile port+Good AI (on Hard and up)+Large amount of missionsCons:-No story-Wonky controls-No multiplayer (Seriously?!)-Missions can get repetitive-Is a mobile port Overall, I give this game a 7/10.

												Bottom line is, that this is a fun game.The downside is that it lacks complexity and gets old pretty quickly.  Sure, it's fun going through the missions and leveling up your team in their respective specializations and getting them new gear - but then what?It's completely satisfying watching your team burst through a door and open up a can of whoopass on some unsuspecting misfits.  One of my main complaints about the gameplay, which may be a bit strange, but here it is:  You can see almost everything.  The only thing I have to wonder about is where the enemies are standing and which direction they are facing.  Surely things could be more interesting if I had a kind of blueprint of the building, and some not-so-trustworthy intel about what objects and obstacles may be where.  There's no peeking through windows or tiny spy cameras to get a better idea of what's on the other side of a door - it's all just there and you know where everything is.  I like the game, but I also want there to be more variables.  I know my team can breach and clear a room in seconds and shoot at anything that isn't themselves.  I want to make more decisions than stack order, and which door to open first.			"

												Pretty fun game. I got it for 6 dollars but I'd definitely have paid the full 15 for it. The gear and gun customization is quite nice. Could be some more stuff to use but whatever. I like how the guys C-clamp their guns, they lean out and shoot from cover instead of stepping out, so there's proper tactics. Graphics aren't the best but the gameplay is there. Seems that sometimes my guys won't engage and sometimes die because of it, but I don't mind replaying the level to see what else I can do better anyway.For a mobile port (from what I've read), it's really good actually. I highly recommend this.			"

												This is one hell of a game. 10/10. I love the strategy it takes to play this game; you can't just hand this game over to anybody and expect them to do great, there is a big learning curve that comes easily and will allow you to control every aspect of your characters. Not only do you tell your soldiers where to move, but also what path to take to get there, and what direction to face every step of the way. The character skills customization really allows you to get attached to your favorite characters and mourn when they die, permanently. The perma-death is an option though so you can choose how hard this game is for you and how strategic you have to force yourself to be. The controls are simple, but some of them you have to learn for yourself that the tutorial does not cover, like how not to open the door when you approach it and how to choose your path. Every mission earns you money and experience based on difficulty, speed, and overall skill and you spend that money equipping your squad with new weapons, attachments for your weapons, face masks, helmets, armor, clothing, and even the equipment they bring into the field. There are always multiple ways to complete a mission, and there is no set way of doing anything, you choose it all. I highly recommend this game to those looking for a great squad-based tactical game, to the fans of the XCOM and Shadowrun games, and anyone else who wants a game like this. If you want a typical FPS, control over just one character, or skill-less combat then I do not recommend this game to you.			"

												It's like SWAT but topdown. It brings good memories of tactical shooters. In a sesne this is a cross of XCOM with SWAT that turned out really good. At least that's what you'll feel at the beginning.The most accurate description of this game is simplified top-down Rainbow Six sim. It has planning phase and execution phase. The game has three different game mods and they are entertaining at the beginning. However once you levelled up and bought good gear the challenge is no longer there.It is a nice casual tactical sim, and breach and clear is very accurate name. All you do you breach and kill every poor soul around. There are no hostages to save, just a set of maps which become grounds for your tactical proving and killing skills.In the absence of other alternatives and no desire to install the good old SWAT or Rainbow Six this will do, but don't expect a serious challenge.Check out my other recommendations at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ogrreview "

												A half decent game, mechanically speaking. Breach & Clear has a good turn based system in place that uses indirect RNG to determine the efficiency of your squad beyond your own choices.I play this muted, because the sounds and music are atrocious.I play it on the top-down setting, and still have issues with the camera.I play this using only a mouse because the game's controls are the clunkiest I've ever been subjected to.I play it very casually because it loses my attention within a half hour.This is definitely not worth the $16.99 it's listed at. It's just barely worth the $2.54 I paid for it. With polish, it would be a fantastic casual tactics game, but as it stands, it feels like the developers don't care very much about their product or its consumers.The positive review I'm giving this is generous on my part.

												Fun game. It's not expensive either. You probably won't play it too long but it is fun. Kind of feel like playing it right now. It's far from Xcom's level, but it's still fun. The AI is pretty awful, and there's a lot of luck involved. It can be a really frustrating game sometimes. It has made me extremely mad becuase some levels are honestly just poorly designed. I play on the hardest difficulty and it is very unfair. I think the normal one is probably the most fun experience if you just want to have fun. I  like to kinda fight against games and see who is the stronger being. All in all, pretty fun game.			"

												I realize this is a port from a mobile game, but it just has no business being on Steam. ""Door Kickers"" is a much better experience if you want something similar to this. I got this on sale for $1.49 and I still feel like it was a waste of time. Disappointed. Was hoping for something similar to Door Kickers (I love that game) but was sorely disappointed by Breach & Clear. But maybe you'll enjoy it. Or just make the better choice and go with Door Kickers.			"

												It's a port from mobile. The enemy AI is kind of a joke and you have no way to tell your guys to hold fire. They spray lead at everything in their view instead of waiting to get in to a superior position. This often leads to them taking unnecessary damage and is tactically idiotic. Example: 4 tango with backs to entry point. Your team enters and opens fire as soon as they enter while moving to cover. They kill all 4 tangos but take damage in the exchange of gunfire. Had they held fire till in cover, they would be far less likey to take damage while maintaining their advantage of surprise and position.Game lacks ""go codes"" like Door Kickers does so well. In the planning stage, there is no time representation so you can't see how many seconds it will take to move someone to a position. No hold position/delay for X time command. No shoot at this target till threat is removed, then continue with plan. You can't pick which targets to shoot at so no way to prioritize targets. Therefore you can't tell your guys to focus the sniper standing in the open vs the shotguner in heavy cover who happends to be a bit closer.Another glaring problem is that every gun unlocked after the CTAR has not been an upgrade. Currently at 472 stars. Laughing at how many stars are required to unlock the later shotguns. Game is getting far too boring and repetitive to ever reach 1400 let alone the 2100 for the last rifle.From the Devs ""The higher star guns are more for 'prestige' than anything else. They were added as    a prize for fans who wanted something out of the ordinary, so they are camouflaged or Platinum/Gold versions of earlier guns."" Prestige in a single player game? Umm OK.No way to tell what is required to reach 4 stars on any given map. Every map and scenario has different requirements, but game fails to tell you what you are aiming for.  Use an item on one map, ok. Use the same item on another and lose a star but won't tell you are being deducted. Did I get 3 stars on my last try because I didn't make time or due to using an item? No Fn idea. Huge fail IMO. Not enough variety of weapons. One assault rifle after another. Outside of the of the P90, game lacks submachine guns like a variant of the MP5, MP7A1 or UMP. Guess this is due to the squads being military and not law enforcement. These are guns I would expect to find in the arsenal of a game that focuses on CQB regadless of the operators. Game is more arcade'ish than tactically sound. Glad I picked this up at 75% off.			"

												I bought this game on sale because it looked pretty interesting, and it turned out to be one of the best games i've gotten in months. I downloaded it around midnight and figured i'd play 15-20 minutes to see how it was, and it was 4AM before I knew it. The gameplay is turn based, but once you choose where you want your soldiers to go, it becomes almost real time until your soldiers and the enemy stop shooting. You can make 4 man squads from multiple different special forces from around the world. There's tons of weapon attachments to customize an almost equally large amount of weapons, along with gear, like clothing, vests, helmets, etc, and those give different stat boosts or penalties. It's a great game and I can't really find anything about this game I don't like. I would definitely recommend giving this a try.			"

												Pretty neat little tactical game, there are however some ""little"" things that bother me, like no way to sychronize doings, I think it is pretty basic requirement in SWAT to do when attacking a room that have multiple entry points. Other thing is replay, it would be so much better with possibility to view replays from each character and also possibility to slow time and even maybe save replays. Also some gear lacking features and generally lack of them, like different camo's could have somekind of camo bonus if used in correct enviroment, and no sidearms/reloading, it could have been so much more! Anyway I can recommend this game for anyone who like their tactical games like SWAT, Rogue Spear and Jagged Alliances.			"

												Hi there.What can I say - yhis game is a very-very interesting tactical RPG with non-direct controls after giving orders.You have a special squad, you can buy and choose special equipment, you can plan operation and give orders to your squad. Then you press ""GO"" and watch the result of your commands.After fights members of your squad gain experience, skills, perks, that can help you in next missions.Choose hard, elite and insane difficulty - and the game will suprise you.CONS: sometimes there are problems with comand interface in the plan phase9/10 - Strongly recommend.

												Yes, its worth it.B&C is a turn based, squad controlling Xcom style game. But, instead of taking place in the future, it takes place in the present day, with real life missions, guns, and Spec Ops Units. In short, where as games like Xcom and Arma:Tactics are very stratgy based, I found this game to be based on ""instinct"". Missions took me a matter of a minute compared to an hour. I didn't think about what I was doing, I just was. And I ended up murdering everything with my squad of Zero Punctuation, Black Booker DeWitt, Chuck Norris and Duke Nukem. For $10, it is, well, worth it.I guess ill do a quick pros and cons, for the sake of putting this out there on launch day. When I spend more time with this, i'll attempt to have a good review.PROS+Fast Paced Combat. Like I said, its a welcome brake to be able to spend a few minutes in a game instead of an hour+Easy to learn. You can pick this up, spend about 10 minutes with it, and truley get it. Some may take that as a minus, but I see it as a very large plus+Amazing soundtrack, much better than CoD ghosts, and thats a $60 game.+Deep Costimzation. You can pick out your troops guns, hats, attachments, and more+Replayability. I feel like i'll be playing this for a long time due to all the different possibiltys in pathtaking+Varied maps. From Russia to Mexico, the missions felt different. More than I can say about most games.+Decent Port. In two hours, i got one gamebreaking bug. On hour one. GG+Fun. It seems like endless fun to go all Real Life and say ""Contact Down""!!!Cons-Bad UI in menus. Seems to be better suited to the tapping of a tablet than clicking of a mouseNo real other gripes exept a few things that didnt make it from the IoS version.I'd give it a solid 9/10. Its $9($15 off sale) Buy it, you wont regret it.  "

												Like a simpler version of Doorkickers that uses turns instead of real-time. Unfortunately the amount of time a turn is, or what will happen during said turn, is never explained. As far as I can tell the turns end once all your characters are done moving.Its very much a weird mix of XCOM in the way your characters (or ""operators"" if you prefer) gain perks as they level up, and a weird mix of Doorkickers in regards to position and movement. The movement is controlled by the same button that moves the camera around, so prepare to accidentally swoosh the camera across the map instead of moving your unit a lot.The orders you can give your units are extremely simple. Move, move at this speed, look this direction, or use a perk/inventory item. That's all. There is no synching up actions to ""go-codes"" as in Doorkickers. I guess you could synch up actions by just doing them in the same turn but depending on the stats of your units things might not happen at the same time.Speaking of stats, you can slap all sorts of tacticool ♥♥♥♥ all over your units and their weapons. Each thing will affect the weapon or ""operator"" in someway, but it usually just ends up being ""+3 to Accuracy.""Probably my biggest gripe with this game is how hard it tries to be high-speed low-drag hooah operators operatin' operationally. From the intro cutscene to the voice lines to the unit photos it tries so hard to be gruff and tacticool that it just ends up coming off as comical, almost a parody. But I could only listen to what sounded like a teenager saying ""AREA SANITIZED"" so many times before it stopped being funny.This might be fun for an hour or so, I picked it up for 99% off. I couldn't see myself getting this for more than a few dollars.			"

												While probably worth the $4 on iOS, this game is certainly not worth the $15 on steam.  This is a second rate port of a mobile game.  The gameplay itself lacks depth, but tries to disguise it with a multitude of superficial weapon options.  Do not buy.

												I bought this game expecting something similar to old swat games. what a disappointment. this game had so much potential, but its so shallow...the squad building is pretty uninteresting and too quick, the missions are too straightforward and demand almost zero thinking ahead.The enemy AI is so dumb and so easy to kill all of them in every mission I played that tactical thinking is pretty much unnecessary. All the enemy ever does is get behind cover and stay there waiting for you to kill them or they run in front of you with gus blazing like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ madman. They dont try to flank you, dont try to counter-atack, nothing. And that, in a squad tactical turn game, should be the high point.so, if you would like a quick and dumb game, get this on sale. otherwise, stay clear.			"

												Dont buy this rage inducing game. Its fun and addicting but then it screws you over and crashes, freezes the screen, locks up your computer, or FREEZES AND DELETES ALL YOUR F***ING DATA AND PROGRESS. This happens way to often, usually in the middle or at the end of a round, and to top it all off, ITS A MOBILE PORT. JUST F***ING LOVELY.Update:Ok now that I have calmed down, let me actually give a good reason why I have given a negative review. First off, graphics. Now I know graphics don't make a game great, or terrible, but the graphics here are the same on mobile. Don't expect anything super pretty. Onto the game itself, the gameplay is very addicting, satisfying, challenging, and fun, as you go through a variety of different situations in multiple locations. There are multiple CTU's to choose from like the JTF2 (thanks for adding that btw) and the SAS along with a bunch of American CTUs and the Spestnaz and some German one that I can't remember the name of. There are also multiple guns, attachments, and perks, with six different classes and various things to upgrade. Now my main problems with this game are the small bugs. I've had a few soldiers downed because the A.I shot a long range wall bang (one end of the map to the other, specifically happening in the Germany campaign) and also when a terrorist dies, the body of the terrorist sometimes goes through a wall, which for me, greatly breaks immersion. I've also seen bullets fly right through people without doing any damage. And as noted previously in my rage, I've experience multiple crashes and lock ups, but I found out that apparently it had something to do with skype being open (my progress being deleted is still bulls***). I still can't really recommend this unless it's on sale, as I'm sure there are other games that have done this better, like door kickers, which I have yet to play (but from what I've seen it looks better, not just graphically, but gameplay-wise as well). If the dev team ever updates this again, maybe fix a few bugs and update the graphics so they look better than on mobile, or add steam workshop support for custom levels and gameplay and graphical tweaks.

												Shallow and greatly unpractical gameplay. The PC version of this game looks like it was made for tablets. Coordinating your squad members' actions proved to be quite difficult and limited. Here are some features of the game:  Your tactical options for each soldier in a turn are:      -Moving the soldier (you can set multiple waypoints and also choose between moving quickly or carefully);      -Choosing on each waypoint where the soldier will be looking at;      -Telling the soldier to hold his position;      -Using the soldiers' special ability;      -Checking intel on the enemy.So far, your options are quite limited, but that is not inherently bad. Sometimes, a small array of options may be backed up by a great gaming experience. Now that's this game's undoing. The AI is almost as smart as real person... if said person was blindfolded and told to find a way out of a maze made of death lasers that made noise so they could still be avoided... and even so the person decided to run and hug death.Coordinating your team's actions proved to be quite the challenge when you can't even tell one of your soldiers to take another soldier's position; you can't tell them to hold fire or to focus one specific enemy; if you tell a soldier move up to a door, he will immediatelly open it! Now THAT'S some real tactical decision right there, phew. Did you make a mistake while placing one of your waypoints? No problem! You just need to press the undo button and remove every subsequent waypoint you had set untill you delete the single one that was wrong... and now place them all again! (I guess the game does that so you don't lose track of what you had in mind...)Every time you select a unit, your camera moves up to them, which is simply annoying. You then have to keep moving your camera all over the place because it seems like the game wants you to have full awareness of your team. ""Juarez? You selected Juarez? Here he is, look! Look closer! See? That's Juarez! Want him to move over there? Okay! Lawrence too? Good! But let us just take a look at him! Oh my, how well positioned he is right here! Now go move your camera back!""This game is quite good for on-the-go casual gaming, but definitely NOT for someone who's looking for some real squad-tactics game. The tactics you employ to win this game are basically, in order of priority: 1-Put soldier behind cover; 2- If enemy is still alive, throw grenade; 3-Win game.The soundtrack is good, it fits in nicely.The graphics are fine, nothing to complain about.The camera movement is ""meh"". In addition to what's been already mentioned above, sometimes the action camera is badly positioned and you can't really see what's going on, but that's not gamebreaking.The real problem is charging US$15 for a game that seems poorly optimised for PC and with little replay value. Frozen Synapse costs roughly less than two times this price but brings you four times more entertainment.Luckily I got this through Humble Bundle though, phew!			"

												I do like this game but I feel it's missing a lot. Too much infact that I kept thinking this is in Early Access. It's your average turn-based combat game but it feels quite bare compared to something like Frozen Synapse. I was expecting to be able to fully control waypoints and time everything so that the squad performs a lot more efficient, but at the moment as far as I'm aware I can only set where the soldier goes and which way he looks and that kind of feels repetitive and not very tacticool. ""Deep tactical strategy simulation"" doesn't feel very depthful or simulating at all at the moment.The game does bring me back to titles like Police Quest: SWAT 2 and it is just as fun to play, but I just really wish they'd make the gameplay a little more intricate. Also there are about 7 regiments of special forces but you can only have 4 squads which is kind of disheartening. It's not only the gameplay I wish they'd improve, the game still has quite a few bugs. The Skullcap which is a piece of headgear doesn't fit many of the soldiers and needs some adjustment which makes it unusable unless you're used to half the soldier's head poking out of it. The Ballcap and the Skull Mask don't fit together and also during a Shotgun breach if your soldier is equipped with the LMG he pretty much shoots himself in the face. It has bugs and like I said it's missing a lot of potential. But it is massively addictive. I only recommend this game just by an inch.			"

												If you're an armchair general like me, then you'll enjoy this game.  It puts you in command of an elite group of spec ops soldiers where you make all the calls from selecting the team, equipping them, sending them into harms way, and then rewarding them (i.e. skills points, new/better loadouts, etc.) for successful missions. The game is simple and intuitive, but very unforgiving if you make a bad call.			"

												Before I bought this game I had a quick scroll through reviews and most seemed to be one of two things.  This game is so much like X-COM  OR  This game is nothing like X-COM. I agree with the latter. Both games feature turn-based tactical combat and squad customisation but that is where the similarities end. Instead of individual turns for squad members, you plan out the paths for your men, then you press the breach button and each soldier runs forth like a human weapon, pouring shots into balaclava-clad enemies. Each planning phase takes minutes but the actual real time mission plays out in a matter of seconds.I started up the game and was presented with a choice of various world special forces to play as; each with their own minor differences. I chose the SAS because it was the obvious choice (who wouldn't want to be the SAS). You get to travel to various parts of the world conducting three different brands of mission. You kill terrorists, you defuse a bomb and kill terrorists, you kill terrorists. Despite the lack of variation between the mission types the different environments are fun and the basic narratives provided give you some context as to why you are shooting these terrorists/seperatists/diisgruntled blokes. There is a rudimentary leveling up system in which you can upgrade the various skills of each of your 4 squad mates including their class specific skills. The game also has two currencies. You gain star ratings for missions and stars unlock new missions and new guns while silver allows you to buy new weapons, weapon customisations, aesthetics, new gear and consumables. It's simple system but works rather well.TL:DR -+ Be the SAS+ Bring Freedom to Heathen Terrorists+ 8.5/10- No ability to stab people from the shadows- Not enough Content "

												As of now, there are two types of war game:Everything else, and Breach & Clear. A turn based strategy game that handles the turns swiftly enough to make it feel intense, Breach & Clear puts you through the ringer around every corner. After spending a day or more customising every single aspect of your squad (from face to name to clothes, weapons, armor, and more,) you won't ever experience more abject sadness as you will when one of your turns sees your guy get killed.  Featuring what they call ""Permadeath,"" when you lose a guy in this game, he stays down. Forever. His name, picture, and stats will be listed alongside all of your fallen warriors under the ""memorial"" tab of the main menu. Multiple locations and game modes, as well as different classes for your squad, see the replayability of this game stay extremely high. I would say 10 stars out of 5 if it worked like that. Since it doesn't, a definite 5 out of 5.			"

And despite store page claims this game is not realistic, do not expect it to be.Dont expect anything more than this, apart from small tactical scenarios there is nothing else in the game.Noteworthy: You can completely customize your team's roles/equipment/clothing etc. which is quite nice.The game also has a great soundtrack with very epic tracks.

												As of now, there are two types of war game:Everything else, and Breach & Clear. A turn based strategy game that handles the turns swiftly enough to make it feel intense, Breach & Clear puts you through the ringer around every corner. After spending a day or more customising every single aspect of your squad (from face to name to clothes, weapons, armor, and more,) you won't ever experience more abject sadness as you will when one of your turns sees your guy get killed.  Featuring what they call ""Permadeath,"" when you lose a guy in this game, he stays down. Forever. His name, picture, and stats will be listed alongside all of your fallen warriors under the ""memorial"" tab of the main menu. Multiple locations and game modes, as well as different classes for your squad, see the replayability of this game stay extremely high. I would say 10 stars out of 5 if it worked like that. Since it doesn't, a definite 5 out of 5.			"

												All I have to say is that, thankfully, I didn’t get this game at full price. Breach & Clear is a strategy, simulation “game” from developers Mighty Rabbit Studios and Gun. and publishers Gambitious Digital Entertainment and Devolver Digital. Let’s get rocking.The GoodI think the best thing about this game is that I don’t have to play it ever again and I can hide it from my Steam library.The BadGames that begin as apps for phones and tablets, should remain on phones and tablets. It’s painfully obvious that this game was designed as such. I don’t actually want to write much else because I feel like this game is still wasting my time by having me talk about it.The MehMove along please.Verdict: NaySave your money, people. This game is $14.99 at full price in the Steam Store. That alone is one of the funniest things I’ve seen this week. There are far better games out there with the same premise that aren’t a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ app port.			"

												This game is REALLY cool! It's short fun and easy to play. Squads look great and the gameplay is solid and very replayable. B&E is like the board game version of CS:GO, except you always play CT. The squads are diverse enough to varry game play, but share the same basics to keep strategy similar on the same levels. Game is easily worth 10 or more hours of play and should is definately worth the sale price!			"

												If you are looking for deep tactical gameplay (as this game is advertised), then stay away, you won't find that here.That said, the game still offers good casual entertainment, if you enjoy leveling up your guys and unlocking new equipment, give it a spin.Quick run-down of the gameplay if you need help deciding if it is for you:You first create a squad, you can decide between some well-known specops units like DEVGRU, SAS, KSK and so on. What unit you select decides the starter attributes of your guys, one will have their special ability trained up nice, other will have reaction time up, other accuracy etc.Then you run through the missions, and I really mean run, as once you discover the one tactic that works 100% of the time against the AI, you'll just breeze through. Not much depth here, and the occasional weird glitch with your guys running backwards or facing a wall for no good reason.Your guys gain experience, and you get money, so in-between you level up your guys (in the end, it doesnt matter much what squad you made, they'll all end up the same just look different), buy them some new weapons and gear.You can upgrade weapons to modify their stats, but here you'll end up again with all the same upgrades as there is one good combination.Sounds like not much, but it is a decent enough time-killer, pick it up when it is on sale.In case 3d is not that important to you, I'd suggest to take a look at 'Door Kickers', that one has tactical gameplay down to perfection.

												Breach and Clear offers up a SWAT simulator that doesn't seem to bring anything clever, unique, or even charming to the genre.In my play-time, I felt I had already seem everything the game had to offer, and no clever level design decisions were going to overcome the stagnant gameplay. Get your squad to move up, always make sure they face corners. That's the whole game. I could see this being a viable Mobile title, but it just doesn't have enough value to justify the price tag. It's not awful, it's generic and overpriced.			"

												Мне понравилось играть. В игре много интересных карт и снаряжения. Радует то, что игры такого формата стали наконец-то распространяться. Я думаю игра будет пользоваться большей популярностью на территории России, если введут оружие российского производства такие как, легендарный АК-47, современный АК-12, АЕК-971 и так далее. Хочу отметить, что наряду с прекрасной возможностью устанавливать на оружие различное тактическое оборудование в данной игре к сожалению отсутствует оружия  формата PG или PDR и дополнительный режим ""Освобождения заложников"". Надеюсь, что это даст дополнительный стимул замечательным разработчикам игры для введения новых образцов оружия и режимов в игру. Спасибо.			"

												This game IS fun, but it is plagued by many problems. First and foremost, in my 20+ hours I've found so many glitches, little things that aren't necessarily game-ruining, but are VERY annoying; especially if you're a perfectionist like me (I HAVE to get 4 stars on every mission). An example being my medic unable to ""stabilize"" downed teammates. That isn't game-breaking, but it gets on my nerves. Sometimes I find my team shooting in the wrong direction. For instance, if I send them to an area looking a certain way, and they happen to pass up an enemy, sometimes my guys would just shoot in a random direction, then turn back towards the enemy and shoot, then back forward. I'm not sure what the point of leveling up ""reaction"" when your team doesn't even react to certain enemies. There is no real-time changing of position or anything like that, the game plays in turns. This isn't bad, it can just be annoying considering the enemy can run/advance MUCH faster than any of your guys (unless you level up speed to 100). Another thing I noticed is once in a while one of my guys, despite me having set a path for him, does not move at all that turn. As other reviewers have stated, this game feels unfinished. It really bugs me when developers let known glitches (like the medic 'stabilize' glitch) persist within a game and then work on a DLC. I know that the medic glitch is known because I saw a Facebook post for the app version of the game with comments from the devs to a guy who had brought it up. This game could be AMAZING if more things had been added. I feel like ""Doorkickers"" nailed it with the real-time movement and the fact that you can switch tactics on the fly instead of being stuck with whatever plan you chose. As for the positive, the game has a lot of customization features, which I love. It almost feels like an RPG. You can name each member of your squad, choose their profile pic/appearance, then buy and customize ALL of their gear. It's really neat. I also love the star system (you get rated on your performance on a mission by stars--1-4 stars). It makes the game kind of addicting, and adds replay value. The mission locations are unique and on each game mode, you must change your tactics. The game modes are: Terrorist Hunt (basically just sweep a level until you've killed all the terrorists), Bomb Defusal (defuse a bomb within the time limit), and a mode where you escape the map out of an extraction zone (your men are placed in random parts of the map). The game is by no means easy (on higher difficulty levels at least). Sometimes my fully-leveled squad struggled to clear certain levels, which I like. Challenges are good and as stated before, add replay value. The main reason I dislike this game is because it has many unfixed glitches/bugs, and it just feels unfinished.Final Verdict: 6.5/10Buy this game on sale and you won't regret it. Don't pay $15 for an app.			"

												Impressions of this game so far are not great.Controls seem more than a bit clunky and cumbersome. Graphics aren't great, it looks pretty brutal (for modern gaming standards) in my opinion. Similar games like Doorkickers use minimal artstyles and graphics but they definitely looked and felt a whole lot better/polished than Breach & Clear; Breach & Clear seems to try to look good, but doesn't really pull it off.Worse of all, I found myself bored within the first few minutes of opening the game. That doesn't necessarily mean that all of it will be, but I definitely don't feel invested the same way I was with Doorkickers. I bought this game because of the positve reviews and because I LOVED Doorkickers. This definitely is in the same exact vein, but so far hasn't excited me. I'm not going to count it out yet, but first impressions aren't great so far.I guess the gist of my review could be as follows:If you're interested in this game but haven't played Doorkickers, go buy/play Doorkickers.If you're still interested in this game and own/have played Doorkickers, you're likely better off to go back to playing Doorkickers...

												I'll start off by saying this game hasn't been updated at all in over 5 months. No patches, DLC's, anything. So far, not so good. And the graphics look like they are from the early 2000's! Super Mario looks better! Not only that, but it's SO BORING! I played it for about half an hour; I then went to Steam Refunds and clicked submit. Best decision ever. Way way WAY too much customization for everything. Buying different lights for your guns improves accuracy, so do triggers, barrels, etc. Why have different categories for items that literally do the same thing? (!!!!!!) The list goes on and on and on. I wish I could say something good about it, but I'm sorry, I just can't. I would be lying if I did.			"
