												I played Knights of Pen and Paper +1. I enjoyed it, despite a feeling that it was grindy and slow toward the end. I enjoyed it enough that I bought the deluxe edition of #2 immediately when I saw it, without a second thought.The depth is improved, but I did not enjoy the game overall.Main faults:- Applying conditions is combat is not rewarding. Enemies (and your own characters, for that matter) have a high base chance to entirely negate a condition every single round. There is no way to impact that chance at all.- Compounding the above, there is a whole set of items,  accessories, and skills that center around conditions that are consequently also not rewarding.- Difficulty is under-tuned. You'll outpace the level of your enemies very quickly and are unlikely to fall behind unless you eschew side quests completely.- Nothing to spend gold on - Stores only stock ""common"" items and enchantment scrolls, item progression caps out early-mid game. Soon you'll be drowning in gold with maxed out items, spending all your money on XP shrooms in a desperate bid to see if there's just one more tier of stuff to buy- Dungeons barely vary from regular gameplay, if you have scarab of energy + cleric you won't even notice the inability to rest, but the cheap and plentiful consumables will also see you through.- Area based ""investigation"" for extra items is excruciatingly boring.- Bland. KoPaP 1 had chunks in it. Hard encounters that forced you to find more effective party and item builds, in order to defeat them.Here's what's good:- The humour of the writing and sheer quantity of geek references scattered through the gameEDIT: I toned down my review a little after trying +1 to remember what I liked and disliked. In many ways KoPaP 2 is an improvement, it's just let down by a lack of any interesting challenges to drive the rest of the gameplay.			"

												It is games like this one that make me really wish Steam allowed ""thumb sideways"" reviews. Knights of Pen and Paper 2 is not quite a bad game; for all it's flaws, it has a solid core. However, what flaws it does have are fairly substantial ones that make any recommendation come with an asterisk at the end. The Good: The sprite work is vastly improved over the first game. Backgrounds, player sprites, and enemy sprites have substantially more detail. The animations are also better and more creative: one enemy's attacks result in it breathing vowels, for example. The addition of a crafting system adds some depth to otherwise routine inventory and equipment management decisions. The class variety of the game is decent considering its limited scope. Class abilities are distinct. Battles have some degree of strategy. The Bad:  As in the first game, quest variety remains functionally nonexistent. ""Travel here"" and ""fight these things"". Get used to those concepts, because they are all you will be doing in the game. Far as I could see, there were less than a handful of exceptions: a  quest that tasks you with solving a murder mystery (through one of three options) and a disguised account creation prompt were the only ones I noticed. It's possible I missed some, but the proportion of time you will actually be doing anything interesting remains dreadfully low. Although the game has decent class variety for such a small-scope title, there is no incentive to experiment with party structure because of how battles decide everything in the game. After you fill out your initial five person party, get used to that setup. If you want to change it, you theoretically can... As long as you consent to make an already extremely repetitive game even more so by playing catchup.  The sheer repetition of the first game was (arguably) its greatest flaw. The second is, unfortunately, not any better in that regard. Lack of quest variety, mentioned above, is only a small cog in a great machine of repetition. What you see in the first five minutes of the game is functionally what you get for all of it, and it can and does feel like a chore at times. The amount of equipment available ceases to improve long before endgame. Plenty of blank slots in the game room customization. I figured I would unlock them over time... No, they just do not exist. Given the game hints at further DLC down the line, I expect them to be part of that.Neither: The improved sprite work comes at a cost. Many enemy types are visibly altered from the same base sprite. Thieves, troglodytes, cavemen, and others share a base. They are altered enough that this isn't a huge deal or necessarily ""laziness"" so much as being resourceful, and the actually unique enemies make up for it. Still, it is worth pointing out.  The story of the game remains extremely limited and basic. Nonexistent replay value is hard to quantify as positive or negative, since whether an RPG has any tends to be a coin flip.So in the end, do I recommend this game? For most people, no. A decent battle system, in most circumstances, is not enough to save a heavily flawed game, especially if that battle system is almost everything the game offers. Games do not exist in a vacuum, and no matter who you are chances are there are more enjoyable and less repetitive ones out there. If all you wanted, however, was for Knights of Pen and Paper to have a sequel... Well, this game certainly is that, and in that case, more power to you.			"

												Definitely doesn't hold a candle to the first one, but it's still playable. After a while the meta of ""lol the DM is too lazy to think up good content"" gets really old and feels like a flimsy cover for why the game is a bit shallow. The writing ain't great, too meme-y and not really that funny. I get that games want to be relevant to their audience, but when references are basically shotgunned everywhere it just doesn't feel like a smart narrative. There's no real depth to the characters beyond one-liners and it kinda feels like slogging through the back-catalogue of Questionable Content.Pros-It's short, so if the constant dankness irritates you it'll be over quickly, sorta.I like the investigate system though the rewards were mostly useless.I like how secrets are unlocked - but I wish an achievement was tied to how many you find so you know if any are left.There's good synergy between the classesIt's not a *bad* game, it's just the first one really makes you want more and this doesn't live up to that desire.Cons-Writing feels dispassionate and like the devs maybe didn't care very much.Balancing is non-existentNo point to getting special equips because you can't upgrade them. You're stuck with vendor items the whole game.Dungeons are not fun at allThe game baits you into buying DLC and email signups which is super ♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I'm a massive fan of Knights of Pen and Paper +1. This is a clear improvement to the first. The art is much more detailed and beautifully done. The combat is the same but with more features and more stratagy involved.If you liked the first one, you'll love the 2nd one.Edit: After finishing the game. I'm actually disappointed. It's short, has fewer classes, fewer, quests, and overall is a lesser game. The pixels are pretty though.			"

												So, let me preface this with the fact that this is a very short game. It took me about 10 hours to complete, and that is with creating 2 parties first before settling on my 3rd and favorite party (so far) which I completed the main storyline and DLC content with.  Now that I have that out of the way, let's discuss the game itself. KoPP2 is the successor to the original game (if that somehow wasn't obvious.) It borrows the base mechanics from its predecessor, but expands quite a bit. Each character now has 3 primary governing stats, Mind, Body, and Senses. You often make party based stat rolls (d20 based, of course) out of combat. As part of this system, each player, class, and race (there are races now, cool, right???) contributes towards the stat scores. The gear system is a significant upgrade from the original, allowing actual crafting rather than buying unending grindstones and improving existing gear. There is also a much broader variety of gear, allowing you to outfit each character to your liking.Now, for the only ""negative"" I have for this game. This game will never be hugely popular, unfortunately, and that is due to the simple fact that the target audience is pretty small compared to that of other video games. It is marketed at tabletop gamers who are ALSO fans of lighthearted comedic games.  **If you don't play tabletop roleplaying games, you will not get many of the jokes.** Overall, dispite the disappointing length (made up for by the replayability brought by experimenting with different party make-ups) I'd highy recommend this game. 8/9 out of 10.

												This game is good... but very short. If you liked the first game, you'll probably enjoy this game for about two hours. But after a certain point if you pay any real attention to your characters, it quickly becomes a disgusting stomp-fest for the entirety of the rest of the -very short- game. I got to the final boss and just kind of stared at the screen waiting for it to tell me that it wasn't actually over, as it happened in the first one, only for the credits to roll and end the game. Ultimately this game feels way less fulfilling than the first, and I don't think it's really worth the money. I would've given this a positive recommendation if it was even close to the length of the first. This feels like less of a sequel and more of an expansion.EDIT: Decided to go a bit more indepth in my review after thinking on it a bit.Good:-Funny, just like the first. Lots of jokes, although some are very repetitive.-Good fun for about two hours, until you start reaching various caps and it quickly becomes very tedious and dull.-Yeah that's pretty much it, aside from ""nostalgia"" for the first game, nothing unique about this game stands out.Bad:-Crafting is almost pointless. The only large use for it is ""enchanting"" gear, which is very minimal and caps out at +3 total very quickly. In addition, you get very few crafting recipes, most of which are for very basic consumables.-Item purchases cap out very quickly as well. I had reached my maximm possible purchasable items well before halfway into the game, and I kept waiting for more to unlock but sadly none ever did.-Going back to crafting, it heavily favors the melee characters, since you can't really boost trinkets, and the only available +spellpower weapon was an already enchanted staff. Meanwhile you can enchant melee weapons to the nines and deal truckloads of damage. I gave my paladin some huge +3 weapons and he just started one-shotting things.-""Unique"" items end up being much worse than crafted ones, therefore making it almost better to sell any interesting items. Like the three-handed sword. I enchanted a +3 waraxe and it had significantly better stats than an Item I had just gotten at the same level, and for 1 hand less requirement. I ended up selling almost every unique item I received, including most of the debuff-immunity ones due to the fact that most of the time debuffs will simply fall off your characters without accomplishing much.-Very repetitive. While the first game was bad about this as well, the ""grinding"" of that game had some kind of purpose. Hunting for grindstones and whatnot was necessary unless you paid $$. In this game by the end you just end up walking halfway cross the map and back repeatedly, and when you get there killing maybe 2-3 waves of monsters, repeat.-Unbelievably short game. I have about a 90% completion on this game, I went out of my way to do most of the side quests, and it only took me 6.5 hours to complete. I doubt I'd get much more than an hour more out of doing the little remaining content, maybe an additional half hour on that if I fork over the additional 4.99 in-game dlc.-No seriously, I cannot stress enough how short this game is. KoPaP 1 was fairly long for that type of game, and you went significantly higher in levels. At the beginning of the game you see a level 99 character, and I figured that would be close to what endgame looked like. Instead, you pretty much finish the game at level 20, possibly earlier if you skip side quests. This was an extreme let down.-Classes, while interesting, require very little in terms of creation. Most of the classes you can be well served simply by levelling 1 or 2 of their skills and all but ignoring the others. I never put more than 1 rank into about 75% of the skills and just capped others with impunity, especially all the ""affect adjacent"" ones combined with the gameroom item to make them effect all.-In addition, I never could find a retraining system to try and re-work my characters if I wanted to test out diferent builds, so short of starting up a new game I just had to stick with my decisions.-Severe lack of gameroom items. In the first one you almost had too many options, this time when you open up to buy gameroom items and you see only 2 or 3 in each section (with 5 slots ""open"") it's an immediate let-down.All in all, this feels like a game only half-finished and just tossed out for some quick fan-cash. They had enough name-recognition to get people to buy it, and decided to use that to just coast on a barely completed product. I didn't personally encounter any bugs, but I heard there were a great deal when the game first released, and that only makes me more sure that this product is yet another in the current trend of ""finish half the game, and then sell the rest of it as DLC.""I would not recommend this to anyone, not even fans of the original.

												When two different RPG editions clash it's up to your party of adventurers to save the game world: you'll be creating a group of up to 5 heroes, choosing their player, race and class and then set them in the world of Paperos tackling quests.Knights of Pen and Paper 2 adds a few new things to what you've seen in its predecessor to mix up its basic fight/travel/spend coins formula: in the end it's a streamlined, albeit basic, turn-based RPG that's quite fun thanks to its humour and charm.PROS:-the pixel art is pretty nice-good retro soundtrack-hero customization (selecting players and races with different bonuses, then a class) works well-good amount of different areas, all with their monster models and quests-the new elements (e.g. dungeons, investigating areas to unlock loot and recipes, crafting,locations with special effects) add some depth to the basic gameplay-lots of humour and references keep things lighthearted -felt less grindy than the first game-good length, took me 9,5 hours doing all side questsNEUTRAL:-despite the new elements it doesn't feel much different from the first one, nor should you expect much depth overall-quite easyCONS:-there's still some grind involved, mostly for gold at the beginning and for exp once you add new party members-side quests can drag for too long, requiring you to travel back and forth several times, there's also a few too many easy fights thrown in: in the end things can feel like padding and become dull-combat Initiative seems a bit too random-when monsters are bunched together you'd end up clicking the wrong one

I had a good time with this one, despite its simple gameplay the game does manage to have a ""just one more quest feeling"" when you want to gain one more level, some more gold to get new equipment or just see what funny/weird twist  a quest will have. Its simplicity and the fact most quests are very simple affairs where you go through several fights and/ or zones means I'd need to take a break every now and then though, to ensure things would not get too dull.The repetitiveness can get to you at times, and in fact you might want to skip some side-quests to cut down on the padding since you don't need to do them all to reach a decent level, but the game's decent combat and humour'd be enough to carry you through the end. Of course the basic gameplay and straightforward design are things to consider when choosing whether this is the kind of game you'd want to buy.I got Knights of Pen and Paper 2 for 5$ and, for that price, it was decent and mostly enjoable: if you liked the first game and a slightly advanced version then this'll be a good purchase, provided you don't mind its simplicity and blemishes.

 Summary: Fans of Dungeons and Dragons campaigns along with connoisseurs of popular media will enjoy this more casual style RPG, that has a little bit of depth hidden in its content. The creators obviously have a love of all things movies, gaming, and the like, but does the subject content well with timeliness of jokes. Some of the humor is groan inducing, but it's done in a lighthearted way that really connects. While the RPG elements are somewhat basic compared to others in the genre, it does have surprising depth with the status system in question and takes good use of the influence of tabletop RPG mechanics. Even after 4 hours of gameplay, I will still engaged, which is a good sign from a game that does have unlockables and replayability to go along with it. The difficulty curve may be less then I would want, however this is mostly due to doing every side quest, and when skipping those, the game presented more of the challenge. The real thing that holds it back in the end is the UI and lack of options. After a while, you'll be wishing to fast forward through animations and pick up the pace of the game after you've seen a cutscene before (on a restart for example). In the end, found it definitely worth the price of admission thanks to the combo of combat options along with the humor. Definitely worth your time. Gameplay Footage and Video Review:

			Views: 287		

			Gather your pencils (not pens, your stats will change!) and character sheets, as we take a look at the world of The Knights of Pen and Paper 2.		

 Lists: +: Really goofy sense of humor that pays respect to popular media of video games, movies, and the like before it. It may be specifically hitting the right bones in my body for this, but it definitely hit home with my sense of humor. Combat system is simple, but does have complexities under the surface that do help bring it some variety over the long haul.  Threat system works well for those who choose to pay close attention to it.  The pixel artstyle does well for the world, but it's more so the different environments and styles it takes you to. Going to fallout's vaults only to later go to an ASCII dungeon still works in this world, and makes you appreciate the time and effort that went into each and every environment. Love the blending of real world elements into the world, and the play on the idea of 1st versus second edition that it goes for, almost to the point of parody. Good use of story elements and making game play variation make sense in the world.  Good use of unlocks and timeliness to help bring new characters and items into the mix, making you wonder how you can use them. Grinding not necessary, as even with little side quests done, you can still use strategy to get through fights. Fights also don't feel grindy like other games, even if you do face the same enemies in a row a couple of times. -: UI has clunky implementation at times, where selection of enemies and items are too close to each other, leading to the wrong decision. Simple click based responses would have helped this in various cases.  There's improvements that can be made of the long hall, like being able to buy multiple items at once. Options to speed up the game at certain points by disabling animations would help replayability and not having it turn into a spacebar/clickfest.   Game can get a little too easy at times if you do a lot of the side quests. Sorta wish gold didn't carry over to other games, it can make the game a little bit too easy in those cases.  "

												Enjoying it. If you found the first one entertaining, you will enjoy this. No Pay2Play aspects at all. Story/questing plays very similar to the first. There is a crafting component added in which seems a bit lacking currently but maybe it will get better once I get to end-game content. Overall, well worth $10.Edit: I did buy Digital Deluxe to support the dev but I would have appreciated a little bit more information on what it actually consists of.

												This could had been a polished improvement of the first Knights of Pen and Paper game. Usually when game developers do a sequel, they remove what that didn't work out in the previous game and improve and further develop what did.In this sequel, they did it the other way around:* Slow game pace is now SLOWER, you can't speed-click past slow text dialogues any more* Odds for good dice rolls to resists, traps, resting etc are stacked against you, making the game pace more sluggish* Changing furniture in the shop now takes 5 times as many mouse clicks, as you have to save+quit the game and go to the main menu to change anything* Did you dislike the quests which involved traveling back and forth between two nearby places? Those are mostly gone in the sequel, instead you have to travel all across the map now back and forth* The main campaign is VERY short and doesn't take long to play through* The storyline is plain boring and lacks the wittiness of the first game* The differences of the character classes you can unlock vs the standard ones are too small and uninteresting to care enough to play the game over again* Inventory handling went from bad to worse - yes the stash is nice, but you still end up not using or selling off 99% of everything you get as it's either useless or just doesn't make a big difference enough in the gameplay for the player to have to care about itThe only improvements are the sound and graphics, comparable to the first game being 8-bit retro and this one 16-bit retro instead.Do I recommend this game? No, buy the first one instead if you don't have it. If you have it and have played through it already, wait for the third Knights of Pen and Paper if such one is ever made. Hopefully it'll be better than this sequel.			"

												Fun RPG, very similar to the first one. If you enjoyed KPP1, you'll probably enjoy this one as well. I did find the gameplay rather easy (cleared the story w/out any gameroom items, for one), and felt the story to be a bit short, but I haven't cleared the DLC content yet.Pros:- Easy to pick up- Class diversity is solid- Gameplay doesn't have any unnecessary fluff, no unnecessarily convoluted stat system- Casual enough to not be frustrating, challenging enough to not be a chore- Dungeons are an actual challengeCons:- Quests get repetitive because they're most of them are ""kill X amount of mobs""- It's pretty short..- The shop is such a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥because you can only buy/sell one item at a time. Same thing with Storage.Other:- Quirky humour, a lot of meta references, etc. I found the writing funny, but I could definitely see it turn off some people.- In the Monk quest line the battles were really really forced upon you and felt like they were there to pad the very short DLC- Some of the items feel broken for their cost. For instance, you can make a +30 HP/MP accessory for 80 gold (25 x 3, +5 crafting cost), while the +30 HP and +30 MP accessory costs 90 gold. Discovering them feels good, but I just stacked those rings on my squishy units and fixed that issue with them, which seems to throw the balance of the game off.Verdict:Good sequel to the first one. I liked some of the new classes (others seemed just really bad in comparison), though it did get a bit tedious toward the end, as I was way over-leveled and battles began feeling like a chore rather than a challenge. I'd say worth it.			"

												I recommend this game, but only barely.For me, the real issue is that there just doesn't seem to be enough content to fill out the containers they created for features.   Whether it's classes, or playable characters, or places to explore, or craftable recipes, or skill options and diversity.   Just as an example of this, the first few times you manage to roll a perfect 20 while traveling you will find an enjoyable event.   But after that, nah.   They just didn't create more than a couple.  It's like someone checked the boxes for all of these features the community wanted or was brought over, but just didn't commit to building them out in a way that the player can enjoy for very long.The only reason I can give this a recommend safely is that you will get 10+ hours of enjoyment out of it for 10 dollars.  That's a decent value.   But it could have been a lot better.			"

Knights of Pen and Paper 2TL;DRI DO recommend this game, if it is on sale.Decent overall, all though the price is a tad steep for the amount of play you will receive. If the Deluxe version was priced at the regular version then it would be no question. Alot of similar mechanics as the previous installment, with crafting added. Oh, and you can't just go anywhere right from the get go, you have to unlock each location through quests and the story line.6/10Detailed ReviewI am a huge fan of the first one, had it on mobile the instant I found it, and then bought the +1 Edition through Steam. With this in mind, I did not expect huge things from the second one, possibly some new mechanics, an interesting story line, and a just different enough feel that it wouldn't just be a ""recycled"" game.Which is mostly true.GameplayThe game plays almost the exact same as the first one. You pick your starting characters, with the difference being you can also choose from three races at the beginning, which add passive dice bonuses in three categories. The three categories are Body, Agility, and Mind. Body powering strength and health, Agility powering critical hit rates, accuracy and speed, and Mind powering the strength of your spells, and how much mana you have. All of the classes use mana, while for warrior and thieves it powers abilities instead of traditional spells.The different classes will also add bonus passives to some or all of the dice, for example, the Warrior class adds to the Body die, but nothing else, while the Ninja class (which you unlock later in the game) adds mostly to Agility, but a little to Body and Mind as well.Different classes include Warrior, Paladin, Thief, Cleric, and Wizard. There are others that you unlock with game progression. The classes are based on traditional roles, such as the Warrior being a hard hitting tanky dude, and the Thief being a sneaky backstabber, and so on.Each base character that you choose to fill a role will add small passives, such as the Jock adding an extra ""hand"" slot. Really it is a matter of experimentation to find the best Base/Race/Class combo to suit your needs and play style.Leveling up works like it did before, with gaining a single skill point to invest, and getting a small boost to health and mana. The skills for each class is pretty much what you would expect from the class type, like the Thief being able to use stealth to sneak up and deal massive first hit damage, and the Paladin to gain aggro and heal others, and so on.Later on you are able to add to your first three characters, up to a total of five. This costs gold, the ingame currency, and ramps up quickly. Gold is used in every aspect of gameplay, from buying weapons and items, to paying for crafting, and for adding the items to the ""play room"". The play room can have items added to it in order to provide bonuses to the gameplay, such as extra experience, gold, treasure, etc.GraphicsGraphics look almost the same, with slightly higher quality to the models and envrionment. Not a huge topic here.Music and SoundI found the music to be just average, nothing to write home about. The sound effects on hitting mobs and using spells sound rather recycled, but what would you really expect from a game that is intentionally made to feel like it is from the early 90's?ReplayabilityThis is probably the single worst factor about this game, as I don't know if there is a New Game + or anything like that. If there is, I haven't found it. Basically, as of right now, once you finish the side quests and the story, it seems to be done.VerdictDecent. 6/10Somethings could have been done better, such as a New Game + mode, possibly making the play room items cheaper, and adding more random quests. All in all, it won't feel like you wasted your time, but I would wait until the game is on sale before picking it up.I DO recommend this game, IF it is on sale.			"

												Played for a couple hours.Thought a small game like this would get really off the rails with its simple D&D concept, but it never really got there in the time I played.The game never grabbed me or surprised me in anyway.Had a chuckle or two, but I don't think I will bother continuing.

												A game about playing a game you say? Nerdception at its highest point, this sequal to Knights of Pen and Paper takes everything it did in the first instalment and makes it better, When i did my 100% completion playthrough it took me about 17hours which actually keept me engaged non stop without to much grinding. Since then more FREE content have been released and id heartily recomend this game to anyone.			"

Review as of the ""Back to the Source"" Update, 02/04/2016, Time: 14:45, Hours Spent on Game: 12.8****THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.I’ll put a tl;dr at the bottom, as my reviews are lengthy. I've also underlined more important points in my review, so you could read those and get the gist of my whole review, I think.This Review(You can skip this if you want, it's not the important part of the review)I am going to do something different than the traditional “pros and cons” reviews as well as the “numeric” reviews, because I think that I want to show something else with my reviews. I want to talk about the actual experience of the game itself more than just elements of the game. I, as a reviewer, don’t want to isolate myself from you (the person reading my review). I want to speak more about the experience that I’ve had with the game and what I thought might be valuable to someone who is wondering what they will experience when they play the game. I think that is much more organic and maybe other people might enjoy this review. Introductory ThoughtsThis game is a great way to sort of “wait” or “kill time” to wait for other big titles that you’re waiting to spend your money on. I mean, the game is rife with humor and references to the outside world, and you might have some experiences worth remembering, but it retains a lot of elements of Knights of Pen and Paper 1 (I will abbreviate the name of the game as KOPAP, because there is a character limit on reviews). It isn't to say ""this game isn't worth your time,"" but I would say do a little bit of looking around if you are wary. And on this same note, this game does bring some new mechanics in that are worth mentioning, and I will get to that later.The Price and TimeWell, I just finished the main questline and I did get sidetracked somewhat, but it took me ~10 hours to complete. Along the way I met some odd characters, enemies, encounters, and all manner of strange things. I think it definitely has a story to it that's interesting. You have to put all the pieces together as you go along, but it’s interesting. I bought the game for $3.19, I think. So It isn’t overpriced at all. (The standard price for indie games nowadays seems to be $14.99 or so.) The DLC was $1.99 whenever I bought it, I think, and it added some extra content that I am going to play through. I would recommend buying it when it’s on sale, because it is $7.99 as its standard price, and while I don’t mean to imply that it isn’t worth that price, I would say to people who haven’t played KOPAP1 to watch videos of KOPAP2 before you jump right into it. You can absolutely jump into KOPAP2 and you won’t be missing much,  but if you’re considering buying it, I would strongly recommend watching videos, and reading other reviews. My Experience:I’ve already mentioned that it took me approximately 10 hours to complete the campaign (while getting sidetracked). (Sidenote: I usually compare the amount of money I paid for the game to the amount of hours played, and if the hours is greater than the money, and I also feel gratified with my experience, then I usually like the game because I can walk away from it knowing it was a good investment.) It may seem repetitive at times, but there are things that do give it much more freshness (I’ll get into this in a bit). The fighting mechanic is a fairly standard turn based mechanic, but it’s based on something called “Initiative,” which you will find out in the game. The exploration mechanic is much like Knights of Pen and Paper 1. You travel from place to place with a fee of 5 gold, which ends up being negligible in the later game. The quests are standard as well; there isn’t much variation in the quest types, but the story is what made it interesting, to me. The New Mechanics and Graphics UpdateThere were a few things that were of note that brought a certain freshness to KOPAP2 that weren't present in KOPAP1. I'll list them, because I've already had enough paragraphs.  Investigation- this mechanic added an ability where you can spend gold and find ""clues"" to unlock chests in certain locations and find certain items that can help you along your way, information that can help you with recipies, and other things I might be forgetting.  Dungeons - This is a huge mechanic which I really won't go in to depth about, but it puts dungeons in the game, and it reminds me somewhat of the old game Nethack. You explore a dungeon, and descend, and find a boss, basically.  Graphics Update - People might be wondering why I'm including this in here. Well, if you look at KOPAP1 against KOPAP2, there's a HUGE upgrade with the visual appeal. I much prefer the graphics of this game over KOPAP1. I thought this did add a lot to the game as well. Conclusion/tl;drKnights of Pen and Paper 2 was and still is a fun game for me. It had memorable references, whether they are modern or not. The characters were ridiculous and serious. The game as a whole was an enjoyable experience for me. If you're more focused on mechanics, I would say take a look at the game before buying it, because this game is really driven by the story. As I say in all my reviews: Don't take my word for it. Go look at videos, other reviews of this game, and maybe buy it. I hope you have fun, and thank you for taking the time to read my review. "

												Knights of Pen and Paper 2 is a really fun and large game.It's not as innovative as #1 of this franchise but still it's very lean and well done. Pros:- it's long if you want to complete all quests- massive amount of free dlc - character classes, levels, adventures, items... Oriental adventures is a really good free DLC that is quite long and has a good plot to it- fair paid DLC Here be Dragons - it's not very special but it's OK for it's price. I've bought it on sale for 2E and I'm pretty happy about it- there are lots of character building options for those of you who like to powergame- powerful character classes- music is great- graphics like 16 bits now compared to 8 bits of Knights of Pen and Paper #1Cons:- fights are too long - some animations are really long, you need to wait a lot for some screens- some classes are just not working compared to others - try this necromancer/warlock, it's just weak compared to Barbarian or Ninja- travelling in this game is just tedious - you need to wait for d20 to roll to check whether you can safely pass or need to fight some random battle- seems grindy at times, you'd need to fight some monsters over and over to grind money and xp to pass furtherOverall this is a very good game to play while drinking beer and eating crisps, just like when we were playing some classic PnP RPGs. If you like sattirical games about Roleplaying games and metagaming jokes then give it a try, it's pretty fun. Just be warned that this game is pretty long on it's own and some quests may seem tedious to you.---------- For anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/ "

												Very enjoyable and humorous game with relatively simple mechanics. A rehash of Dungeons and Dragons style tabletop games as a single player desktop game. The Easter Eggs make the game. I bought this game on sale, definitely a great value for the amount of time and anjoyment I've gotten from the game.			"

												Overall a very nice game. I enjoyed the whole DnD aspect of the game. I thought the character selection was a bit lacking, but each one had very nice and adaptive skills for any situation to come. Couldn't put it down, until I finished the game itself, and even then, I'm on the road to 100%, which as of this review, is probably done by now. 14-15 hours of well worth adventuring through dungeons, killing slimes, fowlbears, and other strange creatures.Very fun for the price point (currently $5). 8.5/10.I usually go into my games with next to zero expectations. Makes it better that way, since I'm not really looking for anything to wow me, or blow me out of the water.			"

More playable classes - Hunter is really fun this far into the game... Better art style/graphics (if that even matters). Dungeon/Raid system is really fun.Worth every penny.			"

												I love the first game, but I didn't like this one at all. It's extremely short, tedious and sometimes boring. I did everything, including the ""DLC"" and I wasn't satisfied at all.Let me give you this breakdown:*Crafting: I am not a fan of crafting at all in videogames, and this one wasn't an exception. You can craft some items and enchant items, but the enchanting is underwhelming, since you can make an item either +1 or +2 or +3, no special bonuses or making them powerful afterwards. Any unique items you find on the field won't be better than your enchanted items. Also, I got the feeling crafting was added, since all other games have crafting.*Quests: This goes for both main story and side quests. ALL of them are either ""Go to that place and fetch this"" or ""Kill X number of monsters"". There is only one variety, and that is a ""mystery"" quest, where you ""investigate"" a place and of course by ""investigating"", I mean click those options and see what happens. Yeah, the first game had the first two, but here, to the sequel of that game, I was expecting more variety, more quests, bigger, longer, better. But no, we got nothing.*Gold: I wasn't sure how to write it down, but another thing you will face toward the end, is you have nowhere to spend gold. I got all availible Game Room items (by the time I write this, BTW), I crafted and enchanted a good gear and everything from the two Magazines, including the 4.99 ""DLC"" and Monk, and then you get more gold and there is nothing you will spend it on. At the end of the main story + ""DLC"", I had over 2000 gold and they were sitting over there.*Conditions: The worst part of the combat of this game. Attacks can cause stun, confusion, bleeding, burning, poison etc status effects, but 99% of the times they work against you, since the enemies will get rid of it either immediately or at the beginning of the turn with a save roll. Also, in some places you have special conditions that also work against you, like in Big Town the special effect is MOB and each round there is a 25% chance a Thief will appear as your enemy. Or in the Tower of Broken Balance, the effect there called Broken Balance, the enemies do +25% damage, while you do -25% damage. They are useless and against the player. Also, how can someone achieve Sudden Death at all, when all everything you cast are gone almost immediately.*Length: It's an extremely short game. My play time, that is I was sitting and playing, should be lower than what Steam says, due to some RL stuff I was doing. And if you don't do the ""DLC"" quests, your play time will be even shorter. And the places you explore are fewer than the first game. The only thing it might add some time are the investigations you can do in each area, but those can be done in 1 minute. And they add nothing, since they are either items you can buy from the stores, or some unique items you won't use or recipes for items you won't make at all.I will say the writing is good, with some good jokes but it won't save it from being a subpar from the first game. And I see they will release DLCs in the future, but after I beat 100% of the availibt content, I won't return back to it.			"

												I was so looking forward to this game having loved the first one so much that I had multiple play through's on it.Bought this one on that fact alone and was almost immediately dissapointed gonna put the bullit points into some pro's and cons and let you decide:Pro:- Combat system saw some much needed love - Traveling felt fun due to bonus area's unlocked occasionally- Dungeon system Is a huge improvement explosation wiseCon:- Character customization actually felt worse there were far less choices on class's and players.- Crafting felt super unimportant first game any time you upgraded your gear it was a great power increase In this game though it was buy best weapon buy bets scroll combine and done forever.- Campaign had Zero challenge every encounter was easily beatable without any beforehand preperation.- Game room customization has next to Zero options in comparison to original game.- Dungeons offer no challenge to players.- Can pretty much go the entire game without having anything in your trinket or armor slot as long as your weapon is up to date.- No ability variance literally putting every level up point into a single talent is a viable option especially if that option is a multitarget ability.There are additional Con's but at that point it gets in to the nit picky details of my personal play style.Anyways make your decision yourself.

												I had a lot of fun in the beginning of this game. This is just the sort of game I like.The first 4½ hours were great, until I found out I was at the end game boss, which outright killed my slightly underleveled party.So I restarted, setting out the goal of not having that happen again.Since no boss can recieve status ailments other than bleed I kept away from anything but Health/mana, DPS and bleed, which is silly.I cleared everything and I do mean everything. I have no secrets nor missions left in my game and my characters are between level 34 and 36.The crafting system is uninteresting and too restrictive. I have not found any recipies that were not on a secret or built in from the beginning, so it would seem that there are nothing to discover here.Once you realize what is the optimal build, then save for a few secret weapons, there are only a very few ways to setup your characters, which are optimal.All this would be ok, if it wasn't for the unskipable battles. When I'm level 35, I shouldn't be stopped by a level 2 monster group, which takes me about 1-2 minutes to kill, thus wasting my time gaining 5xp and a few coins. When you want to make sure that you haven't missed anything or you want to perform a quest traveling. You shouldn't have to waste your time every time you need to travel more than 3-5 roads.This will happen about 5-7 times per quest. Making me feel very frustrated, when I just want to get on with the quest.I had some fun, but ultimately this game became a chore when I wanted to make sure I didn't have to start over again.			"

												WHOO. my first review. 27 hours, not alot is it? but i digress and will do my best as per reviewing this product, now im going to give you this right off the bat. i dont expect most people to like this review or agree with me. with that out of the way lets get on with it shall we?Mechanics: Its a turn based rpg set in a fluxuating timeline, sometimes you go to the past sometimes more futuristic, you can have 5 players with a small differance in choices of players, some will have ability like surfer who will get rid of one statis ailment per round he plays only to himself. as for classes most of them feel stronger rthen others depending on the fight, this is a good thing as depending on the fight some classes shine to show they arent useless. to get more characters or classes you have to complete quests or buy them from the magazine. Fighting: Okay so here i have many complaints and a few compliments, lets start with the compliments shall we? Each class compliments eachother in a variety of ways, you can be a Warlock to sap away enemy hp and give it to your characters instead of the normal cleric build. or also where paladin can heal as well, as for melee builds, for me they didnt stick very well as the magic users (Cleric,mage,psion,warlock) as most of them seemed just.. weaker. i had a ninja who i guess you could say is supposed to be a bit weaker but it doesnt excuse that when my wizard, without any head items at level 30- ish had 200 while he sat at a measly 170 for a MELEE build. but i do enjoy the ninja as later game he does get to shine a bit when he doesnt get hit in the first round, the art for the attacks are also amazing for each class. the only ones i have a gripe with is cleric's healing ability which is basicly just a orb above their head and the warlock's transfer life ability which just has a infinity sign when hitting the enemy, they could have made it much cooler. now for thew bigger gripes. dungeons. oo time to lay it down on this one. im going to make a completely different section.Dungeons!...: whoo boy. lets get on with this, at the beginning the dungeon concept sounded awesome! and the first try it was! it was everything i wanted from a dungeon! but 'oh no' i hear from you as i stated earlier i had to lay in on this one. but just wait. now. it feels really rewarding... in the beginning. the second dungeon i remember going into besides the sewer (maybe the sewer was i dont remember?) was the broken balance one. by now we are about at level 13 - 17 i dont remember the exact level it starts, we will get into this soon but it was REALLY TRUELY BROKEN. if it was supposed to not be fun and annoying them dang did you devs do it well, it was my least favorite dungeon in the whole game.  the rating system on the quests are bs. i remember atleast having to grind up to 2 - 3 levels higher then i was supposed to be just to get past the 1rst floor soon dying a few times to the boss WITH healing items. now for the rewards, the fights are constant so you get a bit of xp, but not enough to make it pay off. also the treasure. at my level 30 characters in a dlc (will get to soon) with 3000+ gold in my pocket im only getting small gems +5 hp and like.. 10 coins per treasure room. in a level 30 dungeon. what the ♥♥♥♥ devs. not only is it annoying to grind through all the enemies, along with the crappy loot and making you spend a good bit of money on pheonix up's because you CANNOT REST IN A DUNGEON. i get it. dont worry. you want it to be tense. but up the rewards and dont spam enemies and traps every room to only be healed by some water that gives 20 hp. thats all. sigh. well. thats all i have to say about dun- oh. wait. i forgot. it almost slipped by me. the effects. along with spamming traps and enemies there are random effects pn the battle fiend. like broken balance which makes all your attacks do -50% DMG and +50% DMG to your enemies attacks... WTF. or like when you cant do critical damage or everybody takes 5 DMG... and may i say that when that happens it only happens to your characters? not the enemies as well? even if the enemies do hits we take the damage, not them. it is really annoying when this happens and it makes it feel like a cheap way to make it harder without being fun. onto the next section of this review.Story: Its okay. thats all i have to say. its average. the best part of the game is side quests, secrets and fighting. the sotry suddenly ends after a battle that feels the same as the others, hell the final boss seemed weak compared to what i expected. now to the next topic.DLC: This is the last part of the review. now, i didnt play the monk one but i have played the dragon one, what i know of the monk one is you unlock a class and it seems to be mid game, the dragons are post game, thus far the dragons ones are a welcome sight, except for the encounters. the quests for the dragon nes can be repetitive at times and seemly just giving you free exp. which is fine. for the price point it is at i would suggest it only if you liked this game enough to play it for a little bit longer, i will give a brief summary nowSummary: So whats up with that good ratin huh? well.. i cant brng myself to hate it. i love the rpg elements and its battles are fun when tailored correctly which happens often you just have to wait. honestly right now i wish there was a 'meh' option. this game is awesome for me but i KNOW people wont like it. i know i hated it for a little bit but kept pushing forward. all i wish is that if you liked knights of pen and paper one, you might like this game. its tory is shorter but i enjoyed it when it was good and hated it when it was bad. i hope this review helps and i will be on my way. hope it helps			"

												A fun turned-based JRPG. You are the players of a Dungeons & Dragons-type tabletop roleplaying game, run by a dungeon master. Your characters have a race, a class, and some inherent stats from themselves that help you whether you choose classes like thief, warrior, paladin, mage, etc. There are some unlockable classes as you go along and two expansions (only one--Here There Be Dragons or whatever--is available on Steam. The other can be bought in-game). If you've played the first Knights of Pen and Paper, not a ton has changed. They've slightly changed the way stats are generated, how saves against conditions like confusion or rage are done, and the graphics are better (now more of a 16-bit feel instead of an 8-bit feel). There are also ""rare items"" available as drops that are super powerful, providing resistance to conditions, or making your attacks better, or making your character more resilent. If you enjoyed the first one, you'll enjoy this one. You definitely don't need to have played the first one in order to enjoy this one. This is an entirely new campaign. There's tons of pop-culture goodness in there (both in the background art and dialogue), so it's fun. As for skills, there aren't a ton of them, but like with any RPG you can level up your skills how you choose to fit your play style. Likewise, there are a bunch of different locations with interesting art, but after you unlock all of them you'll be going back to the same places over and over, so it can get a bit repetitive. Likewise, I did a LOT more grinding in this version than the original to be able to beat some of the bosses, so that was frustrating, but there is a ""Bestiary"" function that unlocks more information about enemies (including bonus damage if you collect enough kills of a certain beast), which made the grinding at least have some use.Altogether, I played about 30 hours (Steam said 37, but a lot of that was idling and some grinding I did voluntarily), but that included the Here Be Dragons expansion pack, which added three new areas, some new items and a ton of killer dragons.Overall 8/10. I prefer the original, but this one has a lot more depth and a much longer playtime. Still, I wouldn't mind starting from the beginning with the new classes I've unlocked. A lot of them I unlocked so late they would die in every combat so they never got a chance to get awesome enough to use in combat to their full potential.			"

												So far a terrific game; however, pales in comparison to it's predecessor in content and enjoyment.It's very short, and seems a little less challenging.  Overall great.  But the price, being more expensive than the first game, for much less content seems a little out there.  Hopefully they keep adding to this game to make it as fun as KP&P 1.  And hopefully they don't decide to blast the hell out of it with microtransactions to access this content.In the end it's worth the buy if you get it on sale.Also, devs, if you are reading this, for the MILLIONTH time, please, for the love of God and all that is holy: Add a feature to Knights of Pen and Paper 1 on mobile to CHOOSE AND LOCK SCREEN ORIENTATION.  It's such a simple feature, and it would solve many a headache for people like me I'm sure.Also for KP&P 2, the randomized dungeons are ok; but, it seems strange that you can't just click on the room you want to go to unless you are adjacent to it.  It's pointless to make you revisit every previous room for no reason other than to move on.  I've played other games with a similar style dungeon and their saving grace was allowing you to skip redundant room travel and just move on to where you haven't yet been.			"

												This game is full of (real good) jokes, just like the first one.For example: there is a level 14 enemy called ""dead pixel"". The level 15 version is an ""undead pixel"".Interesting features are added, too; like a crafting system or investigating places for loot (like recipes or good equipment, but sometimes you only get cheese).I'm a bit disappointed by the Deluxe edition though: I bought it for the farm area. That area was extremely easy in the first game; here it is tougher. It's nice to have, but most people would use it less than in the first game. The mount is purely visual and the rest (soundtrack + art book) is nice to have, but not that important.			"

												Knights of Pen and Paper 2 (or KoPaP2) is a really good game.How I Discovered the Game (you can skip this if you want):I first discovered the first game on my iPhone while being bored and browing the app store. I bought it, and I was hooked. Unfortunately, I dropped my phone and it broke, even though I had a case on it. So, because I did not save my game to the cloud, my save file was gone, along with my full party of level 23-25 characters. You will be missed.So, when I got a new phone about a couple months later, I decided to install it again. Then, when I went on a trip, I noticed that there was a SECOND GAME!!!!Immediately bought it and played it.Then I found out it was on Steam about 2 days ago.So naturally, I bought it with all the DLC. (I even got my dad interested in this game)!Well enough about how I found out about the game, let's get into what it really is.The Game:KoPaP2 is an extremely fun pixelated turn-based RPG for the PC and mobile devices. You create a party, level up abilites, collect items, get loot, etc.However. It is more than just an RPG.You see, this game is FILLED TO THE GOD DAMN BRIM with pop culture references, such as TMNT in one of the DLC's.The game is extremely simple, yet fun, and can have a sense of humor at times. If you are a relaxed gamer, this is the game for you.If this review did not satisfy you, I am sorry. This is a game that you just have to play for yourself to experience.			"

												I had good hopes for this game. I personally loved the first one, but this game is too fast to explain mechanics, not going into enough detail and ultimately rushing the entire thing. I also can't stand the tryhard pixel graphics here. In the last game, the graphics were crisp and well done, but in this one they just seem too... accurate to what they're trying to represent. It outdoes the rest of the game and brings standards that this kind of game cannot realistically achieve.			"

												ok game it's only worth it if you get it on sale.1 was so much better that i beat that a few times but by the end of this i couldn't wait for it to be over. the game feels like it was halfa$$ed then they added 2 really scummy quests 1 you have to make a paradox account and one is to a pay wall that if you don't get the dragons dlc you can't continue (this dlc adds 2 areas, 1 dungeon, and some of the most brain dead/forced fights i ever seen - look for my review there about it). +it has a old school rpg feel+you can craft items before you get the receipt-special weapon drops are useless cause you can't upgrade them (i think this is so your forced to spend gold for good weapons on the iso version) -animations take way to long and get tedious after seeing them over and over and over.-quest that forces you to make a paradox account to complete (at lest the dragons dlc pay wall quest had relevance)-the 2 free dlc and even the pay one you are forced to rebuy in game with gold to unlock.-most classes are useless over others-most fights and npc's feel laze so they made a running joke about the dm being lazy to cover for it-only 5 characters per game (1 you could make 1 character out of every person you had) i feel this was done to make you grind gold to respec over swapping characters. hoping if your on the iso version you would just buy gold.- 2 bosses (1 is a optional boss from the dragons dlc the other is a boss to ""back to the source"" free dlc) that you need to be level 50+ to fight. i did all content and was L40 but these bosses reked my guys.-no upgrade option for delux edition AGAIN			"

												Short Review: I recommend this game, but with a major warning: The status conditions in this game are super annoying. Make a party that really avoids using status afflictions and it's a better experience.Longer explanation:Ok, So I love the first game. When I initially bought this, I played for a few hours and ultimately gave it up. The status conditions are such a pain. You can inflict an enemy with 3 conditions, only to have him roll BEFORE his turn begins and dispel all conditions for free. I think that the devs made it this way because it's possible to give an enemy 6-7 different conditions and they suffer from SUDDEN DEATH. I don't think this should have been a feature at all. I did this once during my game to get the achievement, and it's fairly hard to do with a party built specifically to do this. You certainly don't need to worry about getting it from routine play. A few months later I came back to this and decided to try the game again and avoid the status afflicting skills and equipment, and then I really enjoyed it. I focused on damage dealing, damage reduction, threat and healing and now I think the game is almost better than the first one. I'm looking forward to a KOPP3 now and will buy on day 1 for sure :)			"

												I love this game, I really do, I just have one major issue with it. I have now played this game for dozens of hours and lost myself in it completely. That is, until I beat the main storyline. There is a whole ton of stuff to do after beating the main storyline, but unlike the main plot the expansions (especially the Dragons one) feel like they're empty. I mean, in the Dragons expansion every single thing you do is a fight and they stop making jokes out of it even. The developers attempt to justify these fights but it's broken down to ""Oh, you smell of onions, we are going to fight you now"". I wouldn't have an issue with it if that wasn't the case for hours upon hours of gameplay. They have a beautiful product with a great sense of humor and then... it's like they just stop caring. I love this game a lot, maybe that's why the aftermath (again Dragons is a huge perpetrator) is so disappointing to me.			"

The gmae is played from the perspective of your characters sitting at a table, so it isn't so much action oriented as it is story and humor oriented.

The unique properties of certain drops make for a lot of fun variation of party builds, good assortment of characters, fun enchanting and crafting system, and plenty of rather difficult dragons to slay in the late game.

												This Game is amazing just like the original. The game has a lot of new features, and they have improved on some old features. I really like that they have continued to add content over time, allows you to come back and play the game again, in a different way with new content. Utimatly, I think I do like the first Knights and Pen and Paper better, however that being said, its like saying I like to drive my Ferrari more than my Lamborgini, both are very good just have different features I find more appealing in the first game. Would 110% recommend this to anyone who enjoys games in this genre.My video review if you want to get an idea of how the game plays!

												Recently finished this game, have not perfect cleared it, having some issues finding all of the content. To summarise: pretty much the same as the first game, some nice added stuff, some things taken away, some improvements and some things worse. Kinda short but still worth the price for the silly fourth-wall-breaking humour.The game is very much the same as the first game but with a few tweaks. The game is mostly improved, especially the dungeon layout and the addition of little features such as choices in quests and secrets discovered only by rolling a 20 during travel.  However, it feels shorter and not as challenging, and I miss some of the features that were taken out, such as a choice of GM, the in-house pets and being able to have a space alien as a player choice.The general theme is that you are playing as a bunch of tabletop roleplayers and their characters at the same time. You can see your room and customise it (with the same money as you spend in the game world, for some reason) while also seeing the adventure as it happens. The monsters and NPCs break the fourth wall constantly and everyone is aware they are in a computer game, despite it meaning to be a simulation of a tabletop game.  The complete lack of fourth wall makes it very light-hearted. However, the game is sometimes very insightful about gaming ethics. "

												With equipment and new, deeper mechanics, and even better humor, the game is a shining successor to the great Knight of Pen and Paper.Cons:I have a feeling Pen and Paper 2 is much longer and more demanding, while keeping the slow gameplay of the franchise. I feel that the addictive mix between a very simple game (Pen and Paper 1) and this more complex but still simple game is hard to find; I haven't delved more time into Pen and Paper 2 despite its excellent implementation because I felt that the mix (deeper but still simple and very ""slow"" to play) was a bit odd. Still, it is a GREATLY inspired game, greatly executed.If you liked Pen and Paper 1, this is a must have.If you felt Pen and Paper 1 was too simple, but are still open to a casual looking party adventure game, you should try it.I hope Pen and Paper 3 will be multiplayer :D "

												I bought this game because I played the original Knights Of The Pen And Paper +1 and enjoyed it immensely. The first game was a fun little time sink with a lot of content and quirky characters. I wish I could say this game is a good, but frankly it simply isn't. To start with, it is MUCH shorter than the original as well as MUCH easier. There's less quest variety as well. Most of the game felt like filler content that the dev team added to round out the length of the game. There are also way fewer characters and classes to play as. Even worse, the game sorely lacks depth in its combat and equipment compared to the first.  If I had played THIS first and moved on to the original game, it would have felt right. Almost every aspect except graphics is a downgrade.Viewed away from the original, the game barely stands on its own merits. It is fun and quirky, but much of the humor feels forced. The game is incredibly easy even without grinding and becomes downright trivial if you complete every quest available to you. The lack of content is very noticable, with the main quest taking maybe two hours. You can cram in maybe 8 more from filler if you want with all the DLC but the DLC felt like it was simply trying to stretch out the existing experience without actually adding more content.Overall, the game had some very solid ideas to improve the series. Adding in more ways to spend your gold and being able to craft your own gear was a nice touch. Unfortunately, all the new systems feel like they are half completed, like they were stopped halfway through development and shipped as-is. Realistically, that's how the entire game feels. It's not even a case of content being stuck behind a DLC paywall, it simply was never created. In the end, this is probably worth picking up on a deep discout sale but I'd not suggest paying full price for it. Skip the DLC unless you REALLY enjoy the game. I'd suggest playing the first one over this if you haven't already, it is superior in every way except visually.			"

												Turn based RPG set in a universe where your characters are actually players playing the pen and paper version of what you are experiencing in game.  Few changes from the first one make this a bit different and somewhat better than the original.  If you like turn based combat RPG systems than you will like this game. The difficulty does vary but thankfully never stressful.  I was able to beat the main quest storyline in 10 hours.  The lack of secondary missions give this one not as much flavor as the first Knights of pen and paper.  $5 DLC  when the main storyline is already feeling a bit lacking is somewhat alarming.  Please purchase at a discounted price but otherwise a fun and enjoyable game.

												As much as I'd like to give this game a positive review, I cannot. Why?Pros:  Funny puns, a lot of jokes that made me laugh out loud More interesting skills than in KoPP1 More players/classes More ways to actually play each classCons: All of the upper are irrelevant in endgame, because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ random number generator Extremely short compared to Kopp1 Seems like a cashgrab compared to Kopp1Why am I so agitated because of the RNG?Here goes:In endgame or the DLC you will find yourself put up against enemies with one high stat and usually one middle and one low stat. The system works like this: substract the stat for which you have to roll from 20 and you get your target number, e.g. you have 9 Body and roll for weakness, you have to roll 11+ to be successful. If you suffer any malus on the roll, you substract it from the appropriate stat, e.g. body roll -6 for a character with 9 body would result in a final stat of 3 giving a target number of 17+.Good, now you know how this works. Why am I bummed out? Because your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ useless freaks keep rolling 1-5  constantly  while your enemies get one 20 after another! How do I know this? When your enemy has 10 body, 7 senses and 6 mind and is faced with the ""judgement"" skill from my high level cleric, this is what happens all the time:Judgement lets you roll, once for each stat, you fail, you get hit,  but  my cleric has so many skill points, he applies a -6 penalty to each roll.  For this enemy, the target numbers would be as follows: 16+ for body; 19+ for senses and a straight natural 20 for mind. Statistically speaking, it would be a miracle (or anathema, depends on your POV) for such enemies to constantly succeed more than one saving throw right?Nope, not in this game. 80% of the time you can be happy, that your enemies get hit even ONCE. And that skill even is a vulnerability of the said enemy. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot?Your Warrior, on the other hand, has 9 body and needs to roll unmodified to get rid of weakness, so 11+ is the TN. Nedless to say, that in 80% of all cases he never managed to remove the weakness by himself until the fight ended.Essentially, statistically speaking, the random number gen is perfect, because on the average, all rolls are equally distributed between high and low... except that the enemies keep hogging all the high rolls while you get the 1-12s.Sorry, but this is no fun, and the RNG simply made the game a mess and the longer I played, the more angry it made me, because I dumped skillpoints into skills, which mathematically made sense to have, but enemies keep resisting even if they are reduced to zero stats due to attached penalties in said skills. In the end you will find that damage is the only thing to go for, even critical is super-useless as my warrior with 9% crit get as many crits as my rogue with 54% chance to crit. Get your dirt together paradox, there are so many statistical and mathematical applications to avoid exactly this, which are not even that hard to program.			"

												I recommend this game, but only buy it if it's on sale. It's a fun, cute tabletop RPG inspired game that's pretty simple and easy, but there are a few things that I really dislike about it.Firstly, the length of the game itself is good, (The 10 hours I've played on it was enough to clear every mission in the game) however, the devs have included 2 DLCs in the game for $5.00 each, which I think is insane. You even get to these new locations and are prompted to buy the DLC. It felt like the devs are just trying to squeeze more money out of people by shilling this stupid DLC.Secondly, you unlock every ability within the first few levels of the game. This means that through the entire game, the combat is exactly the same. You spam the same 3 abilities over and over until you win. The condition system is also broken, because monsters get 2 chances per round to resist the condition (once when it is delivered and once when it's their turn) meaning that most of the time when you burn/confuse/stun/poison/weaken an enemy, it ends up doing nothing.Bottom line, I only paid like $2 for it, and I enjoyed myself. The combat leaves something to be desired, and I would never buy the DLC, but the fun music, comfy atmosphere, and witty RPG jokes make it a decent purchase.			"

												I cannot recommend this game.  It seems like a quick cash grab to take advantage of the first games success.  Game is very short, and adds no depth to the orignal game. It seems like it is more shallow and made with far less effort.  Games like these should not be bought and developers should be shunned for pushing out sequels that are inverios in just about every way to the original. The first game was a good starting point, but far to simple a game to take a step back in sequel.Don't purchase at any price.  Also the game is gated behind a pay wall.  A very bad joke that no customer should find funny in the least.			"

												Well, that was a let-down.. Sort of..The first KoPP (+1) was amazing. Yes there were some annoyances from it (like the damn horse noise in travel!!) but otherwise it was very fun! The games humor was spot on and it really made the game worth every second. Sadly in this, KoPP 2, I don't see it. It lacks.. It tries and tries, but never really gets your funny bone... At all. Specifically by the point where it used the same joke for the 8th time.I'm also somewhat dissapointed at the lack of choosable players (as characters) and races and classes..Players: There were a LOAD of these in the first game.. Why couldn't they have simply carried some of them across? It's not like they were game breaking 0.oRaces: There are 3, and I find myself choosing Elf almost 100% of the time. Why not create 3 more races and give each race a total +2 bonus across the 3 stats... More options is more variety is more fun. I think it would take little effort to create 3 additional races..Classes: Where did they go? I'm sure there were more in the first one.. I think I had to get 50% of the way through the game to come across a new class that I liked so there was my 5th player... I WAS waiting to get something more magic based, as that's what I prefer, so I held out for ages only to find there was nothing coming.. Very dissapointed with this sadly to say.The gameplay is a little repatitive... Actually a lot... The first is similar, but it was a first time attempt so again in this I was hoping for a little more. Perhaps a little weather, or heaven forbid the trees sway or something.. Each area has different art, but that's it. I find it all very grindy but with nothing dangling infront of me to entertain the outcome of said grinding.. It's grinding for nothing.. I'm fairly sure that has and never will be a successful use of my time.Sad to say that I cannot recommend this game in it's state at all. It's just very very boring. It was boring from about the 4 hour mark, but I kept going hoping that it became as fun as the first. Personally, the first game is the one to get - I recommend that!			"

												I like the first one better, though this is also not bad.Thumbs down just to give those who are new to this series a note: Play Knights of Pen and Paper +1 first, if you really want more then try this.A few differences compared to KoPP1:-Seems shorter, I didn't finish all the side quests though. But it's like only taking me half the time of KoPP1.-Pixel art isn't as impressing, no I mean, this doesn't even look like pixel art, just low-res art.-Much, much slower combat. Slow animations, slow ""saving throws"" when handling debuffs.-Balancing issues, dungeons seems too difficult and normal encounters too easy. Just because you can't recover in dungeons and have to fight 5-10 group of enemies and deal with traps.(which, I guess you'll fail the saving throw 2/3 of the times and take a lot of damage) Dungeons are also difficult in KoPP1 but they only appear in late game.-Investigation, good idea but bad execution: Throw dice and accumulate the investigation points to get items. So? What you actually do is click a few times and watch the slow dice animation repeatedly.-Saving throws, enemies now have a chance to negate your debuff every turn. so, 1) the slow dice animation makes you bored, and 2) skills that inflict debuff/dot effect isn't that useful. Unlike KoPP1, there was no saving throw, so instant damage skills are time effective(so you finish enemies in shorter turns and take less damage) and debuffs/dots are MP cost effective, which is really better balanced.-Equipments, enchants, creating items. Some people maybe like this but IMO KoPP is good because of its simplicity. Adding complexity just makes it bland.-The humor in the dialogs is still good though.			"

												I do recommend it, However; The dungeons are etremely unfair at times (most times) to the degree where if this were an actual game of D&D I would punch the DM in the face so they would have a reason for being so harsh. Whats that you have explored your first room, well heres a fire trap that kills 3 of your 5 party members then enrages the other 2 and here is 5 enemies you can't run from or use skills on, only normal attack becasue your enraged (actual encounter)... This is the FIRST dungeon, it should not require 2 hours of grinding to complete the first dungeon. All enemies were being 1 shot by my lowest characters, but the traps would kill half the party every time.  So go ahead, give it a play. It's enjoyable, just not the dungeons.			"

												I enjoyed the game.  Similiar vein to the first.  Yes, it has some issues, you can level faster than the quests, there's a lot of repetetion, a bit of grinding for all the final stuff.  But in the end, it provided the same type of humorous story that I was hoping for.  I'd like to see a little more incentive to swap out party members though.  Generally speaking, once you have your party, there's not a lot of reason to grab one of the new characters you run across.  I'd almost like to see a ""split the party"" situation in 3.  Play up players who miss sessions, etc.  Things that happen in real pen and paper campaigns.			"

Posted: October 24, 2015
												This game is kind of a wash. If you are looking for casual RPG that focuses on JRPG format I might looosely recommend it but if your looking for depth, replayability, story, or even an improvement from the orginal I think you will be disappointed. I got about a 6 hours of decent enjoyment out of it before forcing myself to continue playing. Only 6 hours to $10 price point isn't great value imo so I am going to give it thumbs down. Like the first game this one starts out on the path to being a real good game and the early returns likely lead to a number of people waxing poetic about it after a few hours. I too in the beginning was thinking it was pretty good game but I just completely lost interest at about the five to six hour mark. Everything after that point been a grind that just does not seem to have any kind of a reward making it worth completing. I think the game starts off well and introduces some slight tweaks to the systems found in the original. One of the big changes and subsequently huge letdowns here was the crafting system. I was initially excited about the prospect of being able to tune your equipment and craft items but the whole mechanic turned out to be really really really simplistic. Most of the time the necessary elements to forge a new weapon are all located in the shop of the same town you crafting in.  As a quick breakdown of how it works:From Town Screen:Open Crafting Menu-Read a Recipe and Identify Components needed to completeBack out of Crafting MenuOpen Shop MenuPurchase ComponentsBack to the Crafting MenuClick on Components Pay 5 Gold and.....SUCCESS!I mean I get the game is suppose to be accessable but...just....no... just no. The only skill or strategy necessary to complete the above would be remembering the components from the time it takes you to back out of a menu and open another one. The recipes themselves are located primarily (maybe entirely) through ""Investigating"". This entails paying gold to roll the dice and investigate different points along the map.  Enough high numbers stack up over several rolls and you uncover some sort of prize. There are other things to be turned up through this pay for a dice roll mechanic but none of it was of any use I could find. While I did not hate this portion of the game as much as the crafting I found it lackluster as well. Now that I think about it the only real difference between ""investigate"" and ""crafting"" are that the former has an element of chance and less menu navigation.I enjoyed first Knights of Pen and Paper for a solid block of time and I would probably recommend it especially on sale. However it was also difficult to finish. In that game I got to the point of having my party and item upgrades more or less completed strategy wise and was situatuated about the same strategy-wise from about hour 10 to completion.  I did push through and eventually completed the game but I was entirely on autopilot after that point. This version started off stronger but finished or at least flatlined for me much quicker. I am not sure if this game was rushed to the finish line or not but it feels like it would have benefited from some more time in the oven. Often we all enjoy games for different reasons. For me the portions of this game and the first one I enjoyed were that you had the ability to upgrade various aspects of the game (characters, items, room improvments, various other buffs) to your own liking. For my enjoyment the critical fault of this game is that you have very limited options to upgrade different aspects. The first game offered more customized options for upgrades and about the same level of depth as you will find here. I did not care for the story and tone of the game personally, Both are very light and though the humor missed the mark I appreciate it being included. Neither really downgraded my experience much because after I realized I was not getting much out of reading through the story I wound up skim/skipping through the dialouge bits. I do give them a plus one for making the option to speed click through that portion of the game.Overall I was underwhelmed and pretty disappointed as I saw this game as the creators chance to fine-tune the experience I got out of the first 12-16 hours of the first game.  Instead I got the same letdown in less than half the time.4/10			"

												I bought the game because I loved KoPaP +1 and played the hell out of that game. Despite being a bit repetitive at times it still had a variety of gameplay options that you could experiment with. That said, I really felt like KoPaP 2 fell a bit short on this part.There are:- only three unlockable classes, one of which you unlock only right before the end- about 2-3 options for each game room upgrade- which leads to sidequests that barely give any rewards more than XP and gold- a crafting system that I barely needed to use and has few recipes. I feel they could have vastly improved both crafting and quests by, for example, rewarding recipes and/or rare ingredients here- a limited assortment of items that are all very similar- personally, I did not like the enemies very much. There is a seemingly huge number of glitches and bugs that you have to fight along the storyline. I really liked the tabletop rpg atmosphere and it feels a bit too 'glitchy' this time aroundIt is not a bad game though and I enjoyed playing it. It has a lot to offer, such as much improved sprites and graphics from the first game. The dialogue is still hilarious and there are is way more content to come via DLC, but I would not recommend buying it right away. As of yet it is a pretty but somewhat slim version of KoPaP +1.			"

												The first game was so wonderful and fun.  This one is a bit changed in not so many cool ways. The Cleric has the ability to carry the team through in any circumstance.  Though the others I could have interchanged over and over again without ever feeling happy.  I expected a bigger better overhaul and was a bit disappointed.   It is a Short game, I have finished it already inside the 15 hours.  I didn't use the add on characters Barbarian or the Necromancer, because I just didn't see a point. I didn't even expand out to the five chairs till the game was near over.Update: I found out you can save between steam players using the Paradox login, Yeah and lame at the same time. Happy I save between systems but I have to remember which save file is the most recent each time I login. Where is the Monk????? I'm a lvl 26 and I don't see it.  I thought I was going to change my review to a Positive and then I remember that it does reward playing past the main storyline. I still think the first one was fun, this is blah.			"

												First of all, everything I wrote about Knights of Pen and Paper 1 mostly applies here, so to avoid repeating myself: http://steamcommunity.com/id/ogrep/recommended/231740So, what's new in KoPP2? Not a lot, and the main new features are surprisingly thin. 1. Randomly generated dungeons. This is my favorite improvement - the inability to rest adds a good bit of challenge. It's unfortunate that the dungeon generator pulls room descriptions from a pool of what I estimate to be less than 15 different possibilities. This mean that you'll be seeing the same rooms over and over. They're not even themed to the type of dungeon you're in or monsters you're fighting. Very lazy. Also, the loot you get in them doesn't scale with your party.2. More classes/races. These are pretty decent, but nothing too interesting. I like having the options though.3. Overall improved combat. There are more options available to you, but the game is still extremely solvable. The ""Most Correct"" action is easily derived and once you figure out your approach to combat you will rarely deviate from it. Get ready to spend a lot of time clicking the same 5 buttons in a row until things die.This concept - playing a group of friends who are playing D&D - has so much potential and it falls so far short of it. Why don't my characters talk to each other? Why don't they make quips based off their races or classes, instead of completely generic ones like ""LOL"" or ""Medic!""?Knights of Pen and Paper 2 is a definite improvement over the previous game, but it still suffers from the same problem: poor writing and Family Guy-style referential ""humor"" can't replace interesting gameplay or characters/story. Don't buy or play this game.			"

This isn't the sort of game that you put a lot of thought into and experienced rpg players won't break a sweat on it, but it's a great way to relax and pass some time.

It's also one of the few ""retro"" games where the sprites are actually really well done. They reflect the game's humorous tone but are visually clear and consistant.			"

I preferred the first game.  But I loved this game.  It was a good ten hour romp.  I put in 50ish hours in the first game, so it is a shorter game.  But it is different.  The skills are different, the enemies are different, and the areas are different.  I like how different areas have different effects.  So is this a cash grab?  I don't think so, it is a good game that can give a solid ten hours of fun, or more if you want.  If you loved the first game, then get this one too, it is worth it.			"

												Fantastic game! It is exactly how it looks, put together a party and the DM creates the world behind him....usually. I have, and still am, enjoying this game. I would love to see more like it. It reminds me of my old AD&D days in a simple and fun way. I would just prefer it to be a little cheaper, I got it full price because I just missed the sale, and I was out of other games to play, and I was looking for something like this.There is just enough customization to this fun and simple game. Not to mention a hat trick full of pop culture references. I would very much reccomend on waiting for a sale though, In general it is a bit smaller game even with the add-ons, but if you can get it on sale it is a fantastic little game!			"

												In my opinion, this game is extremely simplistic and repetitive.  Essentially boiling down to a grind of 3 types of quests: kill X monsters, travel to point Y, and the occasional escort.  It tries to be funny and quirky; while it has its moments, there are many other games out there that were way more satisfying for me.  If you don't mind a simplistic, repetitive experience, then I would recommend this game.  However, that is not what I look for in games, so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they were specifically looking for that type of game.Also, as a minor criticism, there is no ultrawide support, and it doesn't scale well with 1440p resolutions.  This isn't a huge drawback for a game like this, but it is something that I like to know when purchasing games.			"

												Painfully easy and repetitive, save for a few encounters.  Which is really disappointing, because the game, while quite simple in it's mechanics, has potential to be a very engaging strategy game. Yet most of the time the game chooses just to throw piles of weak monsters at you which you have to slog trough without using half of a brain cell. Another thing that really makes this game painful to play is that it has a bunch of unnecessary dice rolls outside combat - travel, rest, investigate.... all of these unnecessarily slow down the game without providing anything to it. I can't even recommend this as a time-sink game for your tablet or other low-powered device.Additionally, while not a direct criticism to the game, I've been noticing a trend of games trying to mask poor gameplay by filling the game with humour and pop-culture references. And this game really tries hard to seem hip and cool, which just leaves a bad taste while playing it....			"

												I recommend this game, but the expansion I recommend when it is on sale. Not enough content for the price.Good game. Seems a bit short. You never really feel powerful and most classes just feel nerfed. The ninja is the only class that really meshed well in any group. Item drops for the most part just seem worthless. Toward the end of the game (expansion) you get a few items that are pretty good, but for the most part, the stuff that drops you can buy in the stores and then just upgrade. IMO it's not as good as the first, but if you enjoyed the first one, I would recommend this one.			"

												Edit: After I completed the game I went straight to this review. As soon as I returned to the game to give it a bit more play I realized there wasn't really much more advancement to be had. I expected a +1 version where I could play the whole campaign over again with my currently leveled characters, but it turns out all you can do is finish uncompleted side quests...boring. And that stupid scrolling bug has returned! I have changed my review to ""not recommended"".I'm a little conflicted here. The game is pretty fun, but the campaign is so short. I beat it in 9 hours and that was with a fair amount of side-questing, so I'm not really sure It's worth the full price of the game.Also, there is this annoying bug that makes everything scroll down. What I mean is, sometimes when in any type of inventory menu like shopping, your stash, and even on the map, the game scrolls down and you have to either grab the scroll bar with the mouse or hold the up key. Even then, if you are in an inventory menu you can't access items near the top because it just scrolls right back down again. The only way to ""reset"" this is to restart the game, but there is no telling it won't go immediately back to it again, and it will eventually do so.However, it's still a pretty fun game and I'm sure lots of extra content and bug fixes will come out in the future. Overall I give it 7/10 (changed to 5/10 based on lack of content) in its current state. Possibly an 8 or 9 with extra content, bugfixes, and a price drop.			"

												Was lucky enough to get a review key for Knights of Pen and Paper plus the new expansion DLC Here be Dragons and so far I'm very impressed. Solid old school RPG mechanics which are easy to understand but offer enough depth to keep you coming back. Some lovely pixel art which evokes the retro feel and visualizes the partys adventures beautifully and a enormous dose of humor. Great of fans of roleplaying games both pen and paper and computer. For more info and gameplay see my ""Wizards Eye on"" mini let's play (which has a strong chance of growing into a long let's play :)

			Today I dive into Knights of Pen and Paper 2 from Kyy Games. I was a huge fan of the first one so lets dive into the second one and see whats new!		

I loved the first Knights of Pen and Paper and the second one so far is looking like another hit to me. There is a lot of love there and references towards other games and a great sense of humour around the whole thing. I've been having a great time just giggling at the jokes and puns so far. The game still works very similar to Knights of Pen and Paper 1. I've still barely scratched the surface but already I'm in love with the game so I'd 100% recommend it if you liked the first game. If you are a D&D fan, tabletop fan or just like jokes around gaming culture it's probably a good bet for you too!Cannot wait to dive into more of it, I'll update this review if I come across anything I feel I should be mentioned.

												Knights of Pen and Paper 2 is more of the same but with more features and better graphics. If you like the humor here and the nostalgic throwbacks to pen and paper DnD I'm sure that you'll have a good time with this casual RPG but there will be some grinding monsters to progress.

												I was really excited when I saw the sequel to the original game on Steam, but I was quickly disappointed.The GUI is clunky and unintuitive and I had a gamebreaking bug with the Mage class that forced me to quit the game. The mage class would not target enemies properly and I could not proceed without fleeing a fight to reset it. This is really a gamebreaking issue and I wish they would have addressed it before releasing the game.I loved the original, so I was looking forward to this, but I am greatly disappointed.			"

												If you're a fan of the first KoPaP, then you how silly the overall theme is.  If haven't played KoPaP, you're not going to miss anything picking up KoPaP2, (but it's definitely worth playing) and there seems to be better features. The quck explanation: you control a party of adventurers who are being led by a GM in a D&D sort of setting.The dialogue is witty and there seems to be no end to the pop-culture references.  My current favorite so far is the mystical item, the i.D.E.R.P.  The overall feel of the game strikes a nostalgic chord.  It reminds me of some of the classic SNES RPGs in how you manage equipment and combat.  You may not be riding a Chocobo around a world, but that's where the dialogue and simple backdrops are highlighted.Can't wait to sink more time into Knights of Pen and Paper 2!			"

												Well, a lot of things were improved from the first game.This game looks better than he first, the gameplay was streamlined (less clicking in sub-menues) and features were added, like the crafting. The humor is the same and the game also tells another wacky story.Still, I somehow like the gameplay of the first game better.All taken together, there are not more classes and customisations in this game than the first, crafting is a nice addition but I did not really miss it in the first game. In the first game, there were also more battles where you could set the difficulty (enemy number) yourself.I have not finished the game yet, but reading through the reviews tells me this game is also much shorter than the first.So, yes, I recommend this game, BUT if you have not played the first one yet, I would recommend playing that first.

												Considering I spent a week and still didn't finish the whole game of the first one, I was surprised that I 100% finished the entire map on the same day I started. That being said, I had a lot more fun in this world. Even though the first one wasn't a freemium game by the time I played it, the form and structure of the amount of grinding it would have taken to make purchasing the gold appealing was apparent in everything from the grindstones to the travel mechanics. Everything that was wrong with the first one though had been fixed in the second, except for the length. I would have loved for there to have been twice as much game play for a sixteen dollar game, but I still enjoyed every second of what game play there was. Be wary of the DLC area if you buy the delux version, if you finish it before finishing the game, the characters level up so much a good portion of the game except the final battle becomes a bit of a cake walk.

												Wonderful sequel to the first, I liked it better. It's easier to adjust to, achievements are straightforward to get without having to grind thru the game 5 times like in the first one. Jokes are one point, however the game is slightly shorter. It took me about 14 hours to beat this while the first one took me about 30. It does have high replay value and a pretty cool soundtrack. It's only worth getting the deluxe if you want to support the developers, but wait for the game to be on sale. It's really worth it at 5 USD, not so much at 10 or 15. It's fun little distraction and is well made. There aren't many bugs and isn't a typical grind it out kind of game. Story mode is simple to follow along, the plot is entertaining enough to not spam click to skip it. Well worth the wait. Had been looking forward to this since May. 9/10			"

I liked it so much that I was going to origionally only play it as a one-ff for my channel, but I have now started making a series in it. If you wannted to see some gameplay you can check out the playlist for that series here:

												This game is amazing.  It's highly addictive, hilarious, and a fun 8-bitish tabletopping type of RPG.  The music is awesome.  It makes me feel like I'm back in the early 90s when snap wristbands, trapper keepers, and big bangs were awesome.			"

												A fun enough romp into the realms of a heavily referential D&D world, complete with a pretty light-hearted story involving a PC who just doesn't want to change between two editions of a pen and paper game. If the premise doesn't sound at least a tiny bit relatable, you might miss many of the jokes that KOPP2 tosses about, which are mostly in reference to D&D. In my opinion, the game stands on its own legs without most of the referential stuff-- it doesn't feel desperate for laughs like KOPP+1 did at times. KOPP2 also knows when to make fun of itself, and does a pretty good job of it.Mechanically, the game feels more like a pen and paper game than KOPP+1 did, though it still feels more like a JRPG than it does D&D. The main difference lies in three attributes: Body, Senses, and Mind: that both dictate derives stats (like KOPP staples Threat and Initiative) and fuel new resistance rolls, which are used to end effects in a manner similar to D&D's saving throws. These attributes are difficult to increase, requiring expensive trinkets or rare treasures to raise.Character creation is still a highlight, as expected, though the pool of players has been more normalized. (No more dog, or robot, or what have you.) While I enjoyed it as much as I did in the original, there were definitely some characters that had somewhat useless abilities, especially when compared to powerhouse combos like Cheerleader/Thief and Rocker/Warrior (or Rocker/Paladin). Race selection is now present, though it's very fundamental: elves, humans, and dwarves. The races have more long-lasting effects than most players do (with exceptions like the Rocker and Surfer). Most of the core gameplay has been kept the same: form a party of regular people playing as characters, go on adventures, profit. 95% of the quests are still the same fare that KOPP+1 offered, which was killing x creatures at y location. Dungeons are still around, though I found them to be more of a hindrance; the frequent rolls to avoid traps didn't add challenge so much as frustration.Equipment feels much more D&D-like than it did in the original, and it also feels more natural. Gone are the days of grinding for grindstones-- weapons can be improved by enchantment with scrolls, and crafting creates better magical options. In fact, many of the flaws of the first game have been removed: pay-to-win pandering with gold has been removed, as well as several of the more ""phone game"" mechanics, like waiting for armor/weapon upgrades. In their place is an equally frustrating magazine-oriented DLC system, in which some items, scenarios, and classes are behind either gold or solid cash. At the time of review, this system was sorely lacking, with only one class and one player able to be unlocked for gold, and the rest behind the $5 DLC.While I genuinely enjoyed this game, I can't say that I would suggest getting DLC for it. After the main campaign is over, the mechanics start to feel very samey, especially if you've been getting unlucky with random encounters and have fought many underleved foes as a result. Though a difficult boss (one of two difficult encounters in the whole game) sits at the end of the post-game quest, the end-game feels rather hollow-- and I'd bet on DLC filling it up later.Overall, I found the game to be fun for a weekend's distraction, or as a quick dose of RPG for a half hour or so. It's simple enough to pick up and play without getting lost in Pathfinder-esque customization. However, as a result, the finished product lacks the depth that some might expect from it.			"

												This is a parody RPG and it does the job well. The character perspective of 3rd person tabletop gaming reinforces the point and makes the whole thing nerdy fun. The in jokes are rampant and the plotline is equally knowing. None of it is too difficult, allowing you to play through with a limited number of characters then do a 2nd or even 3rd playthrough with new characters and abilities (character creation allows a lot of flexibility so even this is conservative). Some jokes never get old and that's certainly true here.			"

Lots of lame yet funny geek jokes and references. Addictive in that you just want to finish off that one quest, complete the dungeon or do one more battle to level up, which leads you right into the next thing. Money well spent.			"

												Considering I spent a week and still didn't finish the whole game of the first one, I was surprised that I 100% finished the entire map on the same day I started. That being said, I had a lot more fun in this world. Even though the first one wasn't a freemium game by the time I played it, the form and structure of the amount of grinding it would have taken to make purchasing the gold appealing was apparent in everything from the grindstones to the travel mechanics. Everything that was wrong with the first one though had been fixed in the second, except for the length. I would have loved for there to have been twice as much game play for a sixteen dollar game, but I still enjoyed every second of what game play there was. Be wary of the DLC area if you buy the delux version, if you finish it before finishing the game, the characters level up so much a good portion of the game except the final battle becomes a bit of a cake walk.

												Wonderful sequel to the first, I liked it better. It's easier to adjust to, achievements are straightforward to get without having to grind thru the game 5 times like in the first one. Jokes are one point, however the game is slightly shorter. It took me about 14 hours to beat this while the first one took me about 30. It does have high replay value and a pretty cool soundtrack. It's only worth getting the deluxe if you want to support the developers, but wait for the game to be on sale. It's really worth it at 5 USD, not so much at 10 or 15. It's fun little distraction and is well made. There aren't many bugs and isn't a typical grind it out kind of game. Story mode is simple to follow along, the plot is entertaining enough to not spam click to skip it. Well worth the wait. Had been looking forward to this since May. 9/10			"

												Well, a lot of things were improved from the first game.This game looks better than he first, the gameplay was streamlined (less clicking in sub-menues) and features were added, like the crafting. The humor is the same and the game also tells another wacky story.Still, I somehow like the gameplay of the first game better.All taken together, there are not more classes and customisations in this game than the first, crafting is a nice addition but I did not really miss it in the first game. In the first game, there were also more battles where you could set the difficulty (enemy number) yourself.I have not finished the game yet, but reading through the reviews tells me this game is also much shorter than the first.So, yes, I recommend this game, BUT if you have not played the first one yet, I would recommend playing that first.

												After playing the first installment in the Pen and Paper series, I already had my eye on this game. More witty comments and terrible puns? I'm up for that. I happened to come across this game as part of a bundle, and started playing right away. To me, this game is everything good about KoPaP and then some. I'm already at about level 25 after a few days of play, but for the amount this game costs (about $9 CAD) you're getting some decent bang for your buck.Story: 8/10. Silly and fun, but with plenty of lore. Reminds me of a more kid-friendly Borderlands.Graphics: 8.5/10. Attack animations fit together smoothly in a classical 16-bit RPG style.Gameplay: 7.5/10. While it's a lot of fun, grinding can get repetitive. Definitely a step up from the first game, though.Music: 7/10. Nice area themes and battle themes, but it could have used a tad more diversity.Overall: 8/10. I'm currently having a lot of fun, and I really felt like trying to post a more in-depth review. Hopefully this help anyone considering to purchase the game. I'm currently holding off on my opinion of the Here Be Dragons DLC, as I have yet to buy it myself.			"

												Way more into this game than I thought I would be. Hadn't played the first game so I was totally new, but the gameplay is easy to learn. It's simple in a lot of ways, but that really works for the style. Gold can be a little difficult to manage if you like to collect all the goodies right away like me. The sound and music are decent and varied enough to not feel annoying after a few hours of play. The jokes are alright, some rely a little heavily on outdated memes/phrases but the overall tone is light and fun. I general I like this game, but only if I'm in the mood to grind levels/gold for hours (because that's the majority of what you'll be doing).			"

												Fun pass-time RPG with it's tongue so far into its cheek you'd think its got a whole carrot in there sideways. Simple combat that is fairly quick to master (initiative and stunning = win) but manages to not get to boring in small bursts. Some really unfair battles near the end of the game might make you want to pull your hair out, but you can just go grind some levels and equipment to overpower them. The crafting is fairly basic, but doesn't require a lot of random drops to get anywhere. I wish it were a bit more in depth, but I tend to enjoy crafting systems more than most. There is a narrative of sorts to the game, and the sentiment behind it is one that interests me as someone who enjoy's tabletop RPG systems. The quests are fairly grindy at places (Kill X of Y, Gather X drops from these monsters, Travel to here and get in a fight on the way) but some are genuinely funny in their dialog, and quest XP is very rewarding on the whole so they're worth it.This game is entirely passable for what it is. And it is a game at home on iOS and Android devices. So if you're not looking for an amazingly complex RPG			"

												This game doesnt seem to work right on desktop computers - it looks like it was designed for mobile devices.  I am getting constant scrolling and it seems to be related to the mouse.  I have seen others on the forums mention the same thing.The game is really grindy and there is no real tutorial or suggestion on how and what you should form your team up as.  Alot of stuff seems to be in the game but it seems if your party is not configured a certain way your kinda screwed.  You can remove members and replace them - but the new party members start at first level making it extremely difficult to continue your storyline until you go back to a weaker level area and grind them up.The comments are somewhat funny but can grow tiring after awhile.  Seems to be a fair bit of reading with no voice support.  The regular price of this is way too high for the quality provided in this game.			"

												Lazy, repetetive and redundant, doesn't reward you over time. Play the first one instead.It's a great concept, and I'd play if they worked a little harder on it. The main problem is it's so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ repetetive. Half of the game is walking back and forth on the world map, dungeons are halfway filled with you stepping on traps which you can hardly help with any amount of items, you constantly are forced to spend time fighting the lowest level units.If there were more decision making, more customization, more classes, and more in-depth items, I'd be down with a 3rd, but this is the last one of these I'm buying. I had a lot of problems with the first one, but I still liked it in the end. They just took this one and removed the most entertaining features.			"

Hopefully this help anyone considering to purchase the game. I'm currently holding off on my opinion of the Here Be Dragons DLC, as I have yet to buy it myself.			"

												Pretty much a sucker for any game that involves DnD rules in even the most superficial way. I played this game through only for that reason. Otherwise, it's very dull. And the writing. Oh, it's so bad! Every line lands with a resounding thud. And the combat is... servicable? I don't even know. It's not exciting, but not bad either. Character building is the same. Everything's very much a cheaper version of something you've seen before, and probably enjoyed a lot more.If you absolutely must have some rendition of DnD in your life and you've played through ToEE/NWN/BG so many times you've memorized every monster's stats, then get this game, I guess. Otherwise, don't even bother. It offers nothing new other than cute art and bad jokes.			"

												This game was a lot of fun to play through.  It seemed more balanced and improved from the first game.  There was a lot of lines in the game that made me laugh.  Very funny story in parts.  The only thing that started to bug me was traveling.  As I lvl'd the random battles were ok, but towards the end of the game they became a real nuisance.  Rolled a 1 or 2 while traveling through one village and I get a bunch of things that were just a waste of time to stop and fight.I did love the addition of the dungeons.  They were fun to explore through every room in them.			"

												Fun pass-time RPG with it's tongue so far into its cheek you'd think its got a whole carrot in there sideways. Simple combat that is fairly quick to master (initiative and stunning = win) but manages to not get to boring in small bursts. Some really unfair battles near the end of the game might make you want to pull your hair out, but you can just go grind some levels and equipment to overpower them. The crafting is fairly basic, but doesn't require a lot of random drops to get anywhere. I wish it were a bit more in depth, but I tend to enjoy crafting systems more than most. There is a narrative of sorts to the game, and the sentiment behind it is one that interests me as someone who enjoy's tabletop RPG systems. The quests are fairly grindy at places (Kill X of Y, Gather X drops from these monsters, Travel to here and get in a fight on the way) but some are genuinely funny in their dialog, and quest XP is very rewarding on the whole so they're worth it.This game is entirely passable for what it is. And it is a game at home on iOS and Android devices. So if you're not looking for an amazingly complex RPG			"

												The first game has several game breaking ways to min-max your characters... and then also new game plus modes that upped the difficulty to insane amounts.  It could be played straight, or you could figure out how to break it and then plow on to quests that were only possible if you had a broken party.  That kind of respect for players, coupled with getting out of the game what you put in, made the first game amazing.  No such luck here.Everything in KPP2 is so carefully balanced that in the end there is only one good winning team.  Sure maybe the monk is nice, but by the time you've got him you don't need him.  I tried to do a conditions team.  Bought all the (very limited) game room stuff that would enable my party to inflict conditions more effectively, and have moves that target neighbors in effect hit all enemies, going full on in that direction.  Of course enemies can just heal themselves of status ailments right away (and bosses always do), and I had to watch the little die roll every time to see if the move was resisted or not, which added at least a minute to nearly every battle I was in.  So I just switched back to one warrior to taek damage, a cleric healer, and everyone else doing multi-target damage attacks, the only party worth having.Fewer options and even fewer good options.  A crafting system and unique discoverable item, where the best equipment is still just the stuff you buy + a +3 scroll across the board.  Also, as an aside, I liked the 8 bit retro graphics more than the 16 bit style.  It's not ""better graphics"" when the whole point is that it's stylized.			"

												Well, a lot of things were improved from the first game.This game looks better than he first, the gameplay was streamlined (less clicking in sub-menues) and features were added, like the crafting. The humor is the same and the game also tells another wacky story.Still, I somehow like the gameplay of the first game better.All taken together, there are not more classes and customisations in this game than the first, crafting is a nice addition but I did not really miss it in the first game. In the first game, there were also more battles where you could set the difficulty (enemy number) yourself.I have not finished the game yet, but reading through the reviews tells me this game is also much shorter than the first.So, yes, I recommend this game, BUT if you have not played the first one yet, I would recommend playing that first.

												Wonderful sequel to the first, I liked it better. It's easier to adjust to, achievements are straightforward to get without having to grind thru the game 5 times like in the first one. Jokes are one point, however the game is slightly shorter. It took me about 14 hours to beat this while the first one took me about 30. It does have high replay value and a pretty cool soundtrack. It's only worth getting the deluxe if you want to support the developers, but wait for the game to be on sale. It's really worth it at 5 USD, not so much at 10 or 15. It's fun little distraction and is well made. There aren't many bugs and isn't a typical grind it out kind of game. Story mode is simple to follow along, the plot is entertaining enough to not spam click to skip it. Well worth the wait. Had been looking forward to this since May. 9/10			"

												Interestingly if you read the comments on this game and don't stop only at the global evaluation you can sense how Knights of Pen and Paper 2 is not a good game.The choices of the game are very limited. There are a few classes considering how those are not that sought after, there are three skills there, and most of them are not very good. The classes also are not really balanced, there is the mage that can deal nice DPS, but most of the time you would end up better with tanks and be done with it. My paladin died like 1 time where my other character died 20 times. The unlockables add practically nothing to the game, neither do the craft, there are as much recipes as I can cook in real life, and it's not much.The game is pretty much a grind from hour 1. You grind for XP, for gold, there is no strategy to apply to situation, the game is pretty much a hit&heal kind of thing, and go from point A to point B. Yes the game is somewhat pretty, and yes there's humor there, but it does not make up for the lack of gameplay.			"

Mostly the combat gets repeditive, and the game is pretty basic and easy. This isn't to say it is a bad game, because it isn't.

												21 hours to complete the game 100%, but between the times I've left the game running while AFK/alt-tabbed and the time spent grinding for the VR achievement, you're looking at about 10-12 hours of play for the campains (DLC included).Definitely worth the 3.75€ I spent, but I wouldn't spend 15€ on this (and having multiple achievements locked if you don't have the DLC feels bad). I really like the genre, with all the bad puns everywhere, but there is big room for improvement here, mostly in dungeons:- Dungeon traps. Everywhere. Unavoidable. Fixed damage. I died in a level 5 dungeon with my level 40 team because I kept running into traps.- Too few different dungeon events. If I'm going to cross dozens of rooms, I'd expect to have somewhat different runs (I mean, there could at least be a few location-related ones). If I'm going to fight mobs, I'd like to see something other than a portal or monster coming from behind curtains everytime. Not to mention that more than half are traps, so it's both boring and frustrating.- Events have different outcomes, but since there are so few of them you quickly know the outcomes. And often, the best choice is to do nothing.- Expanding on that. Dungeon event reward.... nothing. The same event happen in the first dungeon just like the last. Whoa, so happy to find two +5HP trinkets when I'm level 30+. Man 15 gold? I'm so rich now, I have 6015 gold ! Can't wait to get that sweet 300XP book, that's a big help towards the 30k I need. But you know what? These garbage rewards are only one outcome of an event... the other being most of the time a trap. Unless you're at the first dungeon, pass your way it's not worth the risk.- Random drops. Come on, I just killed a level 45 dragon, and all I got was a 5g weapon you can buy at level 1 in the shop.- Crafting is very limited. Shop included, there is exactly one weapon and one armor for casters (unless you have the trait to ignore penalties on armor, and even then it's just a regular armor).Other than that, the game is pretty fun, with references and horrible puns everywhere. Dungeons are bad but you're mostly playing for the dialogues, and they're pretty good.			"

												Fun little gem, great to keep by side in case your internet connection is cut or you're simply looking for a small getaway from those nerve-wrecking competitive games. KoPP offers great story-telling, doesn't take itself too seriously and is quite the challange. I found myself simply not being able to progress due to building my dudes poorly and had to grind a few levels here and there to progress further. The dice rolls in-game seperates this game from other similar titles, just like it is in real life DnD, a roll can mean the difference between a wipe and victory. Got the game while it was on sale, recommend you do the same. I havent played too far into the story yet but I dont see myself replaying the game even though there are many possible ways to level up and form your squad.			"

												I was not familar with the first game and picked this one up on sale. Great little game, especially if you used to play D&D, Shadowrun, Rolemaster or any of the tabletop roleplaying games. It's pretty generic JRPG, type stuff, with lots of referenes to silly stuff that happens at your average tabletop game. The best thing I can say about it is, I bought it on sale, and I now have 29 hours (real hours, not community hub stuff Steam counts) into it and I'm not done with the first play through.  I still haven't unlocked the monk, story was over, but then gives an encoure. Lots of tedious farming like in many JRPG's. It also has a little replay value as you can play again with all the new classes you unlocked. I definetely recommend this when it's on sale.			"

A fun little RPGA strategy game with 15h-25h of gameplay with old style pixel graphics, I recommend, my score 8/10. I also got the dragon DLC which I recommend also, if you like the game you will like this add-on for sure.Pros:- Good cost for the hours of possible fun- Great game to play with a controller- Can actually complete the 100% achievements without being a crazy person :pCons:- The level of challenge is low, a few fights here and there that could give you a small challenge- The music could have more soundtracks, it becomes repetitive quickly- I encounter a repetitive bug (only with controller) where I couldn't continue any of the dragons battles - Solution: just go back to the room and restart the quest using your mouse instead of the controller until the battle starts, then you can go back to the controller.

												Following in the footsteps of Knights of Pen and Paper +1, Knights of Pen and Paper 2 goes about in the same way that it's previous version did; a Indie filled pen and paper rpg simulation game, with memes. Overall, I would recommend this game, but within reason. Play the first one first, and if you enjoy the prequel, then you might enjoy it's follow-up, which is a more water downed version of it. But anyways, onto the review!Knights of Pen and Paper 2 follows along the story of your party (2-5 members) and the DM (Dungeon Master) in there quest to save Paperos from the evil Paper Gang. You pick between the player (Cheerleader, Rocker, Hipster, etc) Character class (Basic 3) and the job of the character (Insert 13 classes) and go about your journey as you would in any Pen and Paper RPG.During you journeys, you will encounter fetch quests, meme quests, and your run of the mill style of main story line. Evil attacks. Defeat evil. What this game will give you though is the Pen and Paper essence of the game without all the hassle of gathering a party. The jokes, creativity, and overall feel of the game is what I think draws people in. You get to experience the heart of Pen and Paper without the time, social, and work constraints that regular Pen and Paper seems to have problems with. The inclusion to newer players. Pros and Cons;Positives:1. Play a turn based RPG representing a Pen and Paper game without the time investment.2. Will crack a smile at times3. Job selection with the synergy between classes4. Cheaper game for the amount that it entailsNegatives:1. Shorter compared to it's predecessor2. Cringe worthy at times3. Towards the end, it felt more like a chore to finishOverall would I recommend this game? Sure I would, but on certain conditions. Play the first one to see if you like the joke style of game play before you commit to the 2nd since it's not for everyone. And if comparing 1 to 2, the 2nd one still captures the soul of the game, but lacking in what brought people to the original. Regardless, I did enjoy playing but did feel towards the end I was more wanting the journey to just finish then actually finding reasons to keep playing. This review is based on the Deluxiest Edition of the game with a average time of 20 hours for 90% completion, main quest line completed.			"
