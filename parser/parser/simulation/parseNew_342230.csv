												Alright,We can be brief about this game.Air Guardians delivers as much as it costs.Meaning:The graphics are of a poor quality.The controls are fast, if using a gamepad or joystick.The sound effects are of poor qualityAir combat is dumb. (You don't need any skills. just fire away)The thing is:Do you feel ripped off by Air Guardians? Well, to be honest, not really for such a price upon release.It's not easy creating an air combat game from scratch, so you should take that in regard also and so far it's okay for the price.Maybe, with more work on the weapons systems (Limited number of bullets/rockets/bombs and target lock) it might be even better. But, on the other hand, it's not a simulator or AAA game. So, there's that.I think it's okay. Just for the fun of it and for the courage of the developer(s) to get something like Air Guardians done for a cheap price.			"

												Air Guardians captures the 360 degree thrill of air/space battles as you alternate between predator and prey in a ballet of missiles, bullets and space craft.  You must control your speed, angle and roll as you persue the enemy for an attack, then quickly alternate strategy to hectically dance your craft out of a missile lock before you take damage.  The ballet ends in either the completion of your mission or, if you take too much damage, your transformation into space dust.The graphics are good enough to get the job done, but your enemies and allies are reused for all 6 missions so don’t expect too much graphical variety.  The sound of the bullets and missiles whizzing by your craft, or impacting into your craft, add to the atmospheric frenzy of battle.  Technically the control of your craft and weaponry all work very well and I always felt in control of the action.  There is only the hint of a story, but the combat is good fun for the hour or so the game lasts and a fair trade for the price of admission.			"

												A flight game built on the Unity Engine... ok, hmm...This game feels like it should be in beta or early access.Graphics - average.Framerate - good.AI - bad, everything moves the same.Music - average.Sound effects - below average.Speech - below average.Difficulty - seems more difficult than it should be or is? annoyingly so.Alot of people complain about controls. I had the same issue.I went into controls menu and changed the axis & buttons to what I wanted on my XBox360 Controller, problem solved.There is a strangeness about this game...No flares? If an enemy gets 'lock' on you then you will almost certainly get hit.Your aircraft doesn't seem to have much speed. No type of afterburner either.You can't 'target lock' or designate an enemy?Your minigun/cannon shots don't touch the ground? (just pass through or something?)Regenerating health. In a flight game, wtf?Unlimited ammo. Let's just spam proximity missles, don't need anything else. DOH!Default controls are absolute rubbish.You have to unplug all gamepads or joysticks if you want to fly/steer using your mouse.Out of my flight games, this one would be at the bottom.Can't recommend this game as it is right now.

 A positive experience all things considered...	 (Scroll down if the bottom line will suffice ^-^ )To truly appreciate this game in a fair manner one has to compare it to something in it's own price range. This game costs 2,99€ on steam at the time I write this review. 2,99€ is roughly the same money I'd have to pay for a kebab or a bowl of noodles at our local chinese diner. Both worthwhile products in my opinion. With that in mind, the game has a higher actual value than a meal in my opinion since A: you enjoy it at least a little longer and B: you can even replay/re-enjoy it (which would be fairly disgusting with the food I imagine...).All that said, I'll start with what annoyed me (because I think that's what I'd usually do): Horrible support for different controls - The game DOES offer some limited control customization, like, binding roll, yaw and pitch to different joystick axis and allowing to invert them as needed, along with a few select button functions needed in the game... actually there ARE just a few functions so I guess I could say 'all of them'. However the game does not recognize all buttons and/or axis on joysticks and controllers, some clearly different axis are registered as the same, some buttons aren't recognized at all while some multiple buttons are recognized as the same. HOTAS systems are the worst, as the game seems to randomly recognize roughly 10 or 11 buttons wildly strewn about both devices (I had to use a Hat on the throttle unit to fire minigun and missiles because triggers and releases on the stick weren't working). Now for the fun part, in order to play with mouse and keyboard, the game asks you to first unplug every controller and restart the game (quite the pilgrimmage for me...).  No Sound settings, no volume controls - The game is really really loud and it doesn't offer any way of adjusting volume to the user's needs. It's a small issue since you can simply reduce the games volume in windows' volume mixer, but nonetheless annoying. Too short, too little content in general - Which, as I previously stated isn't that bitter since this game has the price tag of two big bottles of Coka Cola... and that stuff is unhealthy anyway...The game has 7 short levels, one being the tutorial, one patrol (plain dogfight), one escort, one fleet battle, one bomber swarm intercept, one ground base attack and one space shipyard attack mission. All of these were fun but still ultimately sadly short.""Story"" narration and general writing of dialogue for the short video sequences was outright horrible, and ultimately almost nonexistent. Sad weapon balancing - There are three playable weapons in the game, heavy-hitting dumbfire missiles, Fire-and-Forget homing missiles and the fighter's autocannon. The missiles fulfill their purposes well (one being against larger ships, the other for fighters of course) but the autocannon has proven to be sadly pointless as it's damage output is too low to compete with the dumbfire missiles while it's bullet speed is too low to actually relieably hit fighters with it. Sad because it's (at least in my opinion) the coolest looking weapon. Now for the positives =) - The gameplay is very simple and easy to master which provides a quick, short time enjoyment for which the game was obviously made. Simplicity isn't necessarily a bad thing after all.- Designs of fighter jets and and also some of the larger ships are quite cool, even in their simple technical execution some of these are superior to ones seen in some other games. - Nicely chaotic aerial combat. A few large vessels slugging it out among each other while you fly around between them hunting fighters, large numbers of enemies and allies in each battle, anti-air fire from larger ships or ground emplacement looks rather nice andthe most positive thing about it in my opinion:Destroyed enemy planes or ships don't just explode, they will fall/sink to the ground as burning smoking wrecks... really really cool!Okay I'm done. If you like a quick uncomplicated piece of fun for the price of one kebab, if you like dogfighting in a decently cool sci-fi setting that lives without the classic laserguns and energy shields (also cool =D), if you don't mind possibly fiddleing around with controls or unplugging a controller and if you're fair enough not to expect too much from a game at such a price...I recommend it =)         -> I've seen far worse, more expensive games being highly rated and sold a lot for smartphones. This is fair.			"

												Air Guardians is more of a demo concept than a true 3rd person airplane shooter, but with realistic (yet playable) physics that's more X-wing or Wing Commander than Babylon 5, huge furballs (dozens of fighters at a time), large ships shooting at each other and you, and some decent combat mechanics, it can be basis of a decent game, just not in its present form. You are the anonymous squad leader of an unnamed faction fighting against ""Global Security Forces"". Your aircraft has 3 weapons: gatling gun, seeking missiles, and dumbfire missile. Dumbfire missiles are great against ships and bases and bombers. Seeking missiles are against fighters. There is no ECM/chaff... any missile locked onto you must be evaded. On the other hand, your ammo's unlimited... Feel free to hold down the firing button so you pop missiles continuously if you want. There are only 6 missions. Yes, SIX, total. Tutorial doesn't count as that just familiarize yourself with the controls, which are simple enough. The dogfights are fast and furious alright, as you try to spam missiles in the direction of the enemy so the seeker can pick up on the enemy, no lock on needed. Hitting bombers and ships are easy enough... start from far away, reduce speed, spam the dumbfire missile while your crosshair is on the target. Simple enough, right? Obviously, the enemy will be shooting back... a lot. Lots of AA turrets, missile launches, it's sure as heck exciting as a shooter. But there are a LOT of UI issues, like dark crosshair at night. Yes, there is a night mission and a space mission too. Shooting things without a crosshair is mostly luck. There's also no enemy health bar, which is sorely needed for ships (both friendly and enemy). There's no ""coupled"" flight, i.e. you can control 3 axis independently if you got the right joystick / gamepad.  There's also no skipping over the mission intro (i.e. ""Why we fight!"")  And not possible to invert the throttle input (the two triggers on Xbox 360 controller, so I ended up LEFT trigger being full throttle/afterburner, rather than right trigger) while all other axis are possible to invert. Finally, the radar doesn't zoom out far enough to point you back into the action, as it only indicates air targets when there are also ground targets. There are also some visibility problems, or perhaps level design error, as I saw one section of the ground rose out of the ground like a solid white wall. All in all, Air Guardians is a nice little adrenaline shootem up that's not far removed from arcade games, but having only 6 missions is almost inexcusable, even for an indie title, and the UI issues prevented it from earning even a begruding recommendation. HINT: For the final mission, your actual objective is to destroy all the ships in the ""shipyard""... and you need to do it QUICKLY lest you get overwhelmed by the bazillion fighters launched later. Hold down ALL THREE triggers so you triple-spam the target. Good luck.			"

												This game has pretty simplistic graphics, and a very fast learning curve. The ariel combat is pretty straightforward, Dumbfire missles, Homing missles and machine gunnery, used to take out other fighters, as well as carrier ships and more. The AI isn't very complicated, so battles tend to be easy to win if you have decent hand-eye coordination. the game offers joystick compatibility which is always a plus for flying games. It isn't a bad game, definitely a steal as part of a bundle or if it were really super cheap on steam. It isn't an Ace Combat game, but it's not complete crap either. I could get behind it.			"

												I've left my original review below for archive purposes, but I'm changing it to a positive.Every single one of the points I mentioned below has been addressed by the developer, which, to be honest, would be enough on it's own to yield a positive review because that puts him on a level of responsiveness above any ""AAA"" dev I can think of.It's now possible to remap controls and joystick axes, and you're left with a relatively entertaining arcade style flight shooter. It's pretty fun and there are no longer any game-breaking bugs or feature deficiencies that I can find.For the price especially, it's definitely worth a look.I was expecting this to be a flight combat game I could play with a joystick, but no such luck.EDIT: You can now play with a joystick, but there is no way to assign axes, so my twist is throttle and my throttle is yaw, making it horrible to try to play.It's a relatively simplistic/arcadey shooter, controled with mouselook and WASD. Except that the turn and roll rates are quite slow, so it's a bit like playing a 3D FPS while standing in quicksand.EDIT: Turn rates somewhat improved as there was a bug affecting mouse sensitivity.Aircraft move quite fast, so I found it very hard to get into a dogfight or bring my cannons to bear, as we'd just zoom past each other unable to chase each other every so often. The proximity (homing) missiles work though.The game seems a bit unfinished. There are no ingame options or graphics settings. You can't customise the controls as far as I can see. There isn't even a way to exit the tutorial mission other than Alt-F4.EDIT: Can now bring up menu during tutorial and quit if desired.Overall, I wouldn't recommend, even with the edits above. Give me a way to remap controls, and you'll be there ;)			"

You just have to get used to the controls.Update:I saw some people complaining about the inverted mouse. Just give it a try, as I said you get used to it. The first ten minutes are terrible, but the next 30-40 will be great.

												Check second review after developers interest in fixing his game and the controllers.This games needs a lot of work in the area of CONTROLLERS! My Trackball  (Logitech 570) nor my mouse (Logitech M215) work well or at all.  My JOYSTICK  (Logitech Force 3D Pro) brings no joy at all.  Could have been a nice arcade flight game.  If they fix the control issue it still would be fun to play but right now (April 13 2015)  it is not worth any thing to buy or play.  Hope it gets fixed soon!  Nice graphics and sound for a game.  Concept of the game is good.  Developers , Please work on fixing the game do not let it die.  After posting this the developer contacted me and helped me get some controll of the controllers.  His interest and assistance make me change my recommendation to YES. He stated that he is working on improving the game controlls and the game. When he finishes this will be a great game. It is well worth the cost.  I really like joystick control so I hope it improves.			"

												As of now i cannot recommend this game at all.The game is just either unfinished or badly made. Without wanting to attack the Developing team (consistent of 1 Guy), it just plays and feels horrible. While there is indeed joystick support, the mouse controls are horrible. You have no way to invert the Aim, you have to use it reversed. There are not sound or graphic settings, leaving the player with a un-stoppable stream of music and outdated graphics.The #1 Killer was the missing ""invert"" option. I am not used to playing with reversed controls and i couldn't get into it, which means i did not get past the very first mission. Unless you own a joystick or are able to handle this problem + you do not have any expactations towards the graphic - then this game might be for you. Otherwise - not.			"

												This is well worth the small sum of money for the game. It reminds me that people still remember the golden days of gaming when the Gamecube was still hot,Xbox 360 was just new,PS3's were hot on the market and PC gamers ruled over all consoles and mobile gaming. It brings back a quick reminder that air combat is still very fun and popular. I couldn't help but think of the new Battlestar Galactica when the planes zipped overhead and flak zipped past my cockpit. This game is a all around blast and took me no time at all to beat it took me just twenty minutes tops to beat it actually trying. The only con i really have to this excellent game is the lack of multiplayer or skirmish mode, it would help keep players still in the game besides having to replay the same story missions over and over (don't misunderstand as a bad thing the story is enjoyable especially the one involving us to attack bombers.). I am happily content with the graphics, now extreme reviewers would say that its horrible yet they forget the fun exprience the game still offers. All in all it is a fantastics game great for fighter piolots who love death from above.			"

												Received this game from a mystery pack from GMG.An interesting game clearly lacking the polish alot of people are used to, but ignoring it's flaws yields are a good amount of fun for the couple of dollars this game costs. Total played time to finish was around 45 minutes, though I can honestly say that time was well spent.Pros:Tight controls (once configured for whatever controller you're using)Fast paced dogfighting (AI is pretty aggressive and will tear you apart if you stop evading for even a couple of seconds)Cons:Graphics lack obvious polish, seems most of the texture work went into the player's shipVery short (45 minutes to finish with a single death)What little story there is was obviously stapled on to provide some form of flow to the missions, though i feel was entirely unnecessary.Overall I'd say grab this game if you're got an hour and a few $ to burn, it'll scratch that dogfighter itch.

There's only half a dozen levels, the graphics aren't really that interesting, and the voice acting and story are completely forgettable. But what's there still plays well enough. The controls function, and the gameplay works, and it's enough for some small amounts of entertainment. If you're looking for a deep, enthralling, memorable experience, you're not going to find it here.

												There isn't much to Air Guardians, but there there is, is actually decent. There are six brief missions, with only the last two really changing things up. You have three weapons, all with unlimited ammo, meaning the only thing you have to manage is your health, which will slowly regenerate. You can blaze through the game in about an hour without much frustration. If you want to fly around and blow stuff up for a bit, this game will do the job, just manage your expectations. A difficulty select or a skirmish mode would have gone a long way to adding to this game. As is, know that you're getting an arcade flight sim that's an hour long at best.

												The developers didn't see fit to allow me to invert (or uninvert) the mouse controls.I even tried SakasaMouse to invert my mouse, and when I was finally able to navigate the menu with my inverted mouse, I found that the gameplay's mouse was NOT inverted.They decided to give gamepads the option to invert (assuming said option works), but not mice. Dumb as heck.I tried playing for a while anyway, so I played training, plus the first two of 6 missions.First of all, it was incredibly easy. Despite that I kept going in the totally wrong directions due to the dumb controls, all I had to do was point vaguely in the direction of the enemies and hold my mouse button down, and my infinite-ammo lock-on missiles won for me.Voice acting was horrible, and there is essentially no story.Graphics were decent, I suppose, but you don't really see all that much, besides the ground from far away. (If you fly closer, it's pretty low res, but it's flight sim terrain, what do you want?) The other ships are pretty much too small and too far away and too fast to see clearly. There were a few capital ships, and they were decent, I suppose. Fire and smoke effects were nothing special but fit the rest of the game.For the on-sale price I paid, it wasn't quite worth it, mostly due to the horrid controls. Without the control issue, I could see it being a somewhat enjoyable 10 minutes worth of gameplay. But probably not worth paying more than $0.99.If you've got nothing else to do with your time, have a spare buck, it's on sale, AND you like to play flying games where pushing forward on the mouse points your nose at the ground, then sure, try it out.

												In the critical real world = 2/10In the cut them a break; it's not a AAA game, It's a few bucks and quite a fun little game you'd expect to find at like an arcade, kind of ""world"" = 7/10I'm actually quite enjoying the game. Only on the second mission but still. I got it for $1.97 and I'd gladly give them double just to help the devs out. It does support Logitech Extreme 3d pro joystick. Probably supports others but that's the one I got. The default controls are wonky and weird. So definitely rebind your keys.Pros:Quick, fun little dogfighting gamePretty good landscape/background/ground textures/graphics actuallyInteresting plane/ship modelsControls are fairly responsive once you rebind themPretty good arcade style physics, speed is keyJoystick supportUnlimited ammo, regenerative health Pretty ""diverse"" set of locations consideringCons:Graphics are obviously overall pretty dated but clearly some love was put into them. (Not a biggie)Voice acting was pretty ""bad."" But didn't bother meHorrible default keybindings (especially for joystick)No graphical/audio options. Though any computer post 2008 can run the game but still. Would have liked to downsampled the game to get rid of the little bit of aliasing here and there.Few UI issues here and there, no biggieNo ECM/Chaff to help with avoiding lock on missiles, must dodgeOnly 6 missions. I want MORE and I'm only halfway through itOverall: I'd say grab the game (even at normal price, $2.99) if you're into quick, fun, indie games that had some effort put into them, are updated, and aren't blatant cash grabs. Which this is NOT. Or if you enjoy dogfighting games. Let me be clear, this isn't an Ace Combat game, it isn't a AAA game, it doesn't have much of a story, or really a top knotch anything. BUT if you just want to have some quick dogfighting fun in fairly large aerial battles pick this up, help a small time developer who isn't all that bad. I'm only the second mission but really wanted to review thiis because I was actually pretty impressed considering. I didn't go in with high expectations and am pleasently surprised ""SO FAR.""Pick it up. You spend more on a cup of Joe. "

												Ehh. It's an interesting concept, but not terribly well executed. There's only the one ship, and as far as I can tell only the one strategy of missile spamming for dealing with fighter swarms. The 6 missions are done in under an hour. Voice Acting is annoying (just random phrases from a small pool). Biggest problem in the end game is that you have black cross hairs against a dark background.			"

												Its a good game...but needs a LOT of improvement. Let me go through the pros and cons:Pro's:fun gameplayaction packedgood-but short- missionsdecent graphics-runs very well on a low level laptop or pc...i would know...Con'sThe 'ground' is nothing but a flat texturesmall unit variety-both of friendly and hostile units  (3 friendly types of ship-fighter, cruiser and heavy cruiser, 4 hostile ship types-Heavy cruiser, cruiser, fighter and bomber)up/down controls are inverted by default and cannot be changed (to my knowledge)missions are too shortcampaign...is WAY to short, consisting of only 8 missionslittle/no story missiles occasionally phase through enemy shipsbug where if you swap from minigun to missiles while firing, missiles fire, but minigun firing sound is still active.enemy fighters only use missiles to attack you and friendliesenemy bombers literally have NO defence against you and rely solidly on their fighter cover...which have a hard time shooting down a single alied fighterBasically, well made game, and has the potential to become amazing, but needs a LOT of work to reach it's full potential. To any that read this, I'd reccomend it. If the developers read it and are still working on it, youve done well-extremely well, but please add more!  Thats all I have to say for now, sooo erm....bye			"

Only major minuses were the cutscenes and especially the voice-acting. For the price it is, I truly recommend it.I reviewed this game on video too:

Can't get enough of patient/understanding devs.Dev says price might be a little high for its content, perhaps the price'll get shaved?I think the price to content ratio is kinda good. 2/10.

The gameplay is sloppy and it's nearly impossible to hit your target. The voice acting and cutscenes look even worse than the actual game. And the game isn't really fun or appealing to me in any way. I don't often give full negative reviews because most games have a couple good things about them at least, but I don't see many good things about this one. It can probably run on a potato, that's my only positive for this game. 2/10			"

												I read about this game before buying it and it said that joystick support had been added although it did say basic it said similar to a Logitech Extreme Pro would work , because of that I bought it .The options screen allows you to assign the different axes unfortunately this has been written by people that cannot programme for joystick compatability in windows .This game needed to be able to detect up ,down, left ,right, throttle and rudder and they could not do that right.I can set 3 but not a 4 axis joystick that is poor , now you cannot use a controller I knew that , but what I did not expect is that if you have a controller like my Thrustmaster Warthog plugged in you cannot use just the keyboard either , leaving me the only option of uninstalling this game without even being able to complete the training missions so Beware you have been warned ....This game is a waste of money unless it is fixed  but keep checking to see if the ""developers"" ever finish their Windows programming course and fix what looks like a broken tablet port.I am certain there is a good game in there and I would love to be able to review the actual gameplay but I can not control my craft so what is the point ?

												This game is more of a demo than anything else. It seems to lack essential options such as flares and boosting, leaving you unable to get rid of missiles that have locked on. They will eventually gnaw away at your health (which regenerates slowly), your only hope is to destroy the enemy before you're down to your last hitpoint.The enemy isn't very difficult to defeat, there are simplya lot of them and aiming your weapons is somewhat difficult as there is no indication of a lock nor any indication of how much you have to lead your target.I couldn't really recommend this game. It's somethign you would expect to be open source so that people can improve upon it rather than milk it for what it isn't worth.			"

												The game its ok for its price and if you don't mind it being really short its worth a try, but the controls fell ok after changing an option here and there to suit your personal tastes but the battles are too plain, just complete one objective and you can ignore everything else, for destroying enemy planes you only have to use the tracking missile since the machine gun its a lot harder to use and doesn't seem to do anything and the missiles are infinite.My biggest problem with the game its that I can't have a feeling of distance in it and that really a problem when you have to attack flying giant ships or things on the groun and you can end in one crash and back to the start which isn't all that of a problem since the missions are really short.Its not a bad game its just too short but I would like to see more games from them in the future since it seems really promising			"

												Reasonably fun. It's less of a game and more of a tech demo as you only get 6 different scenarios to play. Albeit a tech demo with graphics from the late 90s. (seriously, Descent 2 had better graphics) The story is non-existant, other than a couple cutscenes before each scenario giving the context and goals for the scenario. The controls are a bit finicky with roll and pitch on the mouse and yaw and accelerate on the WAD keys (no break or slow). I would have preferred yaw and pitch on the mouse so that the mouse controls where the reticle moves. Finally, it's a 1.2 GB download, what IS all that stuff? It's certainly not graphics...All in all, worth a good hour or two of blowing stuff up. For $3, meh, though if you get it in a bundle (like me) or a steam sale for $1 or less, then sure, it might be worth it.  "

												This looks like it might be a fun game. Alas, it has trouble dealing with various kinds of controllers, and there is no setting to tell it to simply use one particular controller, or ignore them all and just use keyboard and mouse. Support will say to unplug unsupported controllers, but in fact many must have their drivers completely uninstalled, or the game continues to try to use them even with them unplugged. It's not worth the hassle to uninstall/reboot and reinstall/reboot for one particular game.The game needs a working settings screen to set which controls you'd like to use. It has the start of one, but it's largely dysfunctional, ignoring input from any but the one (virtual) controller it's fixated on, and with no way to tell it to just use mouse or whatever, the game remains unusable for any but the simplist of PC setups.

But in its current state, Air Gurardians just aint fun.			"

												this game is amazing in my opinion, i really like massive scale battles and this just has it haha, the only down side is that mission 1 is quite hard and there is only 5 missions but for a game with low budged and only costs 2 dolars its great!			"

												Bad controlls, the map is usless while trying to find your targets. Like it suppsoet to be in front of you but you dont see it while there is a red dot on the damn radar right in front of you. also the radar is 2D, no way to know if the target is above or below you. The ""plot"" is not really a plot (you start a normal patrol, a sec later you are beeing haild by unknown force, when things start to heat up while both you and the other force trying to figure out what to do, you loose communication, so what the first thing you do? thats right, you are ordered to kill them all). there are no physics in the game, up or down, its all the same, no air drag, no lift speed reduction, no dive attacking. voice act is horrible!2\10, a cheap game to get for your 8 y/o if you want him to get bored after a day at best...
