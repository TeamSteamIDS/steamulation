												This game is absolutely amazing.LDSP is easily one of the most fun co-op games my wife and I have ever played! Talk about exciting! It kind of reminds me of Star Trek mixed with PixelJunk Shooter. The Star Trek part is how you have to move your character from station to station to control different systems (weapons, sheilds, helm, cannon) and the PixelJunk Shooter part is pretty much everything else! If you're looking for a good co-op game, you've found it.Pros:+ Fantastically original aesthetic.+ Unique gameplay.+ Interesting enemies+ Very challenging, but doesn't feel unfair.+ Simple controls.Cons:-No online co-op. Doesn't really matter to me, but is sure to be a deal-breaker for some.			"

												Have someone you can play this game with? Girlfriend? Friend? Sibling? Pet? Hobo that loiters around your neighborhood? If you do, GET THIS GAME. Its amazing. There's also an AI companion for all you loners out there, so theres no excuse not to buy the game. Unless of course you can't afford the game, but hey if you need a little financial help, just rob your local bank or credit union. The reward is well worth the risk, plus if a policeman comes to your house with a warrant for your arrest: now you have someone to play your awesome new game with.     To be honest though its a really good game. Looks nice, its fun, and it runs well. Gameplay can run a little repeditive (just a tad, nothing bad), especially if you're playing by yourself, but new levels and bosses help keep it fresh.     Overall its a really good game. Definitely worth it.     8.5/10 -PBW			"

												Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is a space style action shooter with heavy co-op elements. The game was released on Steam and Xbox One in September 2015 by indie developer Asteroid Base.Whilst the game is focuses on the co-op element, the game can be played alone. You are in command of a space ship with a companion, in the single player this is a partly UI controlled pet, dog or cat, when playing co-op, the other player controls this character. The space ship has various seats that must be commanded in order for that part of the ship to be active, the seats consist of outer canons,  rotating gun, shields, maps and boosters; so that means only two parts of the ship can be active at one time. When playing single player, the UI controlled companion makes for a perfect rider of the ships weaponry as they can shoot targets even when you can't actually see them on the screen. I was quite happy to man the direction of the ship for the majority of the play through and just used the companion to switch between the more skill targeted seats. The actual aim in the game is to collect kidnapped space bunnies - these are spread out across the levels and some are not easy to find due to a fog of war feature also being included.  Whilst exploring and destroying other enemies, you will collect upgrades for your ships; these upgrades can be used on any of the ship's compartments, such as turning your canons into rail guns, or upgrading your ships boosters to go even faster.Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime has a really neat graphic style - the neon art really shines through and actually fits in well with the gameplay. The bosses in this game look awesome; they look like something a child would drawer but have a real mature look about them. There isn't any voice acting though which I thought is a real shame given that there is a fair amount of text to be read. The soundtrack is stellar, and all of the sound effects are nice too. There are two levels of difficulties, easy and medium. I actually found the medium level to be really intensive, and actually had to drop the difficulty down on some of the levels - it's nice to see a game have challenging gameplay. This game takes a huge amount of skill to master it properly.  Every level in Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is randomly generated; meaning no play through is ever the same. There are four chapters, and each chapter consists of four levels with a boss fight at the end. All of the regular levels have the same aim as noted above, collecting the space bunnies/frogs/ducks and foxes.I finished the game in just under four hours; so it is fairly short, but it has the added bonus of having the local multiplayer option which is absolutely huge - this ramps the replay ability up tenfold for me, given that all of the maps are randomly generated, you can play this game for hours on end with a buddy on the couch.  Technically, this is a sound game; I was able to play on 4K resolutions, with in game options too.  A controller is recommended to play though; whilst keyboard and mouse is viable, you will definitely get more out of using a controller as the analogue stick makes a big difference when controlling the ship. The game does offer a fairly expansive tutorial too; and this gets you to grips with the controls very easily as it guides you through everything step by step. In conclusion; Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is a top notch title; a really fantastic art style and with an innovative take on the co-op controls of a ship, this is special game. If you only plan on playing this game on your own, you may find the price tag of £10,99 to be a little much, but if you are going to be playing it on co-op with friends, then you are going to get more than your money’s worth out of this game. This is certainly a game to keep installed even after completing it!

												I loved this game from the moment I saw it years ago, but playing the full fleshed out version is even better. The best way to play is with a friend because of the constant need to shuffle around the different stations. Despite its adorable art style the game can be surprisingly difficult, and I often found myself finishing levels by the skin of my teeth. You can cruise a bit in early levels, but if you don't pay attention you can quickly find yourself on the way to exploding.The single player is good too because you get to command an AI cat or dog! The AI does a good job of killing enemies, manning the shields etc. The only limitation is that they can't drive which is understandable since it would take additional commands to tell the pet where to steer towards.The new levels also are always adding new mechanics which mix up the formula and keeps things from getting stale. Water planets, ice planets, enemies that can only be defeated by ricochet-ing shots from a star etc. And also unique boss battles for each section.There's a nice progression system of upgrades where by saving more bunnies (or frogs) you get more points towards upgrades that unlock stations that can fit more gems to modify your weapons and eventually unlock ships with different layouts. I feel bad for leaving any of the space bunnies behind so I'll definitely be trying to go back to save more of them in future playthroughs. Unique premise, lovely art style, and really kickass soundtrack. One of the most unique games you'll play, highly recommended!			"

												LiaDS is a very cool game. You are on a mission to restore love to the galaxy in your spaceship, with either one player and an AI helper, or local co-op. It has a pretty unique gimmick, in that you must move your characters from station to station in order to control parts of the ship you're flying. What this means in practice is that most of the time one person will be flying the ship, while the other moves between the guns and the shields defending you. In special circumstances both players will have to man the defenses while the ship idles.The graphics are super cutesy, and they belie the absolutely punishing difficulty of this game. You'll need a competent second player to match the excellent performance of your AI pet, who zips between stations at your command and just kicks butt on the regular. But when things are in a groove and the chaos is all around you, the game is incredibly satisfying. And the good number of power-up combinations keeps things interesting. Just be prepared for the occasional frustration as the hordes of attackers wipe you out yet again.The unique mechanic of only being able to control one station at a time makes this game feel like a mix between FTL: Faster Than Light and a shoot-em-up. It's honestly inspiring to see such an innovative gameplay concept these days, when it sometimes feels like all the genres possible have been conceived already. Which is to say, I can see this as the foundation of a new genre, much like Minecraft single-handedly brough the crafting genre into existence. It's that good. I found it intriguing enough that I bought it at only a small discount, which is incredibly rare for me.EDIT: Having played this game a few more hours, my estimation of it continues to increase. Rather than getting stale, it's becoming more entertaining the deeper I go. The power up combinations hold some amazing surprises, the music is fantastic, and the game is so well put together and so polished, it's like the distilled essence of joy to play it. I'm willing to call it the best game of the year right now.			"

												Completed this game with my partner. Haven't played this on my own. tl;dr two people in a hard-to-control spaceship collect friends and defeat bosses in 2D generated galaxies, pew pew, yay, love is returned! *squeaky noise here*With two people, it's one of the best couch co-op games I've played on PC, and is very true to the 'co-operative' label. It requires good teamwork, constant communication and occasionally a bit of yelling at each other. The horrifically twee 'storyline' (if I read the word ""love"" one more time, I might hit someone), very cutesy art style and that little dance thing that happens whenever your characters pass each other can help lighten things a bit when it gets a more tense. I haven't seen another game quite like it.That said, this isn't a game either of us would play again. There's just enough variety in the game for one playthrough, but probably not more, not with the same person. It was worth the purchase just to try it out though, and I do recommend it. When the four-player comes out, we'll be playing it again with friends. Could be the best/worst double date ever. One last thing:  I say controllers are required. We started out sharing my keyboard and I just couldn't get used the controls.			"

												Lovin' it !!I enjoyed my first try as a single-player but then I thought it would maybe be better to experience the game with some friend. I had a Couch Co-op session with a buddy yesterday and it was amazing, we failed a few times but it was hours of crazy fun. Considering I only have about 4-5 hours in..The Music is entertaining and varies on each level so far.The Action is well paced and it's really fun to split up responsibilities thru team-work.I do think the game is better thru a Co-op experience, kinda sad there's no online experience but a mic would be essential at that point to be on par with local co-op, it does require coordination.The Game offers a good replay value with the different upgrade combinations you can apply to your ship, different configs bring different play-styles and I love the originality of that mechanic.It has a Millenium Falcon feel, a Chewy and Han Solo duo working together thru their adventure.If you enjoy Couch Co-op games, like light techno music and the kind of art-style you see here.. this is a MUST for you !! If you can catch this on sale it's a no-brainer for me.. totally recommended.			"

												Lovers in Dangerous Spacetime:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  The power of the Ardor Reactor brings stability and happiness to the galaxy. Love is the flavour of everyday…. Interplanetary peace and love, should we say! Unfortunately, an error in the matrix (in the Ardor Reactor) has damaged the reactor. An explosion occurred and as a result it split in four pieces. But this is the least of your predicaments; the fault allowed the dark forces of Anti-Love to breakout and spread through the galaxy. Your goal is to recover the four pieces of the reactor to save the galaxy.  Lovers in Dangerous Spacetime is a local co-op game setup in a space environment.  You and your AI companion (or a friend in local co-op) will be in command of a circular spaceship prototype to save the galaxy. The vessel has eight stations, four guns (north, south, east and west), one shield, one scanner, one super weapon and one engine station. All can be upgraded by collecting gems and you could end up with an interesting combination of weapons, from lasers to missiles or even a giant flail - how cool is that? You will have several missions per sector and will have to save a minimum of five folks (bunnies or frogs) to unlock the escape portal to finish your assignment. You will face a good mixture of enemies (including bosses) in well-designed levels. Also, every time you start a new campaign, levels will randomly generate themselves which adds so much in terms of replay ability. I would strongly recommend using a gamepad for this game as the keyboard setup is actually not the way to go. The game runs brilliantly and the artwork is cute.Positives:~~~~~~~~ -	Great co-op game-	Challenging-	Good artwork-	Achievements-	Trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~ -	Does not have online co-opAn incredible local co-op game! Fun, challenging and well executed. STOP READING… GO AND PLAY IT!!9/10 Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

												My girlfriend and I are always on the hunt for good co-op games. They are so few and far between that I actually created 2 gaming stations 90 degrees off each other each with its own console and projector so we could play ""online"" together in the same room. Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime was a fantastic antidote to that solution. When you want to play co-op nothing beats being on the same (non-split) screen. This had that. The gameplay is really fun. Challenging not only in terms of enemies, but also the mechanics of play (really cleverly twisted as you go) and the gem combo system is really fun and allows the player to really feel out how they best want to interact with the game. Cannot recommend this game enough!Oh and it's SUPER cute too!			"

												Lovers is a fantastic (local-only) coop experience and maybe my favorite couples game on steam. The gameplay is solid, the art is splendid, and the story is enjoyable fluff. And here, you actually need your partner. Even when this means certain doom, it makes for a better experience. The early levels don't expect too much and are great for easing in a partner relatively new to games, but later on (especially the last campaign or two) you may want to switch to easy. Easy mode may still almost guarantee a win in those later campaigns, but it won't ruin the sense of accomplishment through cooperation. If you are playing with someone that doesn't play games quite as much, you may find yourself more pigeonholed into certain roles (especially piloting and shielding), but you'll still find time to move about to the weapons systems. More importantly, you'll both be having fun. Single-player is fine enough, but it will feel a little lacking if you've played with someone else. That's not really a fault of the game, as the AI partner performs well (and better than anyone I played with). It's just not as compelling as having a human to work with (and around), someone who isn't there just to obey your whims.			"

												If you're looking for a unique local co-op experience, Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime may be what you're looking for:With up to three friends (or alone with a remote controlled pet) you have to control the ship using multiple stations. The ship always has multiple weapon stations, an engine station, a shield station and one station for the Yamato cannon. Each station can be further enhanced with gems found during a run, which can change the way the station works entirely, adding to the experience.The key lies within coordinating who uses which station at which time and which upgrades to put where, in order to safely travel through the universe, defeat enemies and rescue your ""friends"".You can expect about 6-10h of pure co-op fun for one playthrough.

 Summary: Lovers in a Dangerous Space Time is definitely more enjoyable with a friend, as you both work back and forth to take advantage of the unique gameplay on segmented functionality regarding shields/navigation/firing. While the AI follows your orders rather well, the lack of him being able to navigate can lead to gameplay that has pacing problems in that case. The core firing and enemy variety does help the game rather well, and the aesthetic is rather nice without being in your face. Upgrade system is rather nice and interesting in the way it combines weapons. Basically, if you're looking for a local co-op experience to play with a friend in a shoot em up nature: this works rather well.  Gameplay Footage and Video Review:

 Lists: +: Local Co-Op sets up gameplay that reinforces communication with your partner and creates an environment to get the chat going rather well.  Like the upgrade system and the different combinations that can be created from it. Things like the laser mace are interesting in their combination.Aesthetic is nice without being too in your face with colors. The best laid back neon style I've seen in a while. Soundtrack is soothing, not too over the top and fits the game rather well. Good laid back feel.  Enemy variety works with different ways of having to deal with them.  AI is competent in firing, and in particular in using the shield against the right enemy at the time.-: Really would have done well to have online multiplayer. Again, sensitive to the amount of programming that it would take, but I really think it would have taken this game, which is obviously co-op focused, to the next level. Single player does lack in compared to local co-op experience due to the lack of AI being able to navigate, although understandable given the amount of work to program pathfinding would be.  Game can feel samey rather quickly. In particular, the game's pace is rather slow. Action players may find the game hard to get into.  "

YouTube™ Video: Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime - 60fps Gameplay & Review - A Sheepish Look At

			Genna plays Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime. A game where you and a real or AI friend pilot a ship, while running to different weapons to fend off enemies.		

The game shares a few similarities to FTL or Guns of Icarus, in the sense that you need to navigate from different parts of your ship in order to survive. Although, because you're only 2 crew members, it's much more intense.In singleplayer, you can tell your AI pet what to take control of. It's very competent and so can use anything but piloting the ship. You need to do that, however you're also free to let go of the wheel and command your shields, or turrets. In co-op, anyone can take control of anything. It's in 2 player mode that the game shines, in my opinion.Your main objective is to free the set amount of bunnies in each level. Once you've done that, the level exit will open. If you choose to stay and uncover the entire map, look for all possible upgrades and free all bunnies, then each level can take you between 15-30 minutes. On top of that, each time you start a new campaign, levels will be randomly generated, adding infinite replay value.The game becomes incredibly satisfying as you upgrade your ship. Different gems can be used to modify different parts of the ship. For example. putting a pink gem on you turret will make it a triple barreled machine gun. Putting a blue gem will turn it into a yo-yo like wrecking ball. Putting a pink gem on you shield will make it cover more of your ship. Putting a yellow gem will make it smaller, but deflect projectiles. You can even combine gems to create different powerups. As you rank up. you can also unlock different ships that have different attributes. It makes the game so much fun.The art style is incredibly cute, and the music is cool.Overall, I think this game is awesome! Give it a try			"

												Since I will be living away from my brother for some time, I decided to take up on the game and offer him the chance to finish a co-op playthrough. It would be nice to play some local co-op games before I leave, and Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime had given us a enjoyable experience.The first time we launched the game it was from my brother's Steam account, so we stopped halfway through the first cutscene to change to my account, which owns the game, just so I can get some trading cards and achievements.Both times we watched to first cutscene, my bother would always tell me that I'm gay. Maybe because it's called ""Lovers"" in a Dangerous Spacetime, but I had figured it was fine to play with my brother. The first boss we came across taught us that the game would be a ton more challenging that it seeemed. We had died an enless amount of times to that boss, because we lacked coordination. My brother, a true lover of the Souls franchise (I am one too), complained that the bosses were way too hard, and ""I'd rather finish our Kirito and Asuna builds in Dark Souls 2."" But I convinced him to keep trying, well, more like I forced him to.By the time we defeated the second boss, which was suprisingly easy, our coordination had improved signifigantly. We would man the turrents, the shields, and drive at the same time. Still, we often found ourselves rushing to the love portal at the end of the level with the tiniest skimp of health.In summary, the game has you and your friends working together in different roles to defeat the antilove monsters, and though this shared experience will reinforce relationships as well as build new ones. Of course, it is frustratingly dificult, but that just means you and your friends will feel more acomplished when you win. Don't be fooled by the title of the game, play it with your guy friends or gal friends. Heck, why not all of your friends in 4-player co-op? (assuming you only have four friends, which I totally feel ya). Very fun and frustrating local co-op. 8.5/10Oh, and by the way, we did play this on two player co-op normal mode.""Just restart the level until we get the last metal gem we need to wreck the boss with our rocket launchers! They do soooo much damage OPOP.""			"

												Most of the time in gaming you are the sole hero who never needs anybody else, you can take out armies, command legions, and single-handedly save the universe. In Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime, your skill to work, and cooperate with somebody is exactly what will be put to the test in this addictive and fun action game. You can only man one post aboard a vast adorable spaceship, either man the guns or take the helm and maneuver through enemies. It's this dynamic gameplay that makes the game so simple but challenging at the same time. There are times where you both have to man turrets, abadon combat and just use shields and run for it. All this takes quite a bit of coordination. To help you are Space gems, wonderful little items that give the ship great customization as they change the way weapons, shields, and the helm work. Add on to that randomized maps, unlockable content, adorable bunnies, a great artstyle, and you've got an amazing title. Single players need not dismay, as Lovers does have the option to bring a trusty space cat or dog. Keep in mind though that for maximum enjoyment of this game, playing with a friend is optimal. Just remember that relationships/friendships can be hard, add on to that your life depending on somebody else and things get dicey! Buyers beware this will put your heart to the test!I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

												How does a PC game in this day and age, specifically a co-op game, not offer multiplayer over internet? I was so incredibly excited to play this game with a friend of mine who has similar tastes in games because the co-op looks amazing. However since the game limits co-op to being on the same physical machine using controllers or one keyboard that won't happen. My friend has 3 kids and we play games from 10-12 at night after his kids are in bed. Why oh why not offer an online play option? Isn't the idea of 2 copies of the game being sold for 2 people to play appealing from a business standpoint?The lack of ability to play with a friend (unless they're physically next to me) is a big downer. However the game is still so incredibly fun it's worth the buy. Though to be fair realize that it's a single player title unless the other person is physically there with you.			"

												This is a great game for a small group of friends (2-4) and a good game for a solo player. This game requires communication and actual teamwork, which offer a nice contrast to other couch co-op games in which the players operatee, more or less, independently of each other.The variety of weapons make each play interesting and the various ships can add their own challenges to play. I recommend this game, even at full price, to everyone.			"

												This game is one of the best hidden gems on steam. It's a game about flying a spaceship and rescuing space critters, with every player manning a different station. For example, someone might be stearing, while another is on shields, and another on a turret. It's such a cool concept, and it's executed phenomenally well. Switching between stations is fast and easy, and all of the controls are simple and intuitive. The three difficulties encompass pretty much every playstyle there is; with easy being almost impossible to die in, normal being challenging but fair, and hard/veteran being hard enough that you're almost guaranteed to die a few times. The music in this game is incredible. This game would have been perfectly fine if there was some generic, relaxing ""space"" music in the background, but they decided to do more than that. Some of the tracks are reminiscent of Hotline Miami. Almost kind of odd considering how cutsy this game is, but it works and sounds great (look up ""ost Crystal C""). And the boss themes are intense and get the heart pounding (my favourite is ""Orion""). The graphics are beautiful to look at and everything animates extremely smooth. It can be eye candy in some parts. I should also mention that while this game is meant to be played with a friend or significant other, it's still fun to play the game by yourself. If played solo, you get an npc that you can tell to man different stations. The AI is good enough that you never get frustrated with it; it's honestly better than most real people I've played this with. In conclusion, this game is well worth the $15 asking price, and a steal when it goes on sale. So do yourself a favor and pick this up. You won't regret it! (probably)			"

												Very fun game to play with multiple people. Recommend you have 3-4 players, but 2 is fun too. Single player is also doable, but not nearly as fun. Takes about 20 hours to get all the achivements. Gamepad recomended. a bit short, but highly recomended to play. Very easy to pick up, so I'd recomend playing this with an SO, a double date, or random friends. The first few levels are beginner friendly with the last world getting pretty hard to rescue everyone in time. Communication and active playing is key! Also, I want to note that the animals you rescue are rabbits, frogs, foxes, and blue birds. I spent half the game joking with my friend that I was slippy toad, he was star fox, and his girlfriend was peppy hare, and when we relaized that the final animal we rescue is a blue bird, we lost it. *spoilers* the final boss has a huge face, and after you beat him, it turns into two eyeballs that attack you, just like star fox 64! Love the reference.			"

												A fantastically polished game.The mechanics in this game are fasinating, and in the hands of a lesser developer, small problems (like handling ladders) could ruin everything. But they pulled it off! Gameplay pretty frantic and requires good team play. Anytime things go badly, you only have yourself and not the controls to blame. Dual controllers are supported and work perfectly, but you'll need to get use to how aiming works which in the heat of battle _can_ become disorientating. But stick with it because it makes sense in the end.Levels are even a little random so replays are not a chore.The 2D vector graphics are beautiful and smoothly animated. And best of all, they're not montonusly neon like some games that try and do the same style.No bugs or glitchyness at all!This is seriously one of the best local co-op games I've ever played (yes, even next to Metal Slug).

												Awesome couch co-op game.  Playing with the wife and 7 y/o daughter, and we all can't get enough.  Lots of fun, lots of coordination, lots of stress (in a good way), and lots of laughter!  Playing it on 3 x360 wireless controllers on couch in big picture mode.  Simple to setup, no issues (thus far) and just good wholesome fun.  It gets challenging very quickly, but not overly frustrating.  We're also playing overcooked which we also like, but that does seem to get too stressful in a not so good way.  LDS just has a fun, happy vibe and just makes you smile.Definitely pick up if have friends and/or family to play with you.  I'm sure it's good solo, but it's really meant to be played with others.

												Great and highly recommended Couch Co-Op game for parties!At first glance you might think this game might be difficult to play. But in reality the concept and controls are easy and very fluid. The only difficult/crazy part is how well you can coordinate with your fellow players in order to control each subsystem effectively. As it will have you constantly scrambling from system to system the whole time in order to maneuver the ship and successful defend it from enemies. The great selection of difficulties feel to be tuned fairly well to suit whatever experience you wish to engage with your friends. May it be a more relaxed sit back experience to one that will have you on the edge of your seat screaming at each other. The choice is yours. The animation and art style is very well done for cinematics and gameplay. And honestly I don't think the trailers do a good job at really justifying how well it all comes together. So go watch a gameplay video on youtube for a better idea then what you see here.Highly recommended for gaming groups that like to get together in the same room. As it will be worth every cent once you get into it. Or if you are the sad lonely type. At least they programmed a alright AI buddy to assist. Even if its not the greatest at times. Though if you plan to play this by yourself. You might be a bit disappointed.			"

												It makes me sad to see people complaining about the lack of online multiplayer. There's so much more value in couch-coop, we obviously forgot how it feels like to play a game with someone dear to us, next to us. Much more fun than sporadically talking to somebody via headphone. But, maybe that's just me. Thumbs up for a game that hasn't forgotten about people who like to be physically in the same room, there's not many good games today on PC / Steam making local coop enjoyable, possible and actually purposeful. Loads of fun!			"

												This is my very first review on Steam, but it's significant because Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is the only game that I've really found that my wife (who also happens to be my best friend) and I have enjoyed working together in.  We have tried Marvel Lego Super Heroes, which is fun but slightly antisocial compared to this game which requires constant back-and-forth communication (sometimes very hectic too!). Due to the lack of online multiplayer built into this version of the game so far, I would highly recommend inviting a friend or ANY close person over just to give the 2-player potential of this game a shot.  I understand this isn't a possibility for everyone, so I can totally sympathize with those wanting online play.  I read in the official FAQ that there is only one programmer for the entire game, so the company as a whole had to pick their battles and at THIS stage, online multiplayer is out.  However that doesn't mean that they won't include it in the future, and it certainly shouldn't be a reason to grade the quality of this game down.  In the short time we've played (82 minutes as of this review), I've discovered areas in our communication that I hadenever noticed before due to the frantic nature of this game.  I realize there's a lot more to discover but already this has been a blast for us.  Besides Lovers'' necessity of communication, the vibrant colors and overall playful mood, the simple yet deep controls,  a great updgrade system, the real sense of challenge(hard but not too hard), and most of all FUN have made this a real gem in my Steam collection.

												BUY IT… it's worth every cent! This game is extraordinarily fun… but you should play it with four players in the same room if you truly want to enjoy all its flavour! It's truly a family (or good friends) game… and contrariwise to other games in which each one pulls his own way, this one demands absolute cooperation (and coordination) if the groups is to survive. I strongly recommend it, especially for parents to play it with their kids… but also for anyonw who wants to have fun with his friends. The Single Player + Space Pet is OK, as well as two-player games… but the real fun starts with three or, better yet, four players, all screaming and running about the ship to man the different stations! My congratulations to the developers… and just ONE suggestion: allow exchanging stones (for instance: two of one kind for one of another) between levels (or, if possible, within the levels).			"

On the downside: It really is better to play this game with a controller, and i would've liked to have an online co-op mode.tldr; if your seeking a couch co-op look no further, but make sure you have controllers for the best experience.

												If like me, you've always wanted a game where you and a few friends are the crew of a starship on a harrowing adventure, then this just might be the game for you. In a nutshell, Lovers is a space action game where 1-4 players share the task of running a small spaceship. Your tiny characters run and jump from room to room to man weapon turrets, direct shields, activate special weapons and pilot your space jalopy. If you've played FTL, that will give you a rough idea of how the ship is layed out. As you thrust around the 2D enviorments dodging space rocks and blasting a menagerie of baddies your main goal is to rescue imprisoned space bunnies who annoyingly scream when you get near them. Once you've located and freed enough of them the exit will open and you can blast your way to the next level. It's a simple formula that stays fresh for a few reasons: Firstly, each module on your ship can be augmented with a gem that changes it's function. For instance a metal gem, turns your gun turret into a tethered spike ball that you launch at enemies and retract. A beam gem placed in your shield generator allows you to deflect enemy projectiles back at them, etc. With upgrades you can add 2 gems to each module for even more varied abilities. Secondly, the enviorments in each level provide just enough in new obstacles to keep from getting stale. A water level might have a rushing current that carries you around a level while sinister pods sticking to the walls will burst unleashing a group of small enemies upon you if you get to close. Lastly, the games core gameplay co-op spaceship action, is simple, fun, frantic and challenging enough that it will keep you and your friends engaged for a long time.On the minus side, playing with 3-4 people is the ideal number and any less can become frustrating as you will constantly need to run all over your ship. With only 1 or 2 people this means one of your important ship systems will be unmanned, leaving you vulnerable in one way or another in dire situations. For instance, there are several cases where enemies will frantically swarm you and the best course of action is to jet away while your buddies shield to fend them off and blast a trail for you with a weapon turret. With out the manpower to cover all your systems it can be very difficult to survive in these situations. In single player you are given a competent AI partner and you have the option of lowering the difficulty, but the problem still persists. And to compound this problem is the glaring omission of online play. While playing Lovers with a room of friends is a great experience that we don't get enough of these days, the convenience of online play should not have been ignored and would still provide a great co-op experience.Despite these issues. Lovers manages to provide a unique, charming and visually striking space adventure like no other. As a single player experience it's still an enjoyable game. However, if you have the means to play with 3-4 people, this is when Lovers really shines.8.5/10			"

I bought myself a controller, and invited over some friends, and despite only logging a single hour, it was the most fun I've had playing a game in quite some time.

												We've finished the game and my wife loved it. It's great for local co-op, it's very enjoyable, thematic, and the production quality is very high. It has several levels of difficulty, which means we can set a low one intended for non-gamers and still enjoy the game. The game keeps the environment fresh and the ship upgrades are very interesting, which drives you forward.The small downsides I noticed are somewhat lacking music (nothing memorable, just background sounds), some technical issues (alt+tab doesn't work because the mouse is kept stuck in the center of the screen, controls setup is difficult and doesn't seem to work properly every time), and also lack of player setup customization (the primary player is always the one with gamepad, and also the colors are fixed even though we'd like them swapped).

												LOVERS IN A DANGEROUS SPACETIME is one of the rare occasions I directly bought a game after seeing the trailer. And it was totally worth its full price!This game has an amazingly imaginative art style that I haven't seen in any other 2D game before. Somehow Asteroid Base have managed to design something that looks cute, sharp, vibrant and colourful, yet doesn't feel childish or cringeworthy.This is without a doubt one of the best coop-games I have ever played. Especially because it allows you to have lots of fun right from the start. Unlike some other games, where it only really opens up if you reached a certain level or got a particular upgrade.My only complaint from the 3 hours I have played thus far is that the upgrade system can be a bit unclear at times. Why is it that I lose my upgrades between worlds? I suppose this is because of balance reasons, but this isn't communicated to the player in any way.			"

Positives:+Unique game concept with Local Co-Op for up to 4 players (game controllers make this a lot easier)+Gameplay that's challenging enough to remain interesting and encourage teamwork+Compelling ship upgrade system that makes it really exciting to find new treasureNegatives:-Some ship upgrades are noticeably less useful or fun than others, fortunately you can redistribute some ship upgrades as you go-The ship's mapping/navigation system feels clunky. If one player wants to look at the map it pauses the action for the whole teamOverall:Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is a top-tier choice if you're looking for something to play during an extended hangout with friends or family. It has a simple premise to draw players in, but enough depth to really feel rewarding.			"

												I've seen a preview of this game years ago. When I found out it's finally coming out I couldn't wait. I bought it on release without thinking.Oh man, did this game DELIVER.I love coop games and this is pretty much the pinnacle of what I've seen. It is currently my No. 1 favourite coop game of all time. It dethroned Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light and that's quite an achivement in my book.Most games have tacked-on coop modes that many times just don't work. This a true coop experience and everything is built around it. You can play solo but it's rather boring since you'll be flying the ship 90% of the time while an AI partner will do most of the more interesting stuff (like shooting !). I also didn't play 3 or 4-player coop so I can't tell how good that is. The core 2 player experience is insane though.The game is so action packed you'll forget you had real-life stuff to do. Every level is a constant scramble to man the necessary stations. It's almost like there's not enough people on your ship, but that's what makes it so fun to pull off. You need to fly the ship, angle the shields and shoot 4 guns all at the same time and enemies just keep on coming.There's a surprising amount of variation on subsystem upgrades (guns, shields etc.) and you can tweak your ship to fit your playstyle.Levels are semi-randomized. You get the same opponents and similar obstacles but the layout changes. It's not the level of some other games but enough to keep the levels from becoming a chore to repeat if you fail.Each campaing has a different theme and ends in a pretty cool and challenging boss fight. Each level also has a different twist on the theme.There's 3 different ships (2 unlock later) plus the one you start with gets a few upgrated versions later on. One of the other ships is kind of weird and not everybody will be able to play it though. I don't wanna spoil here but is a little mind bending. Makes some people dizzy. I'd kind of like some more ships but it's not that big of a deal.It is local coop only and many people complain about it. It's understandable and a valid point but I would like to add that I feel like this game would not be that fun if you weren't sitting next to your partner. Online coop is great - but it's not the same.So if you have somebody to play with I'd HIGHLY RECOMMEND buying this. Worth every penny.			"

A Co-Op Action Space Shooter

+ Very unique gameplay that is surprisingly fun. You have a sphere spacehsip which has a number of different modules including turrets, shields, driving, and so fourth. You can only command 1 of these modules at a time, so you quickly have to move between each one in order to defend different sides of the ship.+ Visually the game looks great with bright neon colors and very clean yet detailed graphics. The particle effects, bullets, and so fourth also look fantastic.+ Cute lovable story about Love and Anti-Love with very cute animal characters and lots of hearts.+ Many weapon combinations created through ""gems"" which you can combine to create new and creative weapons.+ The boss fights are pretty epic in scale, are a load of fun, and can be quite challenging at times+ 1-4 Co-Op, if you have 4 players to play this game with you, you will have an absolute BLAST although the game is perfectly playable solo as you are given an AI companion.+ Amazing soundtrack- Your AI companion can be a little ""dumb"" at times. I often found that it had a difficult time commanding the shields especially when there was two enemies on the screen.- No online multiplayer... The gameplay itself can be a bit frustrating and overwhelming at times if playing solo especially when being attacked from multiple different sides at once. I think the best way to play is with 3-4 players, however this is tough to do on PC.			"

												This game is AMAZING! It's friendship destroying enough to make it difficult, but cooperative enough to make it fun. I've played the whole game through with 4 players and it was really fun from a moment to moment gameplay standpoint and also a planning standpoint, trying to decide where to go in the procedurally generated levels. Each boss was tense and each level added something new to think about. The controls to move around the ship is a bit fiddly, but if you own a PC and 3 friends, BUY THIS IMMEDIATELY!			"

												I picked this up on sale because it was so cute, and had tons of positive reviews. I bought myself a controller, and invited over some friends, and despite only logging a single hour, it was the most fun I've had playing a game in quite some time. It's deceptively simple, but to get multiple people working together is the real challenge, worth every penny, full price or on sale, so buy it and grab some friends!!!			"

												Very simple, yet very satisfying!You control a character each, in a circular ship, with 1 computer to control the shield, another for the engine, one for each weapon, and one for your panic button Yamato Gun.You play a story mode with 4 campigns, with 4 stages each + 1 boss stage. My game time is what it took for my wife and I to finish the game in 1 playtrough.The thing I found most fun about the game is collecting gems. You can find metal, energy and power gems to upgrade your ship's systems, and even add 2 of those together in later levels to mix even more possibilities!If you have someone to play with you, get this game! :)			"

Local couch co-op with you and a friend, frantically running from one system in the ship to another to deal with the different threats.You can upgrade your ship and make choices on how to do so with your limited drops.Challenge picks up quite high, so prepare for some turbulence as it may test your relations!

												Summary: A TRUE co-operative experience that's rarely seen. Like another great example, ""Overcooked"", this game has perfectly captured the essence of co-operative play, and player co-ordination through strong communication. Unlike most ""co-op"" games, trying to go it alone, or trying to ""be the best guy"" doesn't fly here. You'll work together, running around a ship, controlling turrets, shields, lasers, and guiding the ship through hazardous space. It's a LOT of fun, and I would say a must buy for local couch co-op. Pros:+ Designed around co-operative play+ Co-op Campaign+ The ""lone wolf"" mentality is rightly the worst choice, as should be the case in a good co-op experience (see Overcooked as another great example of this)+ Quick to learn+ Encourages participation from gamers of a variety of skill levels+ Encourages strong communication between players+ The screen is tidy, and everything sized just right to lend to visual clarity+ Up to 4 players can play at once+ Couch co-op, Steam link works great, and has great controller supportCons:- Not much... the players who like to be ""winning"" will be sadly disappointed, but that makes me VERY happy- Online co-op not supported (I prefer couch co-op, but I ca see this being a drawback for some)			"

												An absolute joy to play! LiaDS is a fantasticly intuitive and engaging take on the ""Local Multiplayer,"" game genre. So much, that the game is infinitely more rewarding with more friends to play. By that token, buys beware: it is highly recommended you bring additional passengers for this ride!Great presentation and audio make this an endearing package, with gameplay that is simple to understand, but hard to master as the levels progress. It is evident that an enormous amount of effort was invested into LiaDS, a sediment which is echoed by excellent aethestics, difficulty progression, and engaging gameplay.A few gripes do not escape this game from a hearty recommendation. Gamers who are wishing for a forgiving game will be marginally dissapointed, as after a couple hours of gameplay, the level of challenge ramps up significantly. Game levels become long, and trecherous. A misfired cannon, or an unmanned engine can potentionally lead to demise; a loss of 20-30 minutes of gameplay to restart the level.By inverse, the game is rewarding. If you can progress in the game with enough skill and determination, you are rewarded with more gadgets and enemys to test the might of your friends and yourself. If you are interested in a well-constructed, engaging, and fun local multiplayer game, look no further. Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is a voyage your friends will be begging you to embark on again, and again!			"

												This game is great, the art style, music, and gameplay is very fun and unique.  I highly recommend this game to anyone that has a friend to play with locally.  For singleplayer though, I suggest you look elsewhere.  I suggest you watch some reviews first before making this purchase.From a singleplayer perspective, the gameplay does not flow smoothly; it feels very ""stuttery"".  There is quite a bit of micromanaging in this game, during battles you:  command pet to a position, move your ship, move your shields, hop onto a turret to shoot a bit, and then repeat.  Throughout the fight you're not feeling engaged in the combat, it's more about moving around so you don't get hit and let your pet do the shooting.  Overall it is just not fun, well to me anyways, to just move a ship around and not being involved in the combat while the A.I. does everything else.If this were just a singleplayer game only, this game would get a ""thumbs down"", but since there is local co-op and everything about this game is very unique from art style to (co-op) gameplay, this will get ""thumbs up"".

												Amazing co-op game for a group of up to four. Watching the trailers, I knew I'd like the co-operative gameplay, but I was afraid it would be too visually confusing. Playing the game, my fears were unfounded. The visual style isn't just cutesy, it's very well thought through, down to little touches like the ship counter-rotating slightly when you move the engines. The design works really well, and the UI doesn't get in the way.I've only tried it in a team of four, all with controllers, and it was well-balanced for that; I'm not sure if it compensates you when you have fewer players. Normal difficulty is hard enough to be fun but not stressful or scary.			"

There is literally nothing better than screaming at your friend (or soon-to-be ex-friend) to man the bottom turret while you race between the thrusters and shields.I've been on the hunt for solid co-op games for a long time now, and I want to play this one forever.Local co-op only (for now?), so you'll have to make (or break) your friendships in person :)			"

												Excellent couch co-op game. It will test your coordination skills, and the neon-cute style fits perfectly. The first few levels are straightforward but the difficulty ramps up. There are two unlockable special ships that add replay value by forcing you to change your playstyle. One separates the ship into two halves that can each only hold one person, and the other makes the ship roll around you as move.			"

												A great local co-op game that can also be played as a one player game.  A fun sense of humour and a kid-friendly stlye make this an awesome game to play with friends or with your kids! Bonus points for gorgeous art and the ability to upgrade your ship on the fly.			"

												Great local co-op game that really brings a group together.  We weren't sure if we'd like the game when we first saw it, but after a couple of hours of playing we're loving it!  We had a 4-player game going with people from all skill levels and it really felt like we were all achieving something together.Highly recommended			"

												Excellent 2-player co op game, especially for couples. This game clearly had a lot of thought and effort put into ensuring that it was challenging without being too frustrating. It's quite replayable after you first beat all the stages, and each level is randomly generated so you won't just get bored seeing the same level layouts over and over. This is one of our favorite local multiplayer games, next to Dynasty Warriors 8, Sonic All Stars Racing Transformed, and Duck Game.			"

												What can I say about Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime? It is a weird game but I had a blast with it.Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is one of the best couch co-op games that I have played recently. While you can play the game single player, I would recommend against it since it is such a great multiplayer game. Unfortunately the game doesn't have an online mode at this time so you will need to play the game locally.What makes Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime such a great co-op game is that you need to work together in order to be successful. Your ship has many different stations and since you can only control one station at a time you need to work with your teammate in order to avoid destruction. The battles in particular can be really enjoyable as you are running all over your ship to get into a different station in order to destroy your enemies. The game has a couple small issues mostly revolving around sometimes having to spend too much time exploring, but they don't really hurt the experience. If you really like co-op games and the concept sounds at least somewhat interesting to you, I think you would really enjoy Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime.Note: I received a free review copy of the game.

Game was a lot of fun, it was rly playable and acctualy required decent teamwork to complete on normal level. I would definitely recomend it ! :)			"

												Very unique and fun coop game. My wife and I beat the game all the way through sharing a keyboard. The difficulty curve kept things fun, but never made it too frustrating. Highest difficulty did have some very tough levels that caused us to stop playing for a while, but once they introduced 4-player coop, we started playing with a a couple more friends and found the highest difficulty more enjoyable.

												Game is a pleasure for the eyes and ears. I'm playing with a son age 7 on two xbox 360 controllers. I see a lot of complains about the absence of online co-op. Ofcourse online co-op would be an awesome addition. I understand that not everyone has an option to play local co-op, but if you do, it is so much fun manouvering the ship and shouting commands to control certain gun or shield. The thing i'm trying to say is that i'm pretty pleased with only local co-op. Son went to bed today saying he can't wait to wake up tomorrow and play some more, that's a nice sign for me that the game is really good.			"

												Super super fun local co-op game. You and a friend (you can do up to four people but it was mainly designed for two) are supposed to pilot a spaceship across various levels and fight various bosses, while each manning one of six or seven different vital operations in the ship. An enemy comes out of nowhere towards you from the left, do you have one person jump on the piloting seat to fly away while the other person fires a weapon? What about the shields? If you have one person on shields while another person fires, you're not going anywhere and can get ambushed! If you have one person on shields and the other person pilots the ship away, you're not doing damage and risk more enemies following you!It's managing chaos, so for some people that might be a blast, and for others it might not seem fun at all. I personally think its a blast, as long as you go in with a lighthearted attitude and don't take it too seriously. Games are supposed to be fun, not ruin friendships. Enjoy this crazy co-op adventure!			"

												This has been my most anticipated game since 2013, after having played it on the Fan Expo show floor, and the first game I've bought at full price and near release in over 3 years. It has not disappointed.Been playing it with a roommate with two controllers.Let me start this off immediately. It is not a game that would be nearly as good in online co-op. You are constantly yelling instructions to your lover and it's so fast that it just wouldn't be the same online. My lover and I insist on rescuing 10/5 friends, which winds up being incredibly hard to do as more enemies keep spawning later. It's not the easiest of games, and while there is a bit of a blame game that happens, we are never frustrated by a death, we had so much fun that we just take another stab at it.There are so many unique possibilities to play with for upgrades (more frantic yelling as I throw a metal gem at our turret with a beam gem to create a metal ball with lasers, while 3 turrets have not been upgraded), and the entire game feels unique that I'd call it must play if you have a player whom you can couch co-op with.

This game has so much to offer in terms of enemy types, customisation and hazards. AI is responsive and easy to command with gamepad controls. Punishing at times, but a good learning curve, and you have to keep moving. Lots of optional collectibles that actually help you improve.			"

												This is the most fun you and three of your geekiest platonic friends can have on a couch together.Faster Than Light + Artemis + overwhelming cuteness = Lovers in a Dangerous SpacetimeThe game's most glaring flaw is the lack of internet multiplayer.  If they would simply include internet play in an update, the game could sell for twice as much, and it would explode in popularity.  The couch co-op is a blast though, and Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is sure to be a go-to party game of mine, for years to come.85/100 (I'd give it 10 more, if there was internet play.)			"

												We played this game on our couch with gamepads. We both contributed a vital part to our ship's survival and the rescue of our (love rabbit citizens?) friends.  It required communication between two people who like the sound of eachother's voices and who appreciate one another's qualities. My SO and I are both gamers who prefer different  spectrums of genre and have different strengths in games because of that. This was no problem in this game. Don't get this game if you for instance have a lover in another state who you met on a hookup app who, you know, you can't call right now because they're like, super busy being a model on a yacht or something. Get this game for you and your SO, with gamepads, on a bigger monitor, next to eachother.  This game is a super funm redoable date.    "

												I got this as an alternative to my girlfriend and I usually playing Rocket League together. One of the best $10 I could spend during the Winter Sale. We played it for a solid hour and a half and didn't want to put it down. The aesthetics are pleasing, a good contrasting color palette set in space, with cute characters and badass weaponry.This is definitely a challenge and we joked about it being a test for relationships. This kind of is. You have to communicate well as you and your partner navigate levels in space, each portion of the ship has to be manually controlled (except for one cannon, you just press the button). Which makes for a pretty fun time as you and your partner get familiar with the placement of gunner positions and thuster or shield controls.			"

I have 4 controllers and thankfully 3 roomates who all like to game (casual through gamer).  Everyone found their favorite location and accompanying power up combinations. Then you just go to town on just about anything that moves. We finished the game in just under 20 hours and for the price, it was well worth the fun time we had playing it together. Lots of laughing and lots of communication. It was a blast and pleasure to experience this game, especially with my friends			"

												This game is a gem !Very cute, very fun and litteraly a wonder to play with friends !It's simple, easy to learn and the harder difficulty levels offer quite a challenge.You can upgrade your ship as you wish, using various combination and powerups and unlocking different ships layouts.Each level I've seen so far were different from one another, with their own particular settings and challenges.The game succeed in giving you the feeling that you're on a journey through various distant bits of space.Playing with friends is incredible ! Co-op is where this game really shines. It's good to mention that you and your friend(s) get to play side by side, using controllers or the same keyboard. Attempting to work as an efficient team, running between the various stations of the ship to counter every challenges with good timing, trying to synergize as best as you can with your friends, it feels great, especialy when you beat some tough boss or especialy difficult level.The different types of stations you can control requires different skills and offer different challenges. As a team you get to learn how to use everyone's skills in the most efficient way. As an exemple : I might not be good with turrets, I can still pilot the ship very well or use the shields to intercept as many projectiles as possible, making the ship much more resilient while my friends gun down everything. This make co-op interesting even with friends who are not aquainted with the game, as some stations are easier than others.Even if you don't play with friends, the game is still very fun. You can choose a lovely AI pet that you can order to switch stations at will. You'll end up being the pilot since it's almost the only thing the AI won't do, yet it will be a different challenge than co-op since you'll have to manage your pet between the turrets, shield and map while attempting to navigate through various threats.It's one of these rare games with a fun/price ratio where the amount of fun outweights the price by far !

Great enemy types, exploration is fun, and customization of your ships weapons and systems reveals fun and fantastic combinations.Would have loved a save-anywhere save game system (c'mon, it's 2016, there's no good reason we can't save anywhere in any game), but that's my only quibble.Great work...can't wait to see more from this developer.

												The game is very entertaining. Especially in co-op, then you really need to work together to complete the levels. The love theme and the cute characters are quirky and feels like something innovative for a shoot-em up game in outer space! I mean, your mission is to rescue the cute bunnies in space, strange but funny!Space is not black and dark, it is pink and fluffy!			"

												One of the best co-op couch games we've tried in quite a while. My kids and I really enjoyed this game, and couldn't get enough of trying different upgrade combinations. I haven't even tried playing it solo -- I'm not sure how that would work, since in co-op with three people the craziest part of the game is trying to share 5 or 7 positions in the ship between just 3 people...

												Well, the couch co-op is pretty nice.  It really doesn't cut it as a single player game.  Sadly, it lacks online co-op...It also realy needs controllers, without them you feel handicapped.My recomendation is very conditional, if you want to play a co-op, WITH someone who's actually present AND you have controllers, then its great.  The lack of online co-op makes it fairly useless for 90% of the time i want to play it, hence the lack of a recommend.			"

												The requirements for this game include substantially higher IQ than an average bloke would possess. The game itself, for all intents and purposes in one word: flawless. Only problems comes with the arduousness of advancing levels, cause the gameplay keeps getting interrupted by intense love making sessions. You can only save in between levels, so this becomes only downside the game has. The soundtrack is moderately erotic so consider having your minors out of the house or play sound turned down to last longer.			"

It requires good communication with the person you play with. It also has a good length of levels that once completed the game can be put down if tempers run too hot. Fun powerups and it allows really great mix and match of them to create some funny guns.

Best played with 2 people this amazing game is a natural contender for a 2015 'Game of the year' award. LOVERS IN A DANGEROUS SPACETIME is a frantic 1- or 2-player couch co-op action space shooter. Explore a colorful galaxy in a massive neon battleship that you control together by manning turrets, lasers, shields and thrusters. Only through teamwork can you triumph over the evil forces of Anti-Love, rescue kidnapped space-bunnies, and avoid a vacuumy demise. Deep space is a dangerous place, but you don’t have to face it alone! CO-OP GAMEPLAY 2 players (or 1 player plus a loyal AI space-pet) need to work together to man the different battle stations, dashing back and forth between weapons, shields and engines. Both players fill important roles at all times, and nobody gets left behind. UPGRADEABLE SHIPS Find and combine powerful space-gems to customize your ship's load-out. Each gem provides different abilities, letting you learn the right tools for every situation. A NEW EXPERIENCE EVERY TIME Randomized level layouts mean that both players will be exploring fresh areas every time you play. SIMPLE CONTROLS, DEEP CHALLENGE Controlling your spacenaut is so simple that anyone can jump in quickly, but getting both players to work together like a well-oiled machine, battling a galaxy of evil robots and constellations — that’s the tricky part. - Highly Recommended!

												I want to recommend this game. I really do. When I first saw it, my innocent little brain whirled at the possibilities and the wonderful times I could have with friends blowing up space aliens with lasers, laser flails, significantly slower firing lasers, and rockets, and most importantly, the power of love. But after the second world, the love begins to run a little thin, the enemies become slightly more samey, the gem combinations have become either worthless or colorless and the boss becomes significantly more rage inducing. If they add more worlds or more gems to play with, I would recommend this game, but right now? No.			"

												Very cute game ; great co-op concept that looks to have some real legs behind it.There are some real issues though. The control scheme is deeply byzantine. Someone with the keyboard can overide the controller, forcing you into a single player game if you remap any of the keys. The key choice themselves are unituitive. Jump/engage is left shift, breaking from space as jump that is a core gaming premise. Remapping causes the confusing player select options above. Another issue is the unskippable cinematics. I understand that the artists want their hard work to be seen, but when you restart a level, you are forced through them each time. This goes for the ""show you the level"" start as well. All cinematics should be skippable at anytime in a game. Great concept, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired at the moment. Heres hoping they can pull it up out of the UX nosedive.			"

												Well, this is the first game I have ever had to use the steam refunds system on.Perhaps in future I will re-buy the game if it has online co-op, or if I can get enough living space to move my SO in with me so we can enjoy this really fun looking game.Other than the no co-op in a co-op game, it has TERRIBLE keyboard controls and NO mouse support (even though the turret design and way you pilot the ship would suit a mouse SO WELL).The actual controls themselves make zero sense for a keyboard either, it basically treats WASD as the same as an analog stick, meaning pressing up makes the engine go up and stop at up, but pressing left means it stops half way around.I can tell the dev has zero experience with PC games and, am not sure why they didn't just use one of unity's in-built control schemes if they don't know what they are doing.It looks like an amazing experience, but not one worth bearing the iffy ai partner (yes it's awesome he's a cat, no it's not as awesome as my SO, who might also be a cat).Until mouse and keyboard support is added, or more importantly proper co-op, I cannot recommend this game, unfortunatly.

												I wish I could get into this game, but it is so very boring. I search for 2-4 player couch co-op games that use controllers, and this was right up that alley. However, I couldn't play for longer than a half hour before I was bored out of my mind. You'd think that the dynamic of having multiple control points in a ship with two little player dudes would be something really fun, but it is just not fun. Everything is slow, there's no real action. Except for bosses here and there, there's never really a sense of ""danger"" in the game. It's just a slow and cumbersome Super-Nintendo game (without the nostalgia). It's just not a $14.99 game to me. Maybe a $9.99 game that you could pick up on sale. It's polished, but so very boring.Best summed up analogy: This game provides about the same excitement as a conversation with Marvin, the Paranoid Android.			"

												When I saw this game and Overcooked alongside Battleblock Thearter during the Valentine's Day co-op sale, I thought ""Hey, I loved playing on BBT online and working with other people around the world, I bet these games will give me the same experience."" Then I played Overcooked and realized that it had no online co-op. I thought ""Wow, what a poor design choice, a local co-op game that I can only enjoy if I beg my friends to play isn't even worth the sale price. Surely this game will not make the same mistake!"" But they did. Shame on you developers, shame!Bonus fact, unlike BBT and even Overcooked, the game is co-op ONLY, so I literally had to go back into the game and wait afk for the 5 minutes of gameplay required to post this review. If you developers are going to lock me out of the game because I couldn't find anyone to play with, it's YOUR fault I couldn't actually give this game a fair chance!			"

												This game and seller is misleading like crazy. It's a shame cause the stunning graphics of the game caught me from the start and seeing some of my favorite streamers play it just encouraged me to play it however, when reading their descriptiona and reading ""Co-Op"" they meglect to mention that there is no online multiplayer. It makes no sense to buy a co op game with no online features. It's like getting Call of Duty or Counterstrike and once you pay for it they tell you ""Oh we are sorry, didn't you read that these awesome games are local op op only? we did have a tiny little disclaimer just so that it's not clear to you and we can snatch your money"". i've never written a review before and it's sad that this had to be my first soely cause I feel scammed. I demand a refund of this misleading game.			"

												THERE IS NO ONLINE MULTIPLAYER!!!! Only multiplayer with people actually physically at your house, so 1990s am I right? Shoulda read the fine print for this... atleast it was on sale at the time. Also, this game does not mention that you basically need a controller to play it, playing it on the computer is horrible, like absolute trash, the tutorial is hard when using a keyboard.			"

												A superb local co-op experience. The cutesy visuals exist seemingly at odds with a game that can be supremely challenging, tense, and difficult. Even on the ""Normal"" setting, this game can be punishing at times, depending on how well you and your partner play. That being said, I feel the difficulty made the earned moments of success that much more rewarding. This  game is a producer of much high-fiving, cursing, and all around good times.			"

												A wonderful and fresh take on co-op games. Reminds me faintly of Guns of Icarus in 2-D. Everytime someone says they haven't played it, I make sure they've given it a shot. Still have never had someone that doesn't enjoy the game. A couple downsides include no online co-op and a less-satisfying-than-multiplayer single player mode. While the lack of online co-op may turn some away, if there is anyone you enjoys any kind of co-op game, this is THE one to try.			"

It really feels like no stone is unturned, the programmer nailed every interaction, it was a huge surprise to see so many things ""just work"".Can't speak much for playing this solo but it's quite short, so try to find a friend if you can for co-op. You can do it in one 4-5hr sitting no probs.Just a simply wonderful game, I put this right up at Journey level tier.			"

												The team at Asteroid Base Inc. have absolutley outdone themselves. Just one look at the screen is all it takes to recognize ABI's articulate attention to detail. The heart melting & cutesy visual style of this game coupled with LiaDS's intense co-op experience keeps me coming back for more. At first glance this game may seem as though it could be short, however, the ever changing game dynamics you encounter within each solar system keeps the game fresh and challenging. Not only will the player encounter new obsticles and enemies, but the biomes in each universe provide new reasons to rethink your tacitcs, loadouts (power-ups), or even the ship you wish to spread the love with. Including the tutorial, there are 5 systems to venture through that each hold several levels, which once again may leave you with a feeling that there isn't enough. Though I'll challenge that notion by asserting that each level can take anywhere from 15 minutes to a half an hour or more. Having said that, the game also provides a challenging normal difficulty that leaves room for the players to improve upon their tactics and teamwork. I'm excited to feel the love on hard mode ._. 10 out of motherloving 10.			"

												Lovers in a dangerous spacetime is good. It's very good. ""2D guns of Icarus"" is something I've heard it being called. It's fairly accurate as you co-op your way through space piloting different parts of your spacecraft. The game is frantic, enemies at every angle and sometimes the game will throw a curveball and do something unexpected. The upgrade system is lovely and lends itself to experimentation.If you haven't played this game, there is no way you know could know how much more fun you would be having if you were.

If you have a PC with two controllers and someone to play with you, you owe it to yourself to buy this game right now.

												If you are looking for a great couch co-op game, especially since there have been a dearth of them lately, I highly recommend this game. I'm always on the lookout for good couch co-op and this fits the bill! Many co-op games don't seem to be built around that idea so they just feel like an afterthought and are a bit boring. This game does not feel that way! You'll have lots of fun yelling at your ""lover"" frantically trying to decide the best strategy. The game is essentially the platforming version of the tabletop game Space Alert. Strategy and skill is required to reach various stations that operate your ship such as weapons and thrust. The style is adorable and highly amusing; it is saccharine but tongue-in-cheek. I highly recommend this game.			"

Every mistake feels like your fault, nothing is because the game is broken or cheap. It feels very rewarding to complete a segment. Running from an expanding explosion is stressful in the most fun way. There is some good feeling of progression too as you unlock new ships, and upgrade your modules with gems of all sorts.I am a stingy person when it comes to buying games, but this is worth every single penny.

												The team at Asteroid Base Inc. have absolutley outdone themselves. Just one look at the screen is all it takes to recognize ABI's articulate attention to detail. The heart melting & cutesy visual style of this game coupled with LiaDS's intense co-op experience keeps me coming back for more. At first glance this game may seem as though it could be short, however, the ever changing game dynamics you encounter within each solar system keeps the game fresh and challenging. Not only will the player encounter new obsticles and enemies, but the biomes in each universe provide new reasons to rethink your tacitcs, loadouts (power-ups), or even the ship you wish to spread the love with. Including the tutorial, there are 5 systems to venture through that each hold several levels, which once again may leave you with a feeling that there isn't enough. Though I'll challenge that notion by asserting that each level can take anywhere from 15 minutes to a half an hour or more. Having said that, the game also provides a challenging normal difficulty that leaves room for the players to improve upon their tactics and teamwork. I'm excited to feel the love on hard mode ._. 10 out of motherloving 10.			"

												This is an outstanding co-op game.  So much thought and care went into this game, and it shows.  I just gotta gush about it.The core mechanic is executed so well, it's so fun and frantic to run around your ship and try to not die.The station upgrade mechanic is SO GOOD and it reminds me of Gunstar Heroes.  Being able to experiment with all the different gem combinations is super satisfying.It's HARD!  When you're deep in a massive asteroid, saving a bunch of space bunnies, and a super nova bomb suddenly appears before you?  It is incredibly tough, incredibly exhillerating.It is highly recommended to play with a controller and with a friend.  If you have both of these conditions, you gotta play it.			"

												Lovers in a dangerous spacetime is good. It's very good. ""2D guns of Icarus"" is something I've heard it being called. It's fairly accurate as you co-op your way through space piloting different parts of your spacecraft. The game is frantic, enemies at every angle and sometimes the game will throw a curveball and do something unexpected. The upgrade system is lovely and lends itself to experimentation.If you haven't played this game, there is no way you know could know how much more fun you would be having if you were. So go play Lovers in a dangerous spacetime.			"

												This is the best co op game that I've played in a very long time. Teamwork is mandatory and there is no correct way to approach levels. The upgrade system keeps things fresh for several hours, since each of the ship's systems can be upgraded with different combinations of gems.I appreciate that the levels are randomly generated, but I'm not sure what to do after I beat the campaign. I'm on pace to complete the game in ~5 hours total. To me, infinite replay would come with an FTL style galactic conquest with some randomness to the bosses. The levels are already very well generated, and I would love a sort of rogue-lite perma-death randomly generated campaign. That would definitely keep me coming back, since I don't know what the incentive would be to beat the campaign for a second time.The only reason I'm harping on the replayability is because I enjoy the game so much that I want to see more game modes that will give me a reason to play it for 100+ hours.

												Fun and exciting!  The game stays quite fast paced and hectic, especially with you an your bud running up and down, left and right, trying to man the many stations all the time.  It makes even casual fights be pretty entertaining.  But, what really makes this game is the environmental hazards that force you to face enemies in increasingly uncomfortable situations.  If you attempt to focus one problem at a time, you'll eventually find that another issue will grow overwhelming.The variety of the enemies grows quickly, but settles mid way through and many of the enemies will be similar to ones faced in the last campaign with only mild difference in tactics.  But, what always breathes new life into each level is the ever changing threats in the environment, as well as the wild boss battles.  That is always fresh, and quite exciting.I'd also recommend HEAVILY bringing a gamepad as much of the controls are not only awkward to pull off with the keyboard, but cramped if you're playing with another person on the same board.

Still have never had someone that doesn't enjoy the game. A couple downsides include no online co-op and a less-satisfying-than-multiplayer single player mode. While the lack of online co-op may turn some away, if there is anyone you enjoys any kind of co-op game, this is THE one to try.			"

												Ridiculous, over-the-top nonsense, the best way possible.  My partner and I have been playing this non-stop after work for the past few days; Most fun I've had on a couch co-op since I can't remember when.My only regret about this purchase is that there isn't more of it.  Took us 9ish hours to beat on casual, which actually wound up being a solid difficulty curve right through to the last boss.  Not complaining, mind you, this game was worth every penny.  If any of the devs/designers are reading this, I'd definitely be interested in more levels (please!)			"

												Five Word Review: Fine couch coop, a treat!Favorite Thing: Unique and enjoyable game mechanic, playable by novices (just don't let them drive!)+ There's not much story here so it all comes down to the fabulous gameplay.+ Can get a bit hairy at times, in a good way.+ Yamato!- A lot of the combinations on the main guns weren't very useful.Playtime: 10hEnjoyment: 9/10			"

												Brilliant. to those of you who understand the struggle of looking for games to play with your girlfriend, look no further. approachable, colorful, and entertaining. Don't let the colorful and cartoony facade fool you though- this game has plenty of meat on its bones for those of you who like FTL but wished for a co-op version. Look no further. My solitary serious complaint is that the controls can be annoying. I think alternative control schemes might be called for. All in all, if you have watched the trailer and think it looks like the kind of thing you'd enjoy, then you won't be dissapointed. I recommend it.			"

We like space/shooter games and it has the bonus of being funny&cute.One of the best things are the leveling and unlocks. Knowing that each time we work hard to rescue all the lil buddies we get extra points and rank so we can unlock better upgrades and even ships is just awesome.I'd totally recommend it if you have someone to play localy with. If you do go get it, you won't regret it. Also beware the freaking bombs. omg the freaking bombs........			"

												Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is a great deal of fun for almost any player, whether they play a lot of games or not, and it's easy to jump into and enjoy a silly adventure, which makes for great 4-player fun.

												We found this a very cute and fun, if choatic and stressful, game.  The basic premise is simple; you have two players operating a space ship that needs more than two people to run properly, so you end up dashing around the various engine, sheild and various weapon stations in a vaguely coordinated fashion.This is a couch co-op game, so it runs on one computer and only one player needs a copy of the game.  All achievements go the person who owns the game.  We played on a big screen via hdmi cable, so I don't know what it would be like if playing around a smaller game.			"

												Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is the game we never knew we needed it :P First time we got in ""contact"" with this colorful, action-driven game was several month ago in the EMP museum in Seattle, where it is part of an exhibition about indie games. It is recommended to play with game controllers, and this means you SHOULD!, to get the full potential of this coop space game. After geting in touch with the game again at PAX, it was settled. We need this game in our life!My husband and me are always on the lookout for real coop fun games and Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime definitely belongs into this category. The mix of gameplay, outstanding soundtrack and cute graphics promises gaming fun for hours! The need to coordinate your actions is the real deal to success here and will give you some reasons to argue about. Highly reccommended for couples! :D We did a stream/gameplay walktrough for those of you who are interested to watch me fail in driving a spaceship...

												Absolutely fun, chaotic, and a great party activity. I don't recommend it for couples, though, it ends up incredibly stressful, and was so much more fun when my wife and I got a third friend involved. I haven't gotten to play the game with four people yet, but I imagine that's a blast. I really like this game with three people, though. Hopping around from console to console to make that little ship fly is great fun, and coming up with component combinations for the ship's equipment is a blast.			"

												This has probably been the most greatest hidden gem i've ever played. Playing this with 4 players is definitely a joy. It gives you a real sense of stress trying to manage all the different turrets/controls while you're constantly being bombarded by enemies. Its a blast as we all yell at each other to ""man the gun"" or ""man the shield"" to try and stay alive.12/10My only complaint is that it isnt 'Cool'.... its about love and space bunnies, it could've been 'Cool'. I would love if there was a game like this with FTL skin overtop and a cooler story. This is a minor gripe however.			"

												There are 22 negative reviews and two types of people there: Lazy ""don't know how to open settings and change controls"" people and the Idiot ""THIS GAME ISN'T ONLINE SO IT SUCKS AND I AM ILLITIRATE"" people. The first Lazy people (well it explains itself) can't go to the settings and change the controls. The second kind of people who are IDIOTS and can't read (again explains itself) are the ones who can't read the description or watch the trailer wich clearly says LOCAL CO-OP.I am legitmatly amazed with this game. I was thinking it would be great and good when I first saw the game, but i was wrong. THIS GAME IS THE BEST GAME I HAVE YET TO PLAY! No really this game even passes over Gunpoint on my list and let me tell ya Gunpoint was ♥♥♥♥ing amazing! And don't let the play time scare you, this game is worth every SIGNLE CENT/penny/any currnecy. I have played the first campaing (there are 4 campaings in the game) in a hour and HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥THAT WAS THE BEST ♥♥♥♥ING HOUR OF MY LIFE!!! Seriosly if you got the money (wich YOU DO!) BUY THIS! I can't recommend this game enough (oh wait I can) BUY THIS GAME NOW RIGHT NOW!!! DON'T LET YUR GAME DREAMS BE DREAMS!! JUST BUY THIIIIS!!!! BUY THIS NOW!!! BUY NOW!!!! RIGHT NOW!!!

												I tend to be a solo player, so for me this is a rare gem; a game that is genuinelly even MORE fun the more people you have playing it!In one of the most satisfying and unique gaming moments of my entire life, my wife, my mother (who is by no means a gamer!) and I played this game to completion on Casual difficulty over the course of a few evening sessions while my Mom was staying with us on a visit... and we all had a blast! The game, by design, can accommodate multiple players of differing skill levels with ease, without sacrificing FUN.The graphics are bright, colorful, and easy to distinguish. The sound is clean and cohesive. The controls are tight. The energy is infectious. A great buy at full price - an absolute STEAL at a discount.  There's nothing more to say. LOVE wins!			"

												This game is exactly what I look for in a 2-4 person couch co-op. My friends and I started playing at around 2pm yesterday and played for 7 hours straight until we beat it, we were having such a blast. The art is adorable and the gameplay hits the nail on the head. The controls are so simple that your one-joystick-at-a-time friends can play easily. The game plays exactly how it should. No weird bugs, glitches, or missing/improper gameplay mechanics to be found. This is especially true in terms of the upgrade system. Upgrading different parts of your ship is awesome! Every single time my friends and I installed a new upgrade or new upgrade combo and then tested it for the first time, all of our reactions were ""OOOOOHHHHH!!!!!"" in sync. We had a blast exploring different combinations of upgrades for each station. The maps are also all uniquely generated which makes trying levels again just as challenging as the first time.Honestly, this game knocks it out of the park. I cannot recommend it enough to people looking for a great couch co-op experience.			"

Pros: Well balanced and smooth looking challenges based on perfectly thought-out game-play mechanics Scaredy-cat/slow reaction compatible (wife has both traits, playing still as fun as with brave brother) Cute graphics and funny story Well suited for both adults and kids alike.Cons: NONE, if you take into account that it was designed as local coopPS:I'm always on lookout for coop games without fastpaced-bloody-hardcore mechanics.

You need to play and work together  with good communication, if not you're gonna have your ship kicked. We like space/shooter games and it has the bonus of being funny&cute.One of the best things are the leveling and unlocks. Knowing that each time we work hard to rescue all the lil buddies we get extra points and rank so we can unlock better upgrades and even ships is just awesome.I'd totally recommend it if you have someone to play localy with. If you do go get it, you won't regret it. Also beware the freaking bombs. omg the freaking bombs........			"

												Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is a great deal of fun for almost any player, whether they play a lot of games or not, and it's easy to jump into and enjoy a silly adventure, which makes for great 4-player fun. At the same time, crank the difficulty up, and the way you upgrade your ship, how you manuver, and which stations you run around to all become rewarding split-second decision making and strategy that reward skill and teamwork.This game is what it aims to be, and there's not much to fault it for - but adding a few more ship upgrades and ship types definitely would keep the game enjoyable after a lot of play.

												The team at Asteroid Base Inc. have absolutley outdone themselves. Just one look at the screen is all it takes to recognize ABI's articulate attention to detail. The heart melting & cutesy visual style of this game coupled with LiaDS's intense co-op experience keeps me coming back for more. At first glance this game may seem as though it could be short, however, the ever changing game dynamics you encounter within each solar system keeps the game fresh and challenging. Not only will the player encounter new obsticles and enemies, but the biomes in each universe provide new reasons to rethink your tacitcs, loadouts (power-ups), or even the ship you wish to spread the love with. Including the tutorial, there are 5 systems to venture through that each hold several levels, which once again may leave you with a feeling that there isn't enough. Though I'll challenge that notion by asserting that each level can take anywhere from 15 minutes to a half an hour or more. Having said that, the game also provides a challenging normal difficulty that leaves room for the players to improve upon their tactics and teamwork. I'm excited to feel the love on hard mode ._. 10 out of motherloving 10.			"

												A great co-op game (and not a bad single player game either!) with great art and sound.If you are looking for a different and fun couch co-op experience this for you.  I played this with my 6 year old son, and we had a blast.The upgrades are fun, and controls are great and the sound effects are superb making for lots of ear/eye candy!no online gameplay, but you really need to be in the same room as your partner anyhow so it doesn't really matter.The game gets a bit repetitive after a while and it peaks early so I don't think this is an 80+ hour game or anything.. but it's really fun in groups where people are taking turns.  The development is pretty top notch (sound/art/music/animation/AI) A must have for any party gamer.			"

												Awesome art style, great music, cosmic bunnies, and tight controls. What else can be said? It is awesome to play with friends, family, or a significant other. Every mistake feels like your fault, nothing is because the game is broken or cheap. It feels very rewarding to complete a segment. Running from an expanding explosion is stressful in the most fun way. There is some good feeling of progression too as you unlock new ships, and upgrade your modules with gems of all sorts.I am a stingy person when it comes to buying games, but this is worth every single penny.

												This game is a very well put together little 2D shooter.  Reminds me of Pixeljunk Shooter.  Very simple game mechanics, and an absolute joy to play.  I can see me and the missus enjoying the crap out of this one!  The only thing I think would improve it is Network coop gameplay.  Not all lovers share the same computer!!			"

												This game is honestly really fun, the way it plays is really cool, and between the diffrent ships and the gems there are many diffrent ways to play. There could still be a little added to make the game better but its already really good and it feels like asking for a little too much. Overall it's a great game and you should buy it.			"

												Great co-op game that I plan on playing a ton with my girlfriend. Everything about this game is perfect except for two things however. One, being the keyboard controls. It says it is reccomended to use a gamepad, but I still think they could improve a bit. The second, is the no online co-op. I would love to play this with my other friends as well, but it is only a local co-op game. If this issue was fixed and I could play with all my friends, then I would want this to be game of the year. It is truely amazing. I just wish that the devs would maybe give the online play a go. 9/10			"

												i would recommend this game if you have a sibling who lets just say can be peaceful at times. I have been playing this game with my siblings who unfortunately cannot comprehend how to use the cannon's firing into god knows where. Apart from us dying causing my younger sibling to go rambo tearing the room apart in tears it is not a game but a piece of art. GET THIS IF YOU ENJOY TEAMWORK AND ONE SECOND LATER RAGE. 11/10would make my sibling scream and cry at death again			"

												I have only two ""negative"" things to say about this game. 1. I wish it would have had a bigger gem variety for even more fun combinations. 2. I wish the game would be even longer. I have had so much fun playing this game with my boyfriend. There was some frustrated yelling at times, but that is the way it should be in a local co-up game. As you pilot your ship through the different constellations, fighting the forces of Anti-Love you experience a nice variety of worlds. We thought for a second that we had found a ""winning"" gem combination after having easily glided through a few levels in a row, only to have to rethink our strategy as the environment around us changed. (Curse you ice constellation!) I have also played a bit of the solo game and found the cat ai to be a very decent, and agreeable, copilot. Though if I had to choose my boyfriend remains a better shield controller. The choices the ai makes aren't always the one you could wish for. The game is overflowing with cuteness and color, the difficulty increase in a good way to keep you sharp, and the random map creation and different gem builds is nice for replay-ability. All in all well worth the money.			"

												If you are looking for a great couch co-op game, especially since there have been a dearth of them lately, I highly recommend this game. I'm always on the lookout for good couch co-op and this fits the bill! Many co-op games don't seem to be built around that idea so they just feel like an afterthought and are a bit boring. This game does not feel that way! You'll have lots of fun yelling at your ""lover"" frantically trying to decide the best strategy. The game is essentially the platforming version of the tabletop game Space Alert. Strategy and skill is required to reach various stations that operate your ship such as weapons and thrust. The style is adorable and highly amusing; it is saccharine but tongue-in-cheek. I highly recommend this game.			"

The story is very basic, but original and interesting to play in. I also love how the character selection is like some of the best co-op games like Battleblock Theatre and how there are different variations of the characters and ships you can use. I highly recommend this game and it is worth the $15 to play.			"

												Warning: This is a co-op game, not an online multiplayer game.  Many have been hoping and waiting for an easy multiplayer function for this game, but at this point in time it is a co-op game.That being said, there's nothing wrong with a co-op game.  Frankly, this hearkens back to those couch gaming days with games that test you and your partner through fun, though admittedly difficult at times, game play.  Now, for some reason Steam does not show how much time i have actually spent in this game, so do not let that be a bias.  That's a Steam problem, not the game's nor my own.Game play: Almost solely Co-op.  Requiring much focus, multitasking, and cooperation between players.  COOPERATION IS KEY!  I would not try to play this alone (unless you have multiple controllers and arms) because, while there is AI, it can at times seem overpowered or under-powered as any AI tends to be.  However, the AI companion is either a cat or dog, so there is a slight aesthetic advantage. That said, once you do get used to the game play, it becomes super fun.Visuals and sound: simply cute and epic, as you can plainly see from the game art.  Bright, colorful, and loud.  The game is stimulating, and just the style makes the game worth playing as it keeps you engrossed in a cute/simple yet somehow simultaneously epic and destructive environment.Controls: So many would suggest purchasing and programming multiple game controllers/pads, it is personally up to preference.  I remember huddling around one keyboard with friends to play co-op games on PC long ago, and got personally attached to that – not necessarily couch gaming, as you/your friends huddle around a tiny space.  Keyboard gaming really made my friends and I close.  But again, personal preference: keyboard or controller(s).Story: You (and your buddy) are super cute heroes/creatures tasked with finding pieces of the Ardor Reactor – a machine that harnesses and spreads the power of love; broken by the “Anti-Love”.  Along the way, of course, you shoot  enemies, fly around, explore, save bunnies, and everything else you would expect from super cute space travel with love as its goal.Length: This game can be played for hours on end, but is more casual and in reality short.  Final Thoughts: Think C's for this game.  This game is a cute and casual co-op, calling back to couch-gaming.  Controller(s) recommended but not necessary... Oh yeah, and... COOPERATION!			"

												Ridiculous, over-the-top nonsense, the best way possible.  My partner and I have been playing this non-stop after work for the past few days; Most fun I've had on a couch co-op since I can't remember when.My only regret about this purchase is that there isn't more of it.  Took us 9ish hours to beat on casual, which actually wound up being a solid difficulty curve right through to the last boss.  Not complaining, mind you, this game was worth every penny.  If any of the devs/designers are reading this, I'd definitely be interested in more levels (please!)			"

												Quite frankly the most fun I had this year with a game, maybe a little too easy if you find some gem combinations that work. Lovely aesthetic, wonderfully challenging and a truly co-operative game.The keyboard controls can be a little awkward, but are perfectly functional. A controller is probably preferred though.Massively let down by the lack of an online multiplayer, but if you get a chance to play it in couch co-op then by all means do.			"

												I haven't played this game much, but I'll be playing this more so I may update the review as necessary. So I got this game the very last day I was on leave before having to go back to my duty station. I was dissapointed by the local co op only because I knew I would miss playing this with my friends back home. But anyway, my friend came over, I bought this game just because it looked interesting and we both loved it. So much yelling at each other: ""THE SHIELD! MOVE THE SHIELD! WATCH OUT FOR THAT ASTEROID! SHOOT THOSE MISSILES, THE MISSILES!! GET THOSE LITTLE FISH THINGS"" even though we were yelling constantly we were also laughing constantly. Seriously this made my last day home for awhile a lot of fun. But anyway to my actual review score.I gotta give this game a 9/10. The only thing keeping it from 10/10 for me is lack of online multiplayer, and singleplayer just doesn't come close to how much fun this is with a friend. If they add online multiplayer I could play with my friends back home and that would just be amazing for me. I'll buy them all copies if this get online multiplayer haha			"

You need to play and work together  with good communication, if not you're gonna have your ship kicked. We like space/shooter games and it has the bonus of being funny&cute.One of the best things are the leveling and unlocks. Knowing that each time we work hard to rescue all the lil buddies we get extra points and rank so we can unlock better upgrades and even ships is just awesome.I'd totally recommend it if you have someone to play localy with. If you do go get it, you won't regret it. Also beware the freaking bombs. omg the freaking bombs........			"

												It's adorable and the gameplay is really well designed in that the second player doesn't have to be a video game person, there's always something to do even if you're not good at games, and what you do still matters a lot. Well polished and looks great.			"

												I am going to open up my first steam review with my favorite game to play with my gf. Simply put, this game is a great game to play with your gf/bf. With two independant players controlling the two characters on your ship, you won't have to assign your otherwise CPU controlled partner to spots in the heat of battle. Co-op makes this game feel much less lonely and much more fun, so buy it for co-op.			"

												Must-have game to play in good company.One of the best co-op games I have ever played! The confusion of chosing battle-stations is lots of fun, as is learning to work together smoothly. Good co-op expirience all the way. Works well from 2 players. Not a single player, imo. It's overly cute and sugar-coated in nice, but so excusable, likable even... Other: GF and PG-young approved.

												Bought this on a whim to see about some local coop with friends via a steamlink.Great little game. Lots of fun and character. Definitlely worth picking up.Best part for me was the seemless operation.Having had the steamlink totally fail at local coop with big names like Portal 2 and several others, an indie game like this working perfectly first time certainly impressed.

												It's a great game to play with friends.Not many PC games (at least that I take interest with) are Coach Co-Op and most games that are on console don't have anything Co-Op on PC. ♥♥♥♥in' great.On the bright side you get games to play with friends like this which are absolutely amazing, lots of different combinations of gems to make different powers, several awesome and difficult boss fights, and being rewarding to completionist behavior.This is absolutely awesome to play with your friends you know in real life and they've added compatability for 4 players.

												Oh man this was weird, a whole lot of creative, and I loved playing it. I don't know where to begin with this, the story, the characters, or MAN THE GUNS MR TINKLES IT'S FULL SPEED AHEAD!I really wish this could be played with people that are in your friends list only, and not just locally. I feel the devs wanted to keep it a couch game, and that's understandable, but it really cuts off people that rely on remote co-op. That any maybe just a bit longer of a campaign.			"

												Are you looking for a way to check compatability between your loved one or friends?Lovers in a dangerous spacetime is a frantic action shooter that revolves around a strong crew and the power of love to defeat your enemies. Oh also, a few powered-up double chain ball turrets wouldn't hurt either. If you wanna push the bounds of your friendship or reltationship, or really see the effort of your teamwork, play this game. It sure beats chocolates and flowers, and if they do get mad or can't bother to move the shield while you are steering into hostile territory, hey, at least you didn't have to wait till the wedding to find out you weren't meant for each other.

												Pretty unique take on Multiplayer, a bunch of fun as well! Can't recommend it for singleplayer, since half the fun comes from yelling ""FIRE THE YAMATHO CANNON!!!"" at your teammates, but the second you have one other person to play this with, and a set of controllers, it's really funny!

												My girl and I are always looking out for games we could play together on PC especially for co-op games which we could play either on the same computer or side by side. I'd just like to say that LIADS is a perfect fit for us as the gameplay is AWESOME, we work together to keep the ship afloat (albeit with a lot of screaming on veteran mode). Music is great and the visual are colorful as well.Footage of us playing (sorry no narration/screaming/voiceover, we don't have a mic): 


YouTube™ Video: Lovers In a Dangerous Spacetime #2 

			Views: 37		

			So our first stream was a little unplanned and footage wasn't excellent. With the help of the friends of Youtube, we've tuned the footage a litle. Also, we beat the first boss in the game!

Great couch co-op, swinging spiked laser-balls at aliens has never been so fun!This hit on a really good recipe of platform/shmup starship crewing, which could be even better if developers find time to add network play.LOVERS is a true co-operative experience because you need your teammates taking care of different roles in order to succeed.Playing with only two people is difficult as you must pick any two out of shooting/moving/deflecting projectiles at one time, which I guess adds a sort of challenge in prioritising and communicating, but in some situations that takes a huge toll on your survivability compared to if you have 3 or more players.This seems to have great controller support too; I have been able to set up 4 players using even the complex combination of one Xbox360 controller, two PS2 dualshock 2 controllers plugged into a dual adapter, and one player on keyboard, and it works fine. That was testing on Linux though so YMMV.For best results you should plug them in before starting, then assign controllers to players through the options menu.The only negative thing I can say about it after a few hours of playtime is that you can't skip a quite lengthy intro cutscene when starting a new profile, which I found quite annoying, so please fix this.I've only played DRM-free so far since getting it from the Humble store, hence the playtime, but just tested it on Steam and found that it detects existing save files from the same directory, which is also good.N.B. the spiked laser balls are not balls made of lasers, but rather spikey flailing metal balls that shoot lasers out of them! SMASH SMASH PEWPEW!			"
