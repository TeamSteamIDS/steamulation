Early Access Review
								This is an early access review, so my opinion will likely change once the game moves out of beta.Having only played a couple routes so far, I'm quite excited for the finished product.  Backstage Pass is your standard otome (girl main character) dating sim/visual novel; perform tasks to skill up attributes which open up options for you as you target each guy to romance.  There's a little more to it than that, but for the most part that's the game.  If that doesn't really sound like your thing, you may want to pass on this one. Yes, the game is still littered with bugs, but those are being actively rooted out and squashed as the devs move through beta.  If you can get past the issues, though, the game has a TON of promise.  The artwork is beautiful, drawing inspiration from Japanese sources while adding a nice touch of western flavor, and some of the CG's are simply gorgeous.  The UI is one of the better ones I've seen for this type of game, especially since there are some pretty horrendous ones out there; you'd be surprised at just how distracting a bad UI can be.I've played quite a few translated Japanese language otoge before, and it always feels like something is slightly off with them (some more than others).  Perhaps it's the cultural differences, but I find well written English Visual Novels to be a much easier/more enjoyable read, and Backstage Pass is no exception.  The characters feel real with their own distinct personalities that somewhat fall into standard archetypes, but are more fleshed out and human than in other games.  Our protagonist, Sian, is a believable young woman who has her faults but isn't a meek little lamb waiting for one of the guys to sweep her away.  Outside of a lull in events further into the story (which is being addressed with some added scenes) the plot moves along nicely.  The writing is fluffy - meet guy, become friends, fall in love, etc.  I haven't come across anything that's overly dramatic or deep, but that's okay, sometimes I want a little less drama and a little more romance in my games. On a final note about the writing, I haven't come across any completely unbelievable situations nor have any of the characters done anything so stupidly groan worthy that I'm facepalming out of incredulity.  These characters are written like human beings, and they are placed in believable situations that make sense for the story.  That is a HUGE plus for me. As a slower reader, each of the two routes I played took me between 3 to 4 hours to complete, and I didn't get the endings I was aiming for, so replaying to complete CGs and aiming for achievements will likely double the play time per route.  I would estimate that with the 4 main romanceable guys and 3-4 hidden routes, total play time for completing everything in the game could easily bring you well over the 20 hour mark, especially once the voice overs are added which will slow down gameplay a bit.  A completionist by nature, I can see myself logging at least that much play time into this game.I realize there's a sentiment that the price of the game is too hefty for what it is, and to a certain extent I understand that complaint.  However, Backstage Pass offers much more than your standard Renpy EVN, the quality is better, more CG's, and the overall high polish even in this state of development is evident compared to what most other genre games are offering with a $20+ price tag  (and believe me, I've played some that I felt completely ripped me off, but that's totally not the case here).  It plays smoother and is closer to what you might get out of a Japanese dating sim, which is pretty remarkable considering this game is made by a small group of dedicated fans.  If Backstage Pass were to be released finished in its current state, it would be better than 90% of the EVN out there right now, but the devs are determined to continue adding to and fleshing out the game.  With full voice acting and additional hidden routes on the way (including a couple of yuri for those who are interested in them), Backstage Pass may very well become my favorite EVN.  Keep an eye out for this one once it moves from Early Access to Official Release.			"

Early Access Review
								So far I've played Backstage Pass for about 12-13 hours trying to get my hands on all the paths that are currently available. So far the only bugs I found was when Lloyd was going to meet Sian at Pho 24 to discuss what to do about Benito's magic production. The background was Sian's dorm room. Even though its not really a big scene, just thought I would point it out. Now onto my real review. Personally, I LOVE this game. Sure it's a bit short now, but once the game is completed, it will be longer with more dialogue, more routes, and more endings. The game is actually really realistic. You're given many different types of people with many different types of personalities. Plus, the original soundtrack goes perfectly with every scene. Also, everything is set up nicely and runs pretty smoothly. The storyline is also pretty good, sometimes it can be a tad sad. Other times it just makes you wanna giggle.I've played other otome, stat-raising, dating sims, and visual novels before. Backstage Pass has amazing originality, creativity and art. If you're wondering to buy this game or not, I recommend playing some free stat-raising/otome/dating sims before buying this game. A good free one is Re Alistair ++ (by Sakevisual). You can also play demos such as Always Remember Me, The Flower Shop: Winter in Fairbrook and more (both from from Winter Wolves). (EDIT!) I forgot! There is also another free amazing stat raising game you should try out. It's called 'Heartstring Bugs' and it's by Unbroken Hours. It's long, has 5 main guys and is over the course of 3 years. AND ITS FREE. ERMAHGERD. Go check it out! (End of edit. 6/14/14)So far I've focused on Adam x2 and Benito x1. I'm going to start John and Matthew after I'm done writing this xD. But this game will truly come out to be something special. I can't wait for the voice acting to be done.MICAH SOLUSOD (voice of Soul Eater Evans from Soul Eater) WILL BE VOICING ADAM. I literally had a spazz attack when I first found out!!!... *cough cough* Ehem. The price for the game is amazing at just $30 with all that's going to be included when the product is officially done. And replay is going to be high trying to get all the CG's, scenes, Steam achievements, Steam trading cards, items in game, unlocking new places to shop/hang out, and try any and all possible routes. Right now my current rating for Backstage Pass is 8/10. Which is stunning because this is only the Beta version! I've played a few finished games, and their no where near as good as Backstage Pass. If you want to follow Sakevisual about new updates on the game, visit their official website weekly. You can also sign up for mail updates, follow them on Twitter, Like their page on Facebook, view their Tumblr and more xD			"

Early Access Review
								Honestly, I don't know what to say. It's a game of good quality but the waiting for the game to get past beta stage got me weary. I was honestly very enthusiastic, preordered the game the moment it was possible because I couldn't wait to see how the system worked. I was dazzled by the pretty art and the GUI. However, I also noted the story didn't have enough backing to get past the famous RE:Alistair stage. Pretty art, short story and few small scenes. They share the same basis. But I feel like it lacks a little more story and dating considering this one is no freebie. This game should have more story line which is why I quickly told myself to replay it once it was complete... but then again, considering the last news our dear dev made, this is basically the storyline which I find a little lacking.If all I'm waiting for right now is the voice, I can tell you I'm not going to play again. Besides, I have been waiting for over a year now to see more of this and I am tired. I am very, very tired to see that the game is not finished.			"

Early Access Review
								Just viewing the trailer, it's easy to tell that the game is high quality and a step up from Sakevisual's old game Re:Alistair...but when I played it, Backstage Pass was way better than expected. The characters are lovely, the art is beautiful, and what I've heard of the voice acting so far is fantastic. Sian, the heroine, is also a very believable character who is better than most other vn/dating sim protagonists I've come across. There's also a huge amount of represenation of difference races, sexualities in this game and multiple characters with ranging disabilities. My only complaint is that there may just be little too many possible endings. In my game, Sian and John were dating and I merely was half a heart away from having full hearts with him..and absolutely nothing happened in the end. It was a little disappointing since I wasn't sure where I had gone wrong and it's tough to find guides online.It could be helpful for Sakevisual to include a walkthrough for each character online. I realize that many people enjoy finding out on their own, but if someone wants to unlock every CG and is just missing one or two they don't know how to get...an official walkthrough could be very beneficial.

Early Access Review
								The characters are interesting but frankly not that charming. The art is very good. The dialogue is okay. I looked up all the information I could on the internet, made all the right choices, and ended up alone at the end. This game has been in Early Access for over a year now, with no updates to the game, and no word from the creators. Their ""weekly updates"" on their blog stopped in May 2014, and after that there are just a handful of tweets and tumbles about  voice recording in April 2015. Frankly I would consider calling it abandoned: they've suckered $30 out of enough people in Early Access and their work is done. This game does not feel at all like it would be worth $30 even after completion, much less at early access. Consider waiting until the alleged ""release"" before picking up this one.			"

I'm posting a new review now that it's officially released! *TLDR version at bottom of the review (I deleted my early Access review because it's no longer relevant).Pros:Very nice and appealing art/artstyleA wide cast of unique charactersNice musicAmazing UI (User interface)Cons:Sometimes the stories feel a bit ""Light"" not bad thoughThere aren't really any cons now that the VN is completed. There are smaller things like I think more of the side characters should have sprites and that some of the changes made to the story were a little meh during development, but these aren't things that will make you not enjoy this VNShould you buy? If you like otomes games? Definitely. If you like VNs in general? Just look at the story summary and characters to decide but I think it'd still be a good time. If you're new to VNs and/or otome games? If you want to give them a try this wouldn't be a bad first one! I'd recommend it. Also some people might like/dislike the themes related to theater and the fact that the MC is a makeup artistTLDR I gifted this VN to a friend as soon as it was officially released, give it a try!

								I honestly have no clue why there are such bad reviews for this game. I have not finished the game, as there is ALOT of content even if it isn't ""complete"". If you are a fan of otomes, and have the cash to spare, I highly reccomended this game. The newly added voices are a nice additon as well, and for the most part very impressive and appealing. The plot is fun and each route is a different experiance. I will will say it is a tad challenging and this is nothing new for fellow stat raising games. However, the art is really nice, the characters likable, the story is interesting, and I found myself relating to Sian, the mc, much more than any other game I've played. It is frustrating to play over and over, not getting the correct end, but it is possible. The game is actually pretty hilarious (especially John's Route. It was hard to get a good ending but oh my god a certain ""conversation"" had me laughing hysterically.  My point is, you have to be willing to commit time into the game and have patience in order to enjoy it. It is well worth the price for all that we're getting, and have yet to receive.			"

								I wouldn't reccomend this game to anyone until the final verson of it is released. It's not very fun, the voices aren't complete, you need a guide before you can even begin to understand how to jump onto a character path. Honestly, I regret buying it. Worst part? Since buying it last year, I've heard nothing about the development, or any predictions on when the game will be released in it's full version. Stay away from this game, hold on to your money for something better.			"

								Once again, another otome game where you have to do everything perfectly and play off a guide or else you're screwed.And it's been months and months (years now?) and the game's still not finished.The music gets very grating very quickly. The voices still aren't implemented fully. I've unselected all the voice boxes (which is how you turn them on) and I've never heard anything.Maybe if they ever finish the game it would be worth it. I regret paying full price. It's not worth it. Maybe half off, and that would be when it's complete.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is amazing. I have been waiting for it to come out for a while now, and I have played all of Sakevisual's other games, The artwork is far superior to most EVNs that you see coming out. It has an animated opening and closing. You play as a female, freshman college student named Sian, who has been trained in movie makeup. Sian's friend Adam is an up an dcoming singer, who Sian does the makeup for, and John is his producer. You have to keeps your grades up to keep your scholarship (this hit home since I am in college on scholarships), you have to work to get money to buy things, and there are stats to raise to get your guy. There are 4 guys, Adam, John, Benito, and Matthew, and each has a friendship and a romance route. There are other secret character routes, but I have not discovered them all yet. Each main guy has about 14 cgs, and then there is a section for other cgs. Did I mention that the cgs are gorgeous, Tooya did an amzing job. There are a total of 15 endings (8 total from the main guys, 1 alone ending, and 6 others that I have not discovered). The storyline is well written, and it is fun to see Sian be sarcastic. I did not run across any bugs while playing, and I did not notcie any incorrect grammar. It is a stat riaisng sim, which I do not particularly enjoy, but there is enough scenes in between so that the game does not become monotonous. Each week you pick what you are going to do during that week, and sometimes depending on the date, stat level, etc. scenes will unlock during the week. Then on the wekend you can hang out with a friend, sleep, use items, bake cupcakes,go to the arcade, go to a restuarant, or go shopping. Different places unlock depending on events you unlock during the game.This game is one of the better EVNs that I have played, it is on the same level as Dandelion, Nameless, and Starry Sky in Sring. I can't wait till the game is completely finished, and I can't wait to see Sakevisual's next game.			"

Early Access Review
								So far this has been one of the most addictive otome games I have played, and certainly one of the best OEL (original English language) ones. As of writing this review, I have played through the game twice, starting on 1st January 2016.POSITIVES: The English voice acting is excellent. Some anime fans may recognise some of the cast, which is a nice touch. I was particularly fond of the acting for John, Adam, Lloyd, and Matthew. Great value for money. At this point I have logged 11 hours of gameplay, and I still have 15 of the game's listed endings to unlock. For a game featuring this much content, plus an animated opening & closing, as well as full voice work, the price is very reasonable. Fully animated opening and closing sequence (although the ending one takes a lot of work to unlock, and I haven't seen it yet) done by Studio DEEN (notable for their work on several anime series). A real treat for any anime fans playing, and a nice touch which helps this game stand shoulder to shoulder with its Japanese otome competition.Beautiful art. A few of the CGs felt a little off-model, but for the most part the art in this game is particularly gorgeous.Equally beautiful music, that I did not find overly repetitive (although your own mileage may vary).Excellent characters and varying storylines, with a highly relatable protagonist who is independent and fun to play as. The game also features a diverse selection of characters of various ethnic/country origins and sexualities.NEGATIVES:Still a few bugs. As this game is on Early Access, this is to be expected, and at this stage I have not encountered any game breaking ones (and even one which unlocked an achievement early). These can be reported in the game's Bug Report discussion thread, which is currently very active and seeing a lot of player participation.This game can be very tedious and challenging. It can be disappointing to put several hours into a playthrough only to not get one of the listed endings. The fact the game has so many options and possibilities also makes it quite grind-heavy, especially for completionists. It's fairly standard for the stat-raising genre, however, and those used to this style of game should have no problems.Could benefit with some official guidance/documentation from the developers. There are complete walkthroughs out there written by fans, but they can be awkward to track down (I only found a complete one a few hours ago after two days of playing). The game has a lot of complex mechanics and stats, and I feel the game would benefit from some sort of official guide or document explaining how these work, at minimum. For example, there is no obvious explanation as to what the star meter under the characters means in the stat menu.Overall, this game is highly enjoyable and an excellent addition to the genre, which I thoroughly recommend. If you can put up with the grind (and particularly if consulting guides and walkthroughs doesn't bother you) you will love this game. A fantastic addition to Sakevisual's game repertoire, which sets the gold standard for OEL visual novels.			"

Early Access Review
								Overall Score from me: 5.5/10.I realise that the game is not yet complete, if It ever gets updated and fully finished I'll adjust my review accordingly. Keep in mind, that I've played many many many Otome style visual novel games, and there are basically three main types that exist. Stat building, choice maker/visual novel, point and click/adventure.This one is mainly a stat builder but also is reliant on choices you make in relation to the character you're pursuing. First the numbers.Gameplay 4/10. There is no option to skip the mini cutscenes during the classes/work week, or making cupcakes, so if you're going for doing things efficiently and making 20 or so cupcakes it takes forever. The email system is critical for some of the game paths and EXTREMELY EASY TO MISS. Which means unless you save often you could miss half of the requirements for some of the game paths. The game length is too long in the worst way because of how long it takes you to complete the actual week day planning, (A ""save this schedule"" option would be great as well) And it is very difficult to monitor your character's stress levels while paying attention to the email system, and go out on enough dates with the bachelor of your choice. There are also numerous bugs, such as one on Matthew's path that if you press the skip button it occasionally brings you back to the start menu, on loading a save. Another one is that if you have skip on, and you bake cupcakes it makes that faster but can be turned off if clicking in the general area as well. I've also had certain event flags not start when they're supposed to so there's a few kinks that need working out.Music 6/10. The music in this game is fairly well done, but one thing that I personally believe is that the music cannot actually be turned down low enough without being fully mute. I'm thinking this will be fixed when they add voices and such to the game, but that's my only issue there.Artwork 8/10 The art in this game is very beautiful. The only thing I would like to point out is that there are a few cutscene pictures that distort the character's faces in a way that it's not attractive, but overall it's really well done and the character design is really good.My current viewpoints:*All of the paths are EXTREMELY difficult. As in pedantic and overwhelmingly difficult. I have yet to unlock one perfect ending with any of the characters, despite following guides and doing everything in my power for this. This game needs a walkthrough more than a guide.  Matthew's path for example is a bit unclear as I'm not sure what you need to say to Nicole in order to make things work or what stats you need to focus, as even with maximum charisma, specialized cupcakes, dates and popularity I didn't get the complete ending. The game takes way too long to complete due to needing to re-input every single command into the schedule every day. I think that a lot of the game could be made smoother/more user friendly just by making the email button flash red on recieving a new email, and having the option to choose what sian's main ""ideas"" are at the start of the game, such as wanting to start a blog for popularity or practice speaking for charisma. It'd also be a lot better to add more stress relief books to the stores, and to make it easier to access the arcade as raising your gpa for another date-spot, plus trying to balance stats is a bit pedantic and difficult. It's not a bad game, but this goes beyond challenging to a painful grind and a lot of work. I still haven't gotten one perfect ending, though i'm not sure if it is related to the game or something i'm doing wrong, and there are no full guides or walkthroughs that completely cover the exact things people need to do to get the endings.I'd still reccommend this for the story, but until it's finished and some of the bugs are removed, it's not a full reccommendation from me.

												After playing most of the game, my impression of this game is that it is simple. That is to say, that the story itself is rather simple and feels lacking much depth at times. The characters deal with some problems, but tend to get over them pretty easily and the dramatic element just doesn't feel there. Not to say that all games have to have a complicated story, but when playing a visual novel type game where the focus is the story, it feels a little lacking. There are stat management elements to it to break up the story, but those end up feeling like quite a chore, with week after week ending up being more of the same, struggling to keep fatigue low (since it can only go to 30 before it causes issues, but a single week will put it up above 20) and to keep earning money all while keeping your grades high enough.I do like this game even though it is simple, just because I do tend to like 'slice-of-life' games and I also enjoy the setting, but people should not be expecting a riveting experience from this game. It's unfortunate, but the stat management elements make the game tiring so unlike many visual novels that I like to play all the routes one after another, I'm finding myself having to pause from playing the game after each route for a week or two. Even the solo routes still feel like more work than they should be since you still have to manage the fatigue, money, and your GPA. Other than like ~7 main events with each main male (spaced over an entire year, so they are somewhat far between), the main interaction is just going on dates with them which have just a few lines of light dialogue that repeats and that's about it. In my opinion, if you are looking for a school-life dating game, games like Tokimeki where you follow the main character for all 3 years of her high school and manage her many stats while having quite a variety of options for datable characters (9) and many unique date spots and events (such as museum exhibits, movies, etc) are what I would expect for $30. I bought this game because I was watching Dodger's Let's Play of it on Youtube and found their videos to be entertaining and didn't want to wait for more of them before seeing where the story went. In the end, I'm a little disappointed with this game, especially for the cost. Overall, the stat/fatigue system makes this game a bit annoying and I still want to finish all of the routes for sake of being a completionist, but I don't think this is a game that I will be returning to beyond that. It's a relatively fun game for what it is, but be aware of what you're getting.			"

Early Access Review
								Yes, the game is still in early access. Yes, people have been very vocal about their dissatisfaction with how long the game has been in early access and development. I myself was very hesistant to buy it and the game just sort of sat on my wishlist for a long time. I have been pleasantly surprised and happy with what the game has to offer right now though. At it's basic core it's a stat raising dating so, so if that's not your thing the game is probably not for you as stats seem to play a very vital role in the gameplay itself. I'm only about a month into the game itself but already have a to keep a close eye on certain stats. Thankfully the most annoying fatigue stat doesn't rise TOO terribly much with activities and it goes down by a lot when you have a successful rest. The most recent addition has been the voice acting and while I'll admit it was a little jarring at first, I've gotten used to it. Most of the voices do really fit the characters and just give a little more life into the story itself. There are little things here and there like random lines that aren't voiced or times when the volume of the line is very loud or very soft, but it will definitely make the game that much better when Sian is voiced as well. Speaking of Sian, she is an...interesting main character. At first she appears to have a little bit of that quintessential sort of wallflower trait of otome mcs have? Thankfully she has proven to be a more than one-dimensional in her character development so far so hopefully the opinon that I continue to form of her will be positive. I really enjoy the fact that she's sort of behind the scenes in the industry as well and the fact that she is confident in her talents as a make-up artist and knows she deserves to do what she's doing with it. Things could have gone very badly if she was doubtful in herself throughout the entire game. The other character introduced so far have been very charming and likeable, the four love interests have very different personalities and different ways they interact with Sian so that has been interesting to see so far. If you're interested in the game at all and have been on the fence about buying it, I would highly reccomend picking it up. Yes it still has a fair amount of bugs and such to work out, but it really is a wonderful game so far. If you're not a fan of VNs with tedious stat raising then perhaps this isn't the game for you.

												While I normally do not write reviews for this game I felt compelled to do it in this case because in my opinion Backstage Pass is an exemplary visual novel.  On the surface it is an otome game, which means a japanese dating sim for girls.  As a straight man I could not be further from the target demographic for Backstage Pass.  Yet, despite this, I enjoyed it greatly.  That is because Backstage Pass is so much more than an otome.  There is definitely the requisite number of hot anime guys for you to romance, but you don't have to do that at all if that does not interest you.  All of them have friendship paths as well, and there is a route for you yuri fans too(guilty).  But it even goes beyond that and explores non-traditional relationships as well, and allows you to follow separate independant routes where you advance your career in the industry.  There are so many options in this game that almost everyone is bound to be satisfied with at least one of them.Now, options alone do not make the game of course.  As a visual novel it needs good writing and likable characters.  It has those as well.  I would describe the protagonist, Sian, as intelligent and competent.  I am not someone that projects myself into games so Sian was another character to experience and enjoy, which I did.  While I personally cannot relate to her experience with anxiety and panic attacks(though I am sure many others can), that never felt like it affected from my enjoyment of her character and I greatly enjoyed how she was written.  She is definitely my favorite character.  All of the male leads are good as well, Benito is obviously the best though.  Obviously.  There are some characters I have not delved deep into like Alvin so I can't speak much on them, but overall I felt the writing and characters in the game were very good.  Everyone is voiced and while the voices all sounded fine I prefer to leave them off.Since I have never played any other otome type games I cannot speak about how traditional the systems are but they play out like such; you plan out how to spend your week with different activities that raise your statistics depending on how fatigued you are and what I think is a random chance of either good or bad, with the chance of the lower skill raising 'bad' going up based on your fatigue.  Staged events usually happen during this time period as well, like if you accepted a job to work on wensday afternoon.  Then every weekend you can check your mail, decide to take jobs, go into town, or call someone up to spend time with them.  As someone that likes numbers and thinking the best way of doing things this all worked for me, so no complaints.I do have one complaint with the CGs in them.  After studying art a bit I cannot unsee chronic sideface, and a couple characters came down with this affliction(LLOYD).  lastly one piece of advice: never sleep, sleep when you are dead.  I hope you like phoDefinitely recommend this visual novel to really anyone with any kind of interest in VNs			"

								This game is fantastic and was worth every penny I paid for it. The art is wonderful. Each character is drawn very well in a consistent, crisp style. This goes as well for the CGs, which features the same style as the sprites. I liked the story. It was cute, and progresses very well. Each of the characters are unique from one another and develop throughout the span of the game. This includes the MC, whose personality is refreshing from the typical otome heroine. I haven't played it since it was updated with the voice work, so I have no opinions on how everyone sounds. It has such a high replayability as well. There are many endings to explore, and several endings within each character. Stat raising gets repetative, but for this sort of game, this is to be expected. The dates also fall into this same loop. Again, I don't expect unique dialogue for each time I take the same person out to the same place, so I wasn't too upset. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys otome games and/or visual novels.			"

								While the art is lovely and I enjoy stat raising games, I preordered this game over two years ago and it's still unfinished. Sakevisual has explained some of the issues (apparently the time they booked for recording was stolen or something) I find this delay of two years to be unexcusable for what is such a small game.Don't buy this unless Sakevisual says it's completely done. When I preordered this, it was supposed to be finished around November of last year and it's still not finished. It's kind of a joke, really. Characters are nice, story is okay, dialogue can occasionally be interesting but it's not worth waiting this long for. Relatively short with a lot of empty promises.			"

								It's a really nice otome game with various endings. It has a nice story and there is a lot you can do.  But still no voiceover which is kinda sad. It's been in Early Access stage for too long and still there is no update. Sakevisual makes great otome games. But there hasn't been any news about BSP for a long time. Also the art is unique, I can't say that I like it too much. But considering the other otome games on Steam, Backstage Pass is a treasure. There are lots of defiencies but the content of the game covers them up. There are like 16 endings, (as I remember) 7 romance options, -3 of them are hidden- and tons of stuff to do.You should definitely buy it if you're looking for an otome game which has a nice story, lots of endings and a nice art. It's one of the best otome games in Steam.			"

								I feel like I'm managing my life (so much to do!).On a more serious note, I want to address an issue many have been complaining about:The characters.Now, first off - Sian.Sian has social anxiety disorder. So what does this mean? Not only is she uncomfortable with crowds, but she's liable to panic at social events/socializing. Now, this is extremely uncommon to see in otome games, no matter what platform they are in. In all otomes I've played, I've yet to see a protagonist like this.So is it surprising that she and her LI take things slowly?No.John may seem like a heartless jerk, but he's not. Adam's her best friend, so naturally, he knows how deep her fear runs. Benito is perceptive, Matthew is the total contradiction of heartless, and Nicole despite being prickly (kind of) isn't that cruel.Typically, in otome VNs, we have the shy, clumsy protagonist, or the defiant loud-mouth one. But a protagonist with social anxiety? *looks at the sky*Sian has a quiet strength to her that I admire. She's strong-willed and stubborn in her own right (I'm looking at you, John.), determined to do things on her own despite her anxiety and reluctance to work in the industry and not take charity.That? THAT is something to admire. Forget the shy, clumsy protagonists. This is interesting. This is refreshing and it gives me insight to those who have social anxiety.Onto the LIs, as I've previously said - John's hardly heartless or cruel though he may or may not seem like it. Adam and her grew up together, so he knows how deep her fear runs. I've done some research on social anxiety, and though it may seem minor to some, it is not. Fear can cripple and bury itself into you. Overwhelm you.Benito's extremely sharp and quick on the uptake. He has to be, considering his profession. Matthew being cruel? The day the sky falls, honestly. Nicole I can't particularly say as I've yet to seen much of her personality as RL is being evil so I have to play this on-and-off.Conclusion?Sakevisual, keep doing what you're doing.			"

Early Access Review
								For a game that is still in progress/early access, Backstage Pass is remarkably polished. I didn't notice any real bugs, though it's obvious that some routes are still (sadly) unavailable, so I'm definitely looking forward to the updates when they open. The game has really great graphics, interesting storylines, intriguing characters, and an easy to use stats control system. My only real complaint right now would be that the game REALLY makes you work for achievements (10 hours in, 4 romance routes played, only two achievements!). That said, what really makes the game great isn't the graphics or the characters or the storyline, it's the way the game represents and portrays social anxiety and other mental illness with sensitivity and heart. None of the characters shown with mental illness (and there's three I've found so far, including Sian, the main/player character) are mocked or made the butt of joke or just written off as ""crazy"" because of their disability (one character even calls out this kind of reaction within the game!). I didn't realize Backstage Pass would have this kind of representation going in -- I thought it'd just be an interesting industry-based game -- so I was pleasantly surprised to see it and how well it was handled. I also really appreciated some of the realism to the industry element as well. It's obviously a ""light"" version, compared to the real thing, but the terminology and the basic shape seems accurate, given what I know from friends who do work in the industry. Finally, there's a ton of content for each route. It took me about four hours to complete my first route (and sadly I got a bad ending) and another hour and a half to complete the next route I tried (with the skip function used liberally). Each subsequent route took about the same hour and a half. Right now the four main routes (Benito, Adam, John, Matthew) are all open and I've only completed the romance routes on all four. So I expect another good six hours to unlock the friendship routes and even more game time to try the non-romance routes suggested by the achievements (I'm definitely looking forward to being a director!). So there's plenty of story in the game and you won't finish everything in four or five hours like a lot of VNs. So if you're worried about the price (and it does feel like a lot of money for a VN), think of the potential amount of time you'll be playing. Not to mention what is apparently in the pipeline for the game (more routes, fully voiced, etc.) so it's definitely worth the money even at this stage in the game. Definitely one of the better VNs I've ever played (and I'm definitely planning on trying out Sakevisual's other games after playing this!).			"

												One of the best dating sims I've ever played. This is also one of the most realistic dating sims I've played as well. The reactions and characters all act so real, nothing felt tropey to me which is really hard to find when playing this genre of game. All the characters a very well fleshed out and the art is overall pretty great as well, with CG pretty often when it comes to the route you are on.The game overs I believe 16 endings or something ridiculous like that contain both the main routes (Friendship and romance endings with the main routes) and several hidden ones as well as independent endings which is a first I've seen for a dating sim that isnt considered a bad end. This gives the game so much replayability as you want to figure out all the extra endings and get the scenes you were unable to get prior.I had one issue about the game though, during actual gameplay (balencing stats with yourself and characters) you have to do VERY specific actions in some cases to get certain this but its pretty easy to correct if you figure out the character you want to do and find their likes. Other than that though the gameplay was nice filler as it didnt seem to last long and you can fast forward through it easily. In most cases it isnt useless stat boosts either they do help to unlock things and help your relationship of course.So overall I would definitely give this game a shot in your a fan of the series! Its the best in the genre in my opinion so hopefully you'll think the same!			"

												I’m enjoying Backstage Pass a lot more than I thought I would. This is the standard stat-raising dating sim. If you’re on the fence about getting this, I would definitely recommend watching PressHeartToContinue’s playthrough of it, which is what I did before purchase. So, here were my thoughts:CONS:- While I do appreciate full English voices, since that’s so hard to come by with these types of games, I thought the voice acting was kind of amateurish. There was a noticeable difference in volume/mic quality between actors, some deliveries fell flat or just didn’t capture the right tone, and on all three routes I’ve played so far, I noticed some of lines weren’t even voiced and they kept in extra takes either by mistake or on purpose. - Some inconsistencies with quality (weird anatomy, bad proportions, ect.), but overall the art is up to par with other games of this genre, and the chibi animations are cute.- Having to monitor the protagonist’s fatigue, and boost her stats does get grindy and repetitive at times.PROS: - Minimal typos, grammar was good, and minus a few phrases that just didn't work for me, the story is well-written. Never did I get lost or confused while reading along. I’ve played a lot of dating sims/visual novels, and the multiple plotlines are interesting—you do grow an attachment to the different characters. Or at least I did.- Music is catchy. I’ve played for about 15 hours, and I have yet to grow tired of it.- Seems like there’s a lot of meat to this game, and with so many different endings and romance options to choose from, you’ll be investing many hours into it. So, at least you’re getting the full bang for your buck.Overall, I do think this game is worth buying. Maybe not at full price, but definitely keep an eye out if it ever goes on sale again.			"

								Obviously the devolpers put a lot of work in this game, which I appreciate. The only problem is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ CHARACTERS.There's no appeal to them whatsoever. The MC is just a mary sue in disguise, and all other romantic interests just don't make sense. None of the relationships have chemistry, and I couldn't gave a♥♥♥♥♥♥about any of the love stories.  We don't get to see the relationship develop between the characters. It just goes from casual flirting to outright declariations of love. It's a bunch of BS, and a joke of a story.Since this game can still be improved, I'll just add this: please make the relationships more believable. Cause right now I'm more interested in stale bread then in any of the couples.			"

												I am really enjoying this game so far.  Unlike a lot of the other visual noval dating/sim games, this one gives you a lot of room to see outside of just dating.  I really like the story line and how little choices can effect an outcome, like it would in real life.  The art work is really well done and I also like the music and short vid clips.  So far this is an A+ from me.  It's nice to just sit back, relax, and unveil a good story.    ** With all that said, it does take a slower pace than normal in my opinion.  It might seem to drag a bit in places, but I think that helps build certain qualities you might need later (fitness, fashion, etc.).  Like I said before, I still really like the game.			"

												I wanted to like this game. I really did. But with the hefty price tag, the way that one tiny scheduling error could lock you out of multiple endings, and the ever present skill grinding - I just can't! After watching a youtuber play this game, I even decided to use a guide, and I *still* found myself locked out of routes because of a tiny error here or there. It's absolutely infuriating! Not to mention that the way the game is built, the most that guide writers can do a lot of the time is give you a rough estimate of when or where to do something.			"

								I regret buying this game and I think 30$ is really too much! It's not worth this money! There are a lot of free otome games which are much better than this one.The biggest flaw of this game is a lack of passion. Lack of passion in the story, lack of passion in the characters, lack of passion in relationships between the MC and the guys, lack of passion in everything! The story was extremely boring and the guys didn't stir up almost any emotions in me.How come the heroine has something like 50 dates(if not more) with a certain character and only in the end of the route they share a kiss? The heroine isn't a little girl! Why she behaves like she's 14? Does the author really think a mature man like Jhon(I assume he's something like 35 years old) would date a girl SOOO MUCH TIME before trying to kiss her? Does the author of this story think it's realistic?! Or maybe Jhon and other guys are all impotents and spadoes??I thought I would start to sleep while reading the routes. The plot was too predictable, slow, monotonous, lacking dynamics. All of the characters behaved like asexual virgins! I'm sorry but it was one of the most boring otome game I've ever played and half of the time I wanted to press ""skip"". Not to mention how tedious and repetitive was the game process(too much of stat raicing)And Matthew's voice didn't sound good. Does this guys smoke three packages of Marlboro per day?? The voice didn't match his personality at all.One of the big and only pluses of this game is a big quantity of CGs. But the interaction between Sian(the heroine) and the guys is so dull that most of the CGs from the game have nothing special about them.			"

												Here is my first review on steam, as a huge otome fan ^^ + Characters are REALLY likeable, even side ones+ The game is FULLY VOICED in english !! And the voice actors are good !!+ The art is very pretty+ Tons of CG+ Lots of endings : good replayability+ Sian is an awesome otome heroine !+ Secret paths (Alvin, why are you so cute <3)~ There are some bugs and typos, but I hope it will be fixed with later patches (like, it say that I played it 7 hours, while I played at least 15 hours...)~ The routes are a little dull : It's my personnal opinion, but I prefer when there is a little of angst, when characters face harships, and so on. Here, it's cute, and that's all, so some may like it, other not.- When you retry the game for the 10th time, the grinding becomes redundant- The romance isn't very good... Like, it feels poor in comparison with other otomes games : In 2 paths (Benito and Matthew), the romance route and friendship route are almost identical- Sometimes, you don't understand what the heroine is thinking : Suddenly, she's in love in some paths, and it appears a little of nowhere- Some CG aren't as well done than othersIn conclusion, I really liked Backstage Pass and I recommand it, even if it's not the best that exist out there ! I grade it 7,5/10Sakevisual is a good studio, and I will keep on following their future work.PS : If you don't have the money and you want to play otome games, I recommand RE: Alistair++, a free game made by them :)			"

								This game is long and  lot of fun, there's a few moments strange enough to pull me out of it but with the polishing this beta will give them I'm sure it will be even better finished.I was surprised how long it took until I hit anything interactive, my first choice was about three hours in and that's after I read a novel which mostly centered around 2/4 of the love interests. Mostly focusing on Adam with a side of Benito. The weekly planning was nice, the sleeping didn't decrease the stats so much I felt like I wasn't advancing at a good rate and dropping out of college would have required an actual effort to do.My biggest issue, and I address this because it won't likely be changed as it's such a huge part of the game, is the protagonist. I do not like her at all. She is at best a buzzkill and at worse she seems shallow. Way too often she responded to light banter with a blunt and logical response which was in no way fun to see. Also a protag bad in crowds is not really all too original which was a disappointment, but that seemed to be forgotten on extra day on the V/V set but remembered later for the sake of drama when it made little sense. A character like Nicole being the protagonist would have been much more likable. With Sian, I was making mean comments to my computer as it seemed like Sian was excusing the action of a boy sexually harassing someone (mall scene with the elf outfit and Nicole).Though the art was great and the opening cinamatic was polished and a great touch. One play through took 13 hours so I feel like I am getting my money's worth out of it and given a good range of handsome, different love interests to choose from. The continuity in Matt's route was impressive, if you gave him a gift early on he uses it to make something for you much later in the game. I was very impressed and pleased with this.I would suggest this to people who don't mind reading, as there is a large chunk in the beginning you kinda need to power though, once you get to the actual interactive part though it's very addictive, pretty put together for an early access game, and very fun.

Tired of cookie-cutter, bland otome game characters? Fear not! Backstage Pass features a likeable, multi-faceted main character (who actually has other interests besides chasing boys!) as well as interesting and unique characters all around. Tired of choices in otome games that don't actually seem to matter or affect anything? No worries! Your choices can lead to a variety of endings; you're in control here. This game has tons of replay value as well, especially if you're like me and you have to collect all possible CGs and achievements. You will not regret playing this, and if you enjoy it, I highly suggest trying out other games by this developer. Cheers!			"

								Art is great, and the English voice acting is actually pretty top notch. This is literally the only otome game I have ever played with English voice acting that didn't make me cringe. It's shaping up to be a really good game, in fact it's probably one of the better otome titles I have played now that the voiced version is availible. That being said, the stat raising can get tedious, and the date dialogue with the various guys can get pretty repetitive fairly quickly- but no more than similar games of the genre. The voice acting actually allows for the personalities of the characters to come off as pretty developed, I look forward to the MC being voiced in the future,  "

												One of the best parts of this game is the diversity in stories. While the story centers on four main boys, you can choose to have a romantic or friendly ending, and the story does not end with those four characters. There are three other characters that you can have endings with: one lesbian romance, one great friendship, and one romance/friendship with a character who is, from what I've read, struggling with his asexuality (I have yet to play his route so please do not take my word for it). There are also a number of endings that you can reach all by your lonesome! Romance is not forced and friendships are encouraged in this game. Gameplay is half stats-based and half choice-based. The stories are cute and funny and the character designs are all very pretty. I've logged almost 24 hours and still have yet to reach even half of the endings, so this will definitely keep you entertained for a while.All in all, really a great game.			"

												I like dating sims. This one is cute and fun, and whilst I don't know a lot about writing, I think it's very well written. None of the characters come across as creepy like a lot of dating sims, they're all really likeable. I feel a little off about the romance route for the 15 year old though...By far my favourite part was how they handled the romance between the 18 year old main character and a 35 year old guy. I was dreading that route, but the whole time the emphasis was on mc understanding what she was asking for and her consent.Basically it's cute. Buy it if you're into otome games or dating sims in general.			"

Early Access Review
								By far the best VN/dating sim I have ever played. Even as an early access game, the price is definitely worth it. The storylines are engaging (to the extent where at times I had 'heart in mouth' moments), the art is impeccable and the characters are very well rounded and believable.I suppose the best part of the game is that it's actually quite hard. It's challenging to get the endings you want; I have spent hours trying to unlock different CGs and get all of the endings and I'm not even halfway through yet. As irritating as it can be when I get to the end and find a 'bad romance' ending, I'm glad this game is worth more than a couple of plays through. I can't wait until the next update!			"

												Fluff? CheckHot characters? CheckSomewhat plain protagonist? CheckYup. That's an otome game, alright. Not a bad one, but not a specially brilliant one either. Nice artwork. Nice voice acting. Nicely written. Not especially creative. If you are into otome games, then you'll surely enjoy this. I know I did. If you want a revolutionary storyline...you're probably better off looking for something else.			"

								Game: Backstage PassType: Visual Novel, Slice of Life, Anime, Dating SimHours Logged: 18Since this visual novel was on sale on steam I had to give it a try. And I figured I’d write a quick review before it went off of sale. Check it here. It’s 45% off at the moment so: $16.50. This is the first time I’ve seen it on sale and I’ve had it on my wishlist for awhile. So, this may be the biggest discount we get. Or as it looks like they just recently added the voices it may be that as they move forward they are trying to garner more positive reviews. I skimmed through some of the negative reviews and some of the issues folks have with it appear to have been resolved. Also, it looks like they went a really LOOOOONNNGG time without updates. It’s an early access game and just BTW as it stands I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it for the $30 price tag. Game Play Pretty straightforward. You are in school so part of your day will be filled with that and you have to decide what you want to with your free time: work, blog, study,go running, sleep, tutoring, go out with friends, or go out on the town. Each choice will effect your stats and your stats impact your relationships with other characters. Certain stats appeal to certain potential romantic interests.  You have dialogue choices while interacting with characters which will effect your relationships and what jobs and parties you choose to go to will impact your relationships and career options. Choose wisely. ArtThe art in my view was in the plus column. It’s very well drawn and has a fair bit of variety. The opening video is animated (if you search backstage pass in my tags you will find a gif set of it). It’s cute. There is also an animated video at the end, but I don’t have it unlocked. Can’t wait to get it though. CharactersThere are several characters you can pursue. But as I haven’t successfully gotten them all....I can’t really talk about all the characters. My first playthrough I got  Benito as a romantic option. I didn’t find that route too difficult and didn’t need to go back to old saves to make it work. Benito is cute, younger than your character and has a backstory which you slowly uncover as you go along. Second playthrough I didn’t end up with anyone. But I was attempting at Adam. I can’t seem to figure him out. As I like to play games cold the first few times I may not figure him out until I find a walkthrough for assistance. I got John romantically pretty easily as well once I was focused. He’s cool headed, romantic and older. Honestly, my personal preference meant his interactions were the most fun. I also got to the romance option with Matthew. He is the most full in my opinion. He’s pretty and he’s social awkward. If that appeals....There are also three side options to romance (at least I think so?). I haven’t managed to get any of them even though I did try. I think I may have gotten close with two of them as I did get additional scenes with them and phone number, but I haven’t been successful in in my pursuit yet. Overall There are some funny moments, you will probably like at least one of the romanceable characters, you need to save often to go back and fix what you did if you make a mistake, and the gameplay is a bit tricky and if you aren’t invested will probably be annoying. I did have some issues with responsiveness like delays in clicking a button or sometimes it not clicking which was irritating. Not sure if that is just me or what. Anyway, I really enjoyed this game and I am excited to see what happens when we finally get a finished product!			"

Early Access Review
								Okay. As someone who's stuck with it and hung in there for over 3 years, I love this game. I've loved it since it was a charming little game with no voices, no ending animation, and missing a lot of the endings it has now, and I love it even more now that it's closer to completion. Each update during this journey has felt like another layer of polish, allowing it to shine like the gem it is. I love visual novels, but I like to consider myself fairly picky when it comes to which story I want to try out, and this caught my eye immediately. The protagonist is relatable to me, and the characters seemed absolutely interesting, from what I saw of them, so I had to give it a try. I have never regretted that decision even now.The art, while it puts me off in a few rare scenes (I'm a bit fussy, so sometimes this happens. I even get put off by my own art, so whatever), is overall very lovely and nice to look at. The characters are alive, interesting, and relatable. The music is just... It's hard to describe it as anything but gorgeous and very soothing. The game is even voiced by professional actors with quite the history in anime and video games, so you know you're not going to regret leaving the voices on. There's even a lot of endings to try and get (some are very challenging) and some very unique achievements!Overall, this game has stolen my heart and I love it to bits. I give it a solid, and deserving 20/10. After all, it was fun to play even in its alpha build years ago, and it's even more fun to play again and again now. They've even promised to update with the full release version soon, so what are you waiting for? Go play it. Now.			"

								This is an early access game at the moment, of course it has flaws, but even so; this is really an amazing game!At first I was really not sure if I'd buy this game before it was fully finished, but I couldn't stop thinking about it. After a month of this game constantly on my mind I just couldn't wait anymore, and I don't regret buying it at all. The really sad part was that the script crashed after 6 hours of playing, but I don't actually mind starting over because of the amazing gameplay.So if you like visual novel games like magical diary, shira oka, katawa shoujo etc. give this game a chance, you won't regret it!

Early Access Review
								Not a bad game; I'd say it's worth it if you're into the whole stat raising thing and like to go through a bunch of trial and error to get different endings, considering this one has 16 endings for you to spend more or less 80 hours on, considering that at least two of the routes I've already finished took me about 5 hours to complete (or maybe I'm just very slow).Getting straight to the point, it gets repetitive, expected out of a stat raising otome. I wouldn't say it's repetitive to the point you just want to bash your head into the computer screen though, seeing as there are certain events from time to time, depending on whether you accept an offer or not, on what you decided to do that week, and some specific things, which I accidentally did before looking at the guide and seeing that X thing would only trigger by doing Y and Z before.The art also isn't bad; the backgrounds were nicely done, and the sprites for each character is ""unique"", I guess you could say. Many times I've seen otomes having some sort of same-face syndrome with their handsome men and cute girl sprites, after all. Considering this is the same artist that has worked on RE: Alistair, sakevisual's first project if I'm not mistaken, it's impressive how much they've improved (though I must also admit their other artworks are just as great). I guess my only problems with the sprites are Matthew's chin when in front view and Adam's palm tree hair, but other than that, they're all unique on their own ways. Though speaking of the characters, relating to their personalities, I did find them to be unique and endearing as well, or maybe the proper word would be amusing. Some dialogue lines too made me smirk to myself, mainly Mr. Newton's there, though some things seemed a tad bit forced, like the fanboy tutor (though he is still a lovely character). Then again, as much as I'd like to say there are no people that act the way he does, I have a friend that's pretty much like he is, both online and offline. The heroine was also nicely done, and a fresh change from the, usually, meeks ones I tend to see, mainly because my main focus tends to be Eastern otomes though, and social values all differ, but anyways. Depending on your choices, you can make her out to be hardworking, teasing and flirty at times, or a lazy bum that can even get expelled out of college. Though I don't really think there was much room for development for her, from start to finish, since she seemed pretty much the same to me, but my views may change as I go through other routes.Another system I enjoyed is the ability to change clothes depending on the season, something like Tokimeki Memorial, there being certain styles the boys prefer and may mention about when in a date. My only peeve is that you couldn't wear things bought during other seasons, because I mean, I have shirts that I'll wear from Spring to Winter and the cycle continues. I can understand not wearing a thick jacket and a pair of boots during Summer, but a skirt or shirt bought during Spring should also be alright once Summer rolls around.As for the voice acting, I'm not so sure on whether I enjoyed them or not; there were some parts where the cast did a good job, and others that seemed a bit too superficial. The voice choice for each character wasn't bad, you see, but I guess it just didn't feel very natural to me at certain points.Now finally, as for the story, I'd say it's pretty straightforward, though I don't have much to comment since I only finished two routes, at the moment. You raise your stats, you get job offers, get money to buy things, depending on your choices you may go for friendship or lover route, you can give them presents during Christmas or their birthdays, you can hang out, and in the end there's the usual life lesson one or both of the characters learn once their bond deepends enough. Though personally, at least the romantic endings, aren't so satisfying; you bone'em, and then that's it. It'd be interesting if there were some sort of after-story rather than just finishing it right at the moment, like showing how they're doing a few months after getting together. It just feels a little ""incomplete"" to me, as if the endings were done a bit on a rush.Overall, it's not a perfect game, but it's enjoyable and has its own charms, like many other games, I'd say. Bonus points for getting Mili to compose the opening there though; they're one of my favourites.			"

												Backstage Pass is a visual novel that lets you take the roll of Sian Gooding, a professional makeup artist that works with her friend Adam Eaton. She is about to start college and its up to you to help her through it.      The game features 15 different endings, and has animations from Studio DEEN. Now that is an impressive name for an indie game, for those of you unaware, Studio DEEN is a studio in Japan that has made a large Variety of widly known and critically acclaimed anime. Some well known anime they have done are Higurashi No naku Koro ni, Hell Girl, 07 Ghost, Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Bladeworks, Umineko no Naku Koro ni, (while not a very good adaption of the vn, it is still known by the public), Hetalia World series, ETC.      Wow that is an impressive company to have helping oyu out as an indie studio. On to the important part of the review, the game.     This game, oh man, this game is a good visual novel. I am currently trying to get Adam as romance. I will then return to try to get all the other endings. Anyway, this game is an amazing game. The art is really good, the dialogue is good with little to no typos, and there is full voice acting, aside from Sian but I usually just try to do a voice, not easy being a guy and all, regardless, this game is amazing I would highly reccomend this to anyone who wants to play a really good visual novel.     There are some bugs with the voice acting, for instance I was talking to Lloyd, and for some reason his line was said with Benito's voice. Which is fine and all its a tad bit jarring, there was another time when I was talking with Benito and he spoke in Adam's voice, but thats it, there are also some comical issues with the voice acting where you will hear multiple takes of the line someone said, but its usually only with background characters and happened to me only 3 times. Either way, i would give this game a 7/10. Really good, would like a bit of these issues solved, as it is jarring and takes away from the Immersion. Regardless this game is really good, I would advise play through the game once without any help from walkthroughs, as it will be fun. I did it and almost ended with a 4.0, sadly it was a 3.99 but all well. Anyway, try this vn it is really good!			"

Early Access Review
								Overall Rating: 8/10  My main problem with this game is that certain achievements are extremely difficult to get, such as; Life of a Pro, Good at Everything, Director, and Moving up,  Now some of these should be somewhat difficult, that IS why they're achievements after all, but some are practically impossible, and the Director achievement doesn't even have any sort of description. My other main problem is how slowly it's taking to complete the game. Yes, this is a widely stated complaint, but it's that way for a reason.   Also, the music tends to be too loud unless you mute it, though that will most likely be fixed when the voices are added in. Unlike most people, I don't seem to have much trouble on the routes, though I haven't gone on any of the friend routes yet.   The last problem I had made it difficult to finish certain routes, though this only happened once of twice. A glitch where the emails didn't show up occured, which made it so that I couldn't accept certain jobs, which effected some characters routes.Overall it was a good game, and I quite enjoyed it.			"

Full Review On YouTubeA stunningly ambitious, sprawling stat-raiser with compelling characters and a ton of replayability. Some routes are more difficult than others, but overall this game is an insane achievement. This may just be the best Western otome game out there.Pros:-Sixteen endings, all of which have distinct and varied plots-Complex, multi-faceted characters who're charming and memorable-Mature, realistic storytelling that doesn't fall into the typical otome ""tropes""-Incredibly high production values, the music, art and animations are all top-notch-Up to around eighty hours of gameplay, depending on whether you're a completionist or notCons:-Ending requirements can be fairly strict, and some routes require a LOT of stat juggling-Important events aren't always telegraphed - you'll sometimes miss out on a romantic date because you had already agreed to work on that day. Overall, this game is incredibly impressive, and a must-play for any fan of otome visual novels.			"

												I love this game!Idk why there are that many negative reviews.You can customize your characters clothes purchased from the shop in the game according to season.You can go to the arcade or go eat pho with someone (this game had me craving pho the whole time).The story is great and intriguing.You can purchase gifts and bake cupcakes for the person you like and/or friends.You can choose which traits to raise points on and work for.A good amount of replay value.The only two things I disliked were:It chooses a guy earlier on rather than later in the game.You can really only focus on a certain trait to raise points on because there isn't enough time or energy for all.I highly recommend this game, due to the some negative reviews I was a bit skeptical about it-but, I am really glad I went and purchased it anyway. I also bought it for a friend.			"

												Backstage Pass is the first game I purchased on Steam. I play otome games regularly, one of my favourite otome games of all time has to be Amnesia: Memories which I highly recommend but I have to say this is by far one of the best I have played. The artwork is lovely and the storyline is intriguing. I really appreciate the effort that has been put in to creating this game. I hope sakevisual make another otome game with a similar art style but obviously different story. My favourite character is Nichole, her personality was not what I expected. I predicted her to be a really nasty piece of work but she soon became quite friendly. She is also very cute and ambitious. My least favourite character has to be Matthew because his shyness is not appealing to me.I have gained half of the achievements for this game after playing it for 33 hours. In that time I have not gotten an achievement for any romantic and friendship routes. Forever alone. 9/10 -KawaiiCabbage.			"

								I decided to buy this game soley based on the wonderful anime-like intro. lol. I honestly dont regret buying this game, even though for 30$ you are buying an unfinished product, and its been about a year since the game came out.... As you can see I've spent 10 hours in game so far and managed to get the 'uneventful year' achievement. Game play is honestly fun and before you know it, hours have passed, however I think falling in love shouldn't be so difficult. I think the game would be 100% better if:1) It was completely finished (well duh lol)2) Allowed you to wear what you want regardless of season (it was quite annoying to have my outfit on point but could't wear it because it wasn't the right season) and also explain what the cool, cute, and classy stats for clothes are and how it effects the game or your romancing....3) Had an option where you could give gifts to boost your likeability on times other than christmas and birthdays. (Then again maybe playing how I would react to people in real life isn't the best idea to win over the bishounens. Although I did buy plenty of gifts and didnt have an option to bribe them to love me... goes to show money can't buy you romance.)I still recommend the game if you have the funds to get and don't mind spending 30$ for an unfinished game.

It's a perfect grafic novel for girls. I find some of the characters completely adorable. I also like how they use English names for the characters. I'm very imprested with thestory line considering it's the beta. I don't see any typos so far it's clear that the producers spent a lot of effort trying to make this a good game. I especally like how Matthew is shy dispite being a modle and the british voice John has. I would completely recommend this game to any girl who likes anime. By far this is my one of my favorite anime games. I would love to see how much improvement the game will have after it officaly comes out.			"

								Fun and challenging. I loved this game. It's nice to see a 'dating' sim where romance isn't the only option. You can take friendship routes with each of the main love interests (weirdly you can't be 'friends' with more than one per playthrough).You can also go independant, which, unusually for a dating sim, is not a lose condition. The 'worst' ending of the game is being expelled, and that's hard to get wihtout actively trying. It IS hard to get any specific ending, getting the 'good' endings is really hard work, requiring high stats, and correct choices throughout. More than once I thought I'd done everything right, only to find I'd missed a key choice or stat, and had a very mediocre ending. The game also contains a saphic love interest (always nice to see!) and a 'romance' path with an aesexual character (nice to see ace people represented in games). In short I loved this game, and have sunk a LOT of hours into it. It's still being devloped, so at the moment there are a few bugs, but even so it is very enjoyable.			"

								I really enjoyed playing this game! The artwork was nothing to look down on and the characters themselves are some of the most realistic characters I've ever seen/interacted with in any visual novel game I've played!Even though it's still in early access, the storylines are well written and the characters personalities are unique. The only thing I mildly dislike is the fact that there is a lot of reading and not as many choices as I'd like. But that's my own opinion.I thoroughly enjoyed the feature where you could change your character's outfits. Honestly I've never come across that in other visual novel games where you can actually decide what top goes with which bottom.So I reccomend this game to people who like visual novels with stories that will draw you in and make you like the characters more!(Edit made 21/12/2014)I have come across a problem with the loading feature, I don't want to change my review suddenly but it's too big to ignore. If I try to load a saved game it will play the scene to the end of the sequence then it will freeze and soon after send me back to the title screen.			"

Maybe not now, but when it's officially released, it could be. I play a lot of visual novel like games and I have to say, this is definitely at the top of my list. It has beautiful artwork, and interesting storyline, and plenty of multiple endings.

Early Access Review
								Backstage Pass is a really well made game, and for early access it seems quite polished to me! I really can't wait to be able to hear voice acting, because the samples sound good, and it would add a lot to the dialogue.  The dialogue is fun, and I found myself giggling on more than one occassion - this game really sucked me and got me excited to keep playing. I really wanted Sian to do her best, so I tried my hardest to build her good states and keep her career on track. Honestly, stat raising games can get a little tedious; I've played my fair share of them and while they've never particularly bothered me personally, I find Backstage Pass general has a good interplay between story and stat raising gameplay.Notably the art is fantastic, though I always felt Adam looked a little... awkward. I dunno, something about his sprite. But aside from that, I loved the character expressions, and the change in clothes, and the cg's were looooveellyyyy - I remember seeing the one where Benito broke his arm and I just - wow, nice gore dude!I have to say I love the way the story handles issues like social anxiety and other disorders as well - it's not mocking or insensitive, and it really made the whole experience and plot better as a whole. There was also the forum for Vice/Versus which I personally loved reading - the fans were funny and totally accurate to life. That's another thing about Backstage Pass - with a few exceptions, the dialogue often doesn't feel forced.Having said all this however, I do have my gripes about the game. While it's mentioned that excercise is supposed to lower your stress, no matter what I did with it, my rates never really seemed to change, and it seemed I was having to sleep more often than not just to prevent Sian from getting sick, with no real improvement. This was frustrating, and if I hadn't been so convinced my stats just werent high enough, I would have just stopped having Sian excercise altogether. Another thing, having only had the time to play through Benito's route, I'm not entirely sure if it's just my ending or what, but it ends verrrryyy suddenly. Sian and Benito kiss and pronounce love for one another and the game just ends. Suddenly I'm done playing. It was very jarring, and kind of completely tore me out of the experience - it was really frustrating. I didn't feel like I reached any closure. Forgive me if the comparison isn't known, but in Tokimeki Memorial you get a follow up from your year; ""I did this well in school and this happened for me"" etc, and then a short piece about the protagonist and their love interests continued relationship.I didn't feel that at all with the ending I got; Benito's arm was still broken, Sian's future was up in the air, and while I could speculate all I like about what happened after I never got any of that closure. Did Benito become world famous??? What happened to Sian's career? Did they end up travelling together? Did Benito ever talk to his parents?? Not even a little hint of that. They kissed and confessed their love and that was the end. I honestly thought my game messed up and reloaded a save but it was the same.So basically, I really hope the endings are fleshed out way more in the future - and hey maybe it was just the route I took, or maybe I had to do something else?? I don't know. Either way, it was kind of a sad finish for a really good game.Having said that, people should totally buy this game, it is well worth the price, and considering this is still early access there is plently of room for improvement in all areas! Backstage Pass is a wonderful game with a good outlook.			"

								I know that Backstage Pass is in early access but so far I really have enjoyed the game and would full on recommend this to anyone on full release. The characters were likable and the story flowed, got you into a pretty regular routine. I'm not sure if I was just a nut bag and ran through a whole story in six hours or if because of early access it's shortened but either way was sweet and to the point and the ending I got was moderately satisfactory (I am a little spoiled and like over the top romantic lovey dovery endings) but I wasnt disappointed. I will indeed be going back and trying different pathes and love interests soon just to feel the game out on different levels. Can't wait to see what the other stories hold in store for me!			"

								I usually doesn't give bad review about otome games because I want to see more of them but this game was such a disappointment. It's been a whole year and we still waiting for the voices . The story is too short for that price. Even the raising stats become boring at some point. The art good tough. Such a shame because I was a big fan of RE:Alistair and I was really waiting for this game thinking it will be a big hit. Now I'm just crying over my lost money. For that price go buy yo jin bo, same price but more storyline and dude to date. Avoid this game unless you have a lot of money in your pocket and even if you have that much money go spend it on charity at least someone will be happy. I might seem harsh but really I feel like the person who make the game was just thinking about riding the popular wave of otome games it's a shame for the community. A lot of free otome games are better than this one.			"

								Before I start the actual review I would like to point out that I only have done ONE ending so far.This is a great game. I love how you get to customize what you do on a weekly basis as well as all of the clothes. All of the guys are really cute (though I feel like a bit of a pedofile for Benito o.e) What this needs is more places you can save the game. I want to be able to save before I choose what I want for the next week. There have been so many times where I needed to stop playing, and I can't stop because I want to finish the week AND weekend.			"

								honestly, i love this game. the characters are so diverse in personality and route wise. i've played multiple visual novels and this is personally one of my favorites. the voices fit the characters SOOOOO WELL. the writing is absolutely superb, and the romance is fantastic! there are a few issues ive had with the game personally. matthews route seems to be bugged, i even followed a walkthrough for the super happy ending and still did not get it. i highly recommend this game to anyone who loves vn. the stats are a bit tideous but compared to the story i dont think its too much of a bother. if i could change one thing, it would be to have a romance arc with Llyod as well. ut otherwise i am completely satistfied with this game. considering its still in early access, im hoping there's more to come! <3			"

								This is probably one of my favorite Otome games I've played, and I've played more than I'd like to admit. Fact of the matter is, this is a great game, and yes it isn't officially released and the voice acting wasn't done forever and there are no updates, on Steam or the SakeVisual website, but guess what? Their Tumblr has lots of updates and even explains why the game doesn't have full voices yet, the tl;dr version is that the studio gave the space and time to a bigger game and so they actually couldn't get it done but now it has voice acting though I always disable that stuff anyways. It is a great game, not exactly worth the price and the route's can be quite difficult but that's what people want from otome games half the time, half the challenge is figuring out how to romance your favorite or getting a secret route, now granted I said ♥♥♥♥ that and looked up a guide but that's because I value the destination in games more so than the journey. Maybe try and get a discount before buying it but other than that, this is a fantastic game with a really beautiful art style and at this point most VN/Dating Sims make me run away because of the art.tl;dr go to sakevisual.tumblr.com and maybe wait for a sale? steer clear if you dislike trying to figure out how to romance the characters and don't wanna use a guide			"

								I have had this game on my wishlist for a few years. To be honest, it was mostly the price that kept me from purchasing. Yesterday, I decided to finally bite the bullet and purchase it. You guys? This was worth every penny. I found the characters to be really well written, and I found myself smiling and laughing along with happy moments and jokes alike. and not the ""heh, that was cute"" like straight up laughing. The Art is -fantastic-. I liked a lot of the music, and honestly, the backgrounds for the characters are really well done. I felt as though I wanted to learn about all of them. I don't want to spoil anything, but the devs did a really great job. The replay value is high, since there are many different endings you can strive for. Bought this last night, got two endings and I've got 9.2 hours on record as I write this. I  wasn't sure how I was supposed to -get- the endings. There isn't any huge hint on what some of the guys like or what you strive for. My first ending, I didn't end up with any of them, which was fine, because I aced school (nerd!) and my second ending I ended up with John, who I have seen that many people struggle to get, so obviously I was doing something right? I did struggle with all the different gift options I could get, but couldn't give them out. Both endings, I had a whole bunch of gifts sitting there, that I never had a chance to use, and they were a waste of money. I was hoping that when you invited characters out, they would get used, but the did not. it would be a nice feature to add those in as options to gift when hanging out with the characters, similar to how cupcakes are. (cupcakes are also part of the game, so it gets bonus points just for that!)The game is really fantastic. I'm only sorry that I put it off for so long. 10/10			"

												I love this game and now that is out offically I'm happy to come out a tell people to get it.This game this a otome game were you play as a girl named Sian Goodin. Sian is just starting her frist year in collage and you must deside how she does this. There are four main boys (and some side people) that you can pick from and become a good friend or something more.The one main thing I like about this game is that there are so many differnt ends (like 3 per person) that you can play this many times and get something differnt. So if you are looking for another Visual Novel/Otome that won't be to quick or to long and boring this is for you.			"

												First impressions... Probably one of the best VN's I have ever played. On or off Steam. Clearly lots of thought/detail went into this. Lots of different scenes! Pretty artwork. Really good voice acting. Can tell there will a lot of replayability to get all the different endings. Music is alright. Nothing memorable but not annoying either.Only 4 guys you can date though? Ehhh. The one thing I do like about it though, that while the options seem limited (maybe I can unlock other dates later) - the guys don't really fall into the standard tropes of other game characters. I mean they do, but they don't. If you have played other games on Steam like Pub Encounter or Office Lovers or Dangerous Romance you will know what I mean. You know, the tsundere guy (I guess would be John maybe?) or the guy who is lovable but kinda slow/clumsy? (Adam?) IDK... I feel like the personality types in this game are a bit more...complex and fluid. Hard to put it into words but it seems more natural and less forced/formulaic, which I appreciate. It's more fun to play.I am very excited there is at least one female romance option in this game! Bi and gay girls rejoice!!! ^_^However, I am sad that you cannot - I repeat - cannot!!! date Lloyd. D: D: D: Srsly wtf, devs? Throw me a bone here. Let me patch dat sh!t. Or like, update with bonus content or something, gahhhh. Dyin' here. ;___;Would even be willing to pay for it in DLC despite already paying $25 for this game. (I waited over a year to buy this b/c I could not bring myself to pay the full price for it with all the negative reviews due to it being in greenlight limbo status for so long sans voiceovers and so forth.) If this game did NOT have the good voice overs it has...I doubt I would have bought it at nearly full price!! Still think it's worth it tho...that aside... the guys...from my POV thus far:Adam - oni-chan/big brother type. sweet but kinda lazy/boring.Matthew - awkward shy/nervous prettymanboy dudeJohn - tsundere @S$hole with a deep, emo, mysterious side. probably the oldest (?) dateable dude (OK he is kinda growing on me a bit, hah. Must be the accent.)Ben(ito) - high energy youthful spirited one. perceptive and kindly. a bit immature. ((sadly I doubt I will go for him just due to the fact that my ex BF IRL was a magician and he was a total cucksucka who ruined magicians for me forever.... SORRY BENITO I JUST CAN'T...)) Nicole - the only female romance option AFAIK...don't know enough about her yet but first impression = vapid teenybopper. (OK turns out she has many layers... will need to peel those back on my 2nd go through!!)Alvin - AHHH omfg, Alvin. So far my favorite character. What can I say? I always fall for this type... but you know, he is apparently only a friend option so wtf? I think that is b.s... LOL. highly recommend this route though if you like awkward and nerdy but sweet guys.Also I don't know if anyone else noticed this or not but... the main character... (yes her name is pretty awful Sian pronounced like Shawn? really?! wtf. I just hope it grows on me. lol...) she has really bad anxiety/claustrophobia/maybe agoraphobia. This isn't really represented much in games like this at all... or in games, period. So as an individual suffering from anxiety problems, this makes me happy to see. Few of my friends seem to understand it. Sometimes I just don't. Like. Going. Out. Or Crowds... just sayin'. I hope it raises awareness for others with similar issues... though to quote Sian ""IT'S NOT A FLAW."" lol. <3 It is weird hearing a girl referred to as a Shawn/Sean/Shaun. That's my boyfriend's name IRL, so it is very odd. Took me some getting used to but I am slowly not noticing it anymore.lastly.... everytime the main char states she is uncertain about a major I am like screaming at the screen PICK ENGINEERING YOU DUMB TW4T....MAKE MONEY TO TAKE CARE OF YO SICK @$$ PARENTS. DON'T BE A FAKKIN BARISTA FOR ALL YO LIFE. don't be a homeless crack addict. be an accountant. or be a pole dancer.....IDK..... sh!t. then again in this game you somehow magically know all these famous people even though you grew up semi isolated in Hawaii... it never says what island she is from but I can only assume Oahu? (they only say ""one of the smaller ones...) anyway... I felt like at some points in this game you end up either p!ss broke or just wiping your bum with $100 bills, hah. so random. also if you wanna unlock every ending, be prepared to use a guide. there is a really good one in the Steam discussions group... otherwise be prepared to rip out some hair.

								Since this game is a beta, I'll change my review/opinion once the full version comes out.After spending roughly 4 hours into the game trying to get the game mechanics, I'm enjoying it so far. As a visual novel/otome fan myself, I knew I'd enjoy it from the start (as I've had my eye on this game ever since it was announced). I love the characters (I have my eye on you, Matthew...), the main character herself (she's quirky, shy, not afraid to speak her mind), and the story so far.  I like that you can change clothes and get different ones depending in the seasons. And this is where I found my first game-breaking glitch: I had 2 Winter pieces, but didn't have enough money to get Winter footwear. I thought this was no problem, since by the time I got some money I'd get it. But then the game forces me to get into my Winter clothing and I'm basically stuck in the clothing choice panel (and no way of going back but to start a new game, since I didn't save prior to that...) Aside from that, no major problems.			"

								Don't let the price fool you,  it's insanely worth it if you are looking for a visual novel that is so story packed.  It's well thoughtout,  and the storylines are simply amazing.  It's not your average visual novel however,  this is taking you through an entire year of life through Sian's eyes.  there are four men within the story that you can build relationships with,  one of them you already have a backstory with,  the other three you do not.  As the year progresses you will learn that keeping in contact with these men is vital,  but also impressing them is twice as important.   The game comes with a feature where you can dress Sian in certain outfits for each season that passes by the year.   If you get a correct combination,  the man you are trying to impress,  or a man in general who you haven't tried to impress may compliment you on that outfit.  The other way is perhaps waiting for certain holidays to come by,  buying them things you think they would enjoy would be best so pay attention to what these men tell you.  You may even be invited to certain events with them if you play your cards correctly.  This will build up hearts in the statistics section when you reach the weekend.There are other cute activities that you can do,  such as checking the message boards,  or checking your email for jobs to earn some of that extra cash.  All in the way to describe this game is you will not have a dull moment,  and you will not believe that it's an entire year of a makeup artists life.   "

								Though I have only completed a couple of routes, I find it highly difficult to get some of the ending, due to the fact that you have to be very particular on how you play the game. One of the hardest routes that I am in the process in trying to complete now is trying to get the model (hehe) to date me. It's hard, because of how you have to get the money to buy the gifts he want's ect. Then the fact that you didn't know about the e-mail's unless you check them constantly. I wish that you would do some sort of notification thing for the e-mails so it is easier to know if you should check them or not. Though, I have only played a bit of it so far I give it potential to be a great game in the future of it's development. I can't wait to hear the voices with the game it's going to be very interesting.			"

								I saw this game recently and got intrigued by the trailer and art style. I was really excited to see a VN/otome game that has the similar ""choose what to do during the day"" and ""buy and dress up your character"" as the Tokimeki Memorial: Girl's Side. After seeing that screenshot, I knew I was going to like the game. I've been looking for something like that and replaying Tokimeki wasn't satisfying me. The art is far better and the MC is very adorable. Sure, she has some flaws and is still (maybe) a bit of damsel-with-crowd-issues but at least she's still a far better MC than any other VNs I've played before. I don't mind that it's not VOed. Just listening to the music is nice too. The writing is good. I'm playing on a mac and so far no bugs and no typos. And it's really cool that she's working on TV/entertainment business. It's definitely a setting that I haven't seen yet. Again, stressing the fact that she's not your average powerless girl. She actually has a job and is good at it.If any of you played Tokimeki, you'd definitely enjoy this. If you don't like status-raising type of VN then you probably won't like it. Still, bug your friend to buy it for you and try it for yourself (you cheapskate) perhaps you'd like it.			"

								I felt like Sian had more depth and personality than most other protagonists I’ve played with. She had distinct personality traits/quirks that were hinted at (or made obvious) at various points in the story rather than being a complete blank or only having those traits appear for certain routes (e.g., she’s got super good aim/excels at shooting games).I’ve completed each of the main romance routes, two secret routes, and three of the four friendship routes (curse you, John), and I found each one enjoyable. Again, the characters are pretty well fleshed out and each has an interesting story and relatively complex personality. I also appreciate the fact that there are multiple “independent” endings you can achieve that still feel like successes rather than a “boohoo, I’m still sad and single” ending. I also like that you can continue interacting with all of the characters even after committing to a particular route rather than cutting off everyone but the main person.I’ve seen some people complain about the stats building and/or the overall game being too hard. While I agree that there are some parts that got a little frustrating (the friendship routes in particular), I don’t think it’s overly difficult. For this game, it’s just a matter of figuring out how things work, who prefers what, and focusing on the ending you want. Then again, I like a little more strategy and challenge than a lot of these types of games typically offer.Would I like to see a few things done differently? Sure (a dialogue option for John similar to Adam’s aquarium one, Rachel route, some stats related activities for the weekends…). But overall, I think the story is solid, the characters are interesting and likeable, and the general gameplay is both challenging and fun. With all of those endings, I think it’s got enough replayability (especially after the final version with voices gets updated) make it worth the $.			"

								It's fun to play and well-written, but it is unfinished and at this time it is not worth paying the full price.  Once it's full finished, though, I think it would definitely be worth it.  The art is lovely and the game is well-made.  Once finished, it'll be fully voiced in English as well.  I also appreciate that there are female routes.			"

								I'm anxiously awaiting the completion of this game. Honestly, I suck at figuring out how to get the best endings in these games, and even after playing this one through probably ten times, I still needed the help of others to NOT end the game utterly alone.  Hahahaha :) But it's all good, because it is a fun challenge. I love the romance. I REALLY hope that they let you romance Lloyd and Alvin too, but we shall see. I love the music and the art.  None of the characters are particularly annoying either, which is a major plus.  It's a good long game that you can spend lots of hours on.  I'll be honest and say that I have absolutely no desire to get the ""friendship"" routes, so I can't comment on those, but I'm sure I'll probably end up with a few of them through the course of trying to romance the pants off of the guys. ;)			"

								Ok!  I've about wrapped up my early access experience with Backstage Pass. I've got to say that it's been an immensely enjoyable game, and I will probably end up re-playing through my favourite routes when the voices are finally integrated and the game completed. I did have a lot of trouble placing myself on friendship routes initially and often got ""rom-zoned"" and I found it was a game where I did have to do a bit of googling and poking around to get things just right, but personally I don't find that to be largely a con. It's a fairly regular otome style stat-raiser game, but I found that the characters are all fairly well done and develop nicely whether you pursue them for romance or friendship. Some of the side characters showed early signs of some shoujo/otome tropes I really hate, but was pleased to find that the game developed these characters as people instead of reducing them to 2D tropes.I'd definitely recommend Backstage Pass if otome games are your slice of cake! Even in early access, I think the cost was worth it.			"

								Though I have only completed a couple of routes, I find it highly difficult to get some of the ending, due to the fact that you have to be very particular on how you play the game. One of the hardest routes that I am in the process in trying to complete now is trying to get the model (hehe) to date me. It's hard, because of how you have to get the money to buy the gifts he want's ect. Then the fact that you didn't know about the e-mail's unless you check them constantly. I wish that you would do some sort of notification thing for the e-mails so it is easier to know if you should check them or not. Though, I have only played a bit of it so far I give it potential to be a great game in the future of it's development. I can't wait to hear the voices with the game it's going to be very interesting.			"

								My biggest gripe would probably be how easily and quickly my stats go down, though. For example, one day I have 12 in excersize, even if I have low fatigue, it drops back to a 1 or something and that I found sort of annoying since you need ti get higher stats to maintain various things throughout the game. I played about a month in the game and my stats kept dropping by the end of the week.That said, I really liked the characters alot - in particular Matthew and Sian. Adam too. The writing is well done, and the game itself offers several elements to make a very unique slice of life dating sim.The art, graphics, backgrounds are all very polished and well done.			"

Granted it has the standard plan a week, due stuff, and up a skill. But thats that there are even little events that take place during the week so it doesnt feel as bad as it usually would.

								Don't let the price fool you,  it's insanely worth it if you are looking for a visual novel that is so story packed.  It's well thoughtout,  and the storylines are simply amazing.  It's not your average visual novel however,  this is taking you through an entire year of life through Sian's eyes.  there are four men within the story that you can build relationships with,  one of them you already have a backstory with,  the other three you do not.  As the year progresses you will learn that keeping in contact with these men is vital,  but also impressing them is twice as important.   The game comes with a feature where you can dress Sian in certain outfits for each season that passes by the year.   If you get a correct combination,  the man you are trying to impress,  or a man in general who you haven't tried to impress may compliment you on that outfit.  The other way is perhaps waiting for certain holidays to come by,  buying them things you think they would enjoy would be best so pay attention to what these men tell you.  You may even be invited to certain events with them if you play your cards correctly.  This will build up hearts in the statistics section when you reach the weekend.There are other cute activities that you can do,  such as checking the message boards,  or checking your email for jobs to earn some of that extra cash.  All in the way to describe this game is you will not have a dull moment,  and you will not believe that it's an entire year of a makeup artists life.   "

								This is my review after playing some hours:This is a nice challenging ""otome game"" with beautiful music and art. It's not just a reading and click game, You also need to raise ur stats to get an ending. The main character/herione can be  sweetgirl, tomboy-ish, nerd and a work holic but its up to you to decide it.The voice over are really well done (I really like it because its saves me from more reading after playing the game for like 2 hour or more XD) and this game is so addictive. I just can't stop playing this game until I have an ending.The only bad thing about the game is (and probably why it gets some negative reviews.) that isn't really (feel) complete at all. which is also a good thing because u can expect more endings and character route in the future.BUT... The updates are (very) slow. (wait that are two bad things about the game XD)Even though the updates are very slow, you should give this game a chance!			"

												I can actually change this now, and I do honestly really like this game. I've gone through it a few times (John is awesome) and I can say if you like both a management kind of game or visual novels you might actually find this one pretty interesting. There are quite a few paths, with a few hidden ones floating around and quite a bit of content just outside of the obvious things as well. The voice acting is something I actually like for the most part, a few characters I don't care for but that's just me. Overall I'd have to say the game is quite worth getting for those fans of visual novels and dating simulators. (Also cupcakes and outfit collectings is fairly amusing)			"

								Love It! It has a slow start and takes awhile before you can start making choices but once it does it's fantastic. I've played many, many otome games and have a few in my steam library. Many of the otome games I've started have barely been touched because I became bored too quickly with characters or story but not with this one even though it does start out slow.  Though the romance is a bit too innocent for my liking I found myself smiling through multiple routes and even laughing out loud during a couple scenes. I think that the voice overs have a lot to do with that since it adds to the characters personality ( Love, love Johns voice and John and Lloyds interactions are so fun to listen to).The art is great and the characters all have their own special personality and quirks that makes them worth multiple playthroughs. After playing it I think it would be worth the full price but I waited for it to go on sale. Totally worth the sales price for sure. Because there are so many options I would recommend a hints page for those that don't want to waste tons of time trying to get on a specific route or finding the more elusive routes. Each character has an affinity for different outfits, movies, cupcakes, gifts and lunches as well as specific stat builds. For those that like to go no hints, more power to you. It's fun either way.Pros (for me)Art is great.Voices are awesome! Really adds to the personalities. I mean REALLY.Nice story lengths.16 endings. (romance/friendship and extra side routes)Easily replayable.Good bit of humor.Lots of unlockable achievments through steam.Cons (for me)Can't romance Llyod.  I want Lloyds romance route!!!!!  Make him bi and send him my way!It does take a while before you can start making choices.Romance is a bit too innocent for me. Would like it a little more mature..they are in college for cripes sake.There are a few places that don't sync up with voice over but hardly worth mentioning.Having a hard time getting friends route endings.Can't romance Lloyd...did I mention that already?Sometimes the stats part can get a bit stale.

								A lot of people are kinda 'meh' about early access but honestly, I forgot it was early access sometimes because the only problems the game had were bits of dialogue in the game were missing its audio but it was only a couple of lines and it's not even that noticable. It also has a few bugs, like when I went to load a game, sometimes the game would crash but all I had to do was start the game up again and it would work just fine. Those are the only real problems that would prevent someone from playing the game. As for the game itself, I love being able to change Sian's (pronounced 'Shawn' not 'Seeane' like I originally thought) clothes though I hope the final game will have some more options for clothing and that some of the outfits will be a little cuter (I have a thing about ankle length skirts and this game has a few of them and it kind of bothers me but that's just nitpicking). The only other thing that bothered me was the stories in the routes because I mostly found them a little boring and hope that there might be a little more drama or background information to keep people hooked in the final game. But it is still A LOT of fun and since it's still in development, the final game looks like it'll be a lot of fun. Well, I've gone on sounding like a pretentious weirdo for long enough so all I can say is, if you like otome games, this one is a fun one to play and to also check out SakeVisual for other games they've made because they are pretty fun and a lot of them are free (though only a few of them are otome games)			"

Early Access Review
								One of the best visual novel/sim games that i have played. It has so much replay value to it. There are so many endings to it and its also a decent ""strategy"" game by planning your events out. Do not forget to check emails daily you will miss out on cool oppurtunities. It has great art, a pleasing story, and unique set of characters. It only has slight audio sounds ""yeahs, heys, no, etc"". I rate this title 9/10. Finished the benito route.Update 1/18/16 They have updated sounds for charcters :) finished the golden prince route			"

								Good length, Liked the story alot.  A bit buggy though, I could not read the emails in the slightest and I could not watch the opening video but the music still played.  If bugs were fixed this would make the ideal game.  Once debugged and voices added, it will be worth its price.  RIght now?  Not so much.			"

												Backstage pass is an incredible Visual novel,by a very talented group. Having played loved,their other game RE: Alistair Years ago,i was very excited to try a new game from them,and it tripled my expectations~The art is great,it has impressive and captivating intro and ending animations,a host of lovable characters (honestly,there was not a single on i didn't like) with great voices,and a story and world i found myself interested in.The main character,Sian,has an interesting personality- and one that i could personally relate to rather well.This game DOES require a lot of stat raising,which i know isn't everyone's cup of tea,but to be honest the stat raising somehow felt easier and more comfortable then some other games i've played in the past,which was great~$30 might be a bit much,but with all the play time,quality art,story and high replayablity,i assure you it's worth it- at least in my eyes~if you love visual novels,and don't mind stat raising DEFINITELY give this one a try. i'm sure you won't regret it :)			"
