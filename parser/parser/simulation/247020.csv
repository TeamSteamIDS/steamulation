												This is one of the most stressful games I've ever played.  And I put over 20 hours into it over a period of weeks, always coming back to it to serve another day.  You are running a restaurant, but the complexity of it severely outstrips your regular diner dash style game.  Almost every food has multiple recipes (there are something like 35 different hamburger combinations possible), and your menu has upwards of 20 items, of which you can serve 4-6 on any given day.  Manage service, janitorial requirements and a variety of other tasks.  It's hard to describe how complex and yet how engaging this game is.  It is seriously stressful, especially on the later levels, but pulling off 88 orders in a row perfectly is a rush; this is really an underrated and great game.			"

												I enjoy cooking irl and I often play flash cooking games online. But this game makes me wanna set my computer on fire and kill myself.  I thought I was gonna have fun and kill time with it. I got nothing but panic attacks! Let me put it this way. You basically have to take control of EVERY SINGLE CHORE in the restaurant! EVERY. SINGLE. CHORE! Take orders, cook, serve, do the dishes, take the trash out, set traps for rats, stop burglers, take selfies with people, go on dates. Not to mention the stress in rush hours while an inspector is watching you, so you try your best not to miss a single chore. All while cooking for impatient ungrateful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who don't even flush the toilet, so I have to do that too! This game will hurt you mentally, physically and emotionally. Because as cute and yummy as the the food will look, you will hate every single person who makes an order. Because while you finish making a fun delicious burger. You've probably missed or burned at least 4 other orders and also hurt your arm or broke a finger, from mashing every single button as fast as you can. This makes Hell's Kitchen look like a fairy land.But despite all that, it's so addicting and surprisingly fun. The kind of game you will keep going back to, even for just 5 minutes to see if you can do better, which you won't!			"

												""Your food is just meh. I might come back, dunno""SherriSoda Tower worker (God damn you!)  A great game, that gives you everything that it promises. It is casual, very grindy, very addictive and it is really funny. It is both simple and hardcore X) You start with 0 star restaurant and in couple hours you know every hobo that comes to drink beer to your place at 9 am. It is incredible funny to play with your family, sitting nearby, watching your poor restaurant management. To give names to all the visitors, to invent their biography, and to comment their choices like ""Omg lady it's you again and you want more ice cream?! you already ordered 3 scoops of ice cream in the morning, you won't fool anyone here by changing your clothes"".   So you work your way to 5 stars and posh ladies, ordering wine and lobster. Both music and  art style are lovely, food is drawn yummy and appetizing, and it makes you want to cook it in real life. Side missions like dating, vip guests, robbery and hardcore catering\iron cook events gives you healthy dose of fun and competitive expirience.   I recommend it to people who admit existence of their inner child, who understand that it is just a very cute&casual simulator, who are curious enough to read all the spam letters and food description, and who will addictively push wrong buttons while cooking the most horrible soup in the universe.

												Cook, Serve, Delicious is not your average restaurant sim. Instead of waiting tables and clearing checks, you’re more of a line cook who owns a small restaurant in a business tower. Your main goal is to achieve what every chef wants, a five star restaurant. Each day, customers order off your customizable menu and you prep and cook their food by hitting the corresponding keys to each item, such as ‘L’ to add lettuce on a burger. This sounds relatively simple but can certainly become challenging when the clock is ticking and customers are getting impatient. At the end of each day, you get a report of how you did. How many good/average/bad orders you did, how much you earned in tips and from orders, how many chores (such as washing dishes and taking out the trash) you did etc. This performance can have a negative or positive on what the game calls “daily buzz”. Buzz essentially controls how many customers will visit your restaurant, how patient they are and how much they’ll tip. Obviously, the higher your buzz, the better. Your buzz is affected by the food on your menu, as well as weather, time of day and equipment bought from the store. For example, foods such as fish or french fries are considered too smelly for mornings and will give you negative buzz during morning hours. However, fish is a high priced item and both fish and fries are quick and easy to prepare. For some players, this may outweigh the morning hours negative effects. While following the daily buzz is probably in the player’s best interest in terms of cash flow, you can still certainly ignore it and you would still be able to gradually upgrade your restaurant.Aside from working in your restaurant, you can also complete challenges to earn some extra cash. Catering events which pit you against the clock to serve as many themed dishes as possible. In Iron Cook, a clever play on the Japanese game show Iron Chef, you must serve wave after wave of orders. The orders get more complex the more waves you complete and if you mess up three orders, you fail the challenge.Somewhat similarly, in Hunger Festival, a play on Hunger Games, you must complete 20-30 orders but if you mess up even one order, you fail the challenge. While these challenges don’t add too much to the gameplay, they’re still a nice break from a day of service.As you get further in the game, you start earning silver tickets which you can use to make “silver ticket bets”. The Silver Ticket Robot challenges you to get a certain number of perfect orders in a row with the menu items s/he specifies. This gives your menu a mix-up as well as adding a little challenge to your day.Although gameplay doesn’t evolve much throughout the game and may become repetitive at times, there is certainly quite a few new recipes and equipment to buy while you improve your restaurant to be worthy of five stars and this can keep you playing for hours.

												My wife, who enjoys casual games and especially cooking games, loves this game. I hate all those things, and I also love this game. It positively oozes with love and care from its developer. This is a great example of the kind of thing that indie developers can do that big companies never could. A game that uses the best casual game mechanics, but with hardcore difficulty, with an amazing variety of content, and without any crummy monetization ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. You can tell this is a labor of love, particularly considering the huge new expansion that adds tons of new modes including a co-op campaign, completely for free, over a year after its initial release.Tip: Play this with a great big clicky keyboard.

												Cook, Serve, Delicious! is a restaurant/cooking simulator where you start with a rundown little cafe and turn it into a five star restaurant all the while cooking numerous dishes, fending off robbers and flushing blocked toilets. While the game might not sound like everyone's cup of tea it combines addictive gameplay with a good progression system to make a  fun gaming experience. As a huge fan of the Papa's Pizzeria games this was a must buy for me and I was not disappointed.+Nice simplistic graphics, food and drink is well designed and the UI is nice to look at as well+Incredibly addictive, simple gameplay that keeps you coming back for more+You can take place in bets each day which require you to get a certain combo with certain foods+You are rewarded for perfect orders and penalised for bad orders which helps push you to try as hard as you can+Lots of different dishes including drinks+Most dishes have upgrades which adds a new ingredient and new recipe cards+All recipe cards have specific names+Local co-op game mode+The hotkeys for the different ingredients are for the most part intuitive, i.e. the first letter of the ingredient is the hotkey, and if you don't like them the hotkeys can be edited+Full controller support for both the Xbox 360 Controller and the Dualshock 4 Controller+Great music+There are special events in the game which you can take part in such as catering events which earn you more money-The frequency of work orders (flushing the toilet, cleaning the dishes, taking out the trash and setting rat traps) seemed a bit too high, in particular the flushing the toilet job seemed to be very frequent even when the toilet had been upgraded-The progression on the star system is very slow and food upgrades are very expensive-Once you start unlocking more order slots (you start with four and then it increases) it becomes increasingly difficult to keep track of all of the orders you have on the go and I often pressed the wrong key and sent out an order early, breaking a combo-I had a couple of issues where I lost saves and had to replay about 2 hours worth-You can't upgrade the appearance of your restaurant apart from the automatic changes when you get a new star Verdict:7A great restaurant/cooking sim that is perfect for fans of similar games but might be quite boring for most, best to pick this up on sale.El K.

												Before I can actually say anything about the game I have to say that Chubigans, the man responsible for this creation, is easily one of the coolest and nicest indie developers I have ever had to write to.  And just on that aspect alone he deserves your money, but then he made this game and it's worth ever penny spent.Some would say, ""this game is casual."" And to them I suggest they try multi-tasking a queue of 5 burger orders at once during rush time while still needing to flush a toilet, give a thumbs up on social media, and set a mouse trap while the health inspector is watching.  That is twitch control so furious that even some pros couldn't take it.  But somehow even with the game going as frentic as it does it's still fun just making food and taking all the orders.Definitely one worth the money.			"

												Ok it's hard to describe why this game is enjoyable.It's nothing like real cooking. Trust me I've gone to school for that stuff as well as worked for 3 1/2 years in the industry. It's really not realistic.It's mostly a timed key puncher game. Hit the right keys per menu choice when ordered. Hit the right order number when the cooking time is ready. Try and keep the wait time down so they down't walk away. Hit the right keys to clean dishes, ect.. Turn up the intensity and complete the cateering challenges. Oh and you can't get to 3 stars without doing that.It's nothing like real cooking WHAT SO EVER....Yet somehow.. it's fun slamming the perfect order of nachos with over 20 possible variables down and getting a customer thumbs up. A perfect order day is bliss. Passing health inspection days a relief.And oddly enough it can give you a non drug indused case of the munchies.			"

												This feels like a rhythm game married to a restaurant simulation, and the result is delicious. If you played ""Taco Joe"" on Flash back in the day, this is that idea taken to the extreme and polished up. For the uninitiated: the game tasks you with keeping a busy kitchen moving by cooking customer's orders correctly, quickly, and while balancing other orders or demands of a restaurant. On top of that, you're also responsible for managing the ""buzz"" of your restaurant by keeping your menu fresh and balancing complex/expensive dishes with easy/cheap dishes. Complex dishes will bring in more income and potentially more customers, but also give you a greater opportunity to screw up the order.There is a demo on the developers website if you're curious. It's addictive.			"

												I want to start here: I love this game. The review that follows may sound critical at times but only because this is an ""Icarus"" game for me, i.e. it fell apart only because it got so close to the sun.I've heard some people complain that the game is too difficult, but I disagree. The difficulty felt a lot like Guitar Hero. Do you remember how you could barely keep up with songs on easy or medium the first time you played? But after trying a song on hard a few times, suddenly going back to medium felt like a cake walk? CSD is a lot like that. You can barely keep up with the small customer queue and simple orders at first, but you get used it and CSD has a wonderful, smooth difficulty curve. Eventually, you'll find yourself humming along quite nicely with an 8 person queue and all kinds of complex recipes.I really liked the mini-games that were built into the progression as well. Each of them was a nice change of pace and provided an interesting spin on the core mechanic. I also liked the way the game felt. It is very responsive and I could easily get into a rhythm on the PC version. FWIW, I much prefer the PC version to the iOS version. I was able to get into a satisfying muscle memory groove on PC and that's exactly what a wanted. A challenging game using muscle memory and twitch-based time/efficiency management.This game is so close to being perfect that I ended up more disappointed than perhaps I should be. I still readily recommend the game but with a caveat. I've put 30 hours into the game, completed the main game progression and all side challenges, purchased every recipe, every ClicknStart project and anything else I could use money for. After completing the game and playing a little beyond that, I have not yet received the 10K customers served achievement and there is still a 15k served achievement after that. However, I have no desire to grind it out. There isn't a point other than completionist satisfaction.My enjoyment came primarily from completing challenges and those have run out. I think this game could easily be a 10/10 for me with a couple minor additions:1) A challenge list that requires you to complete a perfect day with certain recipe combinations. The list could be huge as there are many possible combinations. Some would be very simple using the beginner recipes but some would be very challenging if you require 4 and 5 star variants of the difficult items. Perhaps this mode would only unlock after all recipes have been maxxed out for further end-game enjoyment.2) Expand on the mini-games. Similar to the above suggestion, have the gameshow mini-game force some challenging combinations and building up to harsher and harsher queuing restraints.3) Leaderboards so you can create your own challenges based on competitive spirit.The core for all these things is already present in the game, it just needs to be fleshed out a little. The developers did an amazing job of creating a wonderful difficulty curve and establishing a solid play mechanic that's fun and rewarding. If a later patch adds some challenges to overcome, such as my suggestions, I can recommend this game without any hesitation whatsoever. It would be top of the class for the genre. As is, I can only recommend it with the caveat that it is fun for 20-30 hours and then loses its appeal.Like I said originally though, I loved the game and only criticize it because it comes so close to being truly great. But try it out! It's cheap and even with my caveat, you're still purchasing a game that provides fun a rate of less than a half cent per minute. Hard to beat that!			"

												This game is absolutely fantastic, especially when you count in the amount of enjoyment you get for the price. The game has a great, steady difficulty incline, so whenever you feel like you're really getting the hang of all the button combinations you need to perform for every recipe, the recipes get more complicated and make you have to work for it again.This game does however definitely require you to have good muscle memory and fast fingers once you get to the later parts of the game, because some of the combinations get really complicated.

Summary:Cook, Serve, Delicious is probably the best cooking management game with huge sorts of minigames for each meal that you can prepare. There is plenty of things to do (especially with Battle Kitchen expansion) but it still might feel too much repetitive for some people - this game is served best for about half an hour per session, not more.Positives:- Well-made restaurant management. It is not hard to get into the management part of the game for a new player, even though you can see plenty of options there. - Many cooking minigames. Coming with great live cooking management of (up to) 8 meals together. It can be stressful but this stress is coming with fun!- Great keyboard controls. You can control everything with hotkeys, and that will make you faster. This is huge positive surprise this game offers, don't expect poor smartphone-ported mouse controls! (For example, instead of many slow clicks, you can just remember PSMCR PSVCR PSCR for people's most favourite lasagna! :D )- Challenges. Have you finished the main part of the game? Come on, here you go, beat all those cooking challenges! - Local co-op. Yes, you can manage a restaurant with your friends!Neutrals:- Battle Kitchen expansion is not for new players. You get thrown all top-level upgraded meals to you to make. Don't expect to enjoy this part of the game soon (and you might not even get there, more in negatives). Still, whole battle kitchen was added for free to CSD, so we can't critize its focus on experienced CSD gamers.- You have to switch most of your meal offers every day for getting more customers. This is not a bad thing but it's worth noticing that the game will motivate you into trying all meals available. (Don't expect playing in style where you can just create same easy meals over and over. You'd even get really bored soon.)Negatives:- Might get really repetitive for you. If you just sit and play it for hours in one session, you notice that you are just doing still the same over and over. You must think of CSD as about a casual game with a bit of ""fun stress"" that will offer you many hours of playtime splitted into months of your life.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Cook, Serve, Delicious! Original Release: 2013 Genre Tags: Management; Simulation; Fast-Paced; Casual; Unique My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 20-40 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Optional Recommended To: Novelty seekers; Casual gamers  REVIEWI found Cook, Serve, Delicious! to be a fun and refreshing experience.  It’s pretty simple, very easy to get into, and extremely addictive.  Little things get added as you progress (like dating, special challenge tournaments, investments, upgrades and such) but for the most part you just do the same thing from day (level) 1 to day 100.  Luckily right about when you start to get over it, you find yourself at the finish line.I was a little intimidated by it before I tried it, because it looks like it can be one of those frustrating and difficult games, where you need twitch reflexes and expert precision... but it’s actually surprisingly easy.  You do need to be fast and precise, but like: you can't even lose.  I went through some days purposely messing up every single order to see what happens, and nothing happens except for you slowing your progress to the end of the game.  That said, don't think it’s not challenging.  If you want to really conquer the game, you'll want to try to get perfect days as much as you can... and that can be quite a challenge.  Also the special challenge tournaments you need to beat for the last few sections of the game are a little challenging, but they are certainly beatable.I will be honest though, the entire aspect of the game is simply a test of your ability to perceive stimuli and coordinate multitasking of entering codes into a keyboard.  That's the whole game.  Slowly the complexity of the keyboard codes goes up, the number of things you need to multitask goes up, and little other aspects are sprinkled in to keep your mind on its metaphorical toes.  But it's fun.  And it's fresh and different.  I like puzzlers and braintwister games and I certainly hadn't experienced anything like Cook, Serve, Delicious! until I played Cook, Serve, Delicious!  If you enjoy mentally stimulating games then I think you'll like the fresh and enjoyable experience this game provides.Update:  With the free update of ""Battle Kitchen Edition"" there is now local multiplayer, weekly challenges, leaderboard contests, and some new character unlockables and customization.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												7/10+ a nice and original idea implemented well, the only other restaurant sim game i can remember is restaurant empire 1+2+ seems like a casual game , but has enough depth in gameplay to keep you interested, you choose the daily menu, upgrade staff that help doing the job faster and more efficiency, you accept daily challenges, there are a lot of things happening+ good progression of the story, becoming more difficult every day, good length for this type of game+ good controls, either clicking with mouse or pressing the right keybort button- very basic presentation, could use more polish in the graphics department- you dont create the recipes, they are just there to choose, something that is the most important and satisfying aspect of gameplay in restaurant empire games- restaurant empire is much better if you want the best game in the genre			"

												Highly addicting game. Your main goal is to serve as many customers as you can during the workday by pressing correct button combinations for each order. You're single worker in restaurant which means you'll serve several customers at once and doing catering jobs at the same time. Customers will not wait for you forever, if you're too late serving them or not giving them exactly what they wanted, they'll leave unsatisfied, giving your restaurant negative buzz for next day, which means - less customers. Basically, your restaurant's success depends on your speed, accuracy and multitasking skills (serving 5+ orders at the same time). There's also a ""manager"" part of the game (between workdays) where you organize menu list for next day, responding to mails, buying upgrades, etc. Take note that this game is not a manager simulation, success depends of your skills as a cook.This is not a game for relaxation - it's very tense from the start, the more successful you are it will be more difficult for you in later game (more complex orders, more customers) and again, you'll feel more accomplished as the game progresses. Game comes packed with many challenges and goals, including multiplayer/co-op - enough to give you dozens of playing hours. Recommended!(I played on Xbox 360 controller so I can't speak about experience on keyboard)			"

												What an awesome game, this is the sort of game that you can keep installed and keep dropping in for five minutes at a time. I couldn't do long stints playing but I have put a lot of time into CSD.It's basically one large, long QTE, but done very well. Simply press the buttons in the correct order to cook and serve various different foods. There is plenty of customization here, buying different kitchen appliances to help make more complex meals, along with things like dishwashers to sort out the chores for you. A really well thought out game that you can get really cheaply but still put tons of hours into.			"

												Doing menial tasks repeatedly over and over for hours upon hours was never more fun. It looks like a little casual title, but it is way more than that. It is excruciatingly challenging late game, requires lots of memorization and quick reflexes as well as on the fly tactical thinking.It's much much more than it appears to be.

DescriptionCook, Serve, Delicious! is a hardcore restaurant management simulator. You do all the cooking and serving (and the delicious *wink* *wink*) in your humble restaurant and, with the money you earn, you unlock new recipes and a variety of features to make your restaurant manager life easier.Warning: I'm not kidding when I say ""hardcore"". This is not a relaxing strategy/management game. It is more a ""get into flow mode"" kind of game. More like Tetris level 15 than Cooking Mama. ;)Pros Fair learning curve in normal difficulty (and all the punishment masochists could wish for in challenges and harder modes) Great variety of recipes Surprisingly deep game for the genre No F2P ""pay to play right now or wait"" dirty tricksCons Arbitrary number (20) of games to complete before you can upgrade your restaurant feels way too long Unbalanced recipes (soups require superhuman memory whereas fish is the easiest thing in the world) Gameplay sometimes gets so frantic it is stressful in a bad way (in rush hour, even in normal mode)VerdictCook, Serve, Delicious! is an amazing game that, in a way, redefines management games. Instead of a casual linear experience with a series of short levels, you're given a lot of freedom over how to manage your venture. It does require coordination, reflexes, strategic thinking and some trial-and-error guesswork.If you love cooking games, try it.If you're sick of casual management games and are ready for the next level, try it.If you like a challenge, try it.If you like games that push you all the way to a ""flow"", try it.If you hate playing with strict timing or frantic situations, stay away.If you like your games easy to master, stay away.Overall, I think most people could love this game if they gave it a good try (knowingly getting into it)... and I cannot wait for the sequel.

												Gordon Ramsay made me do it! - Seriously, I have played so many video games about killing people, killing animals, killing monsters, that it is nice to play a good game like this about sustaining life for a change.GameplayThe advertisement for this game focusses on it being a restaurant simulator. However, the business simulation part is a bit shallow: You can buy recipes and upgrade them, and after 20 days (and accomplishing some specific tasks), you get a new star for your restaurant. You can also spend money on cooking devices that unlock new recipes and other features that increase your time limits in the kitchen, or boost the ""buzz"", effectively the number of customer orders. Yet, you never buy raw ingredients, you do not hire any staff (even in a five-star-restaurant, you still cook, clean and serve everything on your own), you do not buy any visible pieces of furniture and position them strategically... the background for the UI is always static. The developer focussed more on the cooking itself than on restaurant management simulation, and this makes it more of a skill game.I call it a skill game because you win it by ""cooking"" fast and precisely. You can do it with your mouse, clicking on every ingredient and triggering phases of preparation all with your index finger; but in my experience, it is more efficient and ergonomical to learn the key-bindings by heart. You have to press a letter for each ingredient and other keys for certain acts of preparation, and if you can type those ""codes"" fluently (e.g. vegetarian lasagna: ""PSVCR PSVCR PSCR""), using all your fingers and without even looking at the ingredient list on the screen, you have a massive advantage. Fortunately, there is the option to practice every dish with an ""official taste tester"" before you put the item on your active menu and present it to real customers, and I recommend making extensive use of that option.Now, isn't cooking and keeping the restaurant clean like work? Yes, it is. This game actually feels like work. BUT it is rewarding work: The voice-acted reactions of your customers when you serve a perfect meal (""M-hm! Hey-ey-ey!""), the balloons falling under loud applause when you receive a new star, or the successful participation in contests like the Iron Cook Challenges or in the dating programme Cook4Luv provide many opportunities to get acknowledgement for your hard efforts, and this makes Cook, Serve, Delicous! so addictive. Also, the successes and failures are always your own: If you do everything right, the customer will be happy. If you make a mistake, the customer will always notice. It is very fair, and after a bad day, you are motivated to train more and get better. The difficulty increases not so much with the upgrades of the restaurant (with the familiar five-star-system), but with the upgrades for the dishes, that become more and more complex, while simple items (like beer) always stay that way; that means that you can always adapt your own difficulty by choosing a more or less demanding selection of items on your menu of the day.PresentationThe graphics and sound effects are simple, but somehow still appetizing. I focussed on Italian and American cuisine, and after every two hours or so, I had to take a break because I became hungry... The music on the other hand was not to my liking: The title song with the repeated ""Cook!"", ""Serve!"", ""Delicious!"" in different overacted voices was almost annoying, and the repetitive background music is played in a modernistic style I did not enjoy - I switched the music off completely after a short while. I would have preferred if you could have chosen a type of restaurant (Italian food, Mexican food, sea food), and got the corresponding backgrounds and music. I consider this a missed opportunity on the developer's part.Value for moneyIt takes around 10-15 hours to complete the game once. You can add replayability by specializing in different kinds of food, choosing higher difficulty settings and even engaging in a competitive multiplayer mode called Battle Kitchen- which I have not tried yet. All in all, there is a lot to do, and the game is worth its price.VerdictThe presentation of the game can make you underestimate it: It has a very intense gameplay and can give you massive feeling of accomplishment. Also, it trains you mentally to stay calm while multitasking under pressure, a very useful ability. 7.5/10.			"

												This might be the most demanding title in my library. Underneath its casual-friendly theme and its welcoming artstyle lies a game of frantic keyboard slapping. If you thought you were good at multi-tasking, think again. If you thought you were good at memorizing keystroke sequences, let's see how good you are. This is as close as a human being will come to being a food-slinging robot as will be possible until the coming Robopocalypse. It's well crafted. It's fun.

												Recommended in the strongest terms. You did not realize that you needed a hardcore cooking sim in your life until you played Cook, Serve, Delicious! ""Intense action"" is not a phrase I expected to apply to a cooking sim, but this game mocks Dark Souls casuals. You can get by being decent, but to thrive, you must be *on the ball.* Never was fileting fish so satisfying, nor was soup so infuriating.The gameplay is so intense that I can only play safely in small doses. I just played Cook, Serve, Delicious! so hard that I hurt myself. Seriously, I need to go lie down.Cook, Serve, Delicious!: amazingly great.			"

												Fast and frantic much like working in a real kitchen, this game makes me want to go back into the industry.Its just a case of taking the orders and getting them out there! There are ALOT of people who struggle with the pace of the game so may I suggest for a beginner that you go with :Corndog ( hotdog) - Its simple and easy and you can bang them out a half dozen at a time. Rush hour is no problem.Beer - Also very easy and a nice earner in the evenings.Fried chicken- Again, its incredibly easy you can use this or French Fries its the same actions.Soda - A selection of drinks, its a little more difficult but ...really you need more than just beer in your business.Salad...- Get used to this one , its incredibly easy once you learn all the dressings and it can be upgraded many times . Its also good as you need an alternative for the more ""healthy individuals"" among us.This menu can take you as far as a 2 star restaurant with ease after that you can add in Fresh Fish, Chicken Breast, Coffee,  Wine,Lobster as subsitutes . They are the easiest of the more expensive products. Happy Cooking!			"

												In Cook, Serve, Delicious you run a restaurant progressing from a basic establishment with a  modest selection of recipes to a 5 star restaurant offering more advanced food. The player has the responsibility of performing every action needed to run the restaurant (taking the orders, preparing the food, cooking, collecting the money).The game can be played solely using your keyboard or gamepad, which adds to its fast nature. You will be put under a lot of stress when facing multiple customers and thus incorrectly execute seemingly simple tasks.For a game that isn't supposed to be played for many hours consecutively the progression from day to day can often be neglegible leading to a lack of motivation to keep playing.Anyway I recommend the game due to its unique concept.

Teal DeerDevelopers: Vertigo Gaming Inc. Publishers: Vertigo Gaming Inc. Initial release: Oct 2013Genre: Cooking Sim, Arcade #Worth/NotWorth: #VeryWorth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationCook, Serve, Delicious is a great filler/palate cleanser with surprising depth. You run a restaurant inside of a business tower in which you are the sole proprietor of all things that happen. While the game is mostly casual feeling and reminiscent of classics like Diner Dash, you additionally have to run the actual cooking as well as manage the flow of customers. It may seem like a lot at first but it ramps up the difficulty fairly nicely. Additionally, you are in full control of what is on the menu itself. So if something just has too many options you can dial it down regardless. However, you can ramp it up as well giving you added buffs should you be able to maintain good customer service.The actual cooking is incredibly satisfying, each food item has a specific way to prepare it and has its own recipes. Meaning it can only be ordered in certain ways making it an important thing to note regarding strategy in menu selection. Some types have more recipes than others. While in control of the menu you'll find some decent depth in choosing plates that require cooking and prep while other things that are instant and can be done in between the cooking stages and are a good way to increase revenue. There are stat buffs and debuffs that occur, such as menu rot or foods that have bad aromas early in the morning that effect you every day. Your performance can also affect your buzz which will effect the amount of customers coming in, especially during non-Rush hour times. There is equipment upgrades that help in the increasing of the waiting time for customers regarding their patience for you as well as equipment to help with chores that you'll need to do throughout each day. New equipment for cooking different types of food are also available. You'll have extra tasks to complete everyday should you choose to take them on such as bets with other chefs. There are e-mails that you'll receive after each day that are actually quite enjoyable to read. As well as warn you of upcoming events such as health inspections. Career mode isn't the only thingThere are also iron chef challenges that occur weekly and compete with other online challengers. Additionally, there is a ton of control options. Options between Keyboard, 360, X1 and DS4 pads make choosing what you're most comfortable with a non-issue. THE GISTWhile frantic, the amount of of strategy in menu selection makes it rather methodical and it's extremely satisfying to make multiple dishes perfect.Follow my curation for more "

												This is a fun gem and one I suggest. It's a mix between strategic games from Maxis circa the 1990s and cute social games for the Facebook crowd. The end result is a highly addictive, challenging restaurant manager with a lot of heart--it took me completely by surprise. The developer also seems to really care about the game; he posts publicly and thoughtfully about it, even apparently adding a free expansion pack to it prior to its Steam release. By purchasing it, you're supporting niche games and indie devs. To me, there's honestly a lot worse things you can get for $9.99. It's completely worth checking out.			"

												At the time of writing this I have clocked over 300 hours of this game (so far). Cook, Serve, Delicious is by far the most fun I have ever had playing a cooking game in my life. The controls are so well translated on controller that it actually mostly makes logical sense and feels like you are slapping the stuff together as fast as you can. Quickly found myself addicted as I finished the game and realized I could restart with three times the difficulty all over again, testing my reaction/speed and understanding of the ingredients placement on my controller scheme. This is for sure a controller game. I have difficulty playing this with the keyboard controls. If you have a controller you should consider getting this game. Just for the fun of playing alone it is an awesome game but in co-op cooking modes (where you switch out every few seconds) it becomes even more fun. There is so much to unlock in this game and it is challenging even for a seasoned videogame player. I hope to see Cook, Serve, Delicious expand itself into a full blown game where you could be cooking in a multiplayer mode while friends are running the front of house/dining room and plating guests while you cook in the back while other team mates are washing up. (just a nerd dream) This is one of the most addictive games ever. Thumbs up :D			"

What I liked: A decent cooking game with a unique way to cook  the rhythm of cooking during rush hour That feeling when you know the recipes by heart and fly by those ordersWhat You Need to Know: This is not a simulation game, you don’t really manage a restaurant. It’s mostly on the food minigames that is the core gameplay, no prep, tweaking food prices, supply and demand. The beginning is very slow when not during rush hour everyday. Later in the game when at 3 star your restaurant you will have very little downtime. It’s stressful and challenging but really fun. I do hate that can’t start the order over if you made a mistake and can force you lose the perfect day bonus, which early on  a lot compared to your daily income, later on in the game, it’s not really needed I wish you the stats gave me more info like how many days I had an item on the menu, tips per food to try and maximize my profits bro Cooking is a button mashing mechanic with each item being something different; chores are the same way (love the robbery minigame, sarcasm of course) You can bet money to see how many perfect orders you can get in a row, everyday its randomized what items are needed on the menu I played this using a controller, it just seems easier but mistakes can be made when using the analog sticks. ( I did try using the mouse and the arrow keys only, it's doable, but damn it's a clickfest. I don't know how keyboard is even plausible) This game is very repetitive; your goal is to get to a 5 star restaurant. A checklist of requirements needs to be met to go up a star They require 20 days minimum as the annoying requirement. This requirement will be the last one done and wish this wasn't a requirement. It would make the game shorter, more enjoyable, and less grindy There are catering and iron chef style events that offer different challenges, but are few and don't happen till level 2 and 3 restaurants. Each level of star takes about 3-4 hours. You are rewarded if you have a perfect day, sadly if you make a mistake in an order you can’t restart the order and have to take the penalty. You can just restart the day over if it was at the beginning, otherwise I would just take the hit and not get bonus( because money was never really an issue)It might sound like the game is bad, it’s not, it’s just not great either. I wanted it to be more of a management cooking game( plus I played this after playing Overcooked which is amazing) My Score:CPaid:$2.5Main reason for not finishing: very repetitive and tedious( plus not a real management game)Games similar:  OverCooked (amazing!!) The Cooking Game (way more casual) Pizza Express( more management style) "

												The title says it all! Cook, Serve, Delicous! is a game that's worth your money. Do you need a stress reliever game? This can be one of them if you like to take out your stress through a fast-paced game.I totally recommend this game to everyone. This is a very nice arcade game with upgrades for your food from one star to 3 stars. You can even buy equipments that will help your business. Experience a game where you don't just serve the food but you also prepare and cook it yourself. A unique feature of this game is that you also need to find the time to do your chores like flushing the toilet, throwing out the trash, washing the dishes, etc.Time management is the key. Beware of rush hour, when your buzz (the chance of customers coming to your restaurant) is high, efficiency and concentration is needed. You don't want a single customer get mad at you, would you?Pros:+ The game is very realistic in terms of all the work present in a restaurant/food chain+ You don't just continuously play with the same food items on your menu since there are buzz conditions where serving a food for 3 straight days will lead to a menu rot (the food is not in demand anymore) stat to the food which means if you still serve it, it'll decrease the number of customers that will come to your restaurant/food chain.+ Addicting to the bone!Cons:+ It'll take a bit of practice to get used to the key bindings since it has a lot of buttons involved for every food.Note: A new feature called the kitchen battle is still on beta where you battle other players in cooking, I guess, I haven't tried it though.

To its credit, the game attempts to mix things up by introducing concepts like the catering mode (cook a smaller selection of food!) or daily bets (cook very specific foods!) but these extra modes did little to keep my interest.I couldn't bring myself to finish Cook, Serve, Delicious! so I've got to give it a thumbs down.

												This game is bimodal. In one mode, you're strategically figuring out how to balance out your menu to minimax revenue vs hassles/mistakes, or meet other secondary goals. You linger over the ""Upgrade"" button on a dish, knowing that you need the higher revenue per plate, but not being sure if you want to invest the money or if you're ready for the added complexity an upgraded dish sometimes entails.Once you're done with that, you enter the other mode, starting your day cooking. With a single typo you can send a plate of completely uncooked fish to a customer, or slop a bunch of ingredients on a pizza that totally do not belong there. The feeling when you do this in the middle of a giant dinner rush, when you're totally in the weeds, is unsettling. And then you need to take out the trash.This makes the feeling when you complete a goal or finish a perfect day that much better. A+.Also, I will totally 180 noscope ace you on salads. 1v1 me.			"

												This game is far more engaging than it has any right to be.At first glance, it looks like a really simple game. It is. It's very easy to pick up, learn, and play. It's very intense during the lunch rush, with some lulls between to chill out and practice.The game isn't realistic at all with its 8 dollar sodas, but that only adds to the entertainment when people stroll in to pay for a beer at 9 am, too. All the while, wondering why the hell someone would pay 8 dollars for a small water...If you wanna get reductive about it, it's a set of QTEs, but there are light strategies involved with remembering how long foods take to cook while juggling your customers and cleaning chores.

												This game was a huge surprise,  and is an enjoyable time management cooking game.There is a main story campaign where you start off with basics and a few recipes and as you earn money and reputation you can buy more equipment and add new recipes.The game can get quite hectic as there are times where you not only have to serve many customers at once but see to the restaurants other business such as making sure the toilets are cleaned, the trash is taken out, especially at the beginning where you have to do everything yourself.  You can try out recipes before you buy them, each recipe fulfills some customers needs such as party, healthy or on a budget (just a couple of examples) so there is strategy to your menu planning.As well as the story there is a local multiplayer option, you can use keyboard, mouse or gamepad controls.There are multiple save slots if you want to play a few games paralllel .

												Ahhh, Cook, Serve, Delicious. One of my most favourite games of all time. It has everything from keeping you adrenaline pumped when you perfect a day to making you cry in shame for messing up one single order. 10/10 would play again.			"

												This game tests your reflexes and is a very good game because of that.  You will have to use a lot of your brainpower to make it through a day, and that makes it that engaging.  However, it is a bit dragged out for what it is.  The money managing part does keep a little more of my attention, but it seems to be a bit long in my opinion.  However, the music is awesome and I suggest you get the soundtrack.  8.25/10			"

												Welcome to my up-and-coming restaurant! Where the food is always made with love and care. Stop by for a economy priced meal with that 4 star taste! Serving all your favorites at this locally owned eatery.This is an intense game. It doesnt mess around. The customer is always right. If you like to feel pressured to pump out enough food for the day while juggling your businesses needs, this is for you. It really is delicious!			"

												Awesome game! A really fun restaurant/cooking management game. Good for when I'm a little bored and want something to pass the time. It's quite intense (especially on Extreme Difficulty mode & in the Battle Kitchen) but can get a little repetitive so I probably wouldn't be able to spend hours playing it at once, but it's still really fun and I recommend playing it! :D			"

												This is the only cooking game on steam that I find addictive to play because of it's hard & fast game mechanics to see how much food you can cook, I'm going to post my thoughts on what makes this game delicious (At The End Of Each Day You Might Get Positive Or Negative Buzz depending on how good your culinary skills are).Pros:1. Lots of food2. Lots of upgrades for your food3. Hard, Fast & Rewarding4. Good Art5. Very Addictive7. Extra Events a.k.a Challenges that can reward you extra cash but some challenges are way harder to do8. Random E-mails (Some of them are funny)9. Good Tutorials10. You Can Date Other People Who Love Cooking (Not Actual People Just In The Game)11. Good MusicCons:1. I thought the lack of multitasking was an issue for me like for example I'm cooking a burger but I notice some of my other food or chores is going to disappear if I don't interact with it so I try to click on the disappearing object while I'm cooking the burger but nothing happens (Well The only Time I'm able to click on a disappearing object while I'm cooking is if the food is ready to serve), I thought there would be multitasking with the food & chores but I guess not...2. Every time you do a correct dish for the person your dating they always take up most of your time texting which leaves a lot of angry customers because I'm busy using my cellphone instead of making food (Again this is an issue with no multitasking)Overall This game always makes me hungry & I highly recommend buying this Yummy Game.

												This game is simply amazing , i could go in depth about all its features but in short for those looking for a comparison as to what its like , if you were a fan of a old game called Root Beer Tapper. This is the modern advancement of it.Not only you can serve the beer to the oncoming army of people but also other foods. To make sure its not too arcade like they have added in stuff like a upgrade system , equipment , events to make it interesting.if you had loved Root Beer Tapper back then you will jump in and love this game.what i liked about this game- management were you can customize foods, equipment - level up system to keep you going towards a 5 star restaurant.- nice extra stuff to do like event, challenges, reading email, bets etc- controls are excellent.What i did not like- extremely brutal learning curve for new players specially during rush hours + inspection right from day 1- menu rot makes no sense, it should be the opposite people should like and want stuff you serve nicely.- despite buying equipment the chores are not reduced that much at all. - Some of foods are a pain to serve killing your chances of getting perfect combos.Overall the game gave me the arcade experience i enjoyed playing  Root Beer Tapper back then hopefully that gets released on steam as well sometime in future.

												Cook, Serve, Delicious! is one of these games that I bought rather for fun, I did not even plan on playing more than I needed to get the trading cards (yeah, I love to collect 'dem cards). Turns out I was wrong, I started to really like this game and invested some time in it which was unexpected.To get back to the game, it's about running a restaurant and rise high in the cooking sky by gathering stars for your restaurant and upgrading your meals.I highly recommend playing this game with a gamepad, tried keyboard and gamepad and it's way easier to play this game with the latter.As you will make progress you'll realize that the menus will get a bit more complicated and you will have to answer many orders in a short time span so be prepared as the hoards will come eventually.Seriously, this game is worth a shot coming from someone who did not even consider it to be seriously good.Have fun cooking!

												Okay, so 19 hours in to my Cook, Serve, Delicious! experience and I am a 4 star restaurant. Getting a perfect day at this stage is incredibly rare (for me, atleast) and for some odd reason I feel GUILT whenever I produce a bad order. That's a good thing though, made me want to play more. On top of all that, I think it's making me very crazy.+Great workout for your fingers+Fast-paced fun+Addicting soundtrack (seriously)+A lot of food to prepare, alongside lots of achievements (who doesn't like those!?)-Can be a tad repetitive-Stressful at times-The only time I have ever hated Pizza-Would have been nice to customise the restaurant and make it 'mine'			"

 Cook,Serve,Delicious!  COOK,SERVE,DELICIOUS 2 WAS JUST ANNOUNCED! Summary: Cook,Serve,Delicious! is one addicting Restaurant Management game made by Vertigo Gaming made  available through steam. It's gameplay brings out the fast keyboard gamer in you, the graphics is simple yet gorgeous that sets the mood for the gamer. While repetitive at times, the game can really be fun and enjoyable but challenging specially during rush hours. I would recommend this game to all gamers, casuals and hardcore alike. Looking forward to the game's sequel in 2016, COOK,SERVE,DELICIOUS! 2GameplayIt's core gameplay is fresh,fun,thrilling  and fast paced but maybe repetitive for some. There are plenty of things to do from the mini-mini games like cleaning toilets,doing the dishes, drawing out a robber's face to more challenging stuff like the Battle Kitchen update which brings out the same formula but makes it seem fresh with challenges (Not for the new players tho').I find playing this in a marathon like session (I played for 5 hours straight) to be fun but quite repetitive.There is a reward system for spending countless hours in-game from the cosmetic upgrades to your restaurant when you achieve star ratings. Food can also be upgraded bringing in new ingredients making you re-memorize all the things you've come to remember when spamming for the buttons to make the dish.As you progress into the game, recipes you've known and love become more difficult and challenging giving out variety and randomness. While the game may repetitive for some, I find playing this game a fun and rewarding. 9 out of 10  Graphics Before you bash the graphics for being plain and simple (Compared to AAA games like Battlefield), it does it's job really extraordinarily well. The graphics are beautifully made, while not the best, I find the artstyle to be soothing to see and the art style is just WOW. I really enjoyed the background of the outside of sherrisoda, the day and night cycle and the planes passing-by is just a beautiful sight to see. The game rewards you with a star system. The star system gives your restaurant a new look each time. 0 Stars, you would expect to see that the restaurant is in a bad condition, progressing through the game, you can see an improvement in the atmostphere and appearance of your restaurant giving out a new vibe from arriving redneck truck drivers to your VIPs, Rich and Famous. I really like the game's graphics and atmosphere. 10 out of 10  Soundtrack Just WOW! The game's soundtrack is beautifully made by Jonathan Geer. The soundtrack blends well with the game's atmosphere and ambiance providing you with a classy and jazz feel to your gameplay. The music is masterfully made to suit the game and for all it's worth a must buy as well (Can be purchased as DLC)10 out of 10 A really fun well made game from the guys at Vertigo.9.5 out of 10 A must buy even if the game is not on sale!

												Smash together a charming little restruant sim with WarioWare style microgames for preparing/cooking/serving the food and keeping the establishment clean, and you have Cook, Serve Delicious!  It's a ton of fun and the game itself has a fantastic atmosphere, everything looks and sounds great, and there's a real sense of progression as you get deeper and deeper into the game.  Don't be fooled by it's cute looks- though the game starts out relatively easy, CSD! is going to get VERY difficult later on- but never in an unfair way, and always in a manner you can directly control by choosing what foods are on your menu.

												I really like this game, it's quite challenging..not only serving the items but also saving up the money to go on to purchase upgrades and new foods. Most games make it rather easy but not this game, it also as bonus games which are called events and thats one way of getting some extra money. I don't really have a negative on this game, I think its quite a decent game for the price and I've played a good 6/7 hours and I'm nowhere near completing this game so for the couple of £'s that I spend..it truly is a bargain game. So if you like serving games, or cooking games then this game is for you. If not, check out the lets plays on youtube and then decide, don't wipe this game off so easily.			"

												Jesus christ, I used to work at a restaurant, one of the worst jobs I had, I always came home stinking like raw fish and in never ending agony, I come home, and I play this game....Just to cook fish over and over. I breathe fish, I eat fish, I bleed fish, I'm sick of fish. This game keeps that hate alive!Plus, rush hours....I've got PTSD flashbacks when I go through one in this game, almost to the point of suffering anxiety attacks. PLEASE BE PATIENT SIR, WE'VE GOT ♥♥♥♥ING 30 COSTUMERS WAITING FOR THEIR FOOD ALREADY, OH NO, ANOTHER WAVE OF COSTUMERS, MAKE IT STAAAAAHP!After playing this for a few hours, I've got some questions, though.Is your restaurant so short of supplies, that if you accidentally put ice when a costumer didn't want it....You can't get rid of the ice? You will have to deal with angry costumers instead of wasting precious ice and soda. That will teach you to pay attention!Why do costumers complain about, say, getting a jumbo soda when they asked for a medium or large? I mean, it's like, more for less, they still pay the same. WHY?How the hell can you enchance the flavor of plain ♥♥♥ water with flavor blast? And....How the ♥♥♥♥ does a costumer know if I slapped their meat 5 times instead of 6?!?!?.......Get this game, and you'll probably end up being addicted to it.			"

												I've played Cook, Serve, Delicious mainly on my android so don't let my hours confuse you.If you have played the flash games ""Papa's Freezeria/Pizzeria/Burgeria/Et ceteria"" and enjoyed them, then this is the game for you. This game is that, but much much more. +Controller Support, +Adjustable Key Bindings, +Weekly Challenges, +Food Variety, +Steam Trading Cards, +4-Player Mode +2-Player Co-op Campaign +etc.Before your day starts you are able to choose what is on your menu, read emails, buy upgrades, and other cool secret stuff (like making bets!).  Menus must be updated every so often as food will get ""stale"" (boring), and customers will eat elsewhere. Also, certain foods have ""properties"" associated with them. Put too many greasy foods on the menu and cooking will be quick and simple, but customers will be deterred. Put too many things like ""soup"" and ""pizza"" on the menu and customers will pay more, but cooking will be difficult.""Cooking"" is extremely fun. If you know your way around a keyboard the game will be a walk in the park for you; that is, if you play on normal. The game offers many different ways to challenge yourself such as Extreme mode, and Endurance mode.If you're a money conscious person like me, the game is also sold on the Humble Store! Hope you buy, and have fun playing!			"

												I got a free copy of the game. As part of a deal to learn about the game engine (Game Maker).This game makes you learn to push a few buttons to make each food. It is supposed to get repetitive very quickley. Now here is the catch. Each food item is completely diffrent. Some require simple key inputs and other require longer more complicated inputs. The actual game play part comes from able to quickly switch between food items.You will find in a rush to please customers. Things start to mess up unless you zen mastery of task switching. A customer comes in. Burger? M-M. Another customer. A baked potato? Pop it in the oven. Another customer! A salad? Cheese. Onions and carrots. Bacon and croutons. C-O-B. The dishes need doing! Left arrow, right arrow, left arrow, right arrow, up arrow. Left-right-left-right-up. Wait, the burgers! The burgers are starting to burn hurry up! But you have to finish the dishes first, and you do. Two meat patties, two cheeses, bacon, lettuce, tomatoes. M-M-C-B-L-T. Wait, what – the customer left unhappy. Oh no, two cheeses! C-C! Too late.Health inspector issued a warning again because in all that you forgot to take out the trash.			"

												Really fun cooking management game, basically in this game you are in charge of ur own restaurant in which you have to please ur costumers with different types of food each day u can't serve the same types of food each day because if u do so ur costumers will get mad and u will get lower score, the gameplay and mechanics of the game are pretty easy to learn u can either use or mouse or keyboard (or both) to make the different types of food ready just depends on the style you like to play, also this game has alot of different things to in the campaign mode, like for example if u get ur restaurant a higher score u can participate in other games like tv shows etc. and do so fun things. Overall this game is really great and i would highly recommend it to anyone who likes to manage a restaurant :)!8.7/10			"

												Frantic lunacy, in the best possible way.  Despite its designation Cook, Serve, Delicious! is not a 'casual' game in the usual sense - it's possible to fire it up for a ten minute go, but in reality you'll be sat there an hour later wondering where the time went.Luck plays a small part, but this game rewards learning.  It allows you to become better at it as you become better at it, which is something that has become surprising rare in recent games.  A clean, simple concept executed in a very solid way, this is one of the best games I've played in recent years.			"

												What a game this one is and what a great joy to play it was. I always heard great and many things about Cook, Serve, Delicious! back when it was mobile only and even though everytime I looked at gameplay videos and screenshot of the game I honestly thought this was not really the kind of game I'd enjoy but when it came to PC I knew I had atleast to give it a shot, and so I did. And how wrong I was, since the first couple of days I enjoyed it greatly. The game consists in upgrading your restaurant from 0 stars to 5 stars and eventually Platinum. To gain enough ""prestige"" to gain the next star you usually need to play 20 days, I think each day takes around 7 minutes or so to complete, and besides that you ocasioanally have to pass atleast 4 safety inspections which can be done by not failing a chore everytime the inspector visits your restaurant, such as cleaning the toilet, washing dishes, putting the garbage away and setting traps for mice. Eventually, the further you progress you'll unlock special events, first are the catering events which pay you an ""X"" amount for each person you successfully serve, then it's the Iron Chef (or Iron Cook) TV series in which you can only fail 2 orders and the last event is the Hunger Festivities which you cannot fail a single order and usually all the foods are fully upgraded. There's a various amount of stuff in which you can spend your money on, for example, you can upgrade or buy new foods, everytime you upgrade a food it increases the amount of money that you get by serving that food, besides that you can upgrade your restaurant by buying stuff that will help you out such as ""Fun Menus"" and other stuff that will increase the time that a customer waits for you to serve them their meal but you can also get items to help you on the chores. The type of food you serve on your restaurant also has an impact on your ""buzz"", basicly the more buzz percentage you have the more people will show up on your restaurant that day, like, fast foods will give you less buzz while healthy foods will give you more buzz and even increase the chance of getting a tip from the customers who order that food. The gameplay is pretty simple, you can use either the mouse (which I think it's a bad idea) or the keyboard to complete your orders, at first it is really slow paced but later on during rush hours it gets really hectic because you get alot of people. I find the graphicstyle to be rather good looking and charming, along with the visual upgrades that your restaurant gets everytime you gain another star and the way that the more stars you have the more ""fancy people"" will show up on your restaurant, you can clearly notice that by their better clothes and accessories along with the time VIPs start showing up. If there's one thing that accompanies you throughout the entire game is the main music of the game which despite listening to it for over 30 hours while I played Cook, Serve, Delicious! I still find it to be really charming and relaxing to listen to and it certainly fits the right spot everytime you play in my honest opinion. Honestly, Cook, Serve, Delicious! is a very unique game and you'll probably won't find one like it out there or atleast this well polished and well made. It's impossible to go wrong with this game, you should certainly buy it when you have the chance if it's something you think you can dig into, of course some people might not like it.			"

												I wasn't sure about ""Cook, Serve, Delicious!"" when I bought it, and I dare say that even 9 hours ingame, I still have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, I'm obviously having fun if I bothered to keep playing for so long, right? Well, sure, I can't deny that. On the other hand, though, the game really seems to lack the depth and complexity that in my humble opinion, could make it one of my all-time favorites....what exactly do I mean by that?Ugh, well.... The main item on the menu (pun intended :P) is the method of preparing the food. Simply smack a few keys in the right order and within the time limit. In my book, that's worthy of the word ""dull"", not to mention ""boring"". While I realize it's one of the main mechanisms of the game which is meant (I suppose?) to make the game require skill, I'm sure there are better ways to implement that. Personally, I would have really preferred a simulation or a startegy based mechanism. For example - improving my cooking skills ingame by means of character progression (taking courses, learning to cook, advancing levels and ranks, hiring more cooks or other specialists, and so on). There's still room for an action-based mechanism, but the current one simply isn't good enough in my humble opinion.This issue drives me nuts, since other than that, I really *love* this game! The concept is great - just this one major disadvantage. I do recommend this game to anyone who likes simulation games, just be prepared for the action skill requirement. Being an optimist by nature, I really hope the devs will work on a sequel, this time with the emphasis being on simulation and strategy when preparing the food, instead of just action. :)			"

												Similar to Diner Dash but utilizes more on keyboard play, this game deals with running a restaurant and strive to restore to it's former glory. Gameplay (9/10)This is where the game shines most, getting various interesting food orders from customers that can really test your eye, hand and brain coordination to make sure you don't screw it up and get as many perfect points as you can, managing your menu, buying equipments and upgrading your food quality, random events that can influence the number of customers coming to your restaurant, there's definitely a lot of elements that comes into play. Simple, yet fast packed action. Graphics (9/10)Cartoonish graphics is nice here with also nice looking food and it's also nice to see yourself plopping on ingredients onto your own made food ordered by your customers. Sound/Music (8/10)Sound wise it's rather simple, nothing mind blowing here but it gets the job done right here. Music wise it is catchy, nice and during certains parts of the game it gets better. The only problem with this is that it can get repetitive but still it suits the game's atmosphere just fine.Controls (10/10)The controls are quite simple, fully utilizing the keyboard functions when preparing your customer's food and the best part is you get to customize and configure the settings to your own liking and corresponds to the keys to certaing ingredients (Example: Cheese - C) Overall (9/10)Fast, simple and interesting game which has a lot more depth than Diner Dash. Try it out if you're interested for a simple game : )			"

												I just love when a game like this trick me on trying it and then crawls under my skin.Casual? There's nothing casual about this game. This game is SUPER HARD! And I mean that in most positive way.You're in charge of a new 0 star restaurant and your mission is to reach 5 star rank.There is the managing part where you buy foods and equipment necessary for your restaurant to operate and juggle them around for best buzz bonuses (% of how hip you restaurant is, how crowded it will be the next day).And then there is the action part where you serve your customers from 9AM ti 10PM. That is the SUPER HARD part (especially if you made crappy decisions during managing part and even more challenging if you're not a proficient typist) as you'll have to be super quick on your keyboard (you can play with mouse, but it's lot more efficient not to) if you want to serve most of the customers and you have to make quick decisions like which customer to serve first and read quickly what the actual order is (every food type has many variations when it comes to receipts).Now at this point you can probably think that this game can be frustrating, and I pleased to say that no matter how hard it is, it NEVER gets frustrating. Yeah that one order you screwed up will kill your chances of a perfect day, yeah there will be times when you don't know what buttons are you hitting from all the madness, but all this will not make you mad as tomorrow is a new day and new opportunities. :)The gameplay don't get boring as every day there is something new, a new food, a new upgrade, a new situation to deal with, etc.And the developer who already put so much love and effort into this game is constantly improving it. The current version of the game is Battle Kitchen Edition, which added the multiplayer mode, lots of interesting competitive challenges and a harder difficulty (if you ask me, this game needs an Easy difficulty so that a wider audience could be approached).The fun never ends with Cook, Serve, Delicious!

												Cook, Serve, Delicious is a charming restaurant management/cooking game that puts you in charge of a restaurant in an office tower. It is simple and easy to pick up, while at the same time taking tons of mastery to fully perfect and maximize a day. Cook, Serve, Delicious starts you off with a no star, unknown diner operating within an office tower. You start off with some cash, and choose what dishes you'd like to serve. Each dish has an effect on your restaurant's appeal to customers, with certain dishes being attractive for a few days, others being staples that are always popular, while some have negative or positive effects at certain points in the day. The dishes are served up by you as the day runs by, with each dish having a different cooking process, with some dishes having several variations thanks to a multitude of ingredients. You must try your best to cook the meal to perfection while also doing it as fast as possible, while juggling multiple orders and restaurant chores as well.As you move on, you unlock more recipes, or upgrade current recipes to add to its price, but also adding complexity to each dish. You can also upgrade your restaurants equipment to help with your day-to-day, increasing your customer's patience, decreasing the frequency of chores, and so on. You aim to complete goals to increase your restaurants rating, thereby giving you a higher-class clientele and access to cooking challenges and such.The game displays itself in a 2D, cartoon world. It is colorful and charming, with many of the food looking quite delicious while still keeping a stylized flair to it. The game's interface is clear and concise - each dish will show you what keys to press to perform actions, and the UI is kept lean and simple, making the game very easy to play.Cook, Serve, Delicious is an excellent cooking game and will draw you in with ease. Soon, you'll be finding yourself wanting to  cook faster and faster while balancing complex recipes such as soup and pasta, which is quite daunting thanks to the many ingredients in both. This game is a splendidly designed game. If I had to compare it to another game, I would say it acts like a much more cheerful version of Papers, Please in terms of gameplay - simple, but increasingly complex, yet also very satisfying.Fully recommend this game. Have fun.			"

												Sadly I do not recommend.Not a bad game, but a bit of a time waster.  It looks like many of the components for an enjoyable Cooking Mama style experience are here, but there is a grind present.  I found I could make $300-400 income per day of play (+250 for perfect days), but foods started costing $1000+ quickly.  It seems like more and more my income came from...gambling?  Some kind of in-email betting game.Food ""rots"" after being on your menu for 2 days, but, really?  In this game you can't become ""known"" for a particular dish I suppose.  All in all, the gameplay mechanics are a little confused.I've played for about 4 hours now and I am stuck here waiting for my play time to reach 20 in-game days to move on, I'm a little bored.This is not a true restaurant sim either, from glazing the achievements I can see there's much more to unlock, I just don't want to wait around to get there.  From the get-go, the game is lacking depth.  I didn't feel like I owned a restaurant or anything.Pro: Some lady with the same sprite showed up almost every day and ordered a beer at 9AM.

												Thinking about Cook, Serve, Delicious, I wish there was a third option in terms of my recommendation: a sideways thumb. Before I begin, I would like to admit I have a fake food fetish. Wooden toy sushi rolls, plastic hamburgers that can be assembled, lego food. It all stirs my imagination and I often find lingering over these items when I encounter them if out holiday shopping for nieces and nephews. So the premise, setting and aesthetics of most any cooking sim definitely attracts me.Now on to this game itself:I've seen CSD described as a ""hardcore cooking/restaurant"" sim. It's not though.The game boils down to an ellaborate typing and algorithm test. The restaurant and cooking simulation gets a bit weird when soup reveals itself to be one of the most complex dishes to prepare in the game, as you are tasked with prepping each order for soup from scratch.One missed keystroke not only spoils a dish but you are forced to serve the meal to the customer even though you've cuaght the error. There is no option to ""start over"" at a hit for time and or money spent on wasted food.In my mind, a real 1st person hardcore restaurant sim would challenge you to manage time, like choosing to prep veg and make a new pot of soup prior to lunch rushes. To anticipate and use down time strategically between meals. You might even get a sous chef or kitchen hand who can help chop carrots, etc. or maybe you need to send them to the nearest market because your kitchen just ran out of cream or butter (as sometimes happens in the real world!).It's not that I want a restaurant sim that is as so close to reality that it would fit in with titles such as ""Farming Simulator 2015."" I think an ideal title in this genre could still have the same pace of gameplay that this first iteration of Cook Serve Delicious has, but I would like to see a little more nuance in the structure of the day and the gameplay throughout the day other than a speed challenge to mash buttons with no planning or strategy. For gods' sake, at least make a pot of soup serve 6-10 customers!Short of it, I think the cooking game genre still has a ways to go. There is room out there for a true ""hardcore cooking & restauarant sim."" But despite it's charms, CSD is not that title for me.(That being said, I've become something of an achievement hound as of late and I will likely continue to play the game, at least till I hit around 50% completion.)

												As a competitive typing enthusiast and a food lover, I stood no chance of resisting this game's charms. And ample charms they are: the art is full of life, the music is groovy, the sound design provides great feedback (I love the thwack! as I lay down ingredients), and there's a surprising amount of content for what looks like a simple casual game at first glance. Even the writing is subtly clever.So, what's typing got to do with this? It's pretty simple: I get to press lots of keys really quickly to make delicious food appear. It's extremely satisfying.If the gameplay looks daunting, fear not; the difficulty is highly adjustable by customising your active menu. As part of progression, you'll be buying new food items and upgrading them (making them more profitable but also, in most cases, adding complexity to their preparation). But when/whether you do this is up to you. Likewise, you can set up your menu to only include easier foods, or you can give yourself a challenge by filling it with difficult ones, or anything in between. This makes the game much more accessible, and it's part of why I feel confident in recommending this game to just about any kind of gamer.			"

												I saw this game being played and I thought it would help me pass a couple of hours, so I bought it. Immediately upon starting the game I was greeted with a warm, pleasing athstetic that is simply a sneaky mask for the cruel, relentless gameplay that it is built on. As soon as you think you have it under control, a new piece of equipment is unlocked, which unlocks a massive array of new dish possibilities. What happens when you have bought said equipment and mastered every single recipie (A very daunting task indeed)? Answer, you attain a new star, with it ensues more customers, more upgrades, new side jobs, etc.On top of this, the game offers many different little storys or upgrades through the email system. It even has it's own version of Kickstarter! Overall, this is a brilliant game and I fully reccomend it to fans of this genre!			"

												I remember as a preteen browsing flash game websites, ocasionally playing some restuarant simulator flash games. Customers come in, you take their order, and then you just slap together what they wanted with whatever the game gave you(Pizza, burgers, icre cream, whatever). This game is if somebody took those old flash games and notched everything up to 11. ""Cook, Serve, Delicous!"" has a ridiculous amount of customization and choices to run your restuarant. The game is split up into individual days, and on each day you can set up to 6 menu items to serve to your customers. The foods in the game range from all sorts, from the typical pizza and burgers, to breakfast foods, to steaks and wine, to even more fanciful foods like sushi and lobsters.  But it doesn't stop there then you need to consider each upside and downside of the foods, which affect how many customers you get in a day, then there's daily chores to go along with serving your customers, then you can upgrade your foods to increase preparation options and recipes, upgrades to equipment, occasional safety inspections that decrease the time alloted for chores, catering and cooking events, and more and more and more and more! And this isn't even going into the Battle Kitchen option that gives even more challenges! Also, everything in this game is made satisfying with well made sound effects as you slap on ingredients or hearing the sound of a well poured beer. The controls are very tight and well suited for each individual meal you prepare. The mmusic however is one of the weaker points. It's well made music, but there's not many tracks in the game, you'll often hear repeats of tracks on each day, they're not very memorable either, but at worst they serve as suitable background music. And like I said earlier there are multiple recipes for each dish, so at times I can  take an order for ""Pizza"", but I don't know if they want a regular old cheese pizza, or if they want a Deluxe full vegetable pizza with ham, bacon, sausage, pepperoni,  AND pineapple. Which makes it tricky at times to juggle your tasks without dissapointing a customer or missing any chores. Overall very addicting, and very satisfying to play.			"

												Don't let the quirky graphics and the cooking theme fool you.This game is unexpectedly good and fun!It's not just about getting the right ingredients. You have to manage your menu, and you'll gain buzz bonus. The more buzz, the more people will come and of course, the harder it will be (risk/reward). Some items will rot if you let them 2 days on the menu, if you don't change them the 3rd day you'll get negative buzz bonus because of the smell :oSome items are easier to make than other, but some will get you more money than others (still a good balance risk/reward).During the normal course of the day you'll also have to flush the toilet, put out the garbage, taking care of mice, bet on your skills (and gain extra money!), try to find your soul mate, fund kickstarter projects (called click'n start :p) and dispence justice (yes T_T). I'm sure the list is not complete. The game is crazy! But in a good way :)You'll be able to buy upgrades for your restaurant and your food (more recipes, more ingredients, better price), you'll have special event, like cooking contests, or catering for parties. You'll also be able to compete on a leaderboard on some special game modes.For the price asked there is a lot of content, and it's good content.There used to be a demo available.

												Cook Serve Delicious is a well made game, despite being a bit too casual. Who knew that running a restaurant could actually be challenging. This game has lots of content, ranging from all kinds of (upgradeable) food to restaurant upgrades and challenges. It will take hours before you've earned your first star so getting that pretty fifth star might take you a long, long time. Unfortunately, despite all the upgrades and unlockables, the game becomes less interesting about six hours after you first started it. Now, it doesn't become any less challenging, it's just that the fun factor decreases because, well, all you basically do is click on ingredients. It would've been better if you could earn stars faster, or maybe earn money quicker. Either way, it quickly becomes boring.Last thing I want to say is that the graphics defiinitely fit the game; all the ingredients are nicely detailed and the restaurant upgrades make it look like you're really making progress.So, in the end CSD is a fun game to play in short sessions. But you'll probably lose interest after an hour or 6-7.[Rating: 77/100]			"

												Welcome to Sherri Soda Tower, a run-down urban building with a...piece….of crap...space for you to build your….brand new thriving restaurant! No seriously, this game is awesome. Starting from scratch, your goal is to become a 5-star chef beginning with a dump of a restaurant, but it’s rent free! And no, you can’t hire any employees. Why would you do that? There’d be less money for you!That’s right...you’ll not only cook all of the food you serve...but you’ll catch rats, throw out the garbage, wash the dishes, and even flush the toilet for the poor excuses of human beings that come through your restaurant! The good news is you take ALL THE TIPS HOME FOR YOURSELF!On top of the mouth-watering art, and music that will make you wanna dance, this game is incredibly addictive and will leaving you wanting to finish one more day before you go to bed. It will test your reflexes and also provide numerous challenges. Just when you think you’ve mastered a food item, new recipes throw additional learning demands on you, while your customers lack the patience to put up with your ability to do things that truly only an octopus could do.

												I'd heard people raving about this game for a little while, but put off getting it because I didn't understand how a restaurant management sim could be so good. I've never been so wrong. Cook, Serve, Delicious is one of the most addictive games I've played in a long time. Every once in a long while a game comes along that just executes every single thing it set out to do, and executes those things perfectly. This is one of those games.It's a deep game, mechanically speaking. You have access to a large number of different foods, restaurant equipment, and upgrades that can make it easier to manage your customers, prepare your food, or earn the almighty dollar (which in turn lets you buy and upgrade more food, natch). But despite this, the game has one of the softest learning curves I've ever seen, gently letting you flourish from a struggling corn dog cart jockey to a masterful soux chef and maybe even find some love along the way.The biggest key to the success of CSD has to be it's intuitive nature. Not since Wii Sports have I played a game that has such natural feeling controls. After a few minor stumbles along the way (v for olives, n for onions) I find myself juggling prep stations with ease, pounding out orders quickly, glancing at the minimum info I need and making sure I'm not feeding anyone raw fish, unless they want it.Finally, the art and sound really seal the deal. The background music keeps things hopping and peaks and ebbs when it needs to, and the distinctive sounds for various events keep you focused on what's important. The perfect ""whoof"" that I heard the first time I set something on fire was particularly memorable, but the separate dings for dishes that are ready vs. prepped are  essential.In short, this is a fantastically well put together game that has given me more hours of enjoyment than several ""AAA"" titles (that cost me far more, to boot) and I can think of exactly zero reasons that would make me hesitate to recommend this game to anyone. Unless of course you're some kind of fun-hating grump.			"

												pros: windowed mode available, soundtrack fits the theme, art style, variety of menu choices & upgrades, variety of side challenges, ""battle kitchen"" mode: great variety of multiplayer modes & scoreboards with new challenges every week, local co-op available (keyboard+mouse & controller), good pacing on progression, over 20+ hours of content for first playthrough, new game+ available once you have beaten the game (giving bonuses while ramping up difficulty)cons: pressing esc in the main menu before choosing a save file to load will instantly exit the game (won't ask to confirm exit), drawing the face of the criminal who robbed you makes absolutely no sense, during a service things on the right & center of the screen will overlap your orders on the left side of the screen causing you to not know which orders are ready or still require assembly, some menu combinations are completely impossible to pull off during rush hourOverall, the best way to play this is using both keyboard and mouse to maximize your actions-per-minute multitasking. I may never own or run a restaurant but this restaurant simulator is the next best thing. An absolute blast from start to finish.Cook, Serve, Delicious has my highest recommendation, and also worth picking up the soundtrack.			"

												Surpringly great game with fairly unique gameplay. With simple yet franctic and fun gameplay and a solid soundtrack on top, the game is more than worth it's price! If the game is too challenging you can pick easier foods or if it's too easy you can pick more challenging foods, though tougher foods tend to give a better profit if you can pull them off (just beware of rush hour!).The only negative is that the options menu is a bit limited so if you like to tweak a bunch of settings for your game you'll be disapointed. That said it seems to run fine and I haven't encountered a bug yet.Simple yet addicting gameplay will keep most player entertained for many hours.			"

												Probably the greatest of all cooking-themed time management games, which really isn't saying all that much.You will be tried. You will learn the limits of your reflexes and reaction and knowledge of the recipes and controls, through experimentation and a gradual ramping of the overall pace, and you will learn to work within those limits to get through the day with minimal errors. Really fantastic game, very much looking forward to the sequel.			"

												I really like this game! I can finally say I can cook, at least.But a question: Is there any chance we can potentially see more foods added to this? I like the current variety, but that's why I also want just a bit more things to boggle your mind with and still keep up with all other restaurant related matters.Long story short, I can highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to heighten their senses and learn to multitask.

												Ever since Cook, Serve, Delicious! came out on Steam, I followed it around. I tried trading for it a few times, but was unsuccessful. I gave up hope of getting the game since I was saving up my money for another thing at the time, and I forgot about it. A few months later, I was delighted to find the game in Humble Bundle- I almost instantly purchased it, and I have to say, even though I got it for a dollar, I would gladly pay the full Steam price for it.So far it's been incredibly fun. The concept is incredibly simple; press a letter key, and you plop an ingredient onto the dish. This quickly turns from easy to hard. You have to press the buttons with speed, memorize which ingredients go with which key, and juggle multiple tasks at the same time. The gameplay becomes even harder during Rush Hour (usually during workers' lunch breaks and at the end of the work-day), since multiple customers enter at a time. You can customize what you have on your menu each day, so you can theme your restaurant if you wanted (for example, a classic burger/fries/soda restaurant).Overall, it's small and simple, but turns into a huge, incredibly hard game. At the time of writing this review I only have 2-ish hours, and I'm already in love with the game. You can expect to see my played hours steadily rising. EDIT: Now I have 28 hours compared to the 2 hours at this review's writing. The game has only gotten better, and New Game+ provides an even bigger challenge. Oh, and Battle Kitchen just came out, which is awesome. BUY THIS GAME NOW.			"

												This game is REALLY simple. It's so simple and provocative to me as a programmer that i did not created and released this game. This game is soooo simple in technical and visual parts but this game can give you a lot of damn good time. You may stop playing after some hour but you want to go back and continue playing because it is so simple and fun that you cannot stop playing it.The gameplay is simple: Customer order then you serve him\her. You have to accomplish things when the customer ordering something like putting the correct toppings on the food or cooking it and pressing the button in the correct time to serve it to the customer. Oh and don't forget about the rush hours which occurs 2 times a day. Of course like in every restaurant there are some cleaning you have to do like cleaning the toilet (2 button needs to be pressed not simultaneously) or cleaning dirty plates etc... . You can create your daily menu from more than 25+ food in the game. You can buy things to extend the patience of the customers and other things. The game gets harder when you get more stars for your restaurant.If you are really fast and like to challenge yourself in this game there is an extreme difficulty for you. It will speed up a lot of things for you. The rush hour in this mode will be really challenging for most of the people.I really recommend this game to you to get it and play with it. It's really simple and fun for a simple game that is unbelievable. This game contains a lot's of things that you expect a game like this and MORE. It is also good for relaxing after working. If you are still reading this and not owning\playing this game then go and get it NOW!Have fun with it :)			"

												Cook, Serve, Delicious! is the pinnacle of cooking sims. I honestly cannot begin to explain how utterly addictive the gameplay is.   The buzz system works quite well to ensure that days are never too difficult (okay, the beginning days are pretty difficult to get used to) nor too easy, and the ability to upgrade dishes and create one's own menu allows the player to further scale the game's difficulty. The game's visually appealing and filled with little challenges throughout the game to keep things interesting for hours. And while I wish there were options for customization on the restaurant itself, the lack of said options doesn't detract from the overall fun of the game.EDIT: Cook, Serve, Delicious 2!! is coming out soon.

												When you look at the screenshots and trailers this game might look like a browser game. I took the risk of buying it during the Christmas sale, I didn't regret that decision. After a few hours of playtime you notice this game offers a lot more content than a browser game.The variation in dishes and possibilities to upgrade those dishes, combined with 'chores' (for example: cleaning the toilet) makes each day of service different. The extra events that are included in the game are fun and challenging, they are also handy to learn the key bindings to be more efficient in serving your food on daily basis.The steam achievements, steam cooking challenges and leaderboards give the game a competitive aspect.In my opninion the game is very simple but it works. It's fun and addictive. You can easily play Cook, Serve, Delicious! for 30-40 hours until you have fully completed it.Even at it's current price I could advice anyone to buy this game.			"

												I want to like this - brings back memories of Diner Dash and Food Prep Flash Games. But the achievements and even upgrade list is daunting only in that you're doing the same tasks over and over to grind out yet another type of base + seasoning + sauce. The only thing that makes this game enjoyable is that rush and anxiety of serving multiple customers at once in a tight time frame. Once you know the key orders, it becomes a chore to play.. you are playing a food preparation game afterall, but the progression is too slow and increments too small. Gets boring real quick.

I wish they had made this a little more accessible to people who aren't interested in investing a lot of time into it in order to advance through the levels.

												I must have had 100+ hours on Ore No Ryomi 2 back in the day. Playing CSD was familiar, too familiar in fact, but I didn't know it was the same developer until I finished the career mode for the first time and unlocked the gallery. In many ways, CSD is easier in that you can choose an active menu so you don't get stuck with difficult dishes once you've bought them. I remember French Fries and Fried Chicken were hellish in ONR2. I like the upgrades and the different special events, although I think the ""penalty"" for serving bad orders just makes the following day easier because of the slightly lower buzz. I hate the Shish Kabob and the Soup! I'm just trying to get all the achievements now, but I think it has good replayability when you just want to kill a few minutes.			"

COOK, SERVE, DELICIOUS!Restaurant action-sim that requires you remain cool under pressure and have fast fingers.7/10Cook, Serve, Delicious is at times an intense and high paced experience. You start with a run down restaurant that needs money, a lot of money, to improve. From new equipment that opens up new recipes to improving the decor and facilities. It starts at a relatively easy pace serving simple staple such as corn dogs and beer to a small number of customers. These customers come in slowly at first as you build up buzz about your new restaurant after all no one wants to eat at a run down place they've never heard of before. Each order requires you to give the customer exactly what they want as fast as possible, making sure they don't wait too long and you don't over/under cook their order. This is where the difficulty comes in, each order must be prepared by pressing the responding key that matches the food type. To create something simple like a corn dog you only have to press either M for mustard or K for ketchup or if the customer has no taste both. It seems simple and it is, however this simplicity doesn't last long. As both your restaurant and equipment improve so does the difficulty. Along with the restaurant improvements comes new customers with more refined palates, they no longer want corn dogs and beer but steak, soup and fine wine. These fine foods are more complicated to make are require a good memory, fast fingers and attention to detail. So for example a customer will order lasagne that requires you to press P-S-M-C-R twice followed by P-S-M-C, one mistake or slip and the order is ruined, take more than a few seconds and orders will be missed.Days are broken up into five parts, the early part of the day will see a small number of customers then the rush hour at lunch time hits, you’ll need to be on your a-game to make it through before another lull as you prepare for the dinner rush-hour and finally after that the wind down before closing time. Deciding what dishes to put on the menu will make or break your day, too many complicated dishes will attract more people but will prove difficult to satisfy every order during rush hour, however too simple a menu and you won't attract enough people nor make enough money. Thrown into this mix are odd-jobs such as cleaning the plates, cleaning the toilet and taking out the trash, simple jobs but they are usually thrown at you when you least want or expect them and can seriously throw a spanner into what was a successful rush-hour.At the end of each day you get to prepare for the next one, buying new equipment, reading emails, accepting challenges, laying bets on your cooking skills and creating a new menu. There's a far bit of grind as you're required to complete 20 days before you can upgrade to the next restaurant. However it's very addictive and the game makes sure you're always busy with rarely chance to stop and think as you try and achieve a day of perfect orders. There's no great depth to Cook, Serve, Delicious other than the constant actions-per-minute mechanic but that's the attraction, nailing a perfect day on extreme difficulty is an exhilarating and satisfying experience. For many people who fold under pressure, have slow fingers or a bad memory then the heat of the kitchen will prove to be too great.			"

												Single sentence review: The zaniest and most challenging restaurant sim slash time management game you will ever come across on Steam.Cook Serve Delicious is an incredibly fun, potentially maddening cooking/restaurant ""sim"" - although using that word to describe it is doing a disservice. While you do indeed play owner and choose the menu, check your emails and so on (some of the emails are hilarious by the way!), the core focus of the gameplay boils down to you as chef. From open to close, it's your job to multi-task your customer's orders, using keyboard hotkeys to manage up to eight (!) dishes simultaneously. Cook each one with no mistakes and get them out on time to rack up your combo, win bets, unlock cool stuff and eventually showcase your talents in front of a culinary secret society! I'm not joking.Now. This game may look like another Diner Dash, but considering that some dishes use nearly every single letter (A-Z) on the keyboard plus the arrow keys and space bar, this game can reach a level of difficulty which will have even the most hardcore time-management fans palpitating. Combine this with a realistic peak time mechanic, your food choices having a PROFOUND effect on how the day will pan out, needing to compelete chores simultaneously alongside your cooking to stop bad publicity, navigating ever more complex bets from Crazy Dave or an orange robot to boost funding to your restaurant, and suddenly needing to respond to a potential girlfriend/boyfriend's crappy chat-up lines in the middle of a five second flash-fry...... yeah. This game can get as hectic and random as all hell, but it is one of the richest and most challenging time-management games I have ever played and I cannot recommend it enough. I would especially recommend it if you have never felt challenged by a time management game before. Too many games in that genre go down the route of being too easy, doing lots of hand-holding or very quickly running out of new features to keep you interested. Cook Serve Delicious manages to deliver on all of those aspects while remaining colourful and wacky enough to stop you from throwing your laptop at a concrete wall.Bon appétit!			"

												I've clocked in quite a lot of time with Cook, Serve, Delicious! , and can attest to its addictiveness. It is a game which places you under the stress of following repeated sets of instructions at a sometimes rapid pace. The setting is that of a restaurant where you, the head chef, must develop your instruction-following skills to exceptional standards.The presentation is pretty straightforward and functional, with the art style cartoonish without sacrificing the necessary detail. The humour is quirkily offbeat and in places (primarily the food descriptions) mildly satirical. If you get gripped by addiction like I did you're likely to be annoyed by the music after awhile, although the sound effects are vital for you to be cooking at your best: difficulty can be applied by simply muting the game.Although the game tries to enliven the cookery grind with betting, health inspections, tournaments and a rather bland dating system, the core elements remain unchanged from start to finish. I doubt the creators could have done any better without essentially building minigames from the ground up. Regardless, this is by definition a title of limited scope.I do recommend this title, however given the aformentioned shallowness I also recommend buying it when it's on sale.			"

												A while ago I told myself i wouldn't buy any more Indie games.I'm glad I changed my mind because this is the best of them!The game concept is pretty simple, serve as many people as you can to buy food and upgrade your restaurant.Some food and drinks are more complex to prepare than others but earn you more cash. You need quick fingers as the customers come thick and fast when it reaches rush hour.Besides serving the food you can buy equipment to keep the distractions of chores to a minimum and the health and safety officers happy.There's an email system to keep you upto date on whats ahead and even betting and dating :DI got this on sale for next to nothing so i was pleasantly surprised.

												This feels like the kind of game that helps build memory and awareness.  Each 'day' in the game is like a ten-minute exercise to wake up your brain!  I love it!Folks have been asking me what I think of it and I keep describing it as a blend between 'Papers, Please' and 'Game Dev Tycoon'.  You spend the active days tapping together the orders given by your customer and the time between managing your menu and checking out special events and optional goals to grow your restaurant.  Good casual fun!			"

												An absolutely delicious game! It's so engaging and complex for a cooking game! I would definitely recommend it if you're into cooking games and enjoy a challenge. The graphics are mouthwatering, and the recipes get more and more complicated as you upgrade them. You can set your own menu for your restaurant, you have to give 100 percent of hard work every second of the in-game day, to create positive buzz (popularity) from customers, and you have to invest in your restaurant in other ways except buying new equipment. It's quite realistic to a point. I won't spoil it further. The only annoying thing I've encountered is the ""menu rot"" thing, having to change the dishes in your menu every couple of days, I've seen other fans commenting on it. But come to think of it, it's great to get a fresh change in menu every other day, it keeps the game interesting and creative. I also dislike how some of the negative buzz created by some menu items doesn't seem to be very realistic. Why would anyone mind for having alcohol on the menu? I'd say, in an office building, it's a plus.I really love the music, it's so playful and it really keeps you engaged during rush hour, when you need to focus a lot in order to do a good job!The customer animations and sounds are priceless. I like how they get more upper class too once you gain more stars for your restaurant.I also love how there are a lot of in-game games, like the Iron Cook Challenge (think MasterChef).This game is such a delight, it always demands more of you, it's a game you can truly try your best to play to perfection. Kudos to the creators for creating such fun, interesting and original content. And for making it truly challenging. I've been playing cooking games for a long time but this is by far my favorite. For such a reasonably small price, considering the amount of game content (some of it, high-end dishes, recently added) this game is definitely worth trying out! It's a bargain, and a must-have for any foodie with a gaming passion! :)			"

												Single sentence review: The zaniest and most challenging restaurant sim slash time management game you will ever come across on Steam.Cook Serve Delicious is an incredibly fun, potentially maddening cooking/restaurant ""sim"" - although using that word to describe it is doing a disservice. While you do indeed play owner and choose the menu, check your emails and so on (some of the emails are hilarious by the way!), the core focus of the gameplay boils down to you as chef. From open to close, it's your job to multi-task your customer's orders, using keyboard hotkeys to manage up to eight (!) dishes simultaneously. Cook each one with no mistakes and get them out on time to rack up your combo, win bets, unlock cool stuff and eventually showcase your talents in front of a culinary secret society! I'm not joking.Now. This game may look like another Diner Dash, but considering that some dishes use nearly every single letter (A-Z) on the keyboard plus the arrow keys and space bar, this game can reach a level of difficulty which will have even the most hardcore time-management fans palpitating. Combine this with a realistic peak time mechanic, your food choices having a PROFOUND effect on how the day will pan out, needing to compelete chores simultaneously alongside your cooking to stop bad publicity, navigating ever more complex bets from Crazy Dave or an orange robot to boost funding to your restaurant, and suddenly needing to respond to a potential girlfriend/boyfriend's crappy chat-up lines in the middle of a five second flash-fry...... yeah. This game can get as hectic and random as all hell, but it is one of the richest and most challenging time-management games I have ever played and I cannot recommend it enough. I would especially recommend it if you have never felt challenged by a time management game before. Too many games in that genre go down the route of being too easy, doing lots of hand-holding or very quickly running out of new features to keep you interested. Cook Serve Delicious manages to deliver on all of those aspects while remaining colourful and wacky enough to stop you from throwing your laptop at a concrete wall.Bon appétit!			"

												A while ago I told myself i wouldn't buy any more Indie games.I'm glad I changed my mind because this is the best of them!The game concept is pretty simple, serve as many people as you can to buy food and upgrade your restaurant.Some food and drinks are more complex to prepare than others but earn you more cash. You need quick fingers as the customers come thick and fast when it reaches rush hour.Besides serving the food you can buy equipment to keep the distractions of chores to a minimum and the health and safety officers happy.There's an email system to keep you upto date on whats ahead and even betting and dating :DI got this on sale for next to nothing so i was pleasantly surprised.

												I must have had 100+ hours on Ore No Ryomi 2 back in the day. Playing CSD was familiar, too familiar in fact, but I didn't know it was the same developer until I finished the career mode for the first time and unlocked the gallery. In many ways, CSD is easier in that you can choose an active menu so you don't get stuck with difficult dishes once you've bought them. I remember French Fries and Fried Chicken were hellish in ONR2. I like the upgrades and the different special events, although I think the ""penalty"" for serving bad orders just makes the following day easier because of the slightly lower buzz. I hate the Shish Kabob and the Soup! I'm just trying to get all the achievements now, but I think it has good replayability when you just want to kill a few minutes.			"

												This is by far one of my favorite games that I own in my Steam Library. When people want to know a lesser known game that I recommend, I recommend this game. Cook, Serve, Delicious! is a wonderful game that simulates what it would feel like being on a the line for a popular restaurant. You have to cook, you have prepare, you have to serve the food all perfectly or face the consequences. CSD is a restaurant sim, it is a cooking sim, it is the food simulator that we've been waiting for. The gameplay is excellent, the different modes are challening and bring new ways to play the game. If you want to just casually play a few rounds, you can do that, if you want to compete against those around the world, you can do that as well.			"

												I've clocked in quite a lot of time with Cook, Serve, Delicious! , and can attest to its addictiveness. It is a game which places you under the stress of following repeated sets of instructions at a sometimes rapid pace. The setting is that of a restaurant where you, the head chef, must develop your instruction-following skills to exceptional standards.The presentation is pretty straightforward and functional, with the art style cartoonish without sacrificing the necessary detail. The humour is quirkily offbeat and in places (primarily the food descriptions) mildly satirical. If you get gripped by addiction like I did you're likely to be annoyed by the music after awhile, although the sound effects are vital for you to be cooking at your best: difficulty can be applied by simply muting the game.Although the game tries to enliven the cookery grind with betting, health inspections, tournaments and a rather bland dating system, the core elements remain unchanged from start to finish. I doubt the creators could have done any better without essentially building minigames from the ground up. Regardless, this is by definition a title of limited scope.I do recommend this title, however given the aformentioned shallowness I also recommend buying it when it's on sale.			"

COOK, SERVE, DELICIOUS!Restaurant action-sim that requires you remain cool under pressure and have fast fingers.7/10Cook, Serve, Delicious is at times an intense and high paced experience. You start with a run down restaurant that needs money, a lot of money, to improve. From new equipment that opens up new recipes to improving the decor and facilities. It starts at a relatively easy pace serving simple staple such as corn dogs and beer to a small number of customers. These customers come in slowly at first as you build up buzz about your new restaurant after all no one wants to eat at a run down place they've never heard of before. Each order requires you to give the customer exactly what they want as fast as possible, making sure they don't wait too long and you don't over/under cook their order. This is where the difficulty comes in, each order must be prepared by pressing the responding key that matches the food type. To create something simple like a corn dog you only have to press either M for mustard or K for ketchup or if the customer has no taste both. It seems simple and it is, however this simplicity doesn't last long. As both your restaurant and equipment improve so does the difficulty. Along with the restaurant improvements comes new customers with more refined palates, they no longer want corn dogs and beer but steak, soup and fine wine. These fine foods are more complicated to make are require a good memory, fast fingers and attention to detail. So for example a customer will order lasagne that requires you to press P-S-M-C-R twice followed by P-S-M-C, one mistake or slip and the order is ruined, take more than a few seconds and orders will be missed.Days are broken up into five parts, the early part of the day will see a small number of customers then the rush hour at lunch time hits, you’ll need to be on your a-game to make it through before another lull as you prepare for the dinner rush-hour and finally after that the wind down before closing time. Deciding what dishes to put on the menu will make or break your day, too many complicated dishes will attract more people but will prove difficult to satisfy every order during rush hour, however too simple a menu and you won't attract enough people nor make enough money. Thrown into this mix are odd-jobs such as cleaning the plates, cleaning the toilet and taking out the trash, simple jobs but they are usually thrown at you when you least want or expect them and can seriously throw a spanner into what was a successful rush-hour.At the end of each day you get to prepare for the next one, buying new equipment, reading emails, accepting challenges, laying bets on your cooking skills and creating a new menu. There's a far bit of grind as you're required to complete 20 days before you can upgrade to the next restaurant. However it's very addictive and the game makes sure you're always busy with rarely chance to stop and think as you try and achieve a day of perfect orders. There's no great depth to Cook, Serve, Delicious other than the constant actions-per-minute mechanic but that's the attraction, nailing a perfect day on extreme difficulty is an exhilarating and satisfying experience. For many people who fold under pressure, have slow fingers or a bad memory then the heat of the kitchen will prove to be too great.			"

												Just finished the entire game with achievements, and despite some problems, I still recommend it.[PROS]- Original concept that you don't see much. Nice for working out your typing skills, multitasking skills, reading speed, and memory.- Nice graphics for a 2D game.- Lean and intuitive UI.- Achievements are actually doable in a lifetime.- Addictive.[CONS]- Makes you hungry.- Your girlfriend will think you're taking cooking lessons and have more expectations.- Balancing problems between various foods. Some complicated foods provide little reward. So why make them? Fish, for example, are quick and easy to make (even fully upgraded, they only have 2 recipe cards), attract customers and have a very rapid return-on-investment. So why make anything else?- The game quickly becomes repetitive. You come to expect more content out of improving your restaurant other than just a skin change and customers with more patience.- The game describes itself as hardcore but is actually very easy. Can be done completely without ever using the optional VIPs, bets and dating mechanisms.- It feels like the New Game Plus mode was added as a last-minute afterthought. It induces even more balancing problems and the game actually becomes even easier than before. Feels very untested.[SPECIAL NOTES ABOUT NG+]- Because of the constant 50% positive buzz, you'll never be in trouble of lacking customers.- You'll actually be trying to artificially decrease the number of customers by keeping the same fatty foods on your menu for a long time and putting alcohol on the menu (going against everything you learnt in the previous game mode).- By the time you get to a 2-star restaurant and because of all the customers, you should have enough money to get through the whole game.- After this point, you can even go through days without touching your keyboard, failing all your food orders. The only consequence will be less customers the following day, which is actually a good thing!Finally, the game has a major design oversight: by leaving cooked foods burning on the stove / grill (for example steak, chicken or fish), you can block several / all your prep stations from receiving new customers. This allows you to make the game simpler by effectively removing a number of prep stations for the day at 0 negative buzz (I'm not an expert at cooking, but steak burnt for 13 hours should not be viewed by customers as ""average""...).In NG+, you can use this to take a 5-minute break away from your computer or laugh at 8 idiots watching their food burn for a whole day while effectively avoiding super rush hours (""extreme difficulty"" achievement :-)), robberies, chores and it gives you a free pass to safety inspections! Once you've satisfied the other items on your level-up checklist, it's a quick and easy way to go through the remaining days unaffected.			"

												The game I was spying on for so long and never got it until this week Humble Bundle (GO NOW!). Anyway, way it occured to me I might like it is the fact it reminded me of sweet childhood memories of playing Bishi Bashi on Playstation One. Now, Cook, Serve, Delicious! is a bit different, it's part management, part frantic mini game meet skills race against time, part total madness.You start as low life in fast food industry. You serve crap food, yet decide to call yourself a restaurant owner. Through series of hard grueling tasks such as picking the right cup size for sweet drinks, not overfilling tankards of beer and serving badly burned burgers, you also need to check e-mail, like posts on Facebook, do catering services. Let's not forget washing dishes, cleaning bathrooms and throwing out trash. Each day you have to survive two painful rushours and your customers are total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s (and alcoholics). Apart from main campaign, you'll also try to be the fastest, most efficient chef amongst your Steam buddies and you'll also be able to do magic work against your loved ones in hot seat sessions.Why you need to get this game?Because I currently need to play Pillars of Eternity, Witcher 1, Wasteland 2, Running With Rifles, H1Z1, my scores on Pinball Arcade and Pinball FX2 are ultra low, I have to watch new episodes of Better Call Saul and Peaky Blinders, I have several books waiting in queue, need to finish numerous reviews and translate some interviews, yet I go against ALL ODDS and play this game. I even played it today, on my daughter's third birthday. That's HOW GOOD this game is.			"

												Rather hectic and fast paced restaurant management game which reminds me of when I worked in cafes and lunch bars. Dislike that there is no option to have other staff, just 1 person, serving, cooking  and cleaning.Bit too crazy as most places have at least 4 staff. Not just one person to do everything.As a manager I would rather not do the cleaning and pay someone to do it. Wish the game allowed you to hire staff, at least a cleaner. Dislike how I have to do iron cook show challenges to get 4 stars. Don't think I can pass it. I can't do 5 fast paced rounds and not make more than 2 mistakes.This is not a true restaurant sim as you're the only one working in a restaurant which is insane. You can't hire staff, you can't choose prices for the food.Lack of realism aside I enjoy the game mostly, it's very addictive despite being stressful, frustrating and fast paced I like the challenge up to a point.6/10. doesn't get higher as the fun eventually wears off and gets too fast, stressful, no longer fun and eventually feels worse than a real job.

With a total of 5 star resturants it's ~15 hours for the career mode alone, if you wanted to unlock all the recipes (minigames) it could take 30+ hours. That's the length of an average 60$ AAA game.

												Cook, Serve, Delicious is a fun little casual game where you use your keyboard(Or mouse) to cook ingredients by selecting the right option for several small minigames that mostly have to do with the order in which items are added, and adding the right items to an order. It's beautiful in its simplicity and has short (10-15 minute) days which you can quickly play during a break, or when you're just bored for a while. The artstyle comes together quite well and the gameplay works out while letting you set your own difficulty - You can pick and choose what items to serve, between 3 and 6 different ones every day and can decide to get easy things, hard things, or a mix of both. In addition, the game has challenges which will allow you to test your skill at some of the foods.Coupled with this is a progression as you take your restaurant from 'that greasy junk joint' that people visit for lunch but not much else all the way to a 5-star restaurant selling lobsters and fine wine throughout the day. You will be offered challenges to make perfect combos, and you may get a VIP along the way asking for specific foods.Sadly, the one thing I did not manage to figure out in this game are the robberies, in which you need to identify a masked man who just sort of walks past the background with 6 or so variables. How do you do this, you ask? I haven't got a clue I say. If you know a way to identify and sketch the face of someone wearing a mask that covers all their features, then you'll do fine. Otherwise, you won't be able to complete the robbery chore in this game. Luckily, the robbery is the rarest of events, so you will not see much of it either way.Edit: Thanks to the comment below for explaining the robbery! I didn't even think to look thereThere are online challenges, and there is a multiplayer mode which I have not explored, along with several unlockable chefs which...I don't know, you don't seem to see your chef during the game so I don't really understand the point of it.Either way, it's a casual amusing game that you can spend a long time on, with simple gameplay lending to a lot of replay value			"

												So addictive. You have to deal with multiple customers, the amount of which you have to serve at once increasing the further through the game you get, with many different foods that require different making skills, and while the mouse is easier to remember and use, keyboard shortcuts are quicker, you have to find an accurate balance. You will start off failing, but after an hour or so it will become second nature. Very complex and deep game mechanics exist as you get further in too, such as bets and upgrades.			"

												This game is an exercise in repetition.On the plus side, the graphics are endearing (if limited), the mechanics are straightforward and easy to understand, and the in-game text has a bit of charm.However, the game quickly just becomes a grind-fest. During the normal campaign, there is very little incentive to branch out in the menu (I understand menu rot as a mechanic, but it doesn't make any sense in the context of a restaurant). The difficult curve doesn't really ramp up, even near the end. Honestly, I believe many of the players will stick with a menu consisting of a bunch of staples and a couple of items that are easy to make (fish, hint hint).But really the fatal flaw is the crazy amount of repetition that bogs the game down. It begins exciting and becomes painful. I hope CSD 2 fixes these issues, and I can't wait to try it!			"

												At first I thought that it's only a bit better browser cooking game. I was only partially right.If you have ever played any cooking flash games, you know what is it all about. You run low tier restaurant, earn money to buy new food, more equipment ect. in order to create renowned restaurat. You do it by preparing food and selling it to customers. Preparing itself seems to be pretty easy - you have customers' order at the bottom of the screen, and you have to press buttons corresponding to requested adds. Where it gets tricky are rush hours - they occur twice a day, and result in huge amount of customers - so you need to be fast not to make bad food. There are of course rewards for your effort - it's marked in three ways: perfect - exactly what asked; good - small mistake; bad -... pretty obvious. Good and perfect orders result in +0.5% of buzz, wile bad ones result in -0.5% of buzz (buzz is meter of popularity, the bigger the buzz, the more customers next day). Plus, perfect days result in additional money. Besides of cooking, you have also sanitary duties, like cleaning toilet, tossing garbage and so on.After day of cooking, you go to main menu, where you check your emails (they contain spam, random events yelling in more money or higher buzz, notify you about sanitary inspection or else), spend money on new food types or their upgrades (ugraded foods *might* be a little harder, but they are a bit more profitable) or change your active menu. You can't have all your food available every day - you have to change it once per some days (with some exceptions, most of foods are affected by so called ""menu root"" - it was too long in your menu, and people got bored, resulting in negative buzz). Also you can buy equipment, which will make your job easier, by for example cutting amount of dishes nneded to cean by two, or making customers wait a little longer.  After some time, in main menu you will be able to acess special events - like eg. catering events. Theese are a way for you to earn nice money in 2-3 minutes. There are also bets - if you take them and complete, you get more money.All of modern games must have some kind of multiplayer - CSD has Battle Kitchen, with plenty of game modes, like weekly game, with your score posted on the leaderboard. It also includes local coop.Simple as it is, CSD is pretty enjoyable game. I became victiom of ""one more day"" within first few hours of playing. If you don't mind managing restaurant, this is a game for you. My only question - why are people in this game so depresed?			"

If you were experiencing this same problem and gave up on the game, I encourage you to come back and try it again.The GOOD:Simple, but charming artwork.Catchy and enjoyable music.Fast-paced and exciting.Many different elements outside of ""make this dish"" such as dating, health inspections, chores, betting, the concept of ""menu rot,"" robberies, three types of mini games, and an email system which includes spam messages.Can use hotkeys, mouse, or a combination of both. Can create/edit the hotkeys to your liking.Manages to be simplistic and inviting to learn while offering a challenge.Enjoyable, despite its repetitiveness.At least 20 hours of playtime before completing the game (in my experience).A fun game for any foodie or fan of cooking games.The BAD:Once all food and equipment has been bought and upgraded, there is nothing to spend your money on, though it continues to accumulate.Not much incentive to play the game once you have fully upgraded your restaurant and earned all achievements.The three mini games are too similar. One of them is only more challenging because you must be perfect, where the others allow some mistakes to be made.Overall, I recommend this game. I bought this when it was on sale for a few dollars.

												Cook, serve, delicious is one of those games that are easy to learn, but hard to master. You play as a restaurant owner that serves a line of waiting customers. You have to prepare each individual order by pressing the right button for each ingredient on your keyboard (you can also play with mouse or controller), and while it is pretty simple, it gets frantic very fast. You get to pick your own menu and upgrade your kitchen and recipes, which most of the time also makes them more complex to make but also more rewarding. The game never gets boring as it keeps you constantly on your toes by a steady influx of customers, rush hour (which is a more fast paced part of your day) as well as several chores and sometimes even robberies (!) where you get to identify your assaulter. There are also several challenge stages for specific food groups which can get REALLY difficult to complete, but help you lead your restaurant toward your 5 star goal.Gameplay gets more fast paced as you progress and can be pretty stressful, but is also very rewarding when you manage to get that perfect combo streak at the end of the day. If you are into this time sensitive serving ""genre"", this game will keep you hooked into it for hours at a time.			"

												I just bought Cook Serve Delicious.  This game is so simple in design but it is insanely addictive.  Basically, you start off with a cheap little diner in an office tower and have to work your way up to a 5-star restaurant.  Essentially, you are the cook and have to prepare orders for the customers that come in.  It's a very casual game that doesn't have any difficult business strategies or anything like that.  You just have to be quick with either the keyboard or mouse during rush hour.It kinda reminds me of Tetris or those kinda of games but with food.  It's pretty neat and only $4.  It's worth a shot if your looking for something different and light.I'm usually only into very deep games but this has me hooked for some reason.  Definitely a major two thumbs up for the price. "

												I installed this just to collect the trading cards. 20 hours of gameplay later, and I'm still going.It neatly combines charm, humour and light strategy with the increasingly challenging task of preparing and serving the meals.Although it could have felt grindy, with each star requiring twenty days of service, the game constantly encourages you to change your menu though special events (VIPs, dates, bets) and ""menu rot"", meaning that you can't just stick with the ""safe"" dishes like fish and salads - nachos, burgers and the damned soups need to be on the menu at times as well. This ensures that it's constantly fresh and challenging. It's a deceptively deep game, and one with plenty of potential enjoyment.			"

												I... I was not expecting to like this so much. Manage a restaurant by yourself. Pick your menu, prepare your food, prioritize your customers, do chores... etc. Practice multi-tasking and learning your food assembly by buttons on your controller. Played 3 days before writing this review.Each day is composed of early morning and mid day luls, but there's lunch and dinner rushes. You must prepare each item on the menu by reading the customers order (burger assembly by buttons, cooking the meat patties), pouring beer by holding down left stick until the beer has a nice head on it, getting the right size soft drink cup (with or without ice), dunking the fries in the fryer until there's steam (with or without salt).... And chores! Set rat traps, flush the toilets (flush then sanitize your hands), scrub dishes, throw trash out (alternating buttons, the sanitize your hands).Then at the end of the day, you can buy new items to serve, new equipment, and change around your menu.And then repeat.Buy it on sale. Buy it not on sale. It's good.			"

												Chances are you've come across games of this kind before, either as a flash game or some small minigame somewhere, the resturant management where you are the only employee and have to take care of everything. Though Cook, Serve, Delicious! differs itself from these other games in that it's actively trying to give you a heart attack.This game isn't bad, but you'll really need to know how to balance alot of things, both cooking and doing chores that, if skipped. Will make your resturant unsanitary. The game really goes full out in making you responsible for any failure that might occur, as the game offers you full customization of how you do your business, in that you can use mouse only, keyboard only or both. Even controller support.If you get into this game thinking it'll be a piece of cake, you are dead wrong. Sure, in time you will gain the ability to upgrade things that will make customers more patient, and people that take care of cleaning or at the least minimize it. But you'll still have to work your fine bumcheeks off to not completely screw up, especially during rush-hours which turn your nice calm resturant in to a damn warzone.If you like getting stressed out, and cooking/management. Go for it. "

You may think that food is the only thing in this game but you're wrong, there's funny emails, catering events, actual consequences to your food menu and having to plan out what you're going to serve, and you have to get your usuall inspection to check you're doing your chores.The mood or setting or even background of the game is super fitting to the game, when it rain's it get's all moody and the music changes, when the day comes to a end it changes to night and changes the music once again, the AI is really funny and quite fitting like there's some canadian looking fellows and some people who look like hobo's and some women who look classy. The only downfall I see is actually the realism of what the people get in different times of the day, many time's I see me first order being a beer at 9 in the morning.Overall this game is a must get 9.5/10			"

												When they say 'hardcore', that is not an overstating buzzword.This game is probably the closest any cooking title will ever get to being a Hell's Kitchen simulation. The recipes are simple in execution, but what is not simple is the VOLUME in which you be cooking them. If Cooking Mama was to cooking at home, Cook, Serve, Delicious is to cooking in an environment where your lifestyle is on the line. The game eases you in with some simple difficulty and really easy to make recipes, but as you progress through restaurants in which you're going to be held to a higher standard, so to must you be able to go above and beyond. In case the day to day tedium of completing service days isn't giving you the proper motivation, the game also includes a devious betting system, which dares you complete a chain of perfect orders in a row with specific items on your menu, so no comfort zone here, unless that comfort zone is LITERALLY EVERYTHING.But this game is by no means boring or unfair. Getting perfect days is still possible, but you'll have to manage your money wisely and deal with the ever unpredicatable orders of customers. It's no wonder this game got a sequel. I would recommend this game, but be forewarned, you're going to take a lot of hits until you eventually succeed.			"

												If you've ever wanted the thrill of running a restaurant, well this is a game so you're not going to get any thrills like that.  However if you've ever wanted the thrill of pretending you run a restarant with tasks done in the form of minigames, then there are lots of thrills to be had here.First off, you start out with 4 menu slots and enough cash to buy some stuff.  You can buy a grill, a fryer, an industrial stove for making soups and stuff, etc.  You also get to pick food ranging from simple to complicated, and quick to ""needs lots of prep time"".  Food can also be upgraded to allow you more options and more money. A typical day goes like this: you choose your menu items, you start the day and people stop in and give you orders.  It could be ""I need a large water with flavor blast and no ice"" or ""one corn dog with nothing on it"" or maybe even ""3 meat patties, cheese bacon and tomato"" or whatever.  As long as you don't make any mistakes and don't take too long, the customer is happy and you get some extra ""buzz"" from it.  Make a few mistakes and the customer walks away unsatisfied but otherwise ok (no buzz).  REALLY screw things up and he gets mad and you lose buzz.Oh and while you're doing all of this, there's dishes to be done, there's trash to throw out, rat traps to reset, toilets to flush, and the occasional blog post that needs thumbing up because it could raise your buzz.  The game is relatively simple, but yet it's just challenging enough to make you feel like you accomplished something when you go a full day with no bad orders, or if you made a really good streak of perfect orders.  It takes some practice to get used to it, and sometimes adding a new item to the menu can throw you off your game, but you really have to keep changing up the menu to keep it fresh and interesting (both for you and for the customers in game).The game is very charming with jazzy music that plays at various times of the day, for various weather conditions, and during rush hour (among other events).  The art style is kinda like a childrens book, but it doesn't detract from the game and maybe adds a little flavor to it (since the customers you get depend on how good your restaurant is).  If you dislike minigames or QTE style games, you should probably pass on CSD, but if you like trying to multitask and you don't mind the physical challenge of having to hit certain keys (sometimes in a certain order) then this is worth a look.  I've enjoyed CSD... maybe you will too?			"

												I installed this just to collect the trading cards. 20 hours of gameplay later, and I'm still going.It neatly combines charm, humour and light strategy with the increasingly challenging task of preparing and serving the meals.Although it could have felt grindy, with each star requiring twenty days of service, the game constantly encourages you to change your menu though special events (VIPs, dates, bets) and ""menu rot"", meaning that you can't just stick with the ""safe"" dishes like fish and salads - nachos, burgers and the damned soups need to be on the menu at times as well. This ensures that it's constantly fresh and challenging. It's a deceptively deep game, and one with plenty of potential enjoyment.			"

It doesn't stay static like some games but continues to get even more difficult. I even feel guilty when I mess up an order.

												I... I was not expecting to like this so much. Manage a restaurant by yourself. Pick your menu, prepare your food, prioritize your customers, do chores... etc. Practice multi-tasking and learning your food assembly by buttons on your controller. Played 3 days before writing this review.Each day is composed of early morning and mid day luls, but there's lunch and dinner rushes. You must prepare each item on the menu by reading the customers order (burger assembly by buttons, cooking the meat patties), pouring beer by holding down left stick until the beer has a nice head on it, getting the right size soft drink cup (with or without ice), dunking the fries in the fryer until there's steam (with or without salt).... And chores! Set rat traps, flush the toilets (flush then sanitize your hands), scrub dishes, throw trash out (alternating buttons, the sanitize your hands).Then at the end of the day, you can buy new items to serve, new equipment, and change around your menu.And then repeat.Buy it on sale. Buy it not on sale. It's good.			"

												Chances are you've come across games of this kind before, either as a flash game or some small minigame somewhere, the resturant management where you are the only employee and have to take care of everything. Though Cook, Serve, Delicious! differs itself from these other games in that it's actively trying to give you a heart attack.This game isn't bad, but you'll really need to know how to balance alot of things, both cooking and doing chores that, if skipped. Will make your resturant unsanitary. The game really goes full out in making you responsible for any failure that might occur, as the game offers you full customization of how you do your business, in that you can use mouse only, keyboard only or both. Even controller support.If you get into this game thinking it'll be a piece of cake, you are dead wrong. Sure, in time you will gain the ability to upgrade things that will make customers more patient, and people that take care of cleaning or at the least minimize it. But you'll still have to work your fine bumcheeks off to not completely screw up, especially during rush-hours which turn your nice calm resturant in to a damn warzone.If you like getting stressed out, and cooking/management. Go for it. "

												Not your average Restaurant Sim game. Rather than micro-manage, Cook, Serve, Delicious is an addictive indie game that focuses on the concept of making food. In a Simple Simon methodology, you are a budding chef and restaurant owner, aiming for the (5) stars of culinary fame. Following the simple tutorial is enough to get you going where you progress from having no stars, through to 5 and the ultimate fame .. who knows maybe Masterchef is next.At any rate, game play is simple. All you really need is a keyboard, though it has the option for mouse + keyboard use. The music is catchy, the graphics quirky, simple and fun. You earn money by keeping your patrons happy and fed, and in turn can spend money on upgrading your food and some time management perks like a dishwasher and rat catcher. Every task uses the Simple Simon concept of pushing buttons in order then watching the timer and managing orders when things get busy.It's a little bit of Restaurant Tycoon but more like Cooking Dash and those type of games. For the price, you could do much worse. I recommend you put your chef hat on and give this a go.			"

'T' tomato, 'M' meat, 'P' pickles and you have yourself a burger!). Good range of foods, and by setting the menu you can combine foods you're learning with foods you've mastered to control difficulty easily. And weekly challenge gets you cooking the foods you might not serve as much to keep you on your toes and a master of all!			"

												Cook, serve, delicious is one of those games that are easy to learn, but hard to master. You play as a restaurant owner that serves a line of waiting customers. You have to prepare each individual order by pressing the right button for each ingredient on your keyboard (you can also play with mouse or controller), and while it is pretty simple, it gets frantic very fast. You get to pick your own menu and upgrade your kitchen and recipes, which most of the time also makes them more complex to make but also more rewarding. The game never gets boring as it keeps you constantly on your toes by a steady influx of customers, rush hour (which is a more fast paced part of your day) as well as several chores and sometimes even robberies (!) where you get to identify your assaulter. There are also several challenge stages for specific food groups which can get REALLY difficult to complete, but help you lead your restaurant toward your 5 star goal.Gameplay gets more fast paced as you progress and can be pretty stressful, but is also very rewarding when you manage to get that perfect combo streak at the end of the day. If you are into this time sensitive serving ""genre"", this game will keep you hooked into it for hours at a time.			"

The game presents itself as it is: You run a resturaunt (Seemingly alone with no other staff), you cook food, server it, earn money, buy new foods, repeat.However, you have some things i myself have NEVER seen in resturant games before:-You can cater to outside sources-You can participate in a speical challange (Like the iron cheif in ORDER UP!)-You have an e-mail system where you can get e-mails which can either help or hurt you (Also junk mail is sent)-You can be robbedYou must keep up with chores (Washing dishes, taking out the trash, toilet maintenance, and setting rat traps) While also making sure you keep your customers happyNow, all this CAN seem overwhelming, and it is at first, but once you get used to it and buy some upgrades (You can upgrade multiple things to help you, as well as upgrade your shop), it becomes just paying attetion. Not to mention, it contains FULL keyboard support, so while serving customers, you don't have to touch your mouse at all if you don't want to.All in all, Cook, Serve, Delicious! is a truly unique game that i enjoy, and many other people would enjoy as well. It depends on your taste in games, but if you like unqiue games, you just HAVE to give this game a try.			"

												I've had to put this game aside for a while because I started playing it the other day and put in over 8 hours without even realizing it. I'd really like to put some more time into it, but overall accomplishments come slowly in this game.Cook, Serve, Delicious! is a restaurant sim, but the focus of the game is on the individual preparation of dishes, all of which are delivered in deceptively simple minigames which you have to complete in rapid fire succession over the course of each day of running the restaurant.It's a great concept that they can get a lot of mileage out of. There's a surprising amount of depth in this game, especially since I picked it up for just 5 dollars.There's a high number of dishes you can buy to serve in the restaurant, as well as uprgrades to all those dishes. There's a number of upgrades you can buy for your restaurant as well. There's random events that can occur during the day, and if you want your restaurant to be successful you have to manage your menu in such a way as to maximize appeal, taking various factors into account. These factors include your own abilities at the game as well.Perhaps there's going to be a safety inspection that day, and you don't want to miss out on any chores, so you stack the menu with dishes you know you can prepare quickly and easily, so you have more opportunity to focus on things the safety inspector will pay attention to.In addition, there's multiple modes available in the game, catering requires you to prepare a smaller number of dishes, but in faster succession and with less room for error. There's also a battle kitchen minigame, and other content that I have yet to experience because I'm only a 2 star restaurant right now.There's competitive and co-op multiplayer as well. Including a mode that can be played with two people on the same mouse and keyboard, which is nice to see.Like I said, a surprising amount of depth.I understand a sequel is coming out soon, and I'm already excited for it.There are however, some things that frustrate me about this game.First I feel like the progression is a little slow, but that's understandable, as it encourages you to hone your skills on certain dishes before moving on. It also means that this is a game you can get a lot of mileage out of.Also, I feel like some of the upgrades on food items are unneccesary and break the flow of the game. Lasagna, for example,  was already a difficult dish because it's slow to prepare and cook. The minigame associated with it required you to press 4 buttons in a specific sequence three times. It got easier after you memorized the sequence and I eventually got better at it. With the upgrades though, lasagna orders have more ingredients, and become randomized, completely  changing the nature of the minigame associated with it, and making it much more difficult.I think there should be more options to customize the look and feel of my restaurant, and perhaps a chance to specialize in certain types of food rather than having a menu that changes every two days (I don't know of any restaurants that do this). I mean, I really enjoyed preparing the seafood items in the game and I would enjoy having an in-game restaurant that specialized in this, and showcased it through decor or something similar, but there are no options to do so.

												Cook, Serve, Delicious! is a fairly innocent looking game, which is very easy to pick up and play, but hard to master. As the manager of an up-and-coming restaurant (more like a greasy spoon at first), you'll purchase food, devise a menu, and quickly whip up tasty food for the many impatient and particular customers who enter through your doors.In CSD, you'll do everything. Yes, you're the manager, and when you're not ""in the restaurant"", where the bulk of the game takes place, you'll have to take the meagre funds that you start with and buy equipment and food to sell, in the hopes of turning a profit. However, your job doesn't stop there. This business is your life.When the restaurant opens, you'll be the waiter taking the orders, the cook slaving away over the stove, and the janitor setting traps and throwing out the trash, amongst other things. How this works is extremely simple.Customers come in, and a picture of what they want appears next to a number at the left of the screen. Let's say it's salad. Press that number and you now have to prepare the food. A bowl of greens appears in the middle, and on the right are other options tied to buttons on the keyboard, ""G"" for ""Green and Carrots"", ""C"" for ""Cheese"" etc. At the bottom of the screen it says ""I want just greens and carrots"", so you press G and with a tap of enter, send it out. If you don't like the keyboard, you also have the option to use the mouse and just click the icons, or even a gamepad but I can't say if that's a good way to play or not.That took time to type out, but you'll grasp this in about 5 seconds, guaranteed. Speed and accuracy are extremely important. Speed is important because people are impatient. Once you're preparing their food, it's okay, they'll wait as long as it takes. But then other customers come in, wanting other things, so you'd better do this one quickly or they'll leave. No money for you, and even worse: you get negative buzz.Buzz is basically a measure of your popularity. It will increase if you're doing well, and decrease if you're doing badly. Not in the same day, mind you, but a poor performance one day (missed or inaccurate orders) will mean less buzz on the next day. Other factors affect it too, such as what foods are on your menu. Each type of food has positive and negative values, which you can view before you purchase them to put on your menu, or at any time after you've done that. Some foods are Fatty foods, and if you have too many on your menu, people start to have a negative idea of your restaurant and your buzz will go down by 5% or more. Some increase buzz, by being healthy, or by being considered to be ""worthy"". Aspirational foods, like fine wines and lobster. A good player will take a little time to balance their menu around foods which have lots of positive values but are perhaps difficult and time-consuming to make, and easy ones which are fatty foods or come served on a stick, like something you'd get at a noisy, smelly carnival for poor people UGHSo, you have a game of two halves. You have this calm, thoughtful management aspect of the game. No customers and no need to rush, just make sensible business decisions and try not to run out of cash. And then, when you click ""open restaurant"", you have this frantic button-mashing, so simple it could be a minigame on Newgrounds, and you're flinging food at impatient customers and cleaning up their mess as you go. Did I just serve that customer some raw chicken? ♥♥♥♥ IT MOVE ON. *wipes sweat off brow* The game actually balances the two sides very well. There is just enough meat to the management part that you can make good decisions (or bad ones) and this will affect the other side of the game, which works wonderfully because it's simple and just plain fun. You press the buttons and serve the food, and you do it FAST.There are a couple of issues I have with the game which I fully expect to be resolved in the sequel. Firstly, you start off with a one star restaurant, which is fine, but in order to move up to two stars and start making more money, you have to do a full 20 days of service. There's no way around that, and it doesn't matter if it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 20 days of terrible service where your buzz is awful, or if you got a perfect day every time. Essentially this kind of ""gating off"" of the second star is to prevent the difficult from getting too much too fast, but it also limits your income and your choices. I feel it would work much better as a sliding scale. Do really badly, and you have to do the full 20 days. Do really well, and you'll bag that second star after just 10 days of service. I believe this 20 days of service applies for every star level, by the way.Another thing, and it's super petty but I have to say it. You can practice making foods before you buy them, which is AMAZING. You don't have to spend $2000 on wine only to find that it's really tricky to make and means you get it wrong or do it really slowly. BUT, you also HAVE to do chores like washing the dishes and setting traps, and there's no way to practice doing these. You have to learn on the job, and this could ♥♥♥♥ you up in the heat of the moment. Doesn't seem  fair to have one but not the other.My final complaint is that customer orders are written in prose. ""I'll have a salad with ranch, cheese, greens and carrots and mushrooms and onions"", or whatever. I'm a good reader and can parse this all dead quick, which you absolutely need to do, so that's okay. But what about people who struggle to read? Wouldn't it better just to have bullet points:*Cheese*MushroomsLike that? None of the connectives, just what you need to know.Anyway, ♥♥♥♥ all that. This game is awesome. ♥♥♥♥, it's nearly Rush Hour, I'd better get my apron on.			"

												Cook, Serve, Delicious is another super snazzy game with punctuation in the title. I saw Lethalfrag playing it on his stream, so he should get that finder's fee... In this game, you play a restauranteur who has to keep the restaurant clean, serve customers, and garner buzz by day, then prepare the menu and upgrade the restaurant at night.Daytime is frantic, as each chore or dish you do is its own minigame, which follows a unique key combination representing the steps or recipe. If you don't go fast enough or get it perfect, your performance will suffer and your restaurant will lose ""buzz"", representing more and better customers the next day. Nighttime is a management simulator, where you spend the day's proceeds to upgrade your menu or equipment.This game is strangely addictive. I'm talking about daytime. The game presents you with the steps each time you have to do a chore, but I did best when I stopped looking at the instructions and just touch typed the combos. It leads to serious flow and sense of accomplishment when you're hot, and serious soul-searching when you mess up.I don't know the consequences of most of my choices at nighttime. There are unlockables but I don't know how much they help or hurt my cause.I don't know what the difficulty curve is like or how long the love will last. But it's a great blend of two different genres. Hopefully it is not too much of a grind to get to the upper echelons.For now it's a meaty thumbs up. Or should I say order up?			"

												This game is one of those games that just gets ignored for some reason, seriously why? It's a great game that has a low point of entry and a super high skill cap. This game is for people who enjoy getting good at a game or people who enjoy learning new games and then stopping becuase it's both. The game can be very easy at first where you're making pretzels and corndogs while pouring some beer and occasionally flushing a few toilets here and there but, let me tell ya, getting to a platinium star resturant and trying to serve fried rice, sushi, bananas foster, soup, kebabs and steak is really hard and that is what i tried. To put it in perspective 31 hours of playing and being somewhat good isn't enough to be good enough to do that. So go crazy and try to make it to those leaderboards, i got 40th on last week's challenge so i'm pretty sure everyone else can get atleast to 40th right? because if you don't beat me you're a scrub becuase i'm a scrub.

												This game has to be the best game I've gotten on steam in the entire year of 2013 and is easily one of the best indie games I've played on steam since the beginning of time, roughly matching the quality and fun of Don't starve for me.The game stars you, a chef/waiter/caterer/sanitation engineer/janitor/exterminator/dishwasher/vigilante, yes you do absolutely everything in this restaurant eponymously named cook, serve, delicious. It sounds kind of tedious but in reality it is more precarious then anything, with managing all actions being a really tough balencing act, esspecially during rush hour.The gameplay is increadibly fast-paced and hectic, although less so in the beginning so you have time to adapt to the difficulty curve.My only gripe with the game is the system requirements, on my desktop it runs fine but there are occasional times when the game will drop frames when rush hour starts that can mess up an otherwise perfect day in game.Future suggestions (Incase the developer takes time to read this crap)1. Better streamlining of the code & performance options (Idk how the game treats 4+ core cpus)2. Additional recipes using new equipment (Right now smoothies/milkshakes come to mind)3. More character models for the game (The current ones repeat slightly too much for my taste)Overall this is a fantastic game that deserves to have a much bigger following then what it currently has, with a few more updates it would not be crazy to put this game in my top 25 list of the best games I've ever played.Addendum: I am aware that the same game developer(s?) make a game with the same hectic fast switching task game called ""The oil blue"". Personally I just could not get the hang of this game as the admitedly very nice art style distracts from the gameplay and overall it plays much more clunky and despite being slower, is seemingly more difficult and much less fun.

												If you like restaurant management games, then you will enjoy this one.The aesthetics are nice, the food art is well done and the background city view from your window changes with the day/night cycle very seamlessly. The music is okay, I play my own while running this game. The controls are very straightforward - you can use the mouse and/or keyboard. The key bindings are very intuitive (usually first letter = key you have to press; ex: b for bacon), and you can change them around to suit your playstyle. The learning curve is minimal to moderate, the main difficulty comes from juggling tasks efficiently in order to maximize your score multiplier (perfect days give you cash bonuses). Once you get used to the key bindings (highly recommend using primarily the keyboard vs. the mouse as it can be significantly faster) you can complete your orders very quickly.The tutorial is nice and quick, and there is always a guide to the right of the screen when you are completing your orders. In the preplanning area, you can practice with any of the food items to see if you'd like to add them to your active menu. There is quite a variety of food available, and you can upgrade certain foods in order to charge more for them. Some items require you to have additional equipment, like a grill for your hamburgers.There are also restaurant upgrades like a tip jar or light snacks to increase the time your customers will wait for you to take their order before leaving. Customers do not have a happiness gauge (you can take their order even when their ticket is almost empty with no penalty) - what matters is getting the order perfect. You cannot go back if you make a mistake, so balancing speed accuracy (speed-accuracy tradeoff lol) is critical to success (and perfect days).Rush hour usually occurs during lunch time and dinner, giving you a boost to customer intake. Different foods have pros and cons - for example, if you have more than 3 ""fatty"" foods, then you will get a negative rating to your ""buzz,"" which determines how many clients enter your restaurant. Other foods may not generate tips and/or have menu rot (they decrease in popularity and generate negative buzz if they remain on active menu for more than 2 consecutive days). The baked potato takes much longer to prepare, however, it also has a modifier to tipping - generating higher value and more frequent tips.A good game if you enjoy restaurant management, reminded me a lot of Cooking Mama. Give it a try if you are interested.Recommend.			"

												""Cook, Serve, Delicious!"" is a wonderfully addictive game that takes the best parts of Diner Dash, Hot Dog King, and Restaurant Empire and crams them all into one nice, meaty package.  It will definitely test your reflexes and can be a bit hardcore at times in terms of difficulty, yet it manages to keep you engaged in a way that encourages you to do better.  I highly recommend it to those who enjoy time management and simulation games.

												One of my favorite games with great soundtrack and surprisingly not-so-repetitive gameplay. I thought this is just another normal repetitive simulation game that you play for two or three days and never pick up again, but it actually have a lot of content to unlock and I did not realize this game had a dating system after like 30 hours of gameplay (I know... what?). And I feel like it has an appropriate level of difficulty and a reasonable learning curve that foods getting harder with upgrades.This is one of the games that doesn't require much thought or continuity, so you can play it whenever you feel like taking a short break, and you can pick it up a month later and wouldn't feel like you forgot everything about it. Overall, a really nice casual game. Looking forward to CSD2 as well!Important warning: Do not play this when you are hungry.			"

												This game seems on the surface to be a casual cooking/managment game that you often find on free online games websites. This is a cooking game, and a management game, but it is quite debateable whether or not it is 'casual', although I am not saying all casual games are bad, as I have played some good ones, but it does seem to not have as many fatures as a casual game, as cooking and casual aren't always the same thing.The reason I say this isn't a casual game, is because when you think of casual games, you would normally think of a relaxing and easy-to-play game, something where you don't need to think. This game is far from relaxing, it is a great simulation of having a panic attack. There is no easy mode, only normal and extreme, and even normal mode can seem quite impossible. Juggling all these different foods, while at the same time having to do chores, such as flush the toilet, because we all know that's a chef's job.The gameplay in this is not only intense, but it is also centred around typing. It would be easy if it was simply typing out words, such as what the food/recipe was, but no, you have to prapere the food, and each ingrediant/action is one letter, meaning you will end up muttering to yourself while you type a ridiculous combo of letters and numbers. PSCR PSCR PSCROnce you get use to one combonation of letters for a certain meal, you will then, upgrade it as you go, and struggle to learn even more keys. As well as prapering foods for consumtion, you need to amke sure they don't burn, that you don't accidentally press 4 when you meant to press 5 and serve the food undercooked.There is so much more to be said about this game: the graphics, the music, the humour and references, the progression, the events, etc. But all that needs to be said for it, is that you should buy it and play it, as it is quite worth it's money, and is a very enjoyable game, with a very high replay value.

												I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this game. I'm also surprised by how much I LEARNED from this game. For instance: did you know that when cooking in a restaurant, you only have one single shot at ANY order to get it right? I didn't know that! I thought I could throw it away and start over! Not so! Here are a few other free lessons before you open your own restaurant.1- Customers are impatient jerks. If you can't cook and put together a burger within 30 seconds they are OUTTA THERE.2- Customers are also not an understanding bunch. ""Just get robbed? TS, idiot, give me my burger!""3- When you become successful and start earning some decent money, you can still never hire employees to take care of trash and dishes or serve food. Like a real restaurant! It's all you, buddy! No employees, no payroll! Screw those guys! People want to eat food prepared by the person who cleans dishes, throws out garbage, and sets rat traps, anyway, just like the pros!4- A secret clan of ninja cooks exist. I now fear for my life.Those are a few of the things you'll learn about cooking. I've also greatly expanded my cooking skills in real life, too. When I'm trying to prepare a potato, for instance, I'm pressing ""1"" over and over again but it doesn't start baking. Eventually someone feels sorry for me and puts the potato in the oven. Success.I've had less success eating out, however, because of this game, sadly. The waiter kept asking what I want and since I was confused why I wasn't talking to the chef, I just kept looking around the place, wondering if other people were being harassed by this guy, too. Evidently he was annoying EVERYBODY because they were too shy or scared to even look at me and were eating or drinking their single item they could order. I played along and just wrote on a piece of paper that I wanted a burger with ""L"", ""C"", and ""T"" with a couple of ""P"". He pretended to be all confused and I insisted he take it to the chef. He came back about 10 minutes later with a leek, cabbage, truffles, and pubic hair burger. Success.All in all, this is a great game worth your time. Play it as fast as you can before the ninjas test your karate baking skill.			"

												I'm sure everything I'm about to say about this game has probably been said before, but I'mma put my two cents in anyway.Cook, Serve, Delicious is ostensibly a restaurant management game. In reality, it's something more like a rhythm game, especially when you get to the harder stages. You're put in charge of preparing and serving every dish and doing every chore and all of this is done by hotkeys (or controller buttons) - but watch out, 'cuz new tasks are constantly coming in and it's up to you to juggle them before the customers get impatient and leave. The better you do, the more popular your restaurant becomes and the more people come to eat there, which of course means more for you to do.The one thing this game does well - very well, possibly better than any other game I've played - is inducing a flow state, which is to say once you get into the rhythm of handling tasks you'll be tapping away at keys like a madman and become completely oblivious to the world around you. There's no time to think, so don't: just learn the recipes off by heart and then let your instincts take over. I mean, just look at me: I play on Extreme Difficulty just because the normal difficulty is too damn slow and boring. I NEED THE RUSH. GIVE IT TO ME.If you haven't already bought this game, please do: they're bringing out a CSD2 soon and I want it to be as fabulously spectacular as possible. Besides, don't *you* want to become so good at this game that your hands fly across the keyboard like a pair of tap-dancing spiders? Of course you do.			"

It's relaxing in a way that it makes you forget about real life problems you're handling, because at the moment all you stress about is your pancakes and burger both needing final preparations because they just finished cooking at the same time, meanwhile you're trying to get that pizza done right... It offers a simple gameplay but is challenging to master once you want your every day to be perfect in-game terms.			"

												Playing this game is probably one of the best decisions I have ever made in my life.To the simple man, this game may seem a simple button masher, but look beneath its simple exterior, and a whole world of truths unfolds. We see the story of a few simple people coming to a simple resteraunt, but as the resteraunt grows, so do the bonds between them. We see Leo, a major playah, and his never ending battles with the cruel, relentless Dennis. We see Darren, as he trys to win the heart of the ever kind, ever drinking Phil. Alas, Darren has never been able to muster up the courage to win the heart of Phil, so he decides to drown his sorrows in fish and grape sodas. I eagerly look forward to the turning of the next page of this gripping, tear-jerking story.There may be no story set out for you by the game itself, but isn't the point of life to experience it to the fullest? You must create your own path, your own story, and as Phil has said: ""The people who you love must care for who you are, not what you are.""So are you willing to dive into the deep lore, the rich passion, that this game has to offer? Do you have what it takes? Don't be a Darren, be strong in yourself, BELIEVE in yourself. Don't look back. Don't let the regrets of yesterday inflict apon the hopes of today, or the promise of of the future. Take the plunge into the greatest experince of your life.			"

												Cook, Serve, Delicious is a restaurant management sim / typing simulator. Now, I know you’re all thinking this game can’t mustard up anything special, but trust me when I say the steaks are high. This game is not for chickens and if you aren’t well seasoned it’ll be out of the frying pan and into the fryer with you. CSD keeps dishing out special orders as thing progress, spicing things up with competitions, catering, even a chef dating sim. What you have here is the cutting edge of interactive culinary entertainment, so check, please, and see this 5-star game. I’m sure after you’ve had a taste of what this game offers, you’ll eat it right up. That is, if it can cater to your tastes.Bon appetit. "

												Cook, Serve, Delicious! is defitnely an amazing experience. It caught me for a lot of hours inside this restaurant ambient. In this game you're not only the one who cooks: you do literally everything. The restaurant management, the money control, the cleaning part, the kitchen part and lots of other stuff. And of course, you need to be as fast as possible to get a perfect service. This game gives you a lot of options on what you wanna cook, you make your own menu and give your restaurant your personality. Every time you level a star up the game gets harder and harder. You can count with a lot of challenges during your gameplay - that you can chose to do it or not. Full of special services, cooking games and even a co-op mode, Cook, Serve, Delicious! it's something you wanna get. May after awhile the cooking gets repetitive, but you can always fix that with changing your menu and what you're gonna serve to your costumers. It's a great simulator which makes you want to get all of the achievements and look foward to keep playing for many hours. And after beating it, it's not over. The game counts with a extra hard mode - like it wasn't already hard enough. If you want to get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off, with pain in the arms and may even break your keyboard, but, with hours of fun, get that game right now!			"

And yet, though it causes me extreme stress, this game is insanely fun. It's so satisfying to finish a day, and the feeling of accomplishment when you get a perfect day even with a robbery is awesome.I definitely recommend this game if you enjoy a good challenge.P.S.

												Cook, Serve, Delicious! is the pinnacle of restaurant ""simulator"" games. Not only do you manage your own restaurant, but you micro manage every aspect of it. From changing your menu daily, to upgrading your kitchen, to competing in challenges, to reading emails and taking bets, to purchasing new foods and upgrading them, this game is incredibly detailed. The art and music are a bit simple but it fits the theme of the game pretty well. Gameplay is mostly muscle memory with key presses, so I would recommend watching gameplay before purchasing. It's not for everyone, but if you love a good typing challenge while trying to earn five stars on your restaurant, this game is for you. Lobster is OP.			"

 Cooking Done RightI picked up Cooking Mama 2: Dinner with Friends back in 2008 or so for DS, which was an enjoyable little romp in cooking games that I could play on the go, with an added plus that I could share this with my less game-focused friends and family. The cutesy appeal and the cooking mini games combined into a game that I enjoyably shared with my younger girl cousins from out of town, and cemented in me an interest in the genre. So when I saw Cook, Serve, Delicious!, I saw the good reviews, figured I'd try it. I was very pleased with the results.Cook, Serve, Delicious! is a unique cooking game that has enjoyable RPG elements intelligently spliced into a restaurant owning sim. You start out with a simple menu selling corn dogs and beer, and through an enjoyable menu customization system, you slowly build up to a high-end delicatessen. Controls let you use either a controller or keyboard (2 player co-op as well), with you needing to manage a real-time restaurant and prepare dishes quickly by pressing keys/buttons to add ingredients to different dishes. The same dish (like Pizza) could be simple or complicated depending on if they want a cheese pizza or a supreme, since you need to press a button to add every ingredient. The menu customization in particular is very well done, since in a manner reminiscient of Diablo 3's difficulty tuning, you can modify your game's difficulty in how you build your menu of dishes; an easy menu will be comfortable and relaxing to cook, while a more complicated menu of dishes might earn more cash while keeping you on the edge of your seat, frantically trying to multitask cooking multiple dishes at once before you lose a customer. By being able to cater (no pun intended) my menu toward a difficulty I desired, I was able to challenge myself mechanically with my dishes as well as not get overly frustrated or overwhelmed from too many difficult dishes. By the end game, you will start to upgrade your favorite dishes to their highest level, making them worth more but also making them more complicated by adding new ingredients, requiring more work to prepare. This actually results in the game staying enjoyable for much longer than I expected, as steady increase in complexity meant the game was always mechanically challenging, and more importantly, not overly repetitive. In the end, I was quite enjoying whizzing through 8 dishes at a time, feeling as mechanically pleased with my ability to cook complicated dishes as I would by doing a particularly difficult combination of abilities in a MOBA or MMORPG. It really was that fun.This is not a game with a ton of action, or a deep story, or super impressive graphics. That said, Cook Serve Delicious does provide a mechanically enjoyable, great-for-all-audiences game that kept me playing for 30 hours plus. Give it a chance, and it will impress you.			"

There are a lot of things to do in game as far as management goes and you can also try all the other modes if you want to just cook.

												I honestly wasn't expecting much from this game, as it looked pretty simple and it was very cheap (I got it on sale for $3.99, I think). Holy cow, was I wrong. It's devilishly difficult as you progress and sometimes you almost need a second player to get through a level, which is what I and my boyfriend did (he's so much more addicted than I am). Super fun, the learning curve can be a little steep but not terribly hard to get the hang of. It's very addictive. Definitely recommend this game for the micro-managing types.			"

												Casual games in general: You play sometimes and you play 10 minutes or half an hour. You just relax.Cook, Serve, Delicious: Almost everyday, for multiple hours and at the end of the day you might feel even more exhausted than before playing. And you will love it. When playing the first time you might become frustrated and overchallanged due to the almost-every-key-in use-gameplay, but once you managed to cope, unity with delicious burgers, fried rice, shish kebob, ice cream, pizza, lasagne, etc. will be reached.One final advice: Never play hungry.

There's plenty of achievements to beat and a variety of food recipes to try out. Mastering the preparation method for certain recipes or landing a perfect day play session can be very satisfying. It's slow and easy at first, but tension builds up quickly at later stages of the game. Would recommend if you're into casual games, it's definitely not for everyone.

The soundtrack never gets boring as it's really well made and entertaining. Everything is 10/10 except sometimes if you try to let's say filet the fish (press right, down, left) really quickly it doesn't recognize one of the buttons so you end up giving the guy a fish filet with the tail still on or something, which leads to an average or a bad order.

												I'm absolutely delighted to see a polished, extended version of this great restaurant sim that I fell in love with so many years ago.  Offers substantial nostalgia for anyone who has played the orignal and the game now has a nice, new look and a fair bit of comedy in the writing.  Appeal for anyone that likes microgames and multi-tasking, but definitely offers a hardcore challenge.  CSD boasts a progression system that is both fair (doesn't feel grindy) and rewarding.  Gameplay is too stressful to be monotonous, but this game is such a blast that it doesn't seem right to think of it as stress.  Definitely an addicting game, but I've loved every minute of it (including the 30+ hours my friend and I spent playing the original back in 2005/2006).  Hipster Cat out.			"

												Cook, Serve, Delicious! is a high octane restaurant sim, complete with typing elements and a whole lot of stress. The game is simple and enjoyable (as long as you can handle making a few mistakes here and there) and is also surprisingly replayable and long for a petty price tag of $9.99.Players are tasked with building up a menu of food items and successfully getting through a day with serving as many customers as possible with a minimal number of complaints. In order to cook the food on the menu, players must either use their mouse or keyboard to assemble all the required components of the item - more complex food (like sushi or salad) require more components, whereas simpler items (like coffee and pretzels) require less components. The player then has to find the perfect balance between high-income food items and low-complexity food items in order to turn a hefty profit and insure that customers don't walk out of the restaurant with an empty stomach. Over time, catering missions, contests and better food becomes available - these make sure that you don't get tired of playing the game after a few hours, and trust me, you won't.The graphics are a simple art style that is neither good nor bad. The music found in the game changes depending on the time of day - Spanish fiesta music plays during the afternoon whereas calm and weary music plays before closing time. There isn't much of a story, except for the goal to constantly improve the restaurant's star rating, but you will find that the game doesn't need one since it is more or less an arcade title.For $9.99, you're going to find that this game is a great deal. I picked it up during the WInter Sale for $4.99 - maybe keep a look out for it in the upcoming Summer Sale if you want to save money. This game could easily serve as a time-killer OR a full-fledged personal favourite, depending on whatever mood you are in. The bottom line however: it's great, buy it and you won't regret it.			"

												Cook, Serve, Delicious! is a surprisingly fun game. While the controls will likely cause carpal tunnel, the gameplay is addictive. Finding the right balance for your restruant, and working your way to the top is fun. The steady pace, and different ""rush"" times provide a nice change to the tempo. Changing your menu can result with great sucess, or horrible failure.I give it a 4/5. Why not 5/5? Well, mainly because of the fact that one little slip up on a customer's order results with negative debuffs. Sure the keyboard is small, but this game really makes you realize how small it is.			"

												Don't let this game deceive you. It's a pretty challenging and addictive little game that has a lot of charm and is a lot of fun. You  basically run a restaurant and have to prepare and cook food for customers.  The game is broken up into a day where you will try and serve as many customers as you can while trying not to get there orders wrong. Sounds easy enough but try doing it with recipes that require more complex preperation and trying to serve 8 customers at once. The game has a wide variety of recipes which you can buy and upgrade and before each day you can customize your menu. There are also additional challenges you can do like catering missions or competing in an Iron Chef competition. You also have to do chores as well as preparing meals and this adds to the challenge. The game is really nicely animated as well with decent music and gives the game a lot of charm. It isn't a game i found i could play for long time though. I found it better for maybe a quick 20 minutes to half an hour at a time as it can start to feel repetitive at times. It doesn't help that you have to do at least 20 days before being able to upgrade your restaurant which makes the game feel a little dragged out.The Good- Easy game to pick up and play but a difficult one to master, providing a decent challenge.- Gameplay is fun and theres enough to give the game a bit of variety with so many recipes and challenges available.-Nice animated style that adds to the games personality.The Bad- Gets a bit repetetive after a while and isn't a game i could play for long periods.Overall this is a nice fun game perfect for jumping in and out of when you've got a few minutes to kill which is also accessible while still able to provide a challenge. 8/10 "

												This is my personal favorite restaurant sim!Sure, if you really think about it it's just a stupid typing game, but no. It's actually something more than typing. Owning a restaurant isn't as easy as you thought and so proves this game. You start off from a crappy restaurant in a tower, putting ketchup and mustard on corn dogs and serving burgers. But as you move on, you'll be serving soups, pastas and other top notch foods, becoming the finest restaurant to date.But it's not just that. You must arrange your menu, depending on the weather, the people and what the VIP like (when they come), earning additional daily buzz, which means more money in a day. With the restaurant there are also problems. You must do things like wash dishes, trap mouses (on the first steps) or flush toilets. But there are things such as the Protection Due, the -previously mentioned- VIPs and robbers. What makes this game addicting is the fact that it has a lot of ways to play the game. You can start by saving money for buying a new food, or for upgrading another one. There are bets, Steam Leaderboards and extra stuff that really make this greater than most cooking sims.You like fast paced gameplay and cooking? Then Cook, Serve, Delicious! is the thing for you.

												I enjoyed playing Cook, Serve, Delicious for a couple of hours, after which it became a bit too repetitive for my tastes. Maybe I bought too much equipment too soon -- maybe I splurged on expensive food recipes. I'll never know! It has a good moment-to-moment frenzy, without getting overly stressful or complicated. The graphics, while not dazzling, are charming in their own way, and the audio was nice enough too -- only tenderizing chicken elicited complaints from eavesdroppers (it requires repeating the same audio file 6 times, preventing me from winning any popularity contests).In any event, I found myself having completed all of the goals for the first major progress marker (becoming a 2-star restaurant) on day 10, and had another 10 days to repeat before I could unlock the next set of challenges... alas. Maybe I'll get around to it, but... maybe not.I hope more indie games explore cooking as a mechanic. It'd be excellent if Cook, Serve, Delicious were the beginning of a genre.			"

												You can go from 'zen' to 'super competitive' in this game, as your performance dictates the diffiulty of your serving days.  The beginning may seem simple, but you can really quickly challenge yourself by putting complex-to-create dishes on your menu.  Make money, serve customers, and even date people on your quest to become a 5-star establishment!  Once you complete the main story line (which I haven't, in almost 20 hours of gameplay), there are weekly 'challenges' that really test your mettle in the kitchen.  This game is really an easy to play, difficult to master style that can satisfy anyone.  Highly recommend.			"

												While appearing to be a food service simulator, Cook, Serve, Delicious feels more like a mini-game compilation in the vein of WarioWare. You are in charge of single-handed running the busiest restaurant in the world, and are expected to prepare and serve each meal promptly and to order. This is simple with cheaper dishes such as corn dogs and fish filet; however, as the game progresses, and you are asked to prepare more complicated meals, the pace mounts exponentially. Balancing your menu not only involved making sure you don't serve the same thing too often: it also involves balancing your menu so that you don't serve too many difficult dishes at once. For those not satisfied with the normal progression, random bets and Steam challenges are here to give you the opportunity to grab extra bragging rights.Honestly, CSD is one of the best cooking games I've played, and it's definitely worth the full $10.

												I really can't put this game down, it gets addictive. I love typing, multitasking and food so all boxes ticked. I can see why my customers get angry when I put sugar on their fries. I would be too. Need to stop dating hobos while on the job, we're a 5 star restaurant for goodness sake! Can't wait for the sequel~			"

												While appearing to be a food service simulator, Cook, Serve, Delicious feels more like a mini-game compilation in the vein of WarioWare. You are in charge of single-handed running the busiest restaurant in the world, and are expected to prepare and serve each meal promptly and to order. This is simple with cheaper dishes such as corn dogs and fish filet; however, as the game progresses, and you are asked to prepare more complicated meals, the pace mounts exponentially. Balancing your menu not only involved making sure you don't serve the same thing too often: it also involves balancing your menu so that you don't serve too many difficult dishes at once. For those not satisfied with the normal progression, random bets and Steam challenges are here to give you the opportunity to grab extra bragging rights.Honestly, CSD is one of the best cooking games I've played, and it's definitely worth the full $10.

You go through your culinary career from a zero star rat-hole to a glorious five star world famous restaurant.Personally, I played this for while. And I can tell you I enjoyed every second of that while.

												This game is for people who really enjoy repetitive/relaxing sim games. You'll be able to tell right off the bat from the gameplay video if you're going to like this or not. People either really like these types of games or they don't.I think where this game really wins, aside from the game as a package overall (really polished, they've added new content and modes over the years, everything is ""just right"" when it comes to this game) is how well progressed the difficulty is as you play. You won't be making the online leaderboards as soon as you get this game, but damn, you'll be really surprised at how good you get at this game after ~10 hours. And if you like these kinds of games, you will play more than 10 hours. In one day. In one sitting.It has just the right amount of customizability in terms of your controls & menu. The game really makes you want to play it and get really good at it, if that makes sense. And just when you think you're really good, you play the super hard mode and realize how hard this game can get.This isn't a restaurant building sim if you're looking for that. You're not going to get to pick which chairs are in your restaurant and if you want to open a new franchise and hire workers. This is a game for people who enjoy the action of these simulation games rather than the management portion. And I LOVE IT.			"

												I'm not entirely sure why, but this pretty much turned out to be one of the most fun little games I've played in ages. Visually, it's ridiculously charming, the cooking is frantic and fun, and the music! The whole game sounds fanastic. When you're not doing the day-to-day restaurant running, there's a bunch of side challenges to have a crack at, there's various bets and challenges to attempt, and some leaderboards for more competitive people to duke it out over. Best of all? The game's just consistantly hilarious. Between every day, you get sent ""emails"" in game, and most of them are normally information and rewards, but there's a steady trickle of spam you get that's just bloody brilliant. Every written sections of the game is fantastically done.Basically, it's a fast-paced battle to keep your customers happy and get them back out the door as fast as possible, but it's also a hilarious one. Check it out, it's worth it.			"

												So, I just finished getting the fabled 5 star rating on my restaurant, (currently going for the elusive Platinum Star) and I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants a challenge. Especially since it boosts your ability to multitask, (which definitely helps out with projects or assignments) and challenges your memory, accuracy, and speed. This game has really helped me multitask in many  different things, which I'd never expect from a video game.  What I LikedThe fact that it boosts your accuracy, speed, and multitasking skill.The amount of gameplay put into the game, which is surprising for this kind of genre of games.The true feeling of finally getting that last star for your restaurant, and just raking in the big money.How fun the extra events and weekly challenges are.What I DislikedHow hard some parts of the Iron Cook episodes are. The slight unresponsiveness of a controller.The fact you need a controller in order to play the game efficiently without any problems.Overall, this game was a very fun time, and was definitely worth the $10 investment put into it. Considering this game still adds new things over time, even if it's not needed. If you want a challenge for once, try out Cook, Serve, Delicious!			"

												On my android i played cooking games but this one is better.Most things you can cook have a different way of being made.You invent little tricks to make it happen better.For example one dish you need to tender it exactly 6 times quickly. I tender it 2 times 3 because when i tender it 6 times i make the mistake more often to do it 7 or 5 times. For another dish i type pscr pscr pscr. I don't know what the ingrediens are.So its a kind of memory game. when something is ordered, do the sequence asap.What is fun about it is it makes me wonder how far i can get with it.			"

												Originally I bought the game just to support this game developer, but what I got in return was a game that was extremely addictive, fun and surprisingly hectic and challenging. The game is very well made and even as someone who plays a lot of AAA titles and have a harder time getting into indies, this game sat well with me the minute i started playing. The amount of content this game has for the asking price is astounding. I would have bought it even at $19. What I likedThe Amount of content - It has everything. An email client, competitions, betting, challenges, events, food upgrades, equipments, etcThe game length - I'm 6 hours in as of this review and i have only completed lesser than half of the main game. Even if you are stingy and go by the $1 = 1 hour system, the game would take 12 hours for $10. The thought that went into the game - It is extremely well done and everything is completely different while also linked. From the way you make each dish, to the food boosters and detractors, weather and inspectors. [Personal Opinions] What I didn't likeKey bindings for certain food are too confusing. However, this is an issue related to how a computer works and not the game itself. In a situation like during rush hour, you don't have the time to go through the key bindings for each ingredient. If someone wants a burger with a meat patty and bacon, you would just press ""M and B"" followed by enter. This could be an issue  when it comes to complex foods with a huge list of ingredients where 2 ingredients would start with the same letter. Take nachos for example, it has multiple ingredients starting with the same letter and during rush hour, when a customer wants nachos with sour cream, you would press ""S"" only to find out S is shrimp and sour cream is actually ""C"".  This is a good thing for people who wants a challenge and a bad thing for those who hates remembering key bindings and combos ( like me) . One way to avoid this is to select foods that don't have that many ingredients, but the list shrinks by a lot when you progress the game. And that is all. The game is perfect and is a must buy for anyone who likes a challenge.			"

												This is basically that kind of flash game about serving some sort of food and micro-managing the ingredients and cooking and stuff with little minigames (come on, you know the one)... except it's good. Like, really good. With surprisingly good gameplay and a side order of tongue-in-cheek humour, this game really stands out as something different, but still very welcome. If you wouldn't mind a fun, but simple time-waster to play now and then with some good jokes to keep you in high spirits the whole way then I would recommend this. It's no triple A title that will leave you thinking about its message after it's done, but it'll keep you smiling while it's still going. Well worth its quite modest price, despite its deceptive appearence.			"

												Cook, Serve, Delicious! is a fun, simple and addicting cooking simulator. You start out at a 0 star restaurant and have to slowly work your way up to a 5 star restaurant by purchasing upgrading foods, and serving customers day by day. It sounds simple and boring, but it's really fun and charming.The gameplay is good, food is prepared and served by hitting the right key combination so that you get the requested ingredients right, you have many foods/recipes to purchase with different ways of preparing them, and as you upgrade your foods, it adds even more recipes, while allowing you to charge more. You can also buy equipment like a grill station, fryer, stove station, tip jar, table snacks. In order to increase the star rating of your restaurant, you must meet a different list of requirements each time. These sometimes include some of the ""side missions"" such as catering, cooking shows, etc. Seems like a casual game , but has enough depth in gameplay to keep you interested.The art style is awesome, it feels cartoony and cute, and the music also fits,  everything just fits together to make you want to keep playing. The progression of the story is good, it becomes more difficult every day and also the controls are very quick and good, either by mouse or by keyboard.It is a good casual cooking simulator, if you like these types of games you should give it a try, 9/10.

												Satisfies my desire for a task-oriented game like the Papa's Pizzeria series, but without the obnoxious ""food placement"" aspects. When preparing orders, this game focuses on button or click based preparation rather than asking you to spread or place ingredients in a certain manner. Those familiar with the Pizzeria series games would know what I mean. It allows you to build up speed and accuracy faster without worrying about how evenly you distributed the chocolate sauce.More customizability as well, like buying equipment and menu items which you have some control over once unlocked. I don't play a ton of simulation/management style games so I can't give a great breakdown in that regard, but as an occasional sim player, I've enjoyed this so far and plan to play more. I don't think I would have paid $10 for it, that's why it went on my wishlist until this sale, but for a buck or two you can't complain.			"

												These restaurant-managing sims are a guilty pleasure of mine, and I think this one will keep that part of my brain satisfied indefinitely.  Smoothly polished gameplay, good variety of items to make (all with their own quirks; like having to fry or chop ingredients, and whether you cook at the start, middle, or end of preparation), and a decent amount of fluff around the edges to round out the game.  Also it actually gets seriously challenging.You know how these games work; if not go google ""Papa's Burgeria"", play for ten minutes, and then come back.  It is a big pile of minigames, and you go through a game-day worth of them at a time.* Includes non-food chores (dishes, trash, etc) that carry special penalties if you fail them* Health inspections, which make the chores harder for a game day* Optional dating minigame; where a special customer shows up, and if you do well on their order they'll text you during work (reading comprehension time trial)* Optional betting minigames, where you take on extra challenges to make more income in a day* At-your-liesure speed/accuracy trials, guised as catering jobs, iron chef competitions, and something hilarious* Upgrade your recipes and restaurant over time, adding new complexities to recipes* Weekly leaderboard challenges* Amusing tidbits to read (fake spam emails, food and event descriptions)			"

												A very light simulation composed of a bunch of randomly-ordered QTE-based meal preparation tasks using fun little widgets. You select what food you'll sell today, start the day and then fill the orders as they come in. At the end of the day, you read your 'emails', which give you hints on what may happen the following day. There's a bit of management sim in here, but it's mostly about the QTEs.(Note that the food order QTEs are not particularly complex. There are fewer steps to cooking an item here than in, say, Cooking Mama. Although the complexity does increase the further you get in the game.)The game also boasts some competitive and cooperative modes, an online leaderboard with weekly challenges, etc. I haven't spent much time in those modes yet.Anyways, if that sounds like your sort of thing, I recommend picking it up.

The beginning may seem simple, but you can really quickly challenge yourself by putting complex-to-create dishes on your menu.  Make money, serve customers, and even date people on your quest to become a 5-star establishment!  Once you complete the main story line (which I haven't, in almost 20 hours of gameplay), there are weekly 'challenges' that really test your mettle in the kitchen.  This game is really an easy to play, difficult to master style that can satisfy anyone.  Highly recommend.			"

												Do you have aspirations of becoming a world-famour chef? Of running a five-star restaurant? And, perhaps more importantly, are you a bit of a masochist? If you answered yes to any of these questions, and you're not overly attached to your sanity, you'll probably enjoy CSD.CSD puts a bit of an arcade spin on food service. You will of course be running the restaurant by yourself, but that shouldn't be a problem, right? You'll just have to prepare food for all the customers, keep on top of the restaurant chores (those dishes won't do themselves), and generally keep on top of everything during rush hour. Upgrade your restaurant to service more and more people, buy and unlock more complex and difficult recipes, continue to run the restaurant completely by yourself, try not to let the health inspector know your restaurant has a rat problem, try and impress that cute girl (or guy) who has a thing for that one recipe you couldn't cook if your life depended on it, agree to do catering for events where the guests seem to do nothing but crowd the food bar and insist on difficult dishes, OH GOD I WANT MY DESK JOB BACK.Psychiatrist sessions sold separately.

												If you like food, you must buy.Pros:- Good and upbeat music, great use of sound fx- Delicious looking food, nice visuals, colorful, you can see time change out the window- Has some humor elements that make you chuckle- Many things to do besides cooking (you have to complete chores and catch a burglar)- Very fast paced- You can choose your own menu each day- Each food requires different skills and techniques so it doesn't seem repetitive- Different challenges (catering, making bets with Crazy Dave to complete certain tasks)- Food items are upgradable, you can buy grills/stoves- You can use keyboard, mouse, or controller (prefer keyboard cause it's easier)- Quick and easy tutorials. Lets you test out the food before you buy- The daily buzz element is pretty cool and makes game more realisticCons (seems like a lot but they're minor)- Limited food items to choose from. There's only about 20 something total- Can get stressful during rush hour (but that's what makes it exciting)- Not many things to do once you complete the game (but it takes a while)- Simple gameplay. Place ingredients together by pressing buttons.- Earning money is really slow. You have to work several days in order to buy one item- Cannot customize restaurant- Certain features are never seen. Like buying a dishwasher. You bought it. It decreases the # of times you wash the dishes. But you never actually SEE the dishwasher in the game. Same thing with trash disposal, new toilet, etc.Got the game during summer sale for 3.99. Definitely worth the money. Addictive and fun. Many features in the game makes it realistic (such as serving soup on rainy days will attract more customers, having health inspectors, receiving awkward emails). Pros > ConsA great buy. 10/10 Totally recommended.  Have fun!!!			"

												I just love this game, it reminds me of those flash games I used to play as a kid and also a little bit of the Burguer Shop series. But even more evolved because you have a ton of things to upgrade in your restaurant, recepies, services, menu etc. And even the chores like taking out the trash, cleaning dishes and flushing the toilet are your responsability. Sometimes kind of infuriating but in a totally awesome way. 10/10 would recommend.			"

												Cook, Serve, Delicious is a quite a game. You start with some cash to make a start up resturant buisness, it's a lot of fun for any simulation lover. The game might seem boring at first, but once you get into it, it opens up more. You get to purchase loads of foods, breakfast/lunch/dinner. Later on when you ahieve 2 or so stars you get catering events, and by 3 or 4 you get to be an iron cook. More about the gameplay you use either A. Your mouse, or B. Your keyboard, such as ice cream would be ""V"" for 1 scoop vanilla, and 'C' would be a cherry. You can also click on the button corresponding to the ingriedent. Lastly it may seem repitive, but once you finish a day (9/10 mins), you may get an email saying, ""20% more buzz today,"" that makes you want to do just one more day. Overall I give the game a 8/10. I would like to see more features added, though.			"

												This is one of those games that looks like it has to be either poorly made, or terribly boring. In reality, it's one of the best simulators that I've ever experienced. As you run your restaurant, you're forced to balance pleasing the customers, and pleasing the health inspectors by keeping up with upkeep. All actions are made simple, but not so simple that they can be done without thought. Unlike some games which feature cooking, you're not given simple ""Cook"" and ""Serve"" buttons. Instead, you are most often left to assemble dishes with simplified ""one key = one ingredient"" style combinations (e.g. PSCR PSCR PSCR makes a lasagna [Pasta, Sauce, Cheese, Parmesan]). It's simple in theory, until the lunch rush leaves you hectically trying to push through order after order, all while balancing the need to wash dishes and toss out trash. There's no deep story to the campaign, but somewhat forced menu changes and the always random orders will ensure that days vary heavily and keep you on your toes. Overall, it's well worth the pick up. 8.5/10			"

												*This is regarding the new update recently. A new game+ feature has been added which gives you a $15,000 starting bonus, all secondary foods unlocked, starts with 6 prep stations, Munchies detractor is disabled, 50% buzz forever, customer count + achivement progress + food pins from your Platinum Star save will be imported (it won't ask you which if you have multiple saves however,) difficulty increase coming from decreased customer patience and Super Rush Hour. Basically even at the start of the new game, you are already on Platinum ++ difficulty with everything on hyper mode. If Platinum wasn't fast enough for you, you'll love new game +. I'm definitely enjoying the difficulty ramp, but at the moment it does look like some combos might be impossible if going for the Perfect Day. Hopefully further upgrades will make such combos possible later in the game. The Good:Ability to rebind keyboard controlsFood effects to prevent boring menuMultiple profiles for different users*Hello there New Game +The Bad:Your stupid datesThe menu to rebind your keys needs some workLack of new game + (no longer applies in the latest update)Cook, Serve, Delicious!, or CSD, is one of the better cooking/restaurant management games I've had the fortune of playing.  Unlike some of your typical games in the same genre, CSD has controls that relies almost entirely on keyboard as opposed to tapping/clicking.  I'm also happy to say I don't have to control a little sprite to deliver food/pick up orders from your customers.  Only thing you need to manage is prepping your food.  Customers will just show up and tell you exactly what they want.  Anything from that point on is just Simon Says with the instructions.  Everything in CSD can almost be played with just your keyboard.  Your mouse is only needed to navigate the menu or turn on/off the music and sound effects in the upper right corner.  All the shortcuts for ingredients can be rebind in the main menu.  It's not the most intuitive interface and does need some work, but it'll get the job done.  I am ok with the default keys for the ingredients, but some people may definitely want to rebind the Onion ingredient's key (it's either O or N on different dishes) and some of the more complex dishes.  I find the food effects in CSD also refreshing.  It prevents the players from using the same menu and stock only the most profitable munchies at all times.Money will be an issue when you start since everything is pretty expensive.  There are times where you'll be offered a chances to ""gamble.""  It's not really gambling since usually, it's very dependent on your cooking skills and your ability to keep a perfect combo chain going.  The cooking challenges are also a place to rack up some quick cash.  Unfortunately these challenges are one time only until you've maxed your resaurant, but by then I doubt you'd be short on cash.Some potential problems people may have with the game is how repetitive the game can get, since you really are just taking orders and jugggling meat.  20 days to advance to the next level was too long for me.  Usually by 5-8 days I'm fairly proficient at managing chores, customers, and the difficult recipes.  Chores happen in the form of random events.  You need to clean up the garbage, trap the rat, wash the dishes, clean the restroom, and occasionally nab the robber.  The robber happens rarely.  But when he shows up, you can bet that you'll lose your perfect combo streak on higher difficulty.  One thing I also want to nitpick is the dating aspect in the game.  I find it very distracting in the game.  I know it's an optional thing just to get some free gold tickets ($2000 each in the shop,) but everytime your date texts you you are also juggling customer orders.  There's a good chance that you'll lose your combo because your stupid date can't be bothered to text faster or text you after work.			"

												reposted from my tumblr: Why CSD is my game of the yearCSD is one of those games that could be called Casual: The mechanics are easy to understand, yet the game manages to keep you busy and engaging, whilst allowing you to adjust the level of challenge in each consecutive playthrough. The way the gmae does this is by allowing you to decide that’s on the days many. The foods that need more prep and cooking allow you to earn more money, but because of the complexity of the preparation and making of the dish, it becomes more difficult to manage over the rush hour periods of the day.Moreover the game even has some light management stuff going on for it: Each day you can change the menu you have to make it include less challenging foods, as well as replace menu items that have begun to rot (i.e. the foods have been on the menu for too long and customers aren’t interested in them). So with these days you might remove one complex menu item and replace it with another to keep yourself fresh in the eyes of customers.There’s also the factor of safety insepctions, robberies as well as bets and stuff that’ll make the gameplay each day more or less hectic.No IAP stuffI like the fact that the game doesn’t make you buy some mooncredits in order to unlock speciality foods like coffee and stuff. No, all the things and all the foods can be aquired by being really clever and good with the menu items. This makes it a fair game, and this paragraph rather poorly written.Should I play this game?In my opinion yes. Even though it looks like a ‘casual’ game, there is a need for good finger dexterity and use of mouse if you are going to keep making wodnerful dishes and making your cutomers happy. There are NO DLC packages released, so you only pay 8.99 euros for the whole game. The game’s simple and easy to understand, and you might even get the cooking bug after playing this game!Final grade:If Mauve is considered to be unpleasant, and purple is the color of exhuberance, i am giving this game a STRONG BEIGE.GOTY of 2013			"

												I've been a fan of Vertigo Games for a long while now, ever since playing their ""Ore No Ryomi"" game, so it really was not much of a surprise that Mr. Chubigans (founder and primary designer) was planning on making a sequel.The game itself borrows heavily from the PS1 game ""Ore No Ryouri"" in that it is essentially a simulator of running a restaurant entirely by yourself. No waitstaff, no chef, just you, a kitchen, and a counter full of customers. The game itself is played entirely with the keyboard, selecting first the customer/ticket you wish to service, then hitting the correct keys to process the order correctly.The controls do get a little frustrating at times, but it appears that Mr. Chubigans has added a key binding menu for each dish, so any you have particular trouble with can now be changed. Also, the graphics are impeccably watercolor style, and the music/sound design make this game far more relaxing than you would expect from the time-management genre. Highly recommended for the price!			"

												These restaurant-managing sims are a guilty pleasure of mine, and I think this one will keep that part of my brain satisfied indefinitely.  Smoothly polished gameplay, good variety of items to make (all with their own quirks; like having to fry or chop ingredients, and whether you cook at the start, middle, or end of preparation), and a decent amount of fluff around the edges to round out the game.  Also it actually gets seriously challenging.You know how these games work; if not go google ""Papa's Burgeria"", play for ten minutes, and then come back.

												A very light simulation composed of a bunch of randomly-ordered QTE-based meal preparation tasks using fun little widgets. You select what food you'll sell today, start the day and then fill the orders as they come in. At the end of the day, you read your 'emails', which give you hints on what may happen the following day. There's a bit of management sim in here, but it's mostly about the QTEs.(Note that the food order QTEs are not particularly complex. There are fewer steps to cooking an item here than in, say, Cooking Mama. Although the complexity does increase the further you get in the game.)The game also boasts some competitive and cooperative modes, an online leaderboard with weekly challenges, etc. I haven't spent much time in those modes yet.Anyways, if that sounds like your sort of thing, I recommend picking it up.

												So, I just finished getting the fabled 5 star rating on my restaurant, (currently going for the elusive Platinum Star) and I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants a challenge. Especially since it boosts your ability to multitask, (which definitely helps out with projects or assignments) and challenges your memory, accuracy, and speed. This game has really helped me multitask in many  different things, which I'd never expect from a video game.  What I LikedThe fact that it boosts your accuracy, speed, and multitasking skill.The amount of gameplay put into the game, which is surprising for this kind of genre of games.The true feeling of finally getting that last star for your restaurant, and just raking in the big money.How fun the extra events and weekly challenges are.What I DislikedHow hard some parts of the Iron Cook episodes are. The slight unresponsiveness of a controller.The fact you need a controller in order to play the game efficiently without any problems.Overall, this game was a very fun time, and was definitely worth the $10 investment put into it. Considering this game still adds new things over time, even if it's not needed. If you want a challenge for once, try out Cook, Serve, Delicious!			"

Dive into selecting from a sh*t ton of food choices for service, just so that you can hand make them later during the day. Not only must you make food for the impatient customers but you also have to perform chores throughout service to keep your restaurant clean.

												The game is awesome, at the first look you can think it's just a browser game on Steam, but when you start playing it turns really addicting!The game brings a big challenge, you need to serve your customers while you do simple chores like wash dishes and throw the trash out, and awkward chores like flushing the toilet (apaprently the customers can't do it) and fending off robbers.Some recipes, you just need to press a key or two, but for others you need lots of ingredients, and every upgrade adds more ingredients, turning the game really challenging.The game also have an enjoyable atmosphere, with good music and simple, but still pretty graphics.The only bad things about the game are the low variety of recipe, the slow progression of stars, and we should be able to change our restaurant's appearence, it only changes when we get a new star.The game is simple, but still addicting, great for fans of this kind of games, and have a good atmosphere for new players in this kind of game.7.5/10			"

												Really, really addicting arcade-y restaurant sim. There's upgrading and managing the menu between days to keep an attractive menu--not serving the same foods too often, keeping it decently healthy, and such--but the meat of the game is in trying to prepare foods for up to 8 customers at once before they lose patience and without screwing up any orders. It can be kind of slow to pick up if you're good at this kind of thing, since you're forced to wait for most upgrades to become available, but it gets to be quite an intense and fun game.This is actually the third game in the series; you can download the second one (which is much the same but without menu management and with somewhat sloppy graphics) at http://www.vertigogaming.net/blog/?portfolio=ore-no-ryomi-1-2 for free to see what it's like.

												This game captures the feel of working in a kitchen. With a controller, it's so much fun. The prep times, cook times and order of preparation are all perfectly balanced between the giant menu of potential food items to give the impression you are really preparing this food.Even after many hours of play (on another account) and nearly perfecting my play of the game, it is still fun and challenging to go through an entire service without slipping up on at least one order. When you make it through a whole service without messing anything up it really feels like an achievement.This is a great game to play with friends. Fun to watch and tough to master.If you love food, cartoons and challenging video games then you will love this game. It's one of my all-time favorites.			"

												I'll begin to say that this game is really frustrating, and that's probably one of the reasons that makes it so fun to play. Cook, Serve, Delicious! gives you a very good taste of what working in a capitalist society means: to satisfy the clients always 100% while also respecting the hygiene laws is not easy at all, and at the end of every day you feel a bitter, but it doesn't stop you from getting back to work the next day. I like that there are more than one play mode, i find the catering really relaxing and the battle mode super exciting. There are also really a lot of recipes, whch you can upgrade, like your restaurant, to make the game even more interesting.I give it 10/10 burgers!			"

												Cook, Serve, Delicious! is defitnely an amazing experience. It caught me for a lot of hours inside this restaurant ambient. In this game you're not only the one who cooks: you do literally everything. The restaurant management, the money control, the cleaning part, the kitchen part and lots of other stuff. And of course, you need to be as fast as possible to get a perfect service. This game gives you a lot of options on what you wanna cook, you make your own menu and give your restaurant your personality. Every time you level a star up the game gets harder and harder. You can count with a lot of challenges during your gameplay - that you can chose to do it or not. Full of special services, cooking games and even a co-op mode, Cook, Serve, Delicious! it's something you wanna get. May after awhile the cooking gets repetitive, but you can always fix that with changing your menu and what you're gonna serve to your costumers. It's a great simulator which makes you want to get all of the achievements and look foward to keep playing for many hours. And after beating it, it's not over. The game counts with a extra hard mode - like it wasn't already hard enough. If you want to get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off, with pain in the arms and may even break your keyboard, but, with hours of fun, get that game right now!			"

												Cook, Serve, Delicious! is the pinnacle of restaurant ""simulator"" games. Not only do you manage your own restaurant, but you micro manage every aspect of it. From changing your menu daily, to upgrading your kitchen, to competing in challenges, to reading emails and taking bets, to purchasing new foods and upgrading them, this game is incredibly detailed. The art and music are a bit simple but it fits the theme of the game pretty well. Gameplay is mostly muscle memory with key presses, so I would recommend watching gameplay before purchasing. It's not for everyone, but if you love a good typing challenge while trying to earn five stars on your restaurant, this game is for you. Lobster is OP.			"

												I've been a fan of Vertigo Games for a long while now, ever since playing their ""Ore No Ryomi"" game, so it really was not much of a surprise that Mr. Chubigans (founder and primary designer) was planning on making a sequel.The game itself borrows heavily from the PS1 game ""Ore No Ryouri"" in that it is essentially a simulator of running a restaurant entirely by yourself. No waitstaff, no chef, just you, a kitchen, and a counter full of customers. The game itself is played entirely with the keyboard, selecting first the customer/ticket you wish to service, then hitting the correct keys to process the order correctly.The controls do get a little frustrating at times, but it appears that Mr. Chubigans has added a key binding menu for each dish, so any you have particular trouble with can now be changed. Also, the graphics are impeccably watercolor style, and the music/sound design make this game far more relaxing than you would expect from the time-management genre. Highly recommended for the price!			"

												This game is for people who really enjoy repetitive/relaxing sim games. You'll be able to tell right off the bat from the gameplay video if you're going to like this or not. People either really like these types of games or they don't.I think where this game really wins, aside from the game as a package overall (really polished, they've added new content and modes over the years, everything is ""just right"" when it comes to this game) is how well progressed the difficulty is as you play. You won't be making the online leaderboards as soon as you get this game, but damn, you'll be really surprised at how good you get at this game after ~10 hours. And if you like these kinds of games, you will play more than 10 hours. In one day. In one sitting.It has just the right amount of customizability in terms of your controls & menu. The game really makes you want to play it and get really good at it, if that makes sense. And just when you think you're really good, you play the super hard mode and realize how hard this game can get.This isn't a restaurant building sim if you're looking for that. You're not going to get to pick which chairs are in your restaurant and if you want to open a new franchise and hire workers. This is a game for people who enjoy the action of these simulation games rather than the management portion. And I LOVE IT.			"

Offers substantial nostalgia for anyone who has played the orignal and the game now has a nice, new look and a fair bit of comedy in the writing.  Appeal for anyone that likes microgames and multi-tasking, but definitely offers a hardcore challenge.  CSD boasts a progression system that is both fair (doesn't feel grindy) and rewarding.  Gameplay is too stressful to be monotonous, but this game is such a blast that it doesn't seem right to think of it as stress.  Definitely an addicting game, but I've loved every minute of it (including the 30+ hours my friend and I spent playing the original back in 2005/2006).  Hipster Cat out.			"

Finding the right balance for your restruant, and working your way to the top is fun. The steady pace, and different ""rush"" times provide a nice change to the tempo. Changing your menu can result with great sucess, or horrible failure.I give it a 4/5. Why not 5/5? Well, mainly because of the fact that one little slip up on a customer's order results with negative debuffs. Sure the keyboard is small, but this game really makes you realize how small it is.			"

												Cook, Serve, Delicious! is a high octane restaurant sim, complete with typing elements and a whole lot of stress. The game is simple and enjoyable (as long as you can handle making a few mistakes here and there) and is also surprisingly replayable and long for a petty price tag of $9.99.Players are tasked with building up a menu of food items and successfully getting through a day with serving as many customers as possible with a minimal number of complaints. In order to cook the food on the menu, players must either use their mouse or keyboard to assemble all the required components of the item - more complex food (like sushi or salad) require more components, whereas simpler items (like coffee and pretzels) require less components. The player then has to find the perfect balance between high-income food items and low-complexity food items in order to turn a hefty profit and insure that customers don't walk out of the restaurant with an empty stomach. Over time, catering missions, contests and better food becomes available - these make sure that you don't get tired of playing the game after a few hours, and trust me, you won't.The graphics are a simple art style that is neither good nor bad. The music found in the game changes depending on the time of day - Spanish fiesta music plays during the afternoon whereas calm and weary music plays before closing time. There isn't much of a story, except for the goal to constantly improve the restaurant's star rating, but you will find that the game doesn't need one since it is more or less an arcade title.For $9.99, you're going to find that this game is a great deal. I picked it up during the WInter Sale for $4.99 - maybe keep a look out for it in the upcoming Summer Sale if you want to save money. This game could easily serve as a time-killer OR a full-fledged personal favourite, depending on whatever mood you are in. The bottom line however: it's great, buy it and you won't regret it.			"

												I'm a huge sucker for restaurant time management games such as Diner/Cooking Dash, Papa's Gameria series, etc. Out of any restaurant time management games I've played, this one is the most unique.It's highly customizable where you get to pick up to 6 different menu items each with varying difficulty and drawbacks. They can be as stupidly easy as slapping on some condiments and calling it a day, and others are very meticulous as to what order its ingredients need to be in.Needless to say, this game gets super complicated super fast. It's very fast-paced and it gets really hectic later in the game. It makes the game challenging and that's what makes it super fun. Don't think the main game is hard enough? Finish the main game to unlock the New Game+ that is way harder.There are new challenges every week that are ranked against other players, and you can refine your abilities even more with the new Battle Kitchen mode.

												Originally I bought the game just to support this game developer, but what I got in return was a game that was extremely addictive, fun and surprisingly hectic and challenging. The game is very well made and even as someone who plays a lot of AAA titles and have a harder time getting into indies, this game sat well with me the minute i started playing. The amount of content this game has for the asking price is astounding. I would have bought it even at $19. What I likedThe Amount of content - It has everything. An email client, competitions, betting, challenges, events, food upgrades, equipments, etcThe game length - I'm 6 hours in as of this review and i have only completed lesser than half of the main game. Even if you are stingy and go by the $1 = 1 hour system, the game would take 12 hours for $10. The thought that went into the game - It is extremely well done and everything is completely different while also linked. From the way you make each dish, to the food boosters and detractors, weather and inspectors. [Personal Opinions] What I didn't likeKey bindings for certain food are too confusing. However, this is an issue related to how a computer works and not the game itself. In a situation like during rush hour, you don't have the time to go through the key bindings for each ingredient. If someone wants a burger with a meat patty and bacon, you would just press ""M and B"" followed by enter. This could be an issue  when it comes to complex foods with a huge list of ingredients where 2 ingredients would start with the same letter. Take nachos for example, it has multiple ingredients starting with the same letter and during rush hour, when a customer wants nachos with sour cream, you would press ""S"" only to find out S is shrimp and sour cream is actually ""C"".  This is a good thing for people who wants a challenge and a bad thing for those who hates remembering key bindings and combos ( like me) . One way to avoid this is to select foods that don't have that many ingredients, but the list shrinks by a lot when you progress the game. And that is all. The game is perfect and is a must buy for anyone who likes a challenge.			"

												""Cook, Serve Delicious!"" is a fun, fast pased arcadey game. The concept might seems simple at first, but like all good arcade style games it gets increasingly more complex and difficult.The objectives are simple, but fun. You pick your menu and serve the customers as the orders come in.Each dish is made up of different button press combinations, which might seem tricky at first but gets easier once you've memorized the combinations.There's good consistendy with the key mappings, so you can easliy remember which key uses what ingreadient.The key bindings can also be changed, should you prefer sokmething different.If you're looking for a fun, fast pased game to play when you're bored, this is a good pick.

												I enjoyed playing Cook, Serve, Delicious for a couple of hours, after which it became a bit too repetitive for my tastes. Maybe I bought too much equipment too soon -- maybe I splurged on expensive food recipes. I'll never know! It has a good moment-to-moment frenzy, without getting overly stressful or complicated. The graphics, while not dazzling, are charming in their own way, and the audio was nice enough too -- only tenderizing chicken elicited complaints from eavesdroppers (it requires repeating the same audio file 6 times, preventing me from winning any popularity contests).In any event, I found myself having completed all of the goals for the first major progress marker (becoming a 2-star restaurant) on day 10, and had another 10 days to repeat before I could unlock the next set of challenges... alas. Maybe I'll get around to it, but... maybe not.I hope more indie games explore cooking as a mechanic. It'd be excellent if Cook, Serve, Delicious were the beginning of a genre.			"

Dive into selecting from a sh*t ton of food choices for service, just so that you can hand make them later during the day. Not only must you make food for the impatient customers but you also have to perform chores throughout service to keep your restaurant clean.

												This is actually a bit of a weird one. It's got all the makings of a bad game, what with repetiveness, little in the way of cosmetic upgrades, constant grinding and being very much a button mashing game. However, in spite of all this, the game is actually a very, very good game. There's just something about this game that keeps you wanting that extra slice and has you grilling for another go behind the counter.The only criticism I actually have for this game at all is that multiplayer only works locally. Please. In this day and age where half your friends are at the very least in another country?Nevertheless I'd definitely have bought this game, even if the price was doube what it is.15/10 and I'll have fries to go.

All orders and cooking are made with keyboard commands so its nice that you dont have to use both mouse and keyboard at the same time.

												I'll begin to say that this game is really frustrating, and that's probably one of the reasons that makes it so fun to play. Cook, Serve, Delicious! gives you a very good taste of what working in a capitalist society means: to satisfy the clients always 100% while also respecting the hygiene laws is not easy at all, and at the end of every day you feel a bitter, but it doesn't stop you from getting back to work the next day. I like that there are more than one play mode, i find the catering really relaxing and the battle mode super exciting. There are also really a lot of recipes, whch you can upgrade, like your restaurant, to make the game even more interesting.I give it 10/10 burgers!			"

The gameplay is extremely fast and you’ll have to concentrate as orders fly through the restaurant left right and centre. Learning the correct key bindings is important as when you have eight orders on the go, you will need to remember them!

You can set the difficulty yourself by choosing a menu full of foods you find easy, or those that make you put your fingers in tiny casts after you've set your computer on fire and then thrown it out the window. And there is something so completely gratifying about committing every different dish to muscle memory; to watching that perfect combo number keep churning upward; to know that even at 179% buzz, you have perfected every order, done every chore, and laughed in the face of that inspector while doing it. You wouldn't think that a cooking sim would give you a rush, but oh god does it.Is it time for CSD2 yet?			"

There is also a decent chunk of mail to process every game day and the spam filter doesn't unlock for a while.Final Thoughts: The achievements take a while to get rolling and you really have to commit to a lot of gameplay to get them all.

												A fast paced game that is really fun game where you choose your foods and make them yourself while cleaning the dishes, throwing out the trash, setting mice trap and more! You have a checklist to become a higher star resturant, get special events, upgrade food and practice them until perfection! Its a fun game as said before.			"

												Generally a good game but needs improvement.The fast paced nature of the game at later levels really keeps you on your toes with the menu rotting mechanic making sure that you keep switching between foods to keep you from getting too used to certain menu items. The price of improving recipes is a little steep but gives incentive to keep playing however there are some problem areas that need focus on.I encountered two problems while playing this game which has forced me to not include two food items on my menu.1) The soda order of ""large cola with ice and fruit blast"" 2) The steak order of ""everything you have, doubled, except citrus""One of these order maybe a bug, the other is ambigious and in the course of a busy day with 60+ customers when you reach the higher levels, you can't waste time deciding exactly what the order consists of. Whenever i got these orders I fulilled them as i thought i should, large cola with ice and fruit blast but still only got a satisfactory rating from that customer.The steak order could be intepreted as whether to include 1 citrus coating or none at all which doesn't help.Should a sequel be planned, i highly recommend having someone proof read the orders so they are as clear as possible.Other recommended improvements:- Having a back function so if you know you messed up a order, you can go back to the start of that order at the cost of time instead of continuing someone's order, knowing you got it wrong but having nothing you can do about it-When selecting your active menu, having a hover tool tip over each food that shows its modifiers instead of having to keep going to the ""buy food"" category to see them.This is a good entry in the food sim category, the art is decent and actually makes me feel hungry when I'm playing this on a empty stomach with music that matches the atmosphere of the game that changes depending on rush hour and the time of day which is a nice touch.The game is well designed with a lot of ways to earn extra money while testing your reflexes with a incentive of trying differnt food selections that you may not usually consider having on your money.

												Cook, Serve, Delicious! is a hardcore restaurant sim, one of the few in its genre that gives players total control over where they want to take their restaurant's future. You'll start with a few thousand dollars and 20 foods to choose from for your menu, as well as a host of restaurant equipment and a virtual email account that connects you to the people of SherriSoda Tower. Nearly everything is unlocked from the start of the game for you to purchase; this is your restaurant, and you must figure out the best strategy to get your business packed with satisfied customers.

Going trough one day is really fast (only takes 7 minutes), so it's the perfect game to play even when you can't dedicate a lot of time to gaming daily.Bad things: it requiring you to pass 20 days to go up a star makes the game a bit stretched out. When you reach about 10 days towards your new star the game settles down. The buzz is no longer over the roof and you're used to the difficulty, so suddenly the days start feeling slow. I would have preferred more stars, but less days required to gain a star.In short, I would recommend it.			"

												I saw this on the autumn sale and thought that it didn't look that good, but had a low price tag so I gave it a shot. In short, you're a cook running a former five star rated restaurant but due to the last years harsh economy it went bankrupt. This is its second life, second chance and you're the sole employee. Because of that you're supposed to prepare all the food, serve it, do the dishes, throw out the garbage and even flush the toilet (!).Besides those chores, you'll be participating in the Iron Chef show and you'll do some catering as well and you'll be ""dating"" some girls - mainly having their favorite dish on the menu and then doing it in time for them and then answering their texts during the rush hours. Nothing overly complicated, but it's good fun.It is stated that this game is ""hardcore"", but it's really not. Sure, there is some challenge to it, especially in the later stages, but it's not hardcore what-so-ever. It's more casual if anything, a good time killer. So... if you want a game to fire up when you're waiting for something, then this is the game for you. I recommend it!			"

												CSD is just hilarious and addicting. Can't really point the finger as to why it's the latter, though. Let's see...On the plus side, it has a decent learning curve (earn money, buy extra food or upgrades). Tasks start out extremely simple, but add up over time. And each menu item handles differently, which acts even more different than the upgraded counterpart. So there's that: a steadily increasing amount of tasks on a time limit. There's no strategy aside from picking the daily menu; anything else is just an attempt at as many perfectly executed tasks as possible.Note that this is a very, very basic game (I bet it would play well on a PC of last century). It has cute graphics, but you'll be too busy staring at the menu orders and the menu lanes to even notice. It doesn't need better graphics either (rather the contrary: it's far more important to be able to directly grasp what to do).The music department does deserve the praise: it may be base elevator music, but it gets stuck in your head after a while. Add to that the basic sounds of you (pretty much literally) throwing food on a platter and you're done. Oh, and of course some praising/disgruntled grumbles from your peeps.As for gameplay...keep in mind that this is NOT a simulator; it's a time management game. It may borrow quite some elements from sim-games, but all purchases, in the end, revolve around time. It's about learning the keys to the tasks by heart (down to pour coffee, 'C' for creamer, tap 'S' for each requested sugar) and execute them well. It's both stress-inducing as relaxing, as the longer you can avoid panic, the better you'll do. So in that area, it doesn't bring much variety to the table and a lot at the same time (some recipes like soup use over half your keyboard). Again: I don't really know WHY I like this game so much, but I do.I have to note, though, that the game is clearly aimed at a touchscreen environment. I haven't played it on android, so can't say if it's easier or harder. Suffice to say that it can become pretty hard. I'm now nearly 20 hours in (I'm amazed...they really flew by!), and I'm still learning and improving. If I'd sent a video of my average 'work day' to myself about 2 weeks ago, I'd say something like ""no way I could ever perform that well"".Now only to find a real life use. ;-)All in all: a great game. Not for everyone, but at least worth trying. :D			"

												This game has to be at the top of your list if you love a good Sim. Whike the game doesn't let you customise your store, or some of the more complicated business matters, it focusses on the actual day to day menu writing and cooking (and serving) of meals. Each meal is a series of buttons and clicks to add elements to the dish. It all seems so simple, and it probably is. But boy is it challenging. You would think that after a while you would be able to master it and get perfection every service day, but the aaddition of new meals, challenges galore, and the need to serve a perfect day is enough to keep you coming back every day for another day at the griddle.Great game! Definitely work $10. A funny, engaging, combo chasing game.			"

												This is a time management restaurant sim. What makes it different is the level of depth. Its pretty straightforward as far as the cooking part. Up to 4 people come in and ask for items, and you create it by hitting a selection of keys. IE if someone orders a corn dog, you hit the number displaying that person's request, the dog appears on screen and then you can put ketchup or mustard on it by hitting K or M or both depending on what the person wants. There are complicated items as well, like soups which require many items, chopping and cooking. That part is pretty self explanatory and theres a turorial at the beginning to explain it.It gets really hectic though, because each person will only wait for a limited amount of time for you to start preparing their order or they go away angry. There is a ""rush hour"" at certain times of the day where all 4 slots fill up fast and are constantly full. I havent found a way to keep everyone happy yet, and that par of the game can get frustrating as hell.There is keybindings to put the most used items grouped together, or however you want to do it. Thats a great feature, because the default is most of the items are listed by their first letter, but some are just random (olives are V, bowtie pasta is w) This can get annoying if much requested food's keys are across the keyboard.The thing that makes this game different is the level of depth of your restaurant management. At the end of every day, a screen pops up where you can buy new equipment and food, check your email, look at your ""buzz"" (a measure of how well liked your restaurant is). You can also pick the daily menu, upgrade your food , buy things to amuse your customers so they will wait longer and so on. Each food item has boh positive and negative traits like some items are well liked at first, but need to be cycled in and out to keep them ""fresh"". Some smell good, some are fatty, some are healthy. There are many food items and equipment to choose from, all with different effects. The graphics are bright and cartoony, totally fitting for the flavor of the game. The music (especially the intro song!) is peppy and upbeat, also fitting for the style of game.If you like time management and restaurant sims, this is a great choice to consider. Its hectic at points and can be frustrating, but it is still great fun.			"

												This is a great game. Totally a fun way to kill some time. You work as a chef in a resturant. You also flush toilets and catch rats. Why? Because you can that's why. Or you can ignore the nastiness that's going on behind the scenes, continue to serve up food and get a poorer rating at the end of the day. It works on a daily basis with upgrades for the food you serve, the restruant, the equipment etc. The sound effects are adorable, and I love the art style. My only complaint would be that I would like more artwork of the people, but it's not really a complaint seeing as this game is amazingly well done and polished. Upgrade your shop, trap all them rats because screw PETA and button mash your way to the top of the resturant. 9/10			"

												It's a typing game about food. No, wait, it's a food game about typing.It's Typing of the Dead without the zombies, but with more hamburgers, steaks, lobsters, and cilantro. OK, there's no cilantro. But there's anchovies. And when someone wants them on a pizza, you have to oblige no matter how much it hurts.It's frantic. You're juggling multiple orders while new ones keep coming in in a roughshod attempt to get them all in perfect order. A maintained combo means better pay at the end of the day. Rewards await those who pull off the perfect day. Juggle a menu between highly complicated dishes with expensive prices and easier ones that don't quite make as much. Customize your menu to match the requirements for, and then beat the pants off of, the daily bet. Compete in Iron Che—I mean Cook. Iron Cook, yes—challenges. Grow from a meager hole-in-the-wall diner to a five star establishment, complete with whiny, needy celebrities to indulge!Try to keep up. You won't. You'll try, but you won't.

												Really fun game and has more depth than you would give it credit for. You not only have to quickly mash keys in order to prepare perfect meals, but you also have to plan your expenses and your daily menu. Certain meals comboed with each other give you beneftis, or hurt your restaurant ""buzz"".So basically, definitely grab this. It's cheap, fun and relaxing, although rush hour can be pretty tense, you are not punished too much for messing up, unless you try to go for really high streak of perfect orders.			"

ENGLISH and Italian Review Recensione Inglese ed ITALIANA English:This game is surprisingly addictive and fun. It's a well made casual game about cooking, cooking well, cooking fast and expand and improve your buisness. A great killtime.Italiano:Questo gioco mi ha decisamente sorpreso. Sembra una cagatina, ma alla fine è decisamente divertente, ben fatto e da dipendenza. E' un gioco casual/arcade dove si deve cucinare, farlo bene, farlo veloce, far crescere e migliorare il proprio ristorante. Un ottimo passatempo			"

												This is a great game. Totally a fun way to kill some time. You work as a chef in a resturant. You also flush toilets and catch rats. Why? Because you can that's why. Or you can ignore the nastiness that's going on behind the scenes, continue to serve up food and get a poorer rating at the end of the day. It works on a daily basis with upgrades for the food you serve, the restruant, the equipment etc. The sound effects are adorable, and I love the art style. My only complaint would be that I would like more artwork of the people, but it's not really a complaint seeing as this game is amazingly well done and polished. Upgrade your shop, trap all them rats because screw PETA and button mash your way to the top of the resturant. 9/10			"

												Cook, Serve, Delicious! is a restaurant simulator, or perhaps a line cook simulator, that is ambitious in its reach but somewhat failed in its execution. I'm not talking about the gameplay, which is fun; I'm talking about the bugs. The gameplay reminds me of old coin op serving games with modern twists; instead of pouring mugs of beer or root beer to satisfy customers, each menu item has its own recipe to be followed, many times with multiple steps. The game takes into account time of day (some people get turned off at the smell of fish cooking at breakfast) and weather conditions (rainy days mean comfort food will be popular) as you work to make the money to upgrade your kitchen and buy new appliances. Unfortunately, the game menus are terribly coded so that I could only read roughly a third of the buttons. This includes options menus, food selection, item purchases, upgrades, you name it. If you're not behind the counter making food for customers, there's a two to one chance you won't be able to tell what you're doing. At some point, my control scheme was changed to that for a PS controller without any indication of what key I hit or how to change it back.I really want to like this game. Someday, with proper developer support, it might be worth buying.			"

												It's a typing game about food. No, wait, it's a food game about typing.It's Typing of the Dead without the zombies, but with more hamburgers, steaks, lobsters, and cilantro. OK, there's no cilantro. But there's anchovies. And when someone wants them on a pizza, you have to oblige no matter how much it hurts.It's frantic. You're juggling multiple orders while new ones keep coming in in a roughshod attempt to get them all in perfect order. A maintained combo means better pay at the end of the day. Rewards await those who pull off the perfect day. Juggle a menu between highly complicated dishes with expensive prices and easier ones that don't quite make as much. Customize your menu to match the requirements for, and then beat the pants off of, the daily bet. Compete in Iron Che—I mean Cook. Iron Cook, yes—challenges. Grow from a meager hole-in-the-wall diner to a five star establishment, complete with whiny, needy celebrities to indulge!Try to keep up. You won't. You'll try, but you won't. And then, one day, you will. It will be glorious. And all the while you'll have one hell of a time.			"

												So there's basically 3 different categories of food games: waitress (Diner Dash), line cook (assembling orders) and management (you run the resturaunt, hire and fire etc). This game is a combination of a line cook and a management game. It's pretty fast pace and it has multiple side challenges. You play as a line cook who also has to keep up with chores while completeing orders. It sounds overwhelming, and at first it is but eventually you adapt to the gameplay. It's smooth, the graphics fit the game right and I literally feel like this is me running a little food shop by myself. Very fun, 4 hours went by damn quick. I highly recommend, especially if you enjoy food games			"

												Cook, Serve, Delicious! is basically Cooking Mama, but made much more game-y by adding in a simulator layer on top of it. Rather than just play through a series of loosely-related cooking-themed microgames, you manage an entire restaurant, and serve orders in your day-to-day with said minigames. Both the management system and the cooking system are fun, polished, and well thought out. There's lots of things to keep track of, buttons to press, and just enough new twists and mechanics to keep things interesting.There's a lot to love here if you're the type who likes simple, fun games that are more than they initially appear. I highly, highly recommend Cook, Serve, Delicious! if you liked any of the following game franchises:-Cooking Mama-Warioware-Lemonade Stand-Animal Crossing-Harvest MoonPost script: One thing that I'd like to emphasize is that the difficulty scales extremely well. The game starts very simply and rises in complexity and intensity at a rate that I found nearly mirrored my increase in personal skill. I never felt overwhelmed or too bored. I've found that this is an extremely rare thing in video games, so I'm just trying to give credit where it's due.			"

												Simply put, it is, in my opinion, one of the most frantic game you can experience - and a keyboard game at that. The action is non-stop, though you can carefully take it up, one step at a time, thanks to the games upgrade system and its generosity in allowing you to tailor the experience you want to get out of it.I strongly advise you do not judge it based on videos or screenshots but give the demo, available on the web, a try : you will know very quickly if this is the game for you.Vertigogaming's games were long dued on Steam. The Steam version isn't just a quick and dirty port, but features the proper overlay, achievements and cloud support.I give it 5 pizzas out of 2 baked potatoes. If you enjoy it, I advise you check out the equally brilliant The Oil Blue from the same author on Greenlight.			"

												Take the food making minigames from Cooking Mama, mix in the speed requirements and attentiveness from Diner Dash, and sprinkle on top just a dash of restaurant management so your store can progress and make more difficult and expensive stuff. A completely different flavor, but similar to Papers, Please, where every mistake can hurt you, but you also need to be as fast as possible. Take on challenges and bets to earn more money, purchase tougher recipes, realize your dream of owning a 5 star restaurant, do side missions like catering and iron chef challenges. It's a ton of fun and I highly recommend it.			"

												This game is very hectic...but for real the game is great and is so much fun to play, especially if you're bored and looking for something to do. The gameplay is almost entirely keyboard oriented but a mouse and gamepad (controller) will work to. The selection of foods to add to the active menu and the speciality foods add alot of variation into the game making it all the more fun. It's a great game to play but it can be just as or more intense than a competitive match in CSGO. I guarantee that you will not find a better cooking game for this price nor will you dislike it if you buy it. It is very hard to hate this cooking masterpiece. Also it can help quite nicely for people who can't type without looking at the keyboard because you need to remember some of the keys.			"

												This game has no great graphics or music or a complex storyline and it tends to become a bit repetitive, however I found it to be great fun for a few nights. The game will keep your heart bouncing as you will spend most of your time hammering your keyboard and battling against the clock. You won't be typing text, but quickly entering shortcuts in a precise order to prepare food in the game. You will both serve customers and participate in contests. There is a concept of levelling up/upgrading your restaurant and gaining new ingredients/recipes as you get more skilled in preparing dishes. You also need to plan a bit, for you are responsible of managing daily menus where each dish has its pros and cons. Cleaning the bathroom, doing the dishes, taking trash away and some other activities will also interfere with your cooking.

												It's a simple game but it's addicting. I figured I would try it out before bed and 30 minutes later I just closed out because I knew I couldn't stop playing.It's simple, you buy your kitchen equipment and recipes and then use those recipes to make a menu of four items every day. You have to switch it up though as some items have ""Menu Rot"" and bring down the rating of your restaurant if they're on there for too many days. You can also upgrade your food items to help bring up your restaurants rating.It's simple but so addicting and before long I was yelling out nacho toppings and scrambling during rush hour. Oh, and you'll want to cry when it's rush hour, I promise.			"

												I nominated this game for ""The “Best Use Of A Farm Animal” Award"" because, steak. Steak is definitely the best use of a farm animal. I'm just saying. I expected this game to be more like Cooking Mama, but it's actually a timed-response quick-fire kind of game where you have to quickly tap away at all the necessary tasks to get your orders out correctly and in time. It's more addictive then it seems and there are plenty of gameplay expansion options; it's also a lot trickier to master than you might think. And if you've completed the single player campaign there are lots of other challenges as well as a multiplayer mode. In short, there's a lot more to it and plenty of gameplay you get for the price. The graphics are cute and I hope they get a bit more polish in the future.			"

												This is a great simulation game! At a first glance, this game looks like it'll be tough as nails. It appears to demand perfection and punish you harshly for mistakes - but the very opposite is true! Your very first items are all very simple to make, and help teach you the base mechanics and buttons of the game. While serving up corndogs and soda might not be the most exciting thing ever, it'll help to automate things like picking up orders and serving them. The difficulty in this game is always determined by the player. If you miss a ton of orders, there will be less customers the next day, allowing you to learn at a slower pace. Additionally, there are many different recipes that vary in difficulty which you can put on your menu to make things easier on yourself. The food all looks great, and is enormously satisfying to make. The sound effects of a burger being slapped together is a feeling like no other, and you will feel like a gaming champion when you reach a perfect day with difficult recipes on your menu.There are a ton of small fun things that the game offers to enhance your gameplay. Some emails and characters will ask for you to carry certain recipes or combinations, gently nudging you to change up your status quo and use recipes that you normally avoid.Becoming good at cooking in this game is satisfying, and it remains fun throughout the entire experience! The only Con I can think of is that the checklist for upgrading your restaurant takes too long to complete. Not because the challenges are demanding, but because it always requires 20 days of gameplay before you can advance. Sometimes this means you need to play through 7-12 days just to advance your restaurant and unlock new upgrades. Also, a few of the recipes can be tricky in their wording, which sometimes leads to frustration and an inability to complete the recipe. ( I'm looking at you, Stacked Enchilada's! ) All in all, this is a great game that I would recommend to anyone. Go for perfect scores on online leaderboards, or just do a few casual rounds trying to perfect that soup recipe you unlocked - it's all fair game!			"

												This fast paced marvel is on my favorites list. It looked intersting to start with, and it just sucked me in more and more. I kinda just want to stay at a certain level. I like to hone my skills with the keyboard memorization and such. Most people will look at this  game and think its foolish and pointless in a sense. I actually think this game is a skill tester. I also think it could be helpful for kids. When in school, I had a special class that was literally to help me memorize where all the keys were, how to put my hands in a proper position that gave me the utmost advantage with hand cordination. It has truly helped me and this game reminds me alot of that exercise. It makes you remember certain patterns and orders and ingredients. Its also a recipe zone, so if you plan to be a cook in the future, you can get a small hint of cooking knowledge from this. I definetly recommend this to people who like challenges and are good/bad at hand-eye cordination. I also give it a 8/10 :)			"

												Should be called Cook, Scream, Delicious! Because this game will frustrate you. The only thing missing from this game is buying your own groceries.The first play through is very fun, although it can be repetitive you end up changing your menu due to buying new foods, or the weather, or just getting as much buzz as possible. At around 3 or 4 stars, you end up using the same menu. The bets really help change that up, as well as VIPs and dating. The second playthrough, on extreme difficulty, on the other hand could be better. At first, yes it is intense, its hard, but messing up doesn't matter anymore. Making money? You will have tonnes. You will end up making only the easiest foods (fish, chicken, beer, etc.) just so you can get those last few achievements. Lets face it, it gets boring because you get accustomed to it and the star level requirements are exactly the same as on normal. It would be much more difficult and ""extreme"" as you put it if the requirements to get to the next star was different. Perhaps a buzz % requirement instead, where we are forced to use the more complicated foods to get that buzz. Or have an upgrade requirement on certain foods you must have on your menu? I am getting by the game mode right now with beer, coffee, chicken and fish, alternating them when the other rots. I'm being somewhat forced through almost 100 in game days till I get that mysterious email (estimate as I have not gotten it yet).  It's not fun now, its just a chore.			"

												This game has no great graphics or music or a complex storyline and it tends to become a bit repetitive, however I found it to be great fun for a few nights. The game will keep your heart bouncing as you will spend most of your time hammering your keyboard and battling against the clock. You won't be typing text, but quickly entering shortcuts in a precise order to prepare food in the game. You will both serve customers and participate in contests. There is a concept of levelling up/upgrading your restaurant and gaining new ingredients/recipes as you get more skilled in preparing dishes. You also need to plan a bit, for you are responsible of managing daily menus where each dish has its pros and cons. Cleaning the bathroom, doing the dishes, taking trash away and some other activities will also interfere with your cooking. Skilled use of the keyboard and high dexterity are the key to success in this game. Simple but hooking!			"

												This is honestly one of the most fun and interesting games I've played in a while. So many little things come together to make it feel fantastic. The aesthetic design is great. The visuals are interesting and varied without being overwhelming, and the sound effects when preparing food make it so satisfying. The soundtrack is also great, and it perfectly fits the tone of the game. There's jazz, funk, samba, all sorts of styles, and all of them can be either driving or relaxing.The game is also well balanced, which may seem like a weird thing to say, but there was never one setup that I knew I could coast through the whole game with. The game makes you change up your menu and buy and upgrade your foods to make it more varied and challenging. And boy, does it get challenging. But it never punishes you for some bs reason. If you get punished, it's because you made a mistake. And since you can arrange your own menu, you only make it as difficult as you want to. Most of the time, anyways. This game is so fantastic, and I cannot praise it highly enough. It may be one of my favorite games. You may not have the same experience as I did, but I would still highly reccommend that you at least try out this game. At $10, it's a great buy.			"

												Let me contain my gushing and try to do this succinctly. CSD is a restaurant ""sim"" in the same sense that a bag of potato chips is food. It's quick, accessible, and makes you hungry for more. The core of the gameplay is serving a steady stream of customers via barrages of QTE's as apparently the sole existing employee, in something like Cooking Mama meets Wario Ware on crack -- especially during rush hours. Then, in your downtime between days you get to buy new foods, upgrades to existing ones, bits of equipment, and cycle your active menu to keep your ""buzz"" level (customer traffic) high. That's as far as the sim portion goes. The old Giant Bomb quicklook with the late great Ryan Davis sums it up well:

			Need a cold one at 9:06 AM? Ryan and Jeff have got you covered as they explore the wonders of being restauranteurs. If you like this, maybe you'd like to check out our website!		

 Since release, it's also gotten a slew of free new content including about a dozen new foods, controller support, local co-op and competitive modes, Iron Chef challenges, and more. The dev is pretty active and friendly with the community, and now there's even a sequel on the way.The art is, while largely static, easy on the eyes, while the sound design complements it perfectly and really gives the game its captivating energy. The music is fitting for both the everyday activity and rush hours, and each part of an order you assemble is punctuated by various chops, whacks, slaps, and splashes. I wouldn't change a thing about it.For as much as I love the game, though, it does get off to a frustratingly slow start. The main metric of your progress is accumulating star ratings for your restaurant, which typically require getting a handful of perfect combos, passing a few safety inspections, doing the currently available catering side events... and playing for 20 (in-game) days since your last star upgrade. You will LONG be finished the other requirements by the time this elapses, and getting to 1 and 2 stars is a bit of a drag. On the flipside, though, by the time you get to 3 stars you'll likely be wishing that span was longer, as the game starts to ramp up in challenge FAST. I would strongly recommend you be a competent touch typist if you want to play this!All in all, highly addictive, pretty cheap, the dev's nice, and it's easily earned a spot on my favourites list.

												Cook, Serve, Delicious! by Veritgo Games is a frantic simulation of living the day-to-day life of an up-and-coming sole restaurant owner and operator. While the game may appear to be a simple casual game in a sea of other restaurant managing sims predominantly on mobile platforms, Cook, Serve, Delicious! distinguishes itself by being extremely fast-paced as a chain of frantic Warioware-style mini-games. CSD requires plenty of concentration and muscle memory in order for players to adequately serve their customers.  One point of contention which I rarely see mentioned in reviews for this game is the potentially controversial choice of having players control an alleged murderer and cannibal throughout the course of the game. While not initially revealed, players who take care in reading all of the messages in their email inbox at the beginning of each day are able to piece together the truth to the game's story and find out about all of the people the protagonist has murdered and is trying to dispose of by processing them into delicious delicacies for the enjoyment of the customers of SherriSoda Tower. I feel that is a bit of an odd narrative choice and found it to be a bit unnecessary, but I am happy to report that this revelation did not make the food I was preparing seem any less delicious and did not detract from the enjoyment I had when I finished a hard day's work with a stable of satisfied customers.

												I couldn't play this game at all.  I HATED it and I love time management games.  To the people who can play this one, I commend you.  It moved at the speed of light within five minutes of starting.  I guess I should have listened to people when they said it was more hardcore.  I just don't have the patience.  There is a place to learn how to put things together, but I honestly couldn't be bothered over something like this - it just annoyed me very quickly.  Maybe I will give it a go some other time - but for now, no thanks.			"

												This game is a well designed QTE with interesting foods and upgrades for the foods. I felt the game was too much of a grind, and did not want to put in hours and hours of QTE to get to the next levels. For this reason, I do not recommend. Recommended if you enjoy a QTE grind with slow progression.			"

												This won't be the most relevant review you've read today. Bought it on sale, played it ~20 minutes, didn't enjoy it. I particularly like games where you can design and make something your own, with the only thing you can design here is your menu, which is limited to some pretty boring food items. I planned on returning it, even though it came with a cheap price tag. I let a day go by and suddenly my account reads that I have played this game over 24 hours. Uh, ok? So I can't return it because I've ""played"" it over 2 hours. Look under my apps, it isn't there. I restart my computer and it is still ""running"". Go to Steam support but they are more than useless. Turns out it was running in my background processes. From these reviews I'm guessing I'm some freak accident, but I'm not happy I purchased this.

												Recommended in the strongest terms. You did not realize that you needed a hardcore cooking sim in your life until you played Cook, Serve, Delicious. It's incredibly easy to pick up this game for 15 minutes, or play it for 5 hours straight. An addictive mix of light resturaunt management and food prep. The difficulty can be stiff at first, but as you learn the commands for different items, you begin to perform them without thinking. You'll be amazed at how quick your fingers fly over the keyboard in the later stages of the game.			"

												This is a great simulation game! At a first glance, this game looks like it'll be tough as nails. It appears to demand perfection and punish you harshly for mistakes - but the very opposite is true! Your very first items are all very simple to make, and help teach you the base mechanics and buttons of the game. While serving up corndogs and soda might not be the most exciting thing ever, it'll help to automate things like picking up orders and serving them. The difficulty in this game is always determined by the player. If you miss a ton of orders, there will be less customers the next day, allowing you to learn at a slower pace. Additionally, there are many different recipes that vary in difficulty which you can put on your menu to make things easier on yourself. The food all looks great, and is enormously satisfying to make. The sound effects of a burger being slapped together is a feeling like no other, and you will feel like a gaming champion when you reach a perfect day with difficult recipes on your menu.There are a ton of small fun things that the game offers to enhance your gameplay. Some emails and characters will ask for you to carry certain recipes or combinations, gently nudging you to change up your status quo and use recipes that you normally avoid.Becoming good at cooking in this game is satisfying, and it remains fun throughout the entire experience! The only Con I can think of is that the checklist for upgrading your restaurant takes too long to complete. Not because the challenges are demanding, but because it always requires 20 days of gameplay before you can advance. Sometimes this means you need to play through 7-12 days just to advance your restaurant and unlock new upgrades. Also, a few of the recipes can be tricky in their wording, which sometimes leads to frustration and an inability to complete the recipe. ( I'm looking at you, Stacked Enchilada's! ) All in all, this is a great game that I would recommend to anyone. Go for perfect scores on online leaderboards, or just do a few casual rounds trying to perfect that soup recipe you unlocked - it's all fair game!			"

												One of my favorite games in my Steam library. There is so much content. Tons of recipes and upgrades for each of the recipes, plus multiplayer modes, challenge modes, and all kinds of little secrets that pop up around the game. I recommend this game because it is so challenging and so satisfying once you figure out how to get a perfect day. This game is definitely worth full price, but if you are not sure if it is for you, pick it up on sale!			"

												Original March 2014: I bought this on a whim when it was first released on Steam, because I enjoy time management games. This is the most frantic, detailed one I've ever played. It's very easy to succumb to ""just one more turn!"" over and over again. The game is difficult at first when you're learning the speed and combinations, but you will quickly get the hang of it. I just unlocked my four-star restaurant, and CSD is a game I always look forward to playing. I can't wait to see what else the developer has in store!Update Nov 2016: This is my best random purchase on Steam. I noticed it when it came out, and I really like the Cooking Dash games, so I took a chance. I'm still playing it three years after release, and it's one of my favorite games. Perfect learning and difficulty curve, and the sense of satisfaction when you get a perfect day is awesome. You can easily play a very quick session if you want to (each day only takes about ten minutes), but I often found myself playing for hours. I can't wait for CSD2!			"

You'll be flipping burgers, chopping fish, and burning nachos all while the dishes pile up and customers begin to get impatient. You can control the difficulty by what foods you select and how fast the customers arrive. This is one of my all time favorite games and I really think it's a masterpiece.If the trailer seems interesting to you, you'll probably like the game.			"

												Get's extremely repetitive quickly. It's a fun game but I would not recommend it outside of a sale. There is little to do other than the quicktime events which is basically just a keyboard mashing skill contest. Unfortunately there are no ways to actually customize your restaurant in any ways. This is NOT a restaurant sim. The only upgrades that I found were passive buffs (like needing less time to do dishes, customers waiting longer etc). It's fun for an hour or two but gets boring fast. Still worth a try if it's bought on sale ($2-3)			"

												A fun little keyboard mashing game themed on building up your own restaurant. With little customization and repetitive gameplay, I would only recommend this game if you can get it for under $5, otherwise it isn't worth it.6/10			"

												Cook, Serve, Delicious! the game itself is good and really challenging to play.I would like to play more of it but I don't like the way the buttons are placed, I've played different games like this before and I've never been bothered by it until now. I guess it's just the way the game wants to be unique, right?When you get further in to the game, it gets even harder. You barely have 5 seconds to make the orders correctly or even read them until 2 other orders run out (This is more directed for the ""Rush hours"").Fine, I get that some people will be triggered or something because they somehow can think and act faster than some others. I will admit that I'm not really good with fast acting like you need to have in this game.So If you really are into stuff where you have to be quick non-stop, here you have the perfect game.Same thing goes on and on all over again, it gets tiring after a while and just annoying.Sorry, I wouldn't recommend this at all. But If it you think it sounds good, give it a try. Don't blame me If you regret the purchase.0.5/10  "

												Do you remember that ""Bush hotdog cooking"" game you played on agame and y8 and all those sites?Well this is a revamped version of it. Such a good game to get your fingers ready for some cooking.The food is soooo good drawn that I literally need to eat after playing. "

												It's fun at the start, but becomes a bit tiresome and the delay in trying to do the dishes really fast or trash is annoying. If it is on sale, I would suggest getting it. Otherwise it is a pass.			"

												Interesting concept and at first it was really fun but it lost its luster quickly for me. Became repetitive and while I wish I could reccomend it for there are quite a bit of interesting features... it's just not really that good of a game as it initially appears.			"

												I've played this game for 5 hours and have already passed the time and experience of cooking I have in real life. This game really shows the mechanical skills and finesse required to cook at a high level. Its simplicity really portrays how you can make simple home-made food; and elevate it to restaurants as great as the one and only 'Gordan Ramsay.' There are many famous people I have seen pass by my restaurant in this game such as Brian 'Oddone' Wyllie and George 'HotshotGG' Georgallidis.我已经玩过这个游戏5小时，并已经通过了我在现实生活中的时间和烹饪的经验。这场比赛真正体现出在较高的水平做饭所需的机械技能和技巧。它的简单描绘真的你如何进行简单的自制食品;它提升到餐馆一样大，独一无二的“戈尔丹·拉姆齐。 ”有许多著名的人我已经通过我的店在这场比赛中看到的传球如布莱恩' Oddone “威利和乔治HotshotGG ” Georgallidis 。			"

												Never have I been a fan of the ""Diner Dash"" games, but when this game came along it just offers something much more rewarding than those. You still have to manage your customers and give them exactly what you want, but the way you make the meals gives some sense of skill. When dinner rush comes along it's pretty much a frantic mess of making meals and doing chores, and by the time it's over your sweating and glad there is a lull.My one complaint with the game is the progression seems quite slow, you will be doing the same thing for multiple days just to get to the next tier of restaurant quality. There is a few ways they change this up with inspectors, weather changes or food getting boring (which forces you to try different foods), these are a nice change, but still makes it seem like there is a grind.

TL/DR REVIEWThis looks like a mobile game, but I guess you get what it's advertised as being. For me, there was just too much repetition. I didn't enjoy it for more than half an hour or so, so I can't recommend this. Final noteThis is not an in depth or complete review of the game. It simply sums up my experience with the game in an effort to help you make a more informed purchasing decision. "

												Got this to play with the girlfirend. Works with two game controllers. Graphics are nice, sound average, gameplay is ultra-repetitive and boring, text is too small for a TV, over-complicated management. We played a few times and we won't pick it up again.			"
