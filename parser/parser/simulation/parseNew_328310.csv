												Hmm... First of all. Don´t understand this bad reviews. For a simple Simulation, it´s a great game. Gameplay-Time = 2 HOR (Hours on record) ;) You are a Harbor-Worker and must manage you orders and your work-stations. It´s a simple Rig and let´s roll trucks, trains and ships... U can earn money to buy some new Rails, Parking Lots and so on to get more offers... U can jump to all work-stations and take a preview of the orders or to see what to do. No need for super-graphics. (Choose the Window Mode with u desktop-resolution). If u run it as administrator and set the game-compatibily to Win 7 (Choose u OS) it will start without problems and run´s well without game-crashes or bugs. [My game runs @ Win 7 Ultimate 32bit] The secret is the camera. Use all u camera-views to manage the container-bridge and the mega-forklift to control them without problems. The controls are a lil bit unstable and u have not many options to handle them. OK. But the game is for a (Rondomedia) Presentation >> Controller supported (X360 Gamepad) absolute ok. I would recomment this game. But not for the official price. ;) *Notice: Also u can´t compare this with some SCS, Astragon or Giants Game-Programs. But for a Logistic-Managment-Game it´s ok...Not as a typical UIG \ Actalogic-Simulation-Program. Haha... It´s programmed from: Crenetic GmbH Studios. Never heard of this Programmer before... Tip: Take some time to practice to learn skills and handle all vehicles \ Harbor Tools... So here are my results:Pro:Graphics: 8 \ 10Controller-Support: 8 \ 10Gameplay: 8 \ 10Gamefun: 8 \ 10Steam Key supportedContra:PriceInstable Handling (Will try to edit the phisics \ handling script in the next time... ;)No Steam Trade cardsNo Steam AchievementsRecomment 5 \ 10  = - [Game-Price] :(Support the developers and buy the game if u like here >>  (May u wait for a reduced offer @ Gabe´s :) Autumn Sale soon)...

												This sounded like a management game with some cool truck/crane driving in it. Really, it's just an uninteresting menial task simulator. Move this box here, move that box there. No thanks.			"

												Can't really recommend this game if you find it cheap and just want something to kill time sure not a bad game but you have to do soo much stuff your self there is no co-op nor will there be the only AI is the train truck and ship coming in and out you have to operate everything your self with gets repetitive and boring there isn't even any NPC's walking around to give the game more of a better look besides 2 guys standing doing nothing graphics are a bit on the low side the cranes are easy to use though poor physics also really bad hit box if you brake one for pushing a crane slightly to hard it shatters in a cloud of dust and you lose the whole shipment so if you had 6 containers from 1 work order and brakes entirely you lose all 6 and a heavy fine to go with that you can also hit a light post on the yard and you damage your container by 100% so you lose all the money for that container			"

												This game was released November 5th of 2014, making it four months old.  Normally, for a game that is so new, you'd be okay with the bugs and patiently wait for the developers to fix the issues.  The biggest issue with this game isn't even a fault of the game - the developers have given up on the title already.  This is not confirmed, or something that the developers have straight up said, however, the last update to the game, as well as the last developer/staff interaction we had was in December, the exact day they released an update.  To the developer's credit, they fixed issues that had the game crashing.  However, we have gone three months without any sort of word from the developers.  I was told that development stopped in November, meaning they had this update done in the middle, or toward the end of November, and just completely stopped development after that.Lets move onto some of the bugs that have been encountered and reported.  The first one I encountered was that a train was supposed to have two of the same company brand containers on it.  However, after receiving one container, it'd leave!  The other container would then be accepted onto the second train that was there for different cargo.  While the train took the wrong brand container, it of course didn't end the job because it was on the wrong train.  I reloaded the game several times, but it was a constant issue.  This indicates that two of the contracts were conflicting with each other.The second issue was that the truck you pick up and remove pallets from will often despawn when you're still on it.  Most of the time, the truck waits until you're off of it, and then drives away.  When it does despawn, you're left out front, possibly with a pallet that you're now supposed to drive all the way around (slowly, I may add, as forklifts aren't fast) the warehouse just to get back in and unload the pallet or park the forklift back inside.Another issue was the physics.  My truck would often get stuck on fences, light posts, and/or walls.  Sometimes if I tried hard enough, I could wiggle it free, but most of the time the truck would have to be reset.http://i.imgur.com/s2kZHlX.jpgLooking on the Logistics Community Forum, there is no community anymore.  Yes, you may get one post or two from myself or someone else, but those are either bug reports, asking for help, or asking if the developers are even around.  It's really sad and frustrating to see that the developers put money and time into this game and got it released, then got one update out, and then abandoned the game all together.  The saddest part is that this is a fun game with really good graphics, and does what a good simulator game should - make you feel like you're actually a worker.  When you take on a lot of jobs, and end up with multiple containers, you find yourself wanting to stack them together and keep them appropriately stored so you know where they are, you know how many there are, and you know if you're getting a little more containers than you can handle.I got this game just a few days ago, and already put in 20 hours just because of how addicting and fun it can be.  However, because of the lack of updates and lack of proper fixes, there's a good chance I'm not playing this game again.I do not recommend this game, especially with it being $20.  It is simply not worth that much, and unless the developers get their sh*t in order, it will never be worth more than $10 (but even $10 is being generous in this instance).			"

												Picked it up on sale, at first it seemed fun until the glitches started up. First was annoying with the container stacker very slowly migating towards the railway line whether you are left, right or head-on which makes loading trucks difficult. I could put up with that one until I bought the warehouse. Doesn't even work, exemption error after exemption error. Wish I done a video of my somarsalting forklift. If it worked then yes it is worth the reduced price, however not in it's present state. Another rip-off product fully endorsed by Steam as usual.			"

												This game is uncomplete. It has several major bugs that even not let you to play 20% of the game. 1) Containers dissapear 2) Machines start to slide in the field and hits containers 3) Warehouse pallets are totally bugged and you can't do any of these works. 4) Dock crane's rail is not enough to reach first 2 containers of the second ship.5) Railway and dock crane's sometimes start sliding all ways and hits containers over there.

												Light arcade simulator of Container moving and forklift.I've played as i timewaster while listening to podcasts like I do with similar games but this title didn't get me.You basicalli are a lone worker in a terminal and you move containers arond, but the game has a very punitive collision box and phisics while driving your truck.

												December 2015:So, I'm updating my recommendation to a 'thumbs down' because I've seen way too many other players post in the forums and no creators have updated anything since March, except for adding Polish language, which for some reason was more important than fixing the problem(s) that everyone seemed to have! So until an update comes along for the warehouse issues, my recommendation will remain a no!!! March 2015:Absolutely LOVE this game, EXCEPT: The forklift and Palletes are just too difficult to place. even though the box turns green saying that the pallete is positioned correctly, it still does not place the pallete, and you're stuck trying to set one pallete in place for an hour!!!!

												Game is buggy!! Like most people say, it seems like a nice game but it's not!Got it on sale and installed it three times cause of a bug which did not let me play the second day.I gave up! For three times playing the first workday and getting stuck at the second workday in which the game does not see the objectives as finished even though they are clearly finished. The game has a very slow game play. And the simulation is far from realistic. The bad graphics I could live with but since the game has so many bugs as if it's an unfinished game that collected dust but the developers decided to publish it, I can not recommend this game to anyone.If you like sim games, find some other game. Do not waste your money or time on this one!			"

												Hello guys, first, the game is new on the market, some bugs and a few glitches can happen, it happens to all games but in this game, i did not noticed any major problems till now. for a game priced like this, u get a funny game wich gave me some smiles and laugh moments. the graphic looks nice and good in detail. the game it self is not easy but not too hard. u need to be carefull that you not damage ur cargos. i personal love the feeling to play with WASD and the arrow keys.  I played the game and made a live stream with it, u can see the whole video bellow on my youtube channel. and just check the steam forums for the next live stream date.
