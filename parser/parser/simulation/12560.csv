												2.3/10 - A Low-End Tycoon GameI hope my Sims had more fun at the carnival than I did! This game simulates running a carnival. You can choose state fair, parking lot or backyard... Woohoo! There is also a finite amount of items you can place and no development creativity of your carnival except for placement. For this reason I can't recommend this game. It's really boring, and way overpriced. You can typically find this game in simulator bundles for cheap to nothing. Worth $0.30 or so.

												It's easy to tell why this is bad - the publisher is ValuSoft - notorious for shovelware.This is no exception!  Obviously it wants to be Roller Coaster Tycoon/Theme Park but without the ability for the player to design custom roller coasters.   Off to a great start! It gets worse.  There's only about 30 objects you can place, and it doesn't really matter where you put them.  You don't need to worry about paths and things, guests just sort of wander in and bounce around.  At best, the game is whackamole as you click through the awful interface to try get your carnies to fix everything.   The buildings are all managed the same way, so there's basically zero differentiation.   Gameplay is overall terrible.Graphics - ho hum, awful, even for the time.Technical problems - it doesn't run in full screen even if you choose that option, it's always in a window.  Unfortunately, this doesn't prevent you from playing the game.Impossible to recommend - there's so many better games in the genre.			"

												If you are looking for a game to mircomanage resources, but with low quality graphics, this  game could be for you. It wasn't what I considered a Tycoon game. It has potiential though, I wouldn't recommend it yet though.			"

												I wanted to play this game for such a long time but all through, I really can't recommend this game. This game has very poor graphics just to be honest, the lights will flicker. The cannies don't care or repair the rides nor there's staff other than them. RCT 3 is much more better than this piece of crap and that's how I see it compared to this. 1/10 - for awful carnival tycoon game!			"

												One of the worst games I have ever played, the worst camera follow and movement. Silly rides and people that swarm the place. Don't get told what to do you just figure it out. For each individual bench you have to go to the menu and pres the down button several times to choose it, as scroll does not work and then place 1 bench and then do the thing again to place again. Bad game!			"

												Pretty fun smaller kind of game, nothing on the scale of Rollercoaster Tycoon or anything though, have an assortment of small maps, make a carnival by placing attractions such as ring tossing or duck shooting, place small rides. food and drink stores, power generators to run the carnival, benches, bins, etc.			"

												Pretty much what everyone else is saying. . .not worth the money you pay.  I liked the idea of taking on the carnival/fair idea vs. the theme park.  I thought maybe it might be a eurotrucker meld with rollercoaster tycoon....but nope...its just a stripped down version of a bad roller coaster tycoon.  Fun for a minute and then I wanted my money back.  Bummer.			"

												If you ever wanted to control a carnival then this is the game for you! Its entertaining and you use strategy and placement of things to succed in the game. Not a must have but a burn a couple mins here and there type of game.			"
