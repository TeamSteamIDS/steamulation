												A colorful space shooter hampered by mediocre controls, it's a step above its arcade cousin by having a storyline and a more gradual difficulty curve. It proved impossible to play with mouse, keyboard or even joystick, requiring me to plug in a gamepad, much to my disgust. Its flashy graphics are often overwhelming, to the point I more than once had difficulty actually seeing the enemies past all the explosions. A lack of variety in enemy ships and tactics and too much reliance on timed missions (especially the absolutely terrible final mission) hampered my involvement with the title. Still, it frenetic combat had its moments and - especially given the desert of space-sims these days - I could hardly turn my nose up at any offering. Flawed it may have been, but still fun.			"

												I was really having a great time at first, and it felt like X-Wing or Wing Commander had jumped forward in time a couple decades. Then I got the Strike Suit, and the game started to feel like it had a weird split personality, and half the time I was playing one of those games, and the other half I transformed into a giant robot in space and played Zone of the Enders instead. It did not seem like they fit together at first, but after playing a little more, things started to work out. However, with the ability to only save between missions and the very, very sparse checkpoints, I rapidly got very tired of having to repeat the long, easy parts of levels just to get another chance at the hard bit at the end. It got frustrating enough that I wished I had a physical copy of it so I could throw it at something. Then I uninstalled the game, even though it's otherwise fun, because I have better things to do with my time than play the boring parts of a game over and over again.Edit: Just for the record, Strike Suit Infinity addressed my main complaint with this game, and I found myself enjoying that a lot more because of the faster pace and ability to jump right into the heavier action. Ironically, I probably wouldn't've been able to get into that as easily and have as much fun with it if I hadn't spent some time playing this one first.			"

												Strike Suit Zero is a space flight combat game and takes its inspiration from numerous different franchises, most notably Homeworld, Freelancer, Colony Wars, Star Wars, Gundam, Macross and Freespace. As a huge fan of Mecha animes and space combat in general i just have to love this game.Just finished it and sadly its not that long, but maybe there will be some cool dlcs. Pick it up if it goes on sale, right now its not worth its full money, sadly.Its a good game, but they could have done better, for example entering huge ships and destroy them from the inside would have been awesome.Lets hope for good DLCs or other devs that grab that idea.

												If you like taking part in large space battles as a one man fighter (or bomber or 'strike suit') this game is competent at delivering that experience. You get to do strafing runs on Cruisers or Frigates, and taking out their turrets or weak points is very satisfying. Using the strike suit is a blast once you get the hang of it. At rapid pace you can lock and then launch about 40 missiles at varying targets, either severely crippling a smaller capital ship or thinning out a fighter formation.The story is somewhat interesting, but mostly only serves to tie together the levels. Checkpoints are plentiful towards the beginning of the game but become non-existant at the end of the game when you need them most to save yourself from having to redo sections that are cakewalks leading up to some very challenging sections.Unfortunately for me personally the frustrating checkpoint system really hampered my enjoyment during key moments of the game. For instance in mission 13 of the standard campaign a character essentially just monologues a bunch of story explanation at you while you navigate some incredibly tight tunnels for about 7 minutes before reaching your destination. There are two major problems with this. First of all the game up until this point does not in any way prepare you for precision flying, with every other level taking place in a wide open space battle. Secondly there are absolutely no checkpoints on this mission and this means when you inevitably die on this level, you must hear the explanation monlogue again... and again... and keep redoing the same simple manuevers.At it's best the game is a well put together space combat game. At it's worst it is an exercise in frustration. Overall I would say that it is slightly above average, and recommend it only to fans of the genre.			"

												This is the sort of game you -want- to like: an indie Kickstarter darling that wants to bring back the space-shooter with style. Unfortunately, it's just not very good, in many different ways.A quick overview of SSZ: obviously it's a space-""sim"", or what I call a space-shooter. It is not, as you might expect, a game based on the old X-Wing/Wing Commander/Freespace style of games, but rather a 50/50 blend of Japanese space shooters and Freespace. Your aiming reticule is not fixed in the middle of the screen, but floating around, and some missile weapons allow you to 'multi-lock' by sweeping over multiple targets while holding down the missile button. Aesthetically, the anime influences the music (think Ghost in the Shell, not anime schoolgirls). and your transforming ship/suit . Wing Commander/Freespace influences everything else, with capital ships that use both torpedoes from Wing Commander and Beam Weapons from Freespace.To begin with, even starting the game leaves a bad impression. The game's menus are very poorly optimized for mouse control, and its design suggests the devs at some point were trying very hard to prepare to the game for a console release that never happened. In addition, the game defaults to 720P, and inexplicably will change to 720P if you alt-tab to a different window, regardless of what setting you had it on before. The control rebinding is also very clunky, needlessly splitting up the keys into multiple categories based on the state your ship is in. It allows you to have the same key bound to multiple actions without warning you, and this is exacerbated by that fact that some actions will not conflict with each other (e.g. movement keys in the different ship modes) but others will. Which is which is up to you to experience and be frustrated by.Second, the writing is a complete throwaway. The space-dogfighting genre for whatever reason, has a history of having good writing, or at least interesting plots. From Wing Commander to Tie Fighter to the eternally classic Freespace, they all had writing to keep you interested. Not so here. The devs had exactly two ideas: to create a space shooter, and that it should involve a Macross-style transforming space-jet-fighter. There is no interesting dialogue; only one of the characters are even given the barest of characterizations (and he disappears after three missions). Even the backstory to the war in the game is vague and illogical, and contradicts itself in some of the loading screen expository background information texts.Third you get to problems with the gameplay- to put it succinctly, it's simply not fun. The game bounces between far too easy dogfight sections and extremely tedious destroy-the-torpedoes capital ship protection sections. The console heritage is noticeable here, with none of the weapons/shield energy systems management from classic space shooters. There's even a lack of targetting buttons to cycle through targetting enemy ship subsystems. It's all much simpler than fully Western-influence space shooters. Unfortunately, the Japanese influence on the game doesn't add much either. The transforming jet that is so poorly justified in the writing is also poorly justified in the gameplay. You need build up 'flux energy' to even be able to transform into 'mech mode', but the power of it isn't even so impressive. Essentially you use it to be able to spam infinite missiles at Capital Ship hardpoints while you have the transform meter, and to allow yourself the ability to turn much faster than in jet mode. It's not at all exhilarating, which is pretty damn disappointing for a game's central gimmick.A note on the game's Freespace 2 inspirations: when Freespace 2 was released, it was highly praised for how exciting the capital ships made combat, with flak shells exploding around you and massively powerful beam cannons being traded between capital ships. SSZ superficially copies all of this, but completely fails to capture any of the emotion. The sound design is completely lacking, so you barely notice any of the capital chips around. Flak Shells make feeble buzzing on your shield. Completely missing is any of massive weapons rocking your small fighter around in the battlefield. Capital Ship Beam Weapons also lack both a sound effect punch and the actually gameplay punch. They may light up between capital ships, but the damage is actually still done with lots and lots of torpedoes. In essence, all of the aesthetic are 'cargo-cult' ish: capturing the appearance but none of the essence.Lastly, something so terrible it deserves a section it's own, the game's final mission. The developers responsible for creating the final mission should never be allow to design anything again. They should not even be able to voice opinions about other games. The very existing of this game's final mission is a crime against gaming itself. The final mission unfolds as follows: instead of the gameplay from the previous 95% of the game, you find yourself suddenly just flying in a narrow tunnel. Your only objective is to avoid hitting the walls, which will drain your shields and armor, eventually killing you if you scrape the walls too often. The tunnel makes frequent 90 degree turns just so it's not too easy. In addition, all the tunnels look alike, and it is very easy to bounce off a wall, and get turned around without realizing it. This goes on for a minumum of 6 minutes, even if you're holding the thrust button down the whole time, and this is =all without checkpoints=. At the end, you get to make a choice about whether to destroy something for 1 briefly narrated ending, or to flying through more tunnels (timed!) to destroy something else for a different briefly narrated ending that isn't any better.If you are a decent human being, the last mission of the game alone should be reason enough not to pay even one cent for this game. Seriously. Go play something else.			"

												9/10 Game Play - I like transform-fighting machine such as VF series in Macross. This game have mostly suited me, the process of fierce battle is extremely fun. But the game could be better.7/10 Graphics - The backgrounds universe is beautiful, but the screen is still somewhat simple and crude.9/10 Sound - The game has its distinctive music, I enjoy myself when flying and fighting. People who have bought the mega bundle can download them.6/10 Difficulty - People may find it hard to control the plane well, omni-directional flight can also make someone dizzy.7/10 Lasting Appeal - Just singleplayer mod with 3 level of difficulty, you can play over and over again to reach a high score, but times you must find it boring.Total Score - 38/50 Sehr Gut			"

												I have been wanting a fun space shooter for a while. My friends and I used to wear out Freelancer, Starlancer and Tie Fighter (the all-time king of space sims IMO). Strike Suit Zero was a fun diversion, had some cool moments, but towards the end had a very rinse-and-repeat feel to it that took a bit of the wind out of my sails. Target capital ship - lock on with unlimited missiles - fire missiles to destroy subsystems - fly to other side - target and lock on - fire unlimited missiles - and done.It is a fun game, and thats what matters, though, once I got the strike suit and learned to use it effectively, the game got too easy. I got all Platinums and all upgrades and after that there wasn't much point. Its also a tad short I think.Fun ride while it lasts. Its cheap and enjoyable, but not a ton of content really. Mission objectives are pretty much always, go here and kill this before X dies. I enjoyed it but I wont be coming back to it much.6.5/10			"

												This game is a fantastic shooter/sim.  It doesn't have all the controls of a proper sim, but the handling and vastness make if feel more than just a shooter.  The best I can compare this game to is a PS1 series called Colony Wars, which I felt was also a really good game.  The controls are very easy to learn, and quite solid and responsive.  Your HUD is simple and tells you everything you need to know.  Definately recommend playing with keyboard and mouse if you're not using a flight stick, controller seems a little lacking when trying to execute tight maneuvers.			"

												Strike Suit ZeroRating: 7/10  Overview: Solid Space Combat with some questionable design decisions.  The Good: + Graphics are fantastic, fighting ships in space with explosions everywhere, capital ships firing laser beams and seeing a beautiful planet in the background all look amazing and does a great job of immersing you into the game.  + Multiple ships and weapons that you can select before each mission, some missions however force you to use the pre-selected ship. + The main ship and the premise of the game is that one of the ships can transform into a mech that can easily dispatch enemies. Knowing when and how to use your mech is key to winning a lot of missions. + Bonus objectives within each mission allows you to unlock upgrades. You are also awarded medals at the end of each mission depending on how well you did although completing the mission under target time usually gets you the highest medal. These provide good incentives to replay the level. + The controls may take a little time getting use to but once you get good you will be tearing apart ships very easily + Achievements are not too hard to get and may take a little time, a found them to be the right mix of fun and challenging.  + Good soundtrackThe Average:Each mission has a checkpoint system and although its fine in the earlier missions, some of the longer missions could have used a few more checkpoints. There is a story...it involves you and a ship and other people and things start happening...and.....there are explosions...To be quite honest although I'm sure the overall plot is decent the story just isn't presented all that well. It's so difficult to care about any of the characters or the plot.The Bad:- One reason why it's so hard to care about the story is that each mission is very repetitive. Every missions involves the exact same thing....blow up enemy ships..over and over and over again. The only difference between missions is the amount of enemies you have to fight. - The game has some really odd difficulty spikes. Some missions you will beat very easily only to be stuck in the next mission.  Conclusion:This is a game that has such strong core mechanics that work well but is held back by some very poor design decisions. I would love to see a sequel that really adds diversity to the levels. You don't have to be a fan of space combat games to enjoy this as I found it to be pretty easy to learn all the mechanics but it does have difficulty holding interest for long periods of time. "

												It's always been a little odd to me that an idea as freaking cool as mecha has be so minimally explored in games.I guess the easy answer for that would be because making a quality mecha game is a lot harder than it sounds, which Strike Suit Zero exemplifies even as it comes possibly closer than anyone to pulling it off. In the same breath it also attempts to revitalize space combat shooters, again succeeding to a commendable degree yet still failing to shake the nagging issues that quickly present themselves. Strike Suit Zero's potential and ambition never wanes, but that doesn't stop its aspirations to come crashing down when they collide with reality.Strike Suit Zero as stated before, is a merging of large scale space fighter-pilot combat and screen filling mecha insanity, by way of the titular Strike Suit which can transform between a fast, maneuverable ship and the extremely power mecha form. The dynamic of swooping around picking off stray fighters and then switching forms to annihilate larger enemies is strategic but also just super cool, making you feel like the all-powerful terror your enemies supposedly see you as and gives developer Born Ready Games an excuse to blow the particle effects out during massive space battles that if nothing else are incredible to look at.There's a weight to your ship that feels powerful, but without the limited mobility that often comes with higher firepower. It's balanced by requiring you to charge up your ship by killing enemies before you can transformed, and this limited fuel makes combat fast and frantic, as you chain together attacks to keep your meter full while trying to keep track of the situation. Strike Suit Zero excels at making you feel like just one small part of the giant battles going on around you, but still one capable of destroying giant cruisers and chasing down fighters.Unfortunately Born Ready Games has flown a little too close to the sun as the scale of the game quickly seems to get away from them, and the experience as a whole suffers quite a bit for it. Pacing is on of Strike Suit Zero's biggest opponents, and a concept it's fairly unconcerned with. Early missions are plodding, slow excursions as stiff bombing ships before you're given the Strike Suit, but even after missions have a tendency to stretch on and on as they continue to pile on new objectives which look very much like the last. Mission variety is virtually nonexistent, giving you largely the exact same scenarios each mission but ratcheting up the difficulty to uncomfortable levels.These difficulty spikes and the unequaled number of checkpoints intensifies the lack of mission variation, which may have gone unnoticed for awhile but becomes hard to ignore when you already had to complete said objective dozens of times do to some untimely deaths. The vagueness with which objectives are explains only makes things worse, often overwhelming me with different tasks to where I didn't even know how to start or simply saying one thing while expecting me to infer the actual objective myself, usually by watching my ship explode and then reloading to hopefully get it the second time. Or the third. Or the forth. That's if I'm lucky.Much of this difficulty could likely be the result of having missed upgrades the game expected me to have, as each is tied to a specific optional mission objective which are typically much harder to achieve than the original scenario. You can likely see the problem with a system like this, as it rewards skilled play but leaves everyone else in a state of incapable inferiority. The only option then is to replay old missions attempting to unlock the necessary upgrade or pray you can somehow scrape through anyway, which in my case usually involved copious amounts of perseverance and luck.If not for the constant interruption of a cutscene I'd have likely forgotten there was a narrative here at all, one note and vague on details, delivered with monotone voiceovers telling of events you don't care about and characters you can't remember. There's the basis of something really interesting here, but it waits until the last moment to tell you any of it and by then it's too late to salvage much of anything from a story which for all intents and purposes is just you blowing up countless enemies that for some reason hate your guts.The moments when Strike Suit Zero opens up, when the pieces click into place and its firing on all cylinders, are amazing and what kept me playing despite them being perpetuated with frustration and monotony. Born Ready Games has so entirely nailed the feel of the game they wanted to create, if only the scenarios you were placed in could keep up or give you any reason to want to continue on with them.You can find more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												I tried to like this game. As a huge fan of Wing Commander, X-Wing, and Colony Wars I was so ready to love a new space combat sim, even if it leaned toward the arcade side of things.Ugh. Boring missions, terrible voice acting, and lousy checkpointing really strained by patience. The story is kind of fun, but the characters are all broadly-drawn stereotypes that completely undermine anything really interesting about it. The space combat is solid, but when you're grinding through another ""destroy 20 enemy fighters"" objective for the fourth time in the same mission, it gets a little old.Worst of all, the strike suit itself actually sucks. It has a few powers that are essential to your mission objectives, but using it in regular dogfighting makes you far, far less effective. The controls change, so you're disoriented, and by design not as mobile. So you take a ton of damage as you spin around, trying to lock on to as many things as you can with your multi-missiles. Sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn't, but it always felt like a bad idea.It's a really, really pretty game though, and the music's amazing. Just, not much else about it is.			"

												Oh c'mon.It's a puzzle game.Anyone that is complaining about the difficulty isn't playing the game.The game is figuring out what combination of weapons you need to accomplish the mission.  You need to switch weapons fast and frequently to pass the level.  You will die, but try a different method.  Fight from far, dog fight, strafe, anything that will rope you a win.Checkpoints are spaced out a bit far, but that is also part of the strategy.  If you blow all of your rockets early, you might miss out on bagging a capital ship later.  Replay value is built into the difficulty.  I think the balance is excellent.  Well done Born Ready!  I'm in for whatever you got.The puzzle is the right weapons combination, the right tactics, and the right execution.It's fast and furyed....and Fun!			"

												One day I was watching Top Gun and I felt the need for speed and dogfighting. I have a 400+ game Steam library. I did not own an aerial combat game. I did not even own a flight simulator. I did own Strike Suit Zero. Close enough.Sometimes I forget SSZ is an indie game. It's absolutely beautiful and the game mechanics are very well done. The Strike Suit combat compares favorably with Zone of the Enders and Omega Boost. Everything is smooth and responsive. The story is basically nonexistent but that's alright. The ship designs are simply a joy to look at, even though you won't really be doing a lot of that when missiles and lasers are flying everywhere.On a sidenote, I've been rolling through the Discovery Queue recently and I have to say I am seeing a lot of indie games, maybe 10/12 every round, and the bar of quality has really dropped. I guess they just let anyone put anything into the Steam market now?			"

												I will recommend this game but extremely cautiously as you'll have to be an arcade FPS flight fan. If steam had a ""so-so"" button, I would choose that over a thumbs up. I enjoy this genre but I have a feeling majority won't. I should also mention you cannot freely fly around in space. You may freely fly around the battlefield. You are a fighter pilot from United Nations of Earth versus galactic colonies. Generally, you will be assigned minor to major roles as the battle rages on. This may include taking out turrets, specific ships or guarding one of your own friendlies. As you fight, your teammates will be doing their own thing against the enemy. This is a neat concept but the game didn't go as in-depth as it could have. Essentially, you can change your targeting system to whomever you'd wish at any moment but unless your specifically supposed to take out 7 enemy fighters, you'll have no idea how many enemies are left. The game controls themselves are okay. The rolling feature is okay but doesn't feel extremely effecting in dodging opponents fire. The flying itself takes a bit of time to get used to. Once you are accustomed to the style, most likely you will excel in the art. There are no cool gimmicks to do loop-to-loops like Star Fox or any crazy barrel rolls. Boost at least was included as well as a feature to ""brake"". They did add an arsenal of weapons to choose from. The basic weapon given is an energy weapon in which you can choose to shoot it rapidly over time or all in one burst. This weapon needs time to cool down in order to be fired efficiently again. Pressing the D-pad to the right will switch from an energy weapon to a chain-gun/machine gun sort of weapon. I personally like this one as the enemies health can quickly degrade. Missiles are another feature within the game. These can also be changed given what you like most or what you deem important for certain missions. Upon completing a few missions, the player will be given the opportunity to use other ships and even transform their ship into a space mech. The space mech can only be used when the player accumulates enough flux from landing their shots on enemies. Upon pressing A to transform, the mech utilizes it's own special set of weapons and missiles that can literally fire at many targets. This is a high light feature of the game. Overall, the flying experience is pleasurable and the combat experience is mediocre at best. The visuals are very nice and use somewhat of a luminescent look. The sounds are decent as well as the dialogue. There isn't much variance when it comes to explosions or when weapons are being fired. A cockpit view as well as a ship view is available to choose from which is greatly appreciated!As I've stated, a few people may find this game exceptional while others may stop playing a few missions in. It is fun, but it can feel like a grind after a while doing the similar missions over and over. I also found the difficulty to sort of jump at times.RATING : 6.85/10 Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ScreenShots : Cockpit view  "

												Strike Suit Zero is pretty cool, I guess. You play as a pilot of the Earth Federation United Nations of Earth, which is thrust into a war against the Principality of Zeon Space Colonies  who are on their way to totally player hate on Earth by dropping a colony on it using a mysterious super weapon. Luckily, the rag tag forces on their way to stop the Colony fleet from reaching Earth pick up the powerful new weapon, the Mobile Suit GundamVF-1 Valkyrie Dancouga Galvion Gaiking Jeeg Valverave Mazinger ZGunbuster Actually, a Gunbuster or Mazinger game would be really sick Strike Suit!Fight Jacket One is a game inspired by science fiction classics like Free Space, Homeworld, and some anime I totally never heard of and/or watched. You take control of a fighter craft early on that works just like you would expect a space fighter to work. You can choose from several weapons ranging from the usual cannons to scatter guns, homing missiles, swarm missiles, etc. It's a very competent space-dog fighting game like this with an emphasis on being a small part of a large conflict.See, while you're tasked with an objective, there are dozens of friendly star fighters roaming around the battlefield in between larger ships that all shoot about as straight as I pee. But it helps in making you feel like you're fighting in an actual war instead of just being a single fighter going from mission to mission.But there's also Strike Suit's most standout feature!...The uh...The... The Strike Suit. The Strike Suit kind of turns the game on it's head and makes it feel like a really updated version of those Macross games that used to come out on the PS1. It works as a star fighter, yes, but you can charge a super mode via EXPLOSIONS, once you feel comfortable enough with what you've charged you transform into a mecha style mode and tear up anything in front of you with a complete missile massacre that makes your enemies go ""Wow, that's a lot of missiles!"" The Strike Suit itself loses speed, but it makes up for it with a dash as well as overwhelming fire power, it feels great to just unleash hell on everything in front of you with a well timed barrage. Should you play Kerfuffle Coat Two? It's a very competent space shooter with a nice gimmick. But there's a few things that ruffle my tomkins. There are a lot of times where I got stuck in an endless loop trying to get an enemy into my crosshairs, but that just may be because I'm high all the time. Some of the battleships during escort missions lose health so fast you'd think that someone was smashing everything in the engine room with a crowbar during the battle. And speaking of which, the battleships don't seem right to scale.Like I don't think the capital ship could carry all those fighters, or even yours, the starfighters look surprisingly large compared to the ships themselves. Does this review even make sense? I don't know, I wrote it at midnight, but I think I got my points across hopefully probably not. Strike Suit Zero gets 7 people reinstalling Freespace 2 out of 10. Deep Space Nine was actually pretty good. The curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation "

												This game is quite fun and a good challenge. Best played with HOTAS joysticks, but supports keyboard+mouse and game controllers, as well, for those without a good joystick available. However, the lack of any sort of multiplayer detracts from the experience, but not too terribly. I also found everything well-made graphically and often rather pleasing to the eye. In terms of gameplay, the titular machine really feels like a force to be reckoned with; however, while all the vehicles feel different from the others, the Strike Suit is the one that really stood out for me, as it most likely has and probably will for others who have piloted or will pilot it.Overall, I give this game an 8.5/10			"

												When I was a kid, I played a lot of spaceship dogfighting games, especially Star Wars ones like X-Wing vs Tie Fighter and Rogue Squadron. It's a genre that's curiously disappeared from gaming despite the same appeal -- fast-paced action, reflex & skill gameplay, gorgeous sci-fi settings -- still being alive and well.Out of the blue for me came Strike Suit Zero, an underdog sci-fi dogfighting adventure about gunning down ships, bombarding frigates, and launching 50 missiles at the same time while barely jetting out of crossfire with no shields and sliver of plating between you and space-explosion, all to a pulsing, adrenaline-pumping soundtrack. And let me tell you, it feels awesome.While Strike Suit Zero is not as meaty in content as some classics I mentioned, it is a tremendous feat by an indie studio rivaling the look & feel of many an Ubisoft or EA game, and for the most part focuses on what lean dogfighting action it must.So despite its occasional loose threads (the last story mission is a failure, unfortunately), Strike Suit Zero is a finely-crafted action experience that I'm glad to have discovered, and remain extremely excited about whatever the team pulls off next. Let it be said: I'd pre-order a sequel in a heartbeat.			"

												The funnest flight/space sim I've played since Rogue Squadron on the N64—similar structure too.You'll get the basic patrol mission stuff to start, then you're slowly introduced to combat. The missions are relatively straightforward to begin with. Like Rogue Squadron, eventually the missions start evolving halfway through—simple missions become heated dog fights as enemy reinforcements arrive.The learning curve is a bit steeper than something like Rogue Squadron though; there are a lot of dynamics involved that the game trains you in at a good pace. This is how it's supposed to work.I definitely recommend a gamepad. I'm a keyboard user, but this is the sort of thing gamepads are built for. By the last missions, you'll be twitching and flicking buttons without hesitation or thought.One more thing that makes this fantastic: the soundtrack. The blend of synthetica, ambients and old school woodwinds gives you something along the lines of space-age maritime music. I can't quite nail it down, but they definitely nailed the mood. Cruising towards the black fleet to the harrowing tune of a clarinet (oboe?) doesn't seem awesome on paper, but it is.			"

												My advice? Stick around until around mission 4 or 5.Mish 1: ""Wow this looks like crap compared to the screenshots i've seen. Combat is a little dry is there anything else to this game? No? Just combat? oh...Mish 2: ""Nhnn why'd I even buy this space/plane games arn't really my thing and the story to this is pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I mean who the hell is this guy supposed to be? WHO ARE YOU SHOULD I EVEN CARE??""Mish 3: ""Yeah gettin bored of th- oh a mech suit cool. Pretty awkward to control though..""Mish 4: ""These space fights are looking pretty cool now...missles n' ships n' particle effects all up in my face...Think i'm getting used to controling this thing now to...""Mish 5: ""I am Hamster Jelly.

												This game suffers of death by a thousand cutsAt first, i was very much taken in. There aren't many space games anymore so it was nice to have one. The presentation of the game was nice, with voice acting for important characters, and the combat was decent (even though the controls are extremely clunky).However, after a few hours of fun, you start noticing the many problems this game has :- Dogfighting is almost inexistant. It's so hard to aim, you're better off using homing missiles to blast small ships.- Since small ships are not much more than flies, you keep encountering middle-sized or big ships to make it an actual game, but the number of different ships is very limited, so the game soon gets very repetitive, blasting one big ship after another one.- Also, the arcade gameplay means you can crash into a space station of a big ship, and you will only lose your shield, which soon regenerates. I don't ask for a strict simulation, but this is too much on the arcade side. You have no fear of big ships or close fly by, because the worst that can happen  is losing your shield temporarily- The HUD is a complete mess. All enemies icons are the exact same red. A big ships can have 10 or even 20 icons on her, because there is one icon per gun. So unless you get way too close, you usually are never sure what the heck you're actually shooting at. You can't even make out the difference between a fighter and a gun of a capital ship.- The sound effects are highly annoyings. Low health ? You get a constant beeping sound. Being targetted by missile ? another slightly different beeping sound. You locking-in on another target ? ANOTHER beeping. And you have to listen to theses constant beeps very closely because you have to notice the ""being targetted by a missile"" sound (you have to use your EMP at the right moment to avoid it). That constant beeping is driving me nuts.- And finally, the checkpoints. Born Read Games said they wanted the game to be difficult. Well, spacing out checkpoints, while reloading all ammo (making it easy to choose the low ammo, high damage weapons), and refilling all health wasn't the way to go. Especially when all checkpoints are in the ""dead"" moments of the gameplay. Usually reloading a checkpoint means you have to suffer through 2-5 min of nothing much happening, before finally getting to the part that is actually giving you problem. More checkpoints, but no health/ammo reloads would have made the game much more enjoyable, and maybe even more difficult.I will stop that list here. There are other smaller issues, but i don't want to flog the dead horse again and again. Especially since i wanted to like this game, and actually enjoyed the first few hours on it.On the whole, Born Ready Games had good intentions, and i know they had a limited budget, so they probably couldn't do everything they wanted with the game. However, there are way too many small things that make the game annoying, repetitive, and just a chore to finish on any difficulty except easy (which is way too easy).			"

												While this game is interesting and fun, it is somewhat hard to get the hang of. Do not attempt to use just a keyboard and mouse to play this; the best option would be a 360 wireless controller. Even with that you may still be left with playing with the controls. Including the game has a horrible time remembering you choose to not use  inverted controls...The music is decent, however I felt it was not very fitting of the game play, this is also one of the problems I have with it. While the music isn't the focus of game play they could have done so much better with which scores they choose for one. Good example of this would be the temps from eve online. Of course eve onlines music becomes pland after a while, however it takes a rather long time. Within the first 30 minutes of playing this I switched to custom music. (I also own the OST of this)The spikes of how hard this becomes go from, not hard at all, to extremely hard. While that is alright at times, the active save points are horrible and you will be replaying 'segments' over and over again since some things tend to vary.If you are into this kind of thing, or like 'Gundam'-like space play, this may be for you.

												where do I start? this game is simply amazingFirstly, the graphics are gorgeous though a little taxing on the computer, you'll defintely want something near the mid range to run this at the low/medium graphicssecondly, it has a great storyline and awesome gameplay, cutscenes in the middle of fighting can feel a little intrusive, especially since enemies keep moving during them but you don't, giving a few ""I would've had that guy!"" moments but it's not a big complaint from me.the variety of ships you can choose from is pretty standard, a total of 4 (Fighter, Bomber, Interceptor and Strike Suit) and you'll struggle to find a good reason to choose something like the fighter or interceptor over the Strike Suit unless you fancy a challenge, The Bomber you can choose if you want to decimate Capital Ships rather than letting your allied capitals do it.the heroes of the fleet campaign is a nice little addition too, giving you a bit more re-playability to the game seeing as you can try to beat your high-scores and all that guff that I'm not really into.If you like space dog-fighting games from A third/first person perspective, and having a ship which is somewhat similar to a scene from some anime I once saw, then this game is for you, if you're skeptical, give it a try, you can always get a refund if you don't play more than 2 hours.

												Fun space dogfighter. The skyboxes are very pretty, and the ships have a clean visual style. Combat is exhilarating and the difficulty curve is paced well throughout the game. The four ship types are not balanced well, and you will want to spend most of your time in the Strike Suit. However, this ship is awesome, as you can transform into a flying space-mech and unleash huge barrages of swarm missiles, taking out large numbers of enemy fighters in one fell swoop. Some of the later levels get very hectic, and it can become tough to keep track of the battle around you. Capital ships can be annoying as they are bristling with many different turret types, and locking onto and destroying the correct turrets can be finicky. Story is passable, but nothing special in the slightest. Soundtrack is really great, it sounds like a mixture of electronica and Indian hymns.			"

												I don't understand some of the posited reviews saying that this game is too hard or chaotic or bland. The game is not too difficult, it just has a bit of a learning curve. Truly, I thought it was too easy at first. If you're a passable shot in Wing Commander or Ace Combat or anything like that, you should be a dead-eye marksman in this. I went through the first three levels not using the lock-on function. It was only later that I discovered the game has a freaking target-lead reticle. If you cant shoot using that, don't say anything about it because you're a walking advocate for gun control. Of course, then comes the part where you get a mech. Maybe that part was easier for others. I had no idea how to use the damn thing at first. I'll tell you this much; it's not a fighter, but once you get the hang of it and get some strike mode upgrades it's hell on...legs. The Strike Suit is unbelievably maneuverable, not the slow thing some would have you believe. I became an ace with it fairly quickly just by spamming random momvement input and keeping the cursor on-track. Anybody can do that. As for chatoic; yeah, it's chatoic. Gloriously chaotic. Ever play ""Homeworld"" and wonder what it would be like to be an interceptor pilot in one of those mad dogfights where everyone is set to evasive tactics? That is this, glowing contrails and all. Even so, it is not unmanageable. The ""F"" key will helpfully direct you to what you're supposed to be shooting at. Just use it and use it fast because you will need time to orient yourself to which side of the a capital ship or somesuch your target is actually on. An improvement to this game would be to make targets with no LOS a different shade of red. Then there's blandness,  an argument I have seen in every video review. There aren't enough varieties of enemy ships or varieties in missions. I can sorta see that; everything boils down to attacking or defending, rather than including the more diverse missions of space fighters, like attending airshows or flying to Cancun for a weekend. I jest, for there is some merit to the argument. Why doesn't the mech do more mech things, for instance. Well, for starters this began as a freeware game and doesn't have the engine for that sort of thing. For another, it's a Japanese mech so it doesn't have to make sense. It's all about awesome battles set to goregous backdrops and great music. Call me crazy, but getting those out of the way is a major step to making a decent game, so I don't regret a cent of the cost for the steam mega bundle. That said, one of the really nice surprises in this game is not just the chaos, but the frenetic pace of the action. Hands up if you've played an ""intense"" game where something needs to be done ""right now"" and it turns out that you've got forever and a couple of sick days to do it. Not so in SS0, thank the powers that be. When told to ignore the enemy fighters and flak, it's no joke most of the time. You really do have to be quick, especially if you want the juicy upgrades.   It's not a game for everyone. If you don't like explosive arcade flight sims, you won't like this game. If you think the Strigoi Squadron in Ace Combat was too easy, you need to spend a few hours in a centrifuge to learn some respect for gravity due to acceleration, but if you're somewhere in-between I think you'll like this game.

												Graphics: It has great atmospheric graphics. While the graphic itself is not comparable with Crysis for example, it still is stunning how it all looks. The background, the ships and even the tracers of weapons.Controls: The controls were really complicated. But after the first 2 missions you get used to it and experience how you can do anything you want. From fast barrel-roll dodging to sprint-dashing to an enemy sentry. You have to get used to the game in general. Gameplay: It was absolutely lovely. Pure greatness. It's fast space-combat while you're in the middle of massive ships shooting at each other with an army of tiny ships flying around you. A great space dogfight.  I had a lot of fun playing this game, while the missions were quite monotone I still enjoyed every mission as it's kind of a 'kiting' game. Attack, when your armor is low fly away, get back when your armor is replenished. And honestly: It wasn't even boring.As I got the Strike Suit, the gameplay completely changed! It was still a kiting game, but as soon as I had enough Flux (the power to be the Strike Suit and shoot with it) through my normal ship even as I had low armor I was still offensive with my Strike Suit because you had the opportunity to dash away and had a new fighting system.I absolutely loved it.Story: There are 5 different missions with every of them including something for the story.You're a guy who has been sent in deep in space to join the forces of Earth while they're attempting to intercept the fleet. You're in an interstellar war: Earth's forces (U.N.E, United Nations of Earth) fighting against fearless enemies to protect a planet which is shortly before destruction.You begin as a low-priority guard near Earth. You have an Apex Ship which can't transform into a Strike Suit yet.After an attack, Earth's command say that the enemies are intending to end the war with one decisive strike.They've amassed a colossal fleet and are bringing it to Earth.The story is ok, it gets you fast into gameplay.Music: It pumps you up, isn't obviously repetitive and fits with the atmosphere and the art of fighting.Endings: There are multiple endings. You can choose which one you want. For example, the secondary objectives you choose to complete directly affect the state of Earth and the end of the game. With multiple endings, preventing Earth's destruction is your immediate concern but preserving its future is your ultimate goal.Unfortunately: The game doesn't get any of it's promised updates, which is annoying and sad.And all that for 19€. (18€ with the Director's Cut)I would definetly play it again.Looking forward on buying ""Strike Suit Infinity"" (6€) which apparently puts you in waves and waves of the decisive war.			"

												This game has been abandoned by the developer. Having both Strike Suit Zero and Strike Suit Infinity, it feels as though they split the story mode and gauntlet skirmish mode of one game up into two separate games that should have been sold as one game at a slighty higher price. The base and DLC campaigns are enjoyable to play through the first time and total to 18 missions evoking themes that make me remember the Homeworld series campaigns. However, there is very limited replayability beyond trying a handful of different ship and weapon loadouts on the same missions.Further, a graphics update, an additional strike suit from Infinity, and a new strike suit design were released separately to a Director's Cut edition. I understand other people may disagree with me, but I feel that these upgrades should have been sold as a DLC for this version. The Director's Cut steam page also has negative reviews noting that the developer abandoned that version as well, with new bugs introduced into that version left unfixed.Unlike Infinity, Zero is mod-able with Steam support. However, few mods have been produced for this game and the community appears to be defunct. There is no mission editor.I cannot recommend it due to the above points. It may have acceptable value if you are only looking for a space combat title to play through a few times then uninstall - even so, I would only buy it during a sale, and I would suggest that you buy Infinity over Zero or the Zero Director's Cut due to Infinity's relatively higher replay value.

												Remember Homeworld? Just add new graphics, space mechas, a space-flight/mecha sim, and less plot and that's what Strike Suit Zero is to me (which is just as well, since the composer is the same as Homeworld's, in a very noticeable fashion).If you don't remember Homeworld, however, I'll break it down: Strike Suit Zero is a space-flight/mecha sim hybrid with a story that takes you and a small fleet far away from home and into deep space. The objective, or plot, is to take Earth back and a new development in technology, the Strike Suit, will make it possible. The damn thing is the Deus Ex Machina device of the game, and you control it. That doesn't mean that it's necessarily overpowered, however. The ""mecha"" funtion of the ""suit"" is limited to how much you shoot with it. Kills and general destruction grants a special 'fuel' for it to allow you to transform from space ship to mecha form, and unleash pure death. You have to conserve this great power, since your ship-mode isn't the best against all of the enemies you will face, so some strategy and tactics along the way are necessary to stay alive and complete your objectives.The game, overall, is short but challenging. I'll say that, after a few months of picking this up, I haven't touched it much since I finished it, but it's a bit of a guilty pleasure as well. It's hard not to appreciate firing thrity-odd something missiles at multiple targets, and even harder doing the same to large-scale capital ships. And it's in space. And it has great OST.This isn't a game that anyone can really tell you about; this game is an experience. The blend of music, gameplay, and setting makes it good while it lasts. The ending (or endings) isn't the best, but it's not worse than Mass Effect 3's, so the good characteristics mentioned prior more than make up for it.			"

												On paper Strike Suit Zero should be right up my alley. I am a sci-fi buff and I love to fly fighters (on rails or not) across striking space vistas. So I jumped in this game fairly excited.First the story, or should I say something scramble together that only serves to move the game forward; Humans discovered space travel, humans colonized other worlds, humans divided into two factions, humans fight...and that's pretty much it. I understand this is an indie game but the folks at Born Ready could've worked harder. A great story is usually free.Visually I found the game to be stunning. Even though most backdrops had a ""paint"" feel, everything was most pleasant on the eyes. Sound effects were top notch as well. Explosions, collisions, warning cues, felt meaty and had impact. On the music side things weren't so nice. A good ""Mass Effect"" ambient music is peppered here and there, but during most missions the music defaults to a theme build on arabic rythmns and instruments. To say that it clashed with the visual is an understatement. Gameplay felt solid, controls (with a 360 controller) felt just right, though the default binds are not the best, I urge you to customize them. The screenshots might give you the feeling that this is an on rails game but it is not. There is a mission area with more than enough room to let you try different strategies. On the flip side, mission objectives are all linear and most are accompanied by a countdown.Where things crackle is in the overarching mechanics. The game has 13 missions, each of them long and segmented. The game relies on checkpoints to save your progress and they are NOT evenly placed. On normal difficulty, the game can be hard. More often than not, once you die you will have to replay a big stretch of the mission, any sense of progression is lost and the game becomes a chore.You can also earn upgrades for the suit, but they don't seem to make a lick of a difference. For instance you gain a shield upgrade, but in the next mission the shield is still the same lenght and diminishes at the same speed as before. Furthermore, the only way to gain those upgrades are through secondary objectives, which is fine by me. The problem is that in some missions the game won't offer any visual cues to inform you on your progress OR the secondary objectives are so hard/impossible to accomplish that you simply give up.Pros :-Striking visuals-Solid controls-Variety of ships (you get to fly more than the suit!)Cons :-Some gameplay mechanics and checkpoint system makes the game a chore-Subpar and inadequate music-Upgrade system is useless-Enough with the countdowns-Final mission is a joke-Achievements are a grindFinal note : I can only recommend this game to hardcore sci-fi shooters. Born Ready shows promise though, if they can spend more time refining their mechanics their sequel can be great. PS. The game offer VR support, If I ever get my hands on the Oculus Rift I will play Strike Suit Zero again. On VR this game should be a blast!6/10			"

												Almost 10 years ago, I played a mecha action game on the original playstation called ""Omega Boost"". It was fun, frenetic, had massive battles and bosses, and also had a great soundtrack. My game console broke, i lost the CD (still got to pay my friend for that...) and the game faded in my memory...Now, after all those years, I found a game that brought me the same joy I felt back then. If you enjoy space combat, mechas, sci-fi and neat designs, this is a must. Also, some guys in the development team worked on the true RTS masterpiece, Homeworld 1, which is another reason to buy and play this pearl.			"

												I really wish I could recommend this game. It has so much going for it, and I wanted to enjoy it quite a bit. The controls, however, render it all but unplayable.It's a beautiful game. Built by a small team, it looks fantastic. And if you're like me, you've wanted to strap into a transforming starfighter mecha for a long, long time. This looked like the perfect little game - not too long, not too short, and leagues of potential.It started rough, piloting a starfighter for a couple missions and blasting through debris, enemy fighters, and some small capitol ships. It wasn't perfect, but I accepted a bit of a learning curve (I've never been great at dogfighting segments of other games, so I was ready to have to work up my skill here). Once I hit the third mission and was given the titular Strike Suit, it all went to hell. Immediately bombarded with far more targets and action on the screen than up to this point, it was extremely hard to tell what was happening, where to go, or what to do. They give you a nice targetting arrow, but when the whole screen is constantly flashing red and the sounds of explosions are flooding everything, that little red arrow is tricky to find. So it's total sensory overload, but even that could be overcome IF the damned strike suit could maneuver with any degree of control. It cannot.I reduced the mouse sensetivity to the lowest possible settings, and still the slightest twitch of my hand had my targetting reticule flying all over the screen. I spent 20 minutes trying to get a handle on how this was supposed to work, but finally gave up. No matter what I did, the strike suit careened around wildly and utterly out of control, making it impossible to try and pursue objectives, lock onto targets, or generally have any clue what was going on. Maybe it's me. Obviously others have played and completed the game, and obviously some have really enjoyed it. But my experience was that it was impossible to control the ship, and so impossible to enjoy the game. Perhaps using a flight stick controller makes a difference, I don't know. Maybe players more expert in flight games can make a better go of it.But, if you're like me and are a starfighter/mecha enthusiast but not an old hand at flight games, you might want to give this one a pass. I got it for $5 and played for around 2 hours before walking away. That's about the return on investment of a movie ticket, so I'm not angry, but I can't say I'm happy either.			"

												Another day, another Kickstarter. This time it’s Born Ready Games and their first foray into the space combat genre with single-player-fighter-turns-into-mech game: Strike Suit Zero. Raising $174,804 with the goal of $100,000 and achieving the stretch goal of mod tools, Strike Suit Zero is another shining example of what crowd funding can do for small time developers. Strike Suit Zero—or SSZ—is a space combat game similar to classics like Tie Fighter and the Wing Commander series, but with one big caveat: you can turn your fighter into an anime styled mech.You take on the role of Adams, a faceless, voiceless pilot who has apparently fallen out of favor with his superiors. You have to earn the trust of your commanders and comrades in order to be allowed to take the helm of a fighter again. You know, a real rebel story, where you’re Starbuck and everyone else is completely incompetent. The story hinges on some cliché elements, like a woman fused with an AI construct, a commander searching for his white whale, and Adams being the chosen one, all of which are totally mismanaged and telegraphed from the get-go.You spend most of the game with your wingman and commanding officer, Reynolds. She’s a fiery, but effective, leader who will deliver such witty monotone one-liners as, “You know the drill, Adams” and “I’ve got your back.” It’s unfortunate that the voice actor seems as if she’s taken twelve Ambien and just wanted to go sleep instead of offering a moderately appealing performance. That seems par for the course when it comes to all the voice acting in the game. There was plenty of opportunity to use the voice work tactfully, but for some reason the best mechanical use is, “They’re going after Adams.” This line is repeated constantly with no context and sometimes no real reason other than to fill quiet time. It’s unfortunate that Born Ready Games didn’t seize more opportunities to use voice chatter as a mechanic rather than ambiance that breaks immersion and falls flat.Mechanically, the game is pretty simple: cycle targets, shoot targets, win the game. It’s fun for a while, but becomes repetitive. Missions are long and don’t vary much. You’ve got the typical escort, kill, bombing run, and capital ship battles that are tried and true tropes of the genre. You can unlock new weapons by earning medals and special objectives, but you really don’t need to grind in order to progress. There’s nothing really new or earth shattering, either. The controls work well, but you’ll likely find a flight stick or gamepad better-suited to gameplay than a mouse and keyboard.The defining disappointment though, is the very thing that separates the game from the rest of the genre. The mech—also known as Strike Suit—is incredibly underwhelming and mostly boring to use. You gain a resource called Flux, which powers the fighter’s Strike Suit mode by dealing damage to enemies, thrusting, or taking damage. Think of it as a rage meter from World of Warcraft. You use Flux each time you shoot or fire rockets from Strike Suit mode. You can gain Flux while meched out, but the amount is reduced greatly in order to get you to use it more strategically. It just feels like the mech could use more unique abilities beyond shooting and firing rockets to make it more appealing.If there is one thing SSZ does well, it’s visuals. The space-boxes are beautiful and do a great job of immersing you in the universe. You really feel like you’re in space, dog fighting, looping, and bombing. The ships are all nicely rendered and have a distinct visual style inspired by countless space operas and animes.If you’re into future-tech animes and flight combat games, you should have plenty of fun playing SSZ. If you like the idea of a fighter that transforms into a mech and expect to get something out of that, you’ll be disappointed. Only around one third of the thirteen missions feature the Strike Suit, which you don’t even use in the first couple of hours. There’s about 5-6 hours of content though, so you will get decent bang for your buck. If that’s not enough for you, there’s always Freespace 2 and the mass of mods being made to this very day.This review was based on a day one retail copy of the PC version of Strike Suit Zero developed by Born Ready Games			"

												For what it's worth it's a great looking and sounding game but the dynamic of the space combat is largely disinteresting, boiling down to hosing down waves of enemies or making passes at larger vessels. The only ""tactic"" in this game revolves around the Strike Suite, a contrivance that technomagically charges itself when you destroy enemies. A mechanic that once aquired evaporated any verisimilitude I may have had towards the experience.For all its polish, the mechanics of the combat left me dissatisfied and wanting for more. This game should drop the ""Simulation"" tag and call itself what it is; an arcade shooter.			"

												To hear my full thoughts on Strike Suit Zero, listen to the review on Game Hoard Podcast[soundcloud.com]I found that the game hits a sweet spot between a simple arcade-style shooter and a complex spaceship sim. As such, it is relatively easy to learn and control but has a fair bit of challenge and you can really feel yourself improving as you play. SSZ is also a highly focused game. Story, graphics, and sound design are all good but not great and it only has a relatively short singleplayer campaign, with no multiplayer or other game modes. However, the core gameplay is definitely strong enough to carry the game and make it worth playing. Flying along an enemy capitol ship and blowing up its turrets and fighters in a space mech is very fun and empowering, even if you end up doing it a lot over the course of the game.Overall, I'd recommend it to people who like singleplayer space combat sims, especially the Freespace series.

												I really enjoyed playing this game. It just looks really pretty and that your space ship can transform is just funny.And i really liked the fac that objectives are clearly noticable on the map because i usually lose the way in this kindoff games.The only problem i had were that in the last map if you hit a wall its just hard to get control again over your space ship.The game itself is a bit short in my opinion but i really enjoyed playing it and it was definitely worth my time and money.So in easy words:Pros:- Beautiful Game- Your ship can suddenly transform ( To funny )- Different endingsCons:- For somereason the controls arent that easy- If you hit a wall you are mostly marked to death in the last missionRating: 7/10 "

												Strike Suit Zero is a great indie title. I am sorry I waited so long to play this game. I bought it as a bundle and the game sat on my inventory collecting cyber dust for several months. It is a great standard space shooter. If you just want to get better at dog-fighting, this is your game. If you are looking more of a space sim with trading and stuff, this is NOT your game. However, the game is very good at what is does. The battles go from easy to hard in the blink of an eye. You will find yourself fleeing away from enemy fleet laser cannons and turrets quiet often.  Contrary to popular belief, I found the controls of this game to be very good and responsive. I can see how people who are not very good at dog fighting can argue that the controls are bad. Don't listen to them. The game is fast pace and YOU need to be fast, YOU need to be responsive. I found myself switching between weapons and third/first person mode CONSTANTLY, just so I could get the shot I wanted for the easy kill.  The game has bright colors, great music, and explosions...lots of them!!  Strike ModeI loved the concept of Strike mode. Basically, as you progress along you get a new ship that’s has the ability to transform into a mean robot looking beast that takes out everything is its path. The best thing about it is that if you are not into that sort of thing, you don't have to use it. Simple! In short: The game is very good at space combat. It is hard (hard=good) with good controls and I'm yet to see a bug or crash. Once again, great Indie space title. Play it!			"

												I really liked this game, it's quite rare to me see space shooter game where you witness the pure destruction of enemies battleship. It's like that old PS1 game Colony Wars and other space shooter with transformation and space wars, also this game is quite colorful and beautiful to watch and scenery just amazing. Even though, I find this game sometimes repeating some parts and it maybe be quite short story, also it doesn't have checkpoint on when you done the first part of the mission, just after you're finished mission, but it is really good game and I had fun time with it,  I really higly recommend this game when it got this discount and if you're really into space shooters, I also recommend the Strike Suit Zero: Infinity, it is quite fun arcade type of this game and quite challenging.

												Strik Suit Zero is a very refreshing take on the tried-and-true SpaceDogfighting formula, and has drained away a lot of my time, despite Steam claiming otherwise. The gameplay is phenominal, it's like playing the balls of god- if they were deep-fried and required a gamepad. The visuals are very flashy, suprisingly bright, and very pleasing to look at; despite not being ""up-to-par"" they definately deserve some praise, because I've never seen so many ♥♥♥♥ing light trails. Not even in Tron: Legacy. The soundtrack is a very calming, yet tense J-Pop-esque compiliation of themes that give me eargasms, and when combined with the sound effects, will make you spaz out in a pool of your own urine. The story sucks. There's nothing that could redeem it, really, read a synopsis. It sucks. Luckily, you'll be so immersed, that you will care about every character anyways, two-dimensional or not. Also, the A.I is pretty great if you ramp it up to hard, other-wise you might find it a peice of cake. HOWEVER difficulty is insane if you want the ideal upgrades on hard, requiring borderline suicial amounts of replays to accomplish. Overall, pick this up over the DX unless you really want an actual story or ninja mechs.			"

												Very fun! Story is great it actually gives you alternate endings and you can unlock quiet a bit of things in the game, best way to discribe it is flying and mech space shooter, if that makes any sense. It can get tedious as times with the constant ""kill this group"" in every mission but I think it is worth it, especially if you love Gundams or space ship shoot'em ups.Music and imagery is just gorgeous. Controls can be either mouse+keyboard/ Controler or joystick. The controls take a little bit of time getting used to but after that it gets pretty fun.I have to say the most frustrating part of this game is the checkpoint system and the end mission is nothing like what you are doing throughout the whole game which is just all kinds of frustrations, other then that I think the game is worth a paythrough at least.

												After playing several space games, this is finally a superb game for action lovers! It's still enclosed in some kind of story, but you can fly and roll around and blast (almost) everything away. :-)  The graphics are not too overloaded but still great - exactly right for a shooter like game. It runs on Ubuntu 12.04 64 Bit very smooth with everything maxed out on a passively cooled nVidia GT430 card. Joypad Logitech Rumble Pad 2 is perfectly supported and you need all sticks and buttons to controll the most important functions. It's a real blast for gamers that prefer action over strategy.2016-05-22: reinstalled and played again on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64 Bit with integrated graphics AMD APU 7850 and AMD APU 3870. On both computers it runs very smooth with medium settings in 1920x1080. Only in very heavy action FPS goes down. The game seems to have problems when played with a joypad (Logitech Rumblepad 2) as after a few minutes the game just minimizes. Playing with keyboard+mouse, this doesn't happen. Great space 3D action shooter with nice graphics, good effects and very good sound effects. The latest version supports 3 degrees of difficulty (easy, normal, hardcore).			"

												Strike Suit Zero is a sweet space battle action shooter.Compatible with Oculus Rift, the well opimized animations and graphics give the player a good sense of diving into the emptiness of space right into the faces of enemies riping them apart with canons, missles and torpedos.A great variety of types of ships will make you set priorities on your targets in order to keep the allied fleet alive. From fighter ships to huge Frigates and Titanic space carriers.The targeting system is awesome, the explosions are nicely tone, you can even see the debris left behind from the ships killed.The battles are impresive and well set.The game also introduces you to a great feature which is getting a ship that can transform into a mecha, changing your movements into vertical and shoot some kinda AA Gatling canons that rip your enemies into shreds.2 things i didn't like on this game.-Having played Strike Suit Infinite (awesome game as well, same features - arcade mode) the music started getting very boring and repititive and had to turn it off at some point.-The final mission of the game is not like the rest. They literally took every concept I hate from all the 90s games and put it in it. Narrow close quarter paths with obsticles, spicky♥♥♥♥♥♥ lasers and a ♥♥♥♥ing timer above everything.And finally I have to say I wasn't satisfied enough with the controls. Not many people seemed to have the same problem with me so you can say it may be just be on this but things seemed a bit too sharp for me.General input: Recommended if you love space action and flying a ship into battles.Do not let teh final mission take down the average experience from the game.Do buy the Strike Suit Infinite for unlimited battles and lots of fun.CheersPS: sorry for crappy grammar, i did this review really fast.

												Having spent my childhood playing great space combat sims like Wing Commander, Conflict Freespace and Starlancer I was looking for a fresh modern take on the genre in Strike Suit Zero.After a very promising and artistically accomplished introduction (reminiscent of Homeworld) I looked forward to launching into epic space combat with giant robot suits, against a backdrop of an engaging universe and back-story.The game certainly delivers on the former - once the Strike Suit is obtained, there is ample opportunity to rain gloriously intense, multi-directional death on your enemies the likes of which I've not seen in other space combat sims.Unfortunately that's really the only selling point. With your superior firepower, the game quickly becomes an arcade shoot'em up as you take down endless waves of enemy fighters and capital ships. There are the odd stealth or escort missions, but generally the gameplay suffers from a lack of variety. Performance upgrades to your ship can be earned by achieving optional objectives as an incentive to replay missions, but unless you're into maxing out achievements, I did not feel that this was a compelling enough reason to revisit missions. The missions themselves are linear - so if an objective is failed you simply have to restart from a previous checkpoint.The backstory of Colonials vs Earth, alien artifacts and AIs had a lot of potential, but this was not fully explored. The enemy is simply a faceless evil armada hell-bent on the destruction of Earth while your rag-tag fleet are the good guys standing in their way. What prompted them to this extreme course of action? What atrocities did Earth commit to warrant this genocide? Nothing is explained. The characters are equally forgettable. While the voice acting is fairly decent, character development is non-existent: they are simply there to give you orders.With better variety, pacing and story-telling, I would have considered this a great game; it certainly falls short of my childhood favourites. However, as the product of an indie studio, this is still a slick and polished product that is short and fun if you're looking for your fix of gratuitous space battles. And giant robots.			"

												Strike Suit Zero is an interesting space Mecha game. Although the Mecha designation might not be the best here. First of all you are the only who can transform from a normal space ship fighter to a mecha which is much more powerful, however also more stationary. And there is only ship capable of transforming and you don't even have access to it all of the time. Most importantly perhaps is that your time in the Mech mode is limited, you can transform as soon as you gather a little bit of energy (which you can do automatically and very slowly over time, or quickly by destroying enemies), but you also quickly expend that energy simply by firing on your opponents. It seems that the only way they managed to balance the game is by limiting how long you can stay in the more fun Mech mode.The targeting system also isn't very helpful, and there is no overview of what kind of enemies you're fighting. So the only way for you to get an overview of the situation is by actually looking around. That becomes very problematic in the later missions when you're tasked with protecting your fleet and you've got multiple enemy cruisers coming down on them, with your main objective being to destroy the beam cannons which do massive damage to your fleet. However as there is no overview there is no good way to be sure that you've actually neutralized the biggest threats. Unless you know for a fact how many of each ship is out there, which of course you'll only learn once you've failed the mission and that is simply not good game design.Background music for the game is very nice, however it can become quite repetitive as there isn't much variety there.The story itself is very generic, but still passable and kept my attention to the end (which comes quite quickly though), which is more than most other similar games can do.All in all, the game isn't anything special but it's fun to play, at least through its short campaign.6 / 10			"

												Strike Suit Zero is one of the best space battle games I've come across. You take the place of U.N.E pilot Adams as he is given a prototype strike-suit in an attempt to stem the advancement of the Colonials in a really good story-driven campaign. The game is quite challenging and some of the battles are of epic proportions with hundreds of vessels of various sizes fighting at the same time! The strike-suit brings my thoughts to the good mecha-anime-series and it is pretty bad♥♥♥♥♥but not invincible. The game is unfortunately a bit spoiled by a very frustrating monologuing last chapter that would be fine if it wasn't so unforgiving due to the somewhat wanting control mechanics. Still, it's a fairly minor issue with a game that is otherwise awesome so it still gets a recommendation!			"

												This game is getting way to much hate, hence the reason I felt writing this review, since it has caught my heart as being one of the best space flight shooters I've ever played together with that PS1 game back inte the days, what was it called let me look up... ah yes, Colony Wars, awesome game.So there seems to be a lot of complaints about the difficulty of the game. Let be break it down to you, the type of incompetent people that like achievements nonetheless that brought WoW from the glory of its TBC days to the disgrace of post WotLK days, are also the same type of people complaining about the difficulty of this game. If you're one of those people, stay away from this game, and any other game that has an exceptional potential for stimulating gameplay, because we don't want you ruining them.Else, you'll have an absolutely thrilling experience as the game progresses. I still have fond meomeries of the intense, adrenaline rushing and stimulating gameplay as the story and missions kept escalating. The finish was awesome, as were the extra missions added by DLC, especially the ""Impossible Mission"".The music adds an amazing atmosphere and works well with the graphics and artstyle, creating a great experience beyond just merely the gameplay.Now there are only two downsides. The first being optimization for the final mission, which they might have fixed or at least improved since I last played it, which was quite a while ago.The second is that, since the experience is so great, it also feels a bit short, although having some replay value due to its stimulating gameplay.All in all, I'd love to see a sequal, building upon the good that this game already has and improving it even further.Pros:(+) Stimulating, exciting and escalating combat and gameplay.(+) Great music.(+) Nice atmosphere.(+) Sufficiently good story.Cons:(-) Possibly lingering optimization problem for final mission.(-) Would be great if the game was considerably longer.

												Strike Suit Zero was, if I'm not wrong, one of the first successful kickstarted games and it delivered exactly what it promissed. Strike Suit Zero manages to provide you with a fast and frantic space combat, either on 3rd person mode or cockpit mode. It will probably remind you of early space games on the PC market. The game takes place on a raging conflict between the Colonists and the United Nations of Earth (U.N.E.) where you fight alongside the U.N.E. forces on a struggle to save Earth from total destruction and uncovering a hidden mystery about an alien ship that was found on one of the colonies. Visually, the game is stellar, providing you with total immersion during each fight, specially during massive fleet battles between carriers and cruisers with tons of explosions and projectiles. Now, the soundtrack is absolutly great it really reminded me of the old days when I used to play Homeworld 2 and Strike Suit Zero actually made me feel like I was piloting one of the fighters from Homeworld because the setting is so similar and I'm pretty sure it was one of the inspirations. Other than that the story at first might not be all that great but on the last missions it starts to get interesting and it will tickle your curiosity. The combat does an amazing job, it feels extremely satisfying both when using missiles or rockets or when using your main gun, probably the best fighting sections will happen with the actual Strike Suit Zero. I have one complain about this game however, I found the final mission extremely hard and frustrating and I fould myself raging, it does not feature any kind of enemies but what it does feature is a corridor ""racing"" segment which ended up with me going against the walls 95% of the times. Other than that, this was a total blast to play and I highly recommend it, it is definitely one of the best space fighting games I've ever played. "

												This game is too hard. I like hard games, but i like hard games that are fun while they are being hard. This game is not. It's really unfortunate because the graphics are really cool and i haven't played a game that made me feel so much like i was in a space opera since TIE Fighter or Babylon 5: I've Found Her. But this style of game has dated a lot, and Strike Suit Zero emphasizes the worst parts of the genre (combat) while neglecting the parts that made it good (storyline, dialog, wingmen, flying around massive space stations in awe...)I could overlook the fact that your wingmen shoot blanks and your capital ships just float around waiting to be destroyed by insanely slow-moving torpedoes, if it wasn't for the cheesiness of being tasked to single-handedly take down enemy capital ships in a puny fighter that never stops flying forwards. Nevermind being able to fire thrusters to strafe around your target - you can't even come to a dead stop. It makes the whole game feel like Rebel Assault or some other oldskool rail shooter, except for the fact a turret will take you out in about 0.42 seconds. And if you do manage to somehow waste your target, don't worry, you won't get any time to enjoy the scenery, because the mission will either immediately end, or (more likely) another three capital ships will drop out of warp to blast you back to a checkpoint half an hour ago. Great concept, poor execution.			"

												Like most space shooters, this game has no variety. All you really do is zoom blindly around space while trying to maintain the odd and disorienting controls. As ""Blast all of the bad guys!"" is the game's motive, my interest was instantly withdrew, and I go back to playing Space Invaders on my Atari. The controls are very unstable, and every gameplay session feels bland and plain. This game requires a lot of patience, but what good is that for video games? The whole point is to have fun, which, sadly, this game does not offer to me. The only reason that this game is in my library is because it came with my computer, I've played it twice and got bored after two missions.Who knows, you might like it more than I do.

												I really enjoyed Strike Suit Zero up until the point that I didn't. For the most part, Strike Suit Zero was a really fun and well done starfighter-like game. However, the very last mission was poorly made. It's dull and requires you to listen to a very long dialogue from a certain character. If you mess up, you got to start all over again and enjoy getting your ear talked off. I don't want to say much about the final mission at the risk of spoiling something for those who might want to see for themselves. But a fair warning to those who pick up this game, it is quite literally unplayable. The design was not built for mouse and keyboard controls, maybe a joystick... but it sucks so bad visually that I don't think even that would help.Despite all that, I had a fun time playing Strike Suit Zero. Some of the missions proved to be frustrating with their oddball objectives that required you to do things in a very specific way to avoid failing the mission. But for those of you who remember games like Star Wars: Tie Fighter or Rogue Squadron might like to check this one out.Final Verdict: (3 out of 5)Rating may have been way higher if it wasn't for that final mission.

You couldn't change difficulty and checkpoint system was completely terrible. They fixed it and now it works perfectly.If you are huge fan of mecha anime (like me :-D), buy it. Models are Macross inspired. If it only had G mode so you could glide in the capital ships like Rick Hunter on the Zentraedi capital ships...

												Buyer beware! Although the game is technically controller ready, it is practically unplayable. It's painfully obvious that the whole aiming system was designed with the much more accurate mouse in mind, using a controller the ship has the maneuverability of a pregnant whale and the grace of a dead cow floating in a rocky mountain river.

												Fun at times. However it suffers from the usual stuff devolpers can't seem to bother with. Your teamates are useless and every mission depends on your craft to perform almost every task. The only good thing your teammates do is absorb bullets. And there's the other problem. Several missons you are forced to defend these useless teammates. Your are forced to run around the whole battlefield to intercept missiles and other crap your useless team can't stop themseleves.The story shares many things with homeworld series. (not very original).Was able to reach lvl 12, then I had to turn it down to easy to make it past that lvl. Made it to the last lvl and what was the designers thinking. This lvl is among the worst I have ever seen design wise.			"

												I held off buying Strike Suit Zero for a long time because I figured there was no way it would be as cool as it looks. Seeing it on sale at Steam was the final nudge I needed to pull the trigger and I can now say it is actually cooler than it looks. I’m sorry I waited so long to pick up this title.SSZ will appeal to anyone who was a fan of games like Rogue Squadron or Colony Wars on the PS One. It’s not quite up to level of depth that X-Wing or Wing Commander had since this is more arcade shooter than simulation. If you liked those games, though, I’d still recommend SSZ since the whole space dogfighting genre seems dead and you won’t find better nowadays. SSZ has fluid and intense gameplay with great graphics & music. Voice acting is spotty but not bad.The controls may take a little getting used to but once you master them you’ll feel like a boss in the titular Strike Suit. Spamming your swam missiles has a very Robotech/Macross feel and never gets old. I played this with a Xbox 360 controller for PC and found the controls very tight & responsive. No idea what happened to some other reviewers who say the controls are clunky. They may be trying to play with keyboard & mouse but I learned long ago rule #1 of space shooter games is to bring a joystick or gamepad. The missions have a nice variety and are thrilling to play through. The narrative is pretty solid, too, and keeps you interested in moving along. You get scored on each sortie and can also unlock a particular upgrade if certain optional goals are met. Once you beat a mission, you can replay it using any new fighter craft or weapons you’ve unlocked. Some people complain the missions get repetitive and are impossibly hard. I didn’t find them repetitive and they may be too hard if you don’t get any ship upgrades. I’ll admit I went back & switched the difficulty to easy mode to pick up a few, which is an option for anyone who thinks it’s too hard.Best of all, there are checkpoints inserted into the sometimes lengthy missions. This is a welcome feature since you don’t have to keep replaying the same thirty minutes of a mission over & over again when only the last five minutes are giving you trouble. Checkpoints are frequently placed right at those optional parts required to unlock upgrades which again is very nice since, if you miss the optional goal, you do not have to start the entire mission again from the beginning.SSZ isn’t a perfect game but some reviewers are going overboard on their criticism of it. This space & sci-fi combat genre is one I miss a lot and I’ve had a blast playing this game. If you are a fan of any of the titles I mentioned above, you should definitely pick it up. It feels like a blast from the past & a new experience at the same time.			"

												A good game.It's very simple, a mash up of classic PC sci-fi flightsims like Freespacer as well as arcadey games like Star Fox. In fact, I'd say those specifically. High paced, lots of bloom and explosions as you shread through tons of foes. The game is very mindless - the story is a excuse plot (In a war between EARF and COLONIALS,♥♥♥♥♥♥got real and now it's up to YOU to stop the destruction blah blah) with about four characters in all, but it's not about the story. It's not about being thought out and tactical, it's about you in a super ship that can turn into a robot suit for a limited time and murder everyone in the immediate area. It's about your headphones being a blurr of missile beeps, low energy explosions, objective chatter and explosions all at once.It's also a game that (harmlessly) takes the♥♥♥♥♥♥out on you if you don't meet it's rather the rather strict score requirements of its medals/ranks. (""THOSE♥♥♥♥♥♥EARF PILOTS DIDN'T DO JACK"" vs ""OH JESUS CHRIST."")It's cheap, fun and simple.			"

												One of those Indie games with a not-so-indie look to it. Its an amazing game, despite theres people crying about the ""Counter-intuitive"" controls for the Xbox 360 controller, where you use the Right Trigger for Primary Fire, Right button for Secondary Fire, Left trigger for Faster Throttle, Left button for Break. Theres someone out there who wants the Sholder buttons to be Bank left/right. but dont take in consideration of where other controls map to. The controls are tight and pretty easy to learn, the difficulty keeps you on your toes, and the immersion can only be enhanced more than it already is, with its upcoming support for the Oculus Rift. The soundtrack is great (though i wish it would be a bit more upbeat, otherwise, no complaints), the visuals are amazing, and its a Freespace Shooter/Space Flight Sim. What more could you ask for.

												You got a space ship and you fly and shoot. That's it. There is a story, but it's not very good or long.There are 4 space ships. They get unlocked throughout the missions. You get new weapons the same way.You are always moving forward, but you can slow down a bit when holding S and speed up when holding W. You shoot and aim with mouse. You have armor (your HP basically- depleted means death), thruster (short speed up - the max speed you can achieve) and shield (your second HP bar - it regenerates when not taking damage; depleted means that your armor can be damaged).3 difficulties - easy - should be medium if you ask me; medium - this is hard;  hard - not trying this one. NOPE.This game is hard. They place upgrades behind challenges. You are weak if you dont get the upgrades. You won't be able to progress without them. I am not a fan of these space games so it might be me. When you complete a mission, the game shows you your score and gives you a medal, a new weapon and an upgrade if you have completed the challenge. Weapons and upgrades are not tied to the difficulty, so you can only get them once. However, scores and medals are.I hate the challenges! ""destroy all torpedos shot at the carrier""- you are supposed to defend the ship called The Carrier, but there are small ships shooting at you and the carrier. There are 3 bigger ships shooting regular rockets, missiles and torpedos and then one giant ship shooting multiple torpedos, missiles, rockets at you and the carrier. It's one big cluster♥♥♥♥ of rockets and you are supposed to destroy all of the torpedos and the ships! I have destroyed about 70 torpedos and still ♥♥♥♥in' failed the challenge! Had to switch to Easy to be able to get the upgrade!It's not a bad game but you might wanna put your game-pants on, before playing it. "

												If you’re a space games veteran, you’ll find some things in this game that were taken from other space games. For example, you’ll see the large torpedoes and “no need to dodge” countermeasures from “Starlancer”, you’ll remember the flak cannons and ship beams from “Freespace 2”, and you’ll find a Karan S’jet clone. I believe even the missile types are copied from “FS 2”.What distinguishes this game from the others of its kind is the ability to turn into a mech and fire spread missiles at multiple targets. If you’re a fan of mecha anime, this will be pretty familiar to you. It takes some time to get used to this system. However, once you master it, you’ll be fighting like a real “Macross/Robotech” ace, transforming between mech and fighter in the middle of dogfights.You should be warned that this game is also more arcade-like than usual. No power management, no radar, no shield convergence. When you fly a bomber, you have an infinite amount of torpedoes. When you restart from a checkpoint, you get a full ammo reload and hull repair.The story is pretty basic. Colonials want to destroy Earth and that’s all you know about them. There’s nothing about their ideology or personality. There’s no communications from them whatsoever throughout the game, not even a “Surrender or die!”. Enemy units don’t have names, not even the cruisers and carriers.Mission design is the game’s biggest flaw. When you’re attacking enemy fighters and your flight leader says “ignore the fighters, focus on your objectives”, what she means is “enemy fighters have infinite waves, so don’t bother”. Sometimes you have to take out flak cannons before the bombers come in, sometimes you don’t. Sometimes the objective is to destroy the cruiser, sometimes you have to protect the bombers which will do that for you and it’s mission failed if they get destroyed by those infinite waves of enemy fighters. You’ll see so many enemy ships throughout the campaign, that you’ll wonder if Earth ever had a chance to win the war in the first place. On defense missions, you’ll learn to love checkpoints.It’s a fun game. Looks easy at first and it only gets hard when you start fighting the Black Fleet. When you master the strike suit, you’ll love flying it. However, if you played classics like “FS 2” and the X-wing or “Wing Commander” series, it’s likely that you won’t take this game seriously.For example, when I did the bomber mission and realized I had infinite torpedoes plus a ton of missiles for self-defense, I remembered my experience as a TIE Bomber pilot and the bomber tutorial in “FS 2” and I actually laughed.

												What we have: a space combat game. Do we have much space combat games: No.So go ahead and buy the game, if you like genre.The last space simulation game that I played was the Freelancer. (That's nearly 10 years ago.) Well, this game is not a ""simulation"". We have a pure space combat game here, which will take about 7 to 10 hours to complete. If you want to achieve all the upgrades, then it will probably take more than 20 hours. Battles are solid in this game. Period. Tons of allied and enemy crafts flying around you, explosions, plasmas, beams, all together mixed with beautiful space backgrounds. And you feel like you are controlling a space craft, not a weightless camera. Soundtrack is also surprisingly good and though the story is cliche, it gives a good taste for an arcade game.But don't except Freespace or Freelancer. S.S.Z is clearly a low-budget game than those and focuses only on combat. The ship designs, including the Strike Suit are ugly. Some missions are clearly interesting but somes are very repetitive and so on...You may like the space genre. The last space game you played may be about 10 years old. Maybe you are dying for Star Citizen and want a popcorn along the long way. This game is worth of your money.7.5/10			"

												It's a shame we live in a world where a 65 rating is considered bad and not just average. In light of this, screw Metacritic.SSZ is a straightforward, arcadey space combat game with a twist. Being able to transform into what's essentially a Gundam is a great spin on the genre, and you get a real sense of power when you do; casually swatting away swarms of enemy fighters and missiles like they were nothing. Yet it balances this power with an energy bar of sorts, the more enemies you destroy, the more the it charges, making you swap between the two forms often, which keeps the pace of the action high and stops it from degenerating into constant dogfights.Strike Suit Zero is a pure fun. If you like streamlined, action oriented space games, this is easily one of your best options available. It's a simple beast, but it's also a fast paced, satisfying, and damn good looking game.			"

												Strike Suit Zero is one of the best space simulators to come along for a long time, and is comparable to Freelancer, Homeworld and O.R.B. in terms of enjoyability. While it has striking similarities with Project Sylpheed, it concentrates more on action, fighter-to-fighter dogfights, and smaller realistically-powerful weapon loadouts. The story is somewhat watery, but is a tried and true plot; the interactions with Control (and the A.I. 2.0) are amusing and probably simulate true intelligent and powerful A.I. There is a wide variety of settings for playing the game, and even the mouse and keyboard (for me) worked wonderfully. I would give this a 9, 9.5 maybe out of 10, and would recommend buying this, especially if you can get it on sale, to any lover of space games that aren`t strategy.			"

												Strike Suit Zero is a game that has me completely and utterly engaged in space flight and combat.  I cannot stress enough how fun this game is!  If fast paced frenetic action with a lot of stuff blowing up seems like something you could have fun doing then by all means stop what you are doing and buy this game right now!  I have to say that this game is not for the faint of heart because it will have you moving on from one enemy to the next and then wishing the level didn't end because you had so much fun blowing stuff up.I have only encountered one problem and that I am getting a pretty horrendous screen tearing, even with a Nvidia GeForce 770m.The lack of multiplayer is also a little bit depressing as I would have LOVED to blow freighters and carriers up with my friends and even partake in dogfights in huge strike suits over vast open space.This game needs to be played.  I'm a firm believer in giving this 9/10 because of the price, the arcade action, the visuals of constant explosions, and the amount of insanity on screen.  I only wish it was longer as I'm on the last mission already.			"

												Pretty fun so far, only played it a few times, but the action gets going quickly and takes me back to the days of Descent and Wing Commander. Picked it up on a sweet sale for $5.00 but could have spent $15.00 and not been disappointed. It is pretty basic combat, but several little nuances will make you always want to get just a little bit better. "

												In the nineties space combat was a thing of the present and many series became part of gaming history. Then history apparently decided to move on and the genre has been lain dormant for years. Strike Suit Zero is the debut from indie studio Born Ready Games and gives ample reason for both nostalgia and anticipation.Developers have clearly studied the genre classics but I did not see Strike Suit Zero as mere retro but rather as classicism. All the lessons learned from the past are condensed into a clear, timeless form. There is no extra weight anywhere. No side paths are taken nor excess features added. You can shake and batter the game all you want but nothing will come loose.This principle extends to the writing as well for there is no characterization and virtually no lore. I enjoyed being spared expositions and lore dumps but on the other hand missed the sense of history or touches of everyday life. The game world is elegant and pure but cold, almost metallic, and this will not appeal to everyone.There are thirteen missions in the campaign and most of the criticism towards the game have been directed at the level of difficulty. It has to be said that many missions required complete restarts and in some cases replaying earlier missions for missed upgrades. Whether or not this is a bad thing is up for debate. I enjoyed the challenge and the general mission design where things escalated in a logical fashion. There are typically two checkpoints per mission and restarting from one will restore both hull and ammunition which makes things more manageable. The titular Strike Suit is powerful to say the least but requires skill to master. The missions are so intense and tightly knit that a precise execution of the objectives is always required.For a Kickstarter title I was continually stunned by what I saw and heard. The soundtrack is the equal of any recent sci-fi game and was composed by Paul Ruskay of Homeworld fame. Even better are the fantastic visuals. Seeing the screen lit up by capital ships' beam cannons and dozens of fighters and bombers fighting for survival is spectacular to say the least. The potential for screenshots is great indeed, especially given the various backdrops ranging from misty nebulas to a destroyed planet. Voice actors sound calm and clear throughout and fit the atmosphere admirably. Developers clearly believe in their work and have been very active with the community, posting on the Forums, adding free mod tools and patching as needed. Given the fact no one can jump out of themself and think as a bodiless ghost objectivity is a hard thing to achieve. Accordingly I cannot say how Strike Suit Zero would feel for those unfamiliar with the genre. On one hand the game almost expected that I already knew space combat beforehand. Weapon and targeting systems seemed familiar and so did the process of supporting capital ships in major engagements, et cetera. On the other hand there are no serious post-millennial competitors out there at the moment. Strike Suit Zero is like space in more ways than one: cold but beautiful in a way that appealed to my personal tastes very much indeed and will more than likely do the same for anyone wanting to embrace the void for the duration of this gaming experience.

Not real percise movements.  I guess with some tweeking that could be improved.  But I didn't bother.  There just isn't enough appeal there for my taste.  However, I didn't feel too much remorse having Steam Deleting it from my library the day after I bought it.  But at least this game didn't suck as bad as Vector Thrust.

Joystick users apparently dont have any problems with this mission but mouse and keyboard users find it next to impossible to navigate. Also its the absolute worst final mission of any game that I have ever played. Real letdown after the enjoyment of fighting 4 cruisers in a strike suit.			"

												Quick Summary: Strike Suit Zero is like a slightly inferior version of Freespace 2, but still a good game. You also have the option of transforming into an♥♥♥♥♥kicking space robot, so that’s a plus.About 300 years in the future, mankind receives a signal containing instructions on space travel, leading to a glorious age of exploration and colonization. Of course nothing good lasts and the Colonies eventually want independence from the United Nations of Earth (UNE). Things come to a head with the discovery of alien technology that massively tips the scales in favor of the Colonies. Too bad you play a pilot for the UNE so you’ve got your work cut out for you.Strike Suit Zero starts off as a space fighter simulator game very similar to Freespace, but with less weapon and ship customization and you’re not the “squad leader” so you can’t order your teammates around or call for support. Your ship has guns and missiles for weapons, and shields + EMP for defense. The EMP is like a flare that you fire off right before a missile hits you to deflect it. Some of your missiles have lock-on capability and are good against fighter craft, while others may be dumb fire and be good for hitting large slow capital ships. Yes, the capital ships have turrets and weak points that you can destroy to keep them from chewing up you and your teammates. A few levels into the game you gain access to the Strike Suit, a prototype fighter with the ability to transform into a humanoid robot with superior weapons after gathering enough “flux.” You gain flux from killing fighters or shooting turrets off of the larger enemies. Think of it as a kind of hyper meter that you constantly gain and spend by transforming into the strike suit and firing your weapons. In strike mode your main gun becomes like a flak cannon (moderate damage but auto-aiming) and your missile weapon becomes a super-fast lock-on homing missile that can acquire large numbers of targets before firing (with infinite ammo). Basically if you have to wipe out waves of enemy fighters, switch to strike suit mode and just spray them dead.Pros:+I like space fighter games where you fight large enemies mounted with large numbers of destructible turrets. With patience and accuracy your fighter can take down corvettes, frigates, cruisers, and even carriers.+Some nice music to blast your enemies to.Cons:-The story is mediocre-You need to have the game’s DLC to get about half of the game’s steam achievements.Overall the game is fun and actually less difficult that it seems. I played Strike Suit Infinity first and got my♥♥♥♥♥kicked. I should have started with Strike Suit Zero since this game actually has a story and slowly ramps up the difficulty. "

												Pros:1. Fun space/flight shooting with flashy effects2. Overall very smooth3. Not very hardware-taxing (old game, of course)4. MACROSS MISSILE MASSCAREEEEEEEE (when in strike mode of course)5. Implemtation of transforming like Macross/Zeta Gundam allows stationary firing in a dog fight which is interesting to play with6. Controls are easy and to-pointWanted improvements (tho Born-Ready is gone so i doubt if it will be fixed at all)1. Sometimes doesn't hit objects even you visually saw it hitting head-on, probably a hitbox bug or sth2. Multiplayer is completely absentCons:1. Plain♥♥♥♥♥storyboard - sorta like Gundam 1-year-war, except no enemy characters are seen and essentially has no plot whatsoever, which really hurts a mecha-based game (and no improvements were seen in Director's Cut). Characters also sometimes doesn't make a lot of sense over the course of the story, although this is circumvented in Director's Cut where most characters were given backstories, have more emotion express, but still overall not good2. Bland voice actor/actresses - The blandness of characters are further worsened by the voice acting which is also as bland as hell. Probably a result of plain storyboard and non-professional voice actors, causing extremely tense fighting like Part 12 doesn't sound right when Raymond doesn't sound too concerned about the large numbers of enemies. Circumvented in Director's Cut where most character's (especially Raymond's) voice are more expressive and coped with the situation3. Last chapter is really a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to play with - I mean with all the fightings you've experienced in 1-12, you suddenely end up piloting the fighter in tubes of flashing light, which makes already-hard-as-hell navigation and piloting extremely difficult, especially when you are already used to the broad space you've been with.Overall a good game tho, recommended despite the flaws in the game.

It has decent replay value. Just REALLY wish they didn't have that utter crap final mission.			"

												This game is OK.  The redeeming aspect of it is the gameplay, which is as good as you can find right now for a space sim.  It's fun and engaging, and both fighter and strike suit modes offer different forms of gameplay gratification.  The graphics are pretty good (with exception to their implementation of intergalactic warp speed which is just a tacky visual distortion effect).  Production value on this game is quite limited, but this is an indie game from a small studio with more limited resources, so I can overlook things like poor voice acting and purely text-based mission briefs.  The video demonstrations of your weapon options from the loadout screen is a nice touch though.Unfortunately, the story is worthless.  It's completely unengaging and doesn't do anything to build out any of the personalities the game tries to expose you to.  The plot and characters are all derivatives of implementations from classic games from this genre, but here they're combined into a rather formless blob that fails to really compel you to care about anything going on in the game's universe.  The missions are all artificially longer than they need to be, and only support checkpoints.  The difficulty is inconsistent from mission to mission, and the controls have a rather substantial learning curve due to them not using any previously established standard for flight controls in favor of developing one of their own.  Team AI also seems to be lacking and all too often it's up to you to destroy the overwhelming majority of enemies in order to ensure mission objectives are completed.  As a game that was inspired by the likes of the Elite series and Freelancer among others, the fact that this game has an exclusively linear mission schedule is a bit disappointing as well.  While overall SSZ has more bad things going on than good ones, by playing the game you actually spend more time engaged with what works in the game than what doesn't.  I feel an apt comparison for this game would be Square's Project Sylpheed, which has nearly identical flaws, but substantially worse flight mechanics.  SSZ would be best described as a better version of that game.			"

You should pass up this version for the directors cut (which has more content, better visuals and a more interesting plot).

												While not on the same level as my personal all time favorite Freespace 2 (both in terms of gameplay and story), Strike Suit Zero manages to deliver an unique mix of dog-fight in fighter mode as well as over the top action when turning into mecha mode. I do not regret buying this.			"

												I highly recommend this game!It may not be worth 20$ but if you wait for a sale its great! This face-paced highly explosive space fighter game is really exciting. The levels are a tad repetitive but other than that the game is fun. Although not revolutionary the strike suit offers a bit more strategy, it looks good and has a odd yet fitting techno-jazz soundtrack.I found the controls on the keyboard mangable but diffcult. Also the game should have a multiplayer.It has a few flaws but other than that a fun game to play.			"

												Strike Suit Zero is excellent, though to reach it's full potential I find that a controller or joystick is best.The combat is it's strength. Combat is SSZ is fun, first and foremost. The game does an excellent job of providing a degree of power fantasy while still giving a good challenge.Graphics are phenomenal. It's a cinematic game to say the least. Not all the designs are the most original (the main fighter looks like a Terran Sabre from X3:TC), but I didn't notice anything deliberately stolen, and there's nice variety.The plot is mostly a device for getting from one place to one place where you feel like a badass or get your♥♥♥♥♥♥wrecked to another place where you do more of the same.I would note, the Director's edition fixed my main complaint of *giving* me the shiny new death machine, but then not letting me *use* it half the time.In any case, I enjoyed the game thoroughly. I recommend the DLC as well.			"

												Strike Suit Zero (SSZ) is a frustatingly beautiful game; the personification of a game with excellent gameplay marred by horrible enemy variation and an outlandish story. You are a pilot of a fleet taking off to exterminate an alien threat. The game's namesake ship however isn't even obtainable until the third mission - and even then you are charged with taking other ships such as the interceptor (a variation on the starting ship) and a bomber (which was actually pretty cool to operate). The aspect of the game that makes it most difficult is the combat: I want frentic warfare - not a jumbled mess. The dogfights are engaging if only for a moment; taking down capitol ships is an exercise in bullet/missle-sponges; and using the strike suit is like drunkingly blasting ships. Plus it leaves you more vulnerable to attacks - which makes no sense because you have to garner flux to use it and equipping (transforming) the suit should make you more of a bad♥♥♥♥♥ Instead it makes you a sitting duck that relies on wobbly shooting (granted, lock-on firing is available). The story actually has a good conclusion but everything before it is wonky. At some random point there is a grand coupe de tat that is massively overlooked because you are too busy trying to master the controls to even pay attention to the dialogue.The game's greatest weakness is that it doesn't flaunt the suit! Let me free fly with this piece of machinery. Make it more controllable. Make it worth garnering flux! Sadly, the game falls flat for me, and beating it was a months-long mission whose only vincidation of knocking off one more game off my protruberent Steam library.			"

												So let me begin by saying: If you enjoyed the space combat in ""Freelancer"" you'll probably slide right into this without a hitch.I did enjoy freelancer a lot, but the combat wasn't the only thing in the game. So that's where the similarities end. Strike Suit Zero is entirely combat missions. That's it.Shoot the baddies in space, fulfill the requirements and get an upgrade to your ship's stats (which really don't seem that noticable, max ranked shields feel about as sturdy as rank 1) and as you check off missions in the list you will get new weapons.There really isn't any customization, and upgrades aren't that big a deal. Some ""upgrades"" come with a cost, such as using up more energy for a better gun... but you can't really upgrade your energy -on demand- so you're going to choke after firing 5 or six shots.You have about four ships to choose from barring the purchase of any DLC (Strike suit- is butts outside of strike mode, Fighter- basic ship, more boolets/missiles than strike suit's basic mode, Interceptor - a little mosquito, Bomber - infinite slow as dirt torpedos, fires ping pong balls for bullets, decent amt of missiles)The eponymous ""Strike Suit"" only becomes available after three missions of flying a basic little fighter craft around, and comes with it's own kind of annoying mechanic: a ""Flux energy"" bar, which is powered up by blowing crap up, You can then expend this flux energy to go into Strike mode: a robot suit, instead of pursuit mode which is your base crappy ship which has less armaments than the starter fighter ship. Strike mode lets you actually start killing things and operates like a dream. Really they should give you some kind of option to play with an infinite flux bar, because the strike suit is basically where all the fun lives. You can instantly track targets with a press of a button, you fire cool dancing missiles that wreck enemies, and you can -STOP MOVING- which is probably the MOST IMPORTANT PART OF STRIKE MODE. If i could put my ship engines on full stop the way strike mode can hold position, I WOULD.Strafing runs are crap, but all the ships except the strike-moded, flux using strikesuit, are forced to do strafing runs and it is garbage. In Freelancer you could -gasp- STOP YOUR SHIP and sit there FIRING AT THINGS. It even comes with it's own built in downside so you don't need to balance it with ""stop fuel"" or something ridiculous, because YES you're a sitting duck BUT you can focus fire those annoying stationary battlecruiser turrets and such.There are a LOT of stationary targets you're expected to either burn all your flux energy on or do a zillion strafing runs at.Graphically it FEELS like everything is at 1/2 scale. Like I'm playing with minatures or something. enemy ship models could stand to be increased in size by about 1.5x to 2x.Really if there was a way to use points from missions to upgrade my ships further (add more guns to the underpowered pursuit mode of the strike suit) a button to mash for -FULL STOP- on any ship so you could sit and fire like a turret at a stationary target, and a few more weapon options (energy missiles, some kind of missile without ammo aside from flux) this might just scratch all my space ship itches. Is the tagline ""Space combat reborn"" accurate? No, it's freelancer style space combat without some of the key moves (cut engines & drift, stop) and without any real customization (you get a energy gun, a machine gun, and pick a missile type.)As it stands, Strike suit zero isn't a bad game for what it is: a short space combat mission-y romp.Is it worth the current asking price of 20 bucks? Ehhh... Get it on sale/bundled or something, there's not that many missions.			"

												I'm confused by all the good reviews for this game. Sure, the graphics look nice, but the controls! Oh, the controls! I got fed up right after the initial training segment.I tried using an Xbox 360 controller as well as keyboard and mouse and, even with customizations, I couldn't get comfortable. The problem is that the left\right movement doesn't behave like you'd expect. You would expect the you'd go left when pressing left and right when pressing right, but your ship goes into more of a barrel roll which leaves you upside down and completely disoriented. I know this is in outer space so it won't control like, say, StarFox, but I have to believe there was a better way to do these controls than this.If you are willing to suffer through this, or somehow manage to get comfortable with the controls, then I'm sure you could have fun. If you are looking for a good shooter that you can jump into and start having fun, look elsewhere.			"

There's no effort in building any kind of drive outside of 'there's the bad guys and their ships are red, kill 'em.'Guns shoot and kills as they should, that's their job after all. The idea of a gundam starfighter just blows me away, this is the most fun I've had in an aircraft game.The later levels are obnoxiously long, and there are no save game slots for during missions. Either you beat the level and wait ten minutes for the next one to start, or you die and wait five minutes for the level to restart.This game is broken in comparision to Strike Suit Infinity, Zero being not worth the effort to beat. 5 out of 10 stars			"

												Not bad. Looks really good visually, unique soundtrack, and the combat is pretty good, but there isn't much to it. The campaign feels sort of generic although the ship design is cool. Overall it feels like it would be a killer multiplayer game and the lack of multiplayer kind of wasted its potential for me. The Linux support is really nice, I haven't had any problems with it. (Tried it on both Intel HD 4000 and Nvidia GTX 770 graphics.)			"

												If you watch the trailer, and stopped for a second to think ""wow this game looks pretty good"" you should stop right there and buy it. Personally, its brilliant - combat is fast and frantic, dogfights against impossible odds have you diving, rolling, and charging - guns blazing - around the map. Thats not to say combat is easy. There are moments when piloting elegantly and unleashing the variety of weapons in your arsenal becomes extremely difficult - and this is completely forgetting about the ability to rapid transform into a flying combat mech that can wipe out entire fleets with missile barrages and cannon fire while dodging incoming missiles.Cons of the game? No free play, just campaign. Lack of enemy units. Enemy units prefer to use swarm tactics to beat you - individual fighters have no combat skill. But the pros of the game outweigh its cons by far. Get the game, if you like games like this.			"

												Star Lancer was the best $5 I spent. My friend and I came across it at EB games about 10 years ago.This game is not quite like Star Lancer, but close enough. A must buy for space combat lovers. Doesn't have the feel of really changing your ship around and really going in on missions with a ""What the hell will happen?"" attitude, but like I said, close enoguh.Get it, and if it's on sale, YOU BETTER BUY IT.

												It's a really aweome game up until the last 2 missions (which are so annoying imo). The controls are very good (for the most part), you can't strafe, and when you run into a big ship you instantly lose all your shielding even if you just barely graze/fly close but not touch. Beyond those, I'm willing to recommend it for anyone who's interested in a Space arcade game.			"

												Я люблю космосимы. Люблю и аркадные и не очень. Но это полная хрень. Скриптовая мыльная опера с картонными персонажами-клише и стандартным героическим сюжетом ""плохие напали на хороших и почти убили их, но почему-то не добили, и хорошие начинают ногебать, хотя почему-то только что сливали"". Игровой процесс сводится к переключению на ближайшую цель/торпеду и стрельбу в ""точку гарантированного попадания"". Единственное, что реально круто - саундтрек. Это по большому счёту единственное, за что игру можно купить. Играть при этом не обязательно.I love space simulators both arcade and sim, but this one is total rubbish. Standart fancy graphics, standart prescripted missions, standart ""good vs evil"" plot, and standart console action ""switch to nearest enemy-fire till it blows up-repeat"" game process. The one and only real bright side of this game - gorgeous soundtrack. It worth to wait for a sale and buy with soundtrack DLC. Playing isn't necessary.			"

												(It is difficult to get the required 5 minutes of play time to post a review when a game doesn't launch)This developer failed to test their in Steam under all platforms they claim to support. Had they done so, they would have known the game segfaults and crashes before releasing it. This has been a known issue since August 2013, and yet they still claim to support Linux.After contacting support for the game, the only reply I got an automated message stating that they had recieved my email. Steam was nice enough to refund my purchase to my Steam Wallet, even though this, according to their EULA, they don't do. But, if you're a game developer, and don't respond to customer support questionts, then you really have no business selling games to begin with.			"

												So... it's a starfighter that transforms into a Gundam suit. Spaceship shaped like a person is still the dumbest idea ever (yes, even dumber than the double-decker couch). In addition to being a stupid idea (seriously; why does a spaceship need legs? They don't do anything), it's poorly executed.The first three missions of SSZ are solid. Great game. It's freelancer with a bit of a facelift and no trading business to distract from the action. Then you actually get the Strike Suit and the game becomes unbearable. On top of the absolutely useless targeting system, the redundant (and pointless) HUD elements and lack of control customization, controlling this thing is just an absolute mess.Yes, they finally patched-in the ability to re-map the controls but not all of them. Dodge is still hard-bound to ""double-tap a movement key."" So when I have all my movement bound to proper control axes, dodge is physically impossible. I can't ""double-tap"" my flightstick to the left. Also: the Strike Suit can't roll.Bottom line: consolized beyond playability. Not a PC game. Absolutely do not buy. Whatever you want this to be, you probably want it to have the basic requirements of playable one expects in a PC game, which it doesn't have.			"

												Strike Suit Zero seems like a good game. It has pretty backdrops, some fun and exciting music, and the promise of a robotic mech spaceship to annihilate enemies. But the gameplay is so frustrating that playing it is a chore, and a frustrating one at that.The basics combat system is good enough. It's fairly easy to get the hang of picking off enemies and sending missiles in every direction. In fact, Strike Suit Zero feels the best when it has you fighting against dozens of enemy fighters, honing in on enemies to build up to the moment where you can transform and unleash hell. But that's a small part of the game. At least 50% of the game is attacking larger stationary ships, taking out cargo, or blowing up turrets, all of which is so boring or frustrating that it brings down the little bit of fun the dogfights provide. To make matters worse, there is a constant barrage of turrets, cannons, and other non-evadable damage that not only steadily drains health but keeps the screen in a disorienting panic that's less exhilirating than it is confusing. Many missions, especially the incredibly tedious ones that involve picking off every turret from a large cruiser, turned into me going for an attack, then flying aimlessly while my shield recharged before trying again. Rinse lather repeat.If you're looking for your fill of space dogfighting, I don't think Strike Suit Zero is your best bet. There are many older games, and even some very recent ones that are starting to fill that hole better. If you're dedicated to playing every space game out there, you'll probably have fun with it, but otherwise I'd sit this one out.			"

												This game feels like a generic space shooter. It is like Freelancer except that you can't go wherever you want, and you can't take the missions you want. I was looking forward to using the strike suit, but that is also disappointing. In strike suit mode all you get is more damage to your normal guns, missile spamming abilities, auto-aim (if you want it), and the ability to dodge incoming attacks. Dodging in strike suit mode actually seems less effective against missiles than using the deflect ability in normal flight mode :(.  Strike suit mode also runs out very quickly when you try to use a lot of missiles, and then you are just back to normal flight mode. Most of the levels are just fighting waves of enemies and blowing up large carrier space ships, which gets old fast. The final level feels like it is trying to be more like Star Fox and it doesn’t work out. There are no enemies, and you just navigate through tight corridors. This game isn’t worth your money.			"

The free aiming is terrible, but no worries, you can be cheap and spam lock on rockets -- but it's very unrewarding to do so.

This is why:Unskippable expository dialogueBad voice actingGrinding tutorial missionsYou don't touch a transformable mech until a-while in (I got up to the third mission and just gave up)Rinse and repeat dogfightsHOLY GOD WHO DOES ESCORT/DEFEND THE OBJECTIVE MISSIONS IN THIS DAY AND AGE?It just wore me down playing it, it suffers the same problem Dark Void had for me: don't put your main gameplay feature behind a wall of grindy tutorial nonsense. And from what other reviews say, even that doesn't hold up...			"

												This is game starts so slow that my negative review is a must for this title. Low energy all the time, you cannot shoot and kill because you always are low on energy. So basically the game is totally wasted because developers put little thought into it. Bad decisions, do not buy this pathethic game.			"

												Cheesy interaction.  Poor controls. The game is pretty, however there are too many enemies in each mission and too many colorful distractions. Clunky controls.. It is difficult to keep my interest. I tired of the game after only 10 min. but i gave it another hour, game never picked up the pace.  No sense of exploration or purpose in this game. 4/10.			"

												Great game that is realy fun and can challenge your spacial reasoning a little.  Don't buy it expecting to find a long and complicated story line, what you will find is a nice game that is very mechanics based, with little focus on the story, but hey, if you were looking for a story, you would go read a book.  The perfect solution to several hours of boredom.  HOWEVER, I would recomend that you buy the director's cut, as it has the DLC built in, and it is (at the time of writing this) the same price.			"

												Here's the thing. There are 2 things gamers hate most in games that are properly programmed. 1. Underwater missions. 2. Defense/Escort Missions where the allies or Defense objective are useless.This game may not have underwater levels, but it definitely has Defense missions. I really cant stand it. Combined with the control sceme that just isn't conductive to it's main draw ""The Flux mode"" I can't really suggest people play this game.			"

												Strike Suit Zero is a game weighed down by difficult mechanics and a predictable and lazy storyline. Strike Suit controls are goofy and despite being a ""sim"", feels more like an arcade shooter. The visuals are bright and pretty, but feel out of place and uninspired in the context of total war. It's only an indie game, but a game's a game.			"

												You will only find the targeted missles useful, unless ur dealing with relatively stationaly items, you are guaranteed to miss (and thats where the targeted missles come in), but don't waste them, you only get a certain number for the ENTIRE mission, not one section, the ENTIRE thing. Don't waste your ammo, you dont want to be running around with no ammo, however, you do have to kill quite a few ships or you will fail, so the the question is: when does the mission end?			"

												Ok I've been playing this for the better part of an hour and I have to say I kinda want my money back even though it was on sale . Dont get me wrong love the games that it gets it inspiration from HomeWorld(come on Homeworld 3), Freelancer, Gundum,.etc, but for me the conrols are very sensitive even when turned all the way down. I could never really get a clean shot on any of the enemies. It felt like i was just getting lucky and destroying stuff becuse the computer decided to fly in a straight line to give me a shot. The mouse should not have been used to steer the ship if you move the mouse too far it will fling you in a hard turn that is hard to come out of. Its almost like the made it so you would have to buy a game pad, but i dont want to have to go out and get one of those just to enjoy this game. A and D only roll the ship i would like to change it so that it turned the ship and the mouse just controled the orientation of the targeting recticle. The game is very good looking from what I have been playing so far it reminds me of Zone of the Enders but just a tad bit slower. Visually it is spot on good explosions if you just happen to be a little to close the the ship that is being destroyed than they are a little too bright. Some of the background elements are great some of them i want to have as a background on my desktop. For now i am going to uninstall it I may get a flight stick to play it properly becsuse it is a little wierd with a mouse and keyboard. So I recommend it if you have a flight stick if you dont and still want to give it a go then i recommend putting the mouse sensativity on low settings that way you will be able to keep up with your enemies in the game and you wont zip past them. And with a flight stick im expecting this to be like Ace Combat.			"

The controls take some getting used to especially once you get to the strike suit itself (which is also the most fun), but once you got those, you'll have tons of fun slaughtering hordes of fighters and bringing down capital ships.My only critiscism so far is the lack of explanation on weak points on capital ships, which is done in Strike suit infinity and I only played that after I finished Zero.

												Battle mechanism might be difficult at first, but once you get the hang of it and get your 'strike suit', your mind is literally blown. It was as if I was 'Kira' from 'Gundam Seed' shooting 40 missiles at different targets at the same time. Action is great, story is okay, but I disliked the way I had to play all over again from the check point if I die or fail mission. This might not be a problem if there were many check points, but apparently there aren't many check points in this game :( Personally, it was a great experience for me playing this game so far.			"

I was expecting a longer story line but like a lot of the good one season anime it accomplished what it set out to do in the lenght of the game.			"

												It's like someone took the space battles from Star Wars Battlefront 2 and just mixed in a hell of a lot of Japanese mech stuff and then decided to make a game out of it. Not as bad as it seems suprisingly. Be warned however, Does contain missions so long that you may literally just start banging your head against a wall instead as it is more spontaneous and interesting than whatever the missions is still doing after 20 bloody minutes of not changing.10/10 would MISSLES MISSLES MISSLES MISSLES again.

												If you love Macross, Gundam, or other mecha related nostalgia, then you'll find yourself falling in love with this game. Wonderful art & design, as well as a pleaseing sound track are more than enough reasons to get this game. Of course, it is rather difficult to enjoy those parts of the game because you'll find yourself failing that one mission over, and over, and over again. Yes, the learning curve for this game is rather steep. The controls and the gameplay feel like what it would be if Ace Combat and Armored Core had a baby. But much like Ace Combat and Armored Core, once you get used to the controls, this game finally offers the experience of what it feels like to be a main character from your nostalgic mecha anime. Unless you're me, in which case you'll still feel like a grunt in this really good mecha..			"

												The first 5 levels leave you in some largely undesigned fighter ships that are purely there to juxtapose the power of the titular vehicle, the Strike Suit. A mission at the most would have done as you grind through these initial taste testing stages, recieving increasingly bitter doses of the non-newtonian flight model & utterly insufferable tutorial/introductory stages that will put many people off the rest of what eventually transforms into a robust space paint-select-missile-em-up.Despite these minor flaws, Strike Suit Zero still manages to pull through as an enjoyable few hours experience, and the incentive to top the leaderboards could keep the more neckbearded space pilots hooked for longer.8/10			"

												A solid arcade style space combat simulator with respectable graphics, great gameplay, and a great soundtrack.  If you're a fan of space combat flight simulators and a fan of mecha, this will be your cup of tea.  If you're looking for the hardcore, unbridled space fighter simulations of old reborn, this isn't quite there, but it's a good start to revitalize interest in the genre.  Still, this game is fun and presents a fair challenge.Controls are responsive and defaults are well planned out for keyboard/mouse users.  A few different classes of fighters, each with a customizable loadout of weapons you unlock as the game progresses are available, though most of the non strike-suit ones are one offs for particular missions (but they are selectable in others once you complete the mission in question.)  Going into strike suit mode is very reminicent of classic mecha anime where you can heavily damage or eradicate many of your enemies in one fell swoop if you're good enough, a bonus for mecha anime fans of series such as Gundam and Robotech.It's fairly short, but for the price, it's a good experience.

												really cool space war game. The mecha action is there but very limited bursts like around 10 seconds until you are out of flux and then you have to be in ship mode for the other 95% of the game. I guess they do that because in mech mode you are extremely powerful and can easily wipe out half the guns on a cruiser or take out corvettes with ease while side stepping gunfire. But don't let the beautiful space scenery fool you though, you will hardly have any time to enjoy it and only during the beginning of the mission. Within seconds you'll be under heavy fire from fighters and warships and you do your best to stay alive while trying to attack. But if you do want beautiful scenery while cruising space then SSZ isn't for you. There is no cruise control! only full on attack!			"

												I'm veeeeery mixed about this game. I love its combat and the fact you feel as though the fights you are fighting are of something bigger in the level. You aren't the main focus. The ship design is awesome and the various weaponry are amazing. The one big flaw with this game, and I cannot stress tis enough, is its controls. It is very difficult to play this game with keyboard and mouse. Where does tis shine? The last level!Strike Suit Zero is an amazing open space dogfighting game. There is no denying this. However, when the last level takes EVERYTHING you have been doing in the former 12 levels (The very open space for movement and maneuvers) and throws it away. Instead, you get one of those precision and closed space levels where your ship is carefully navigating the relics NARROW, LINEAR spaces. Not the open place you have been fighting for all of the game. I would not have minded this if the controls were changed... But they aren't. You play as though you are in that open space. The controls are still either super touchy or not touchy enough in this level.It simply bad level design. Adding to this is the fact you have 10 MINUTES to complete the level. It sounds like enough, right? Not in this level. The corridors are long and the time getting to the core takes up about half the allotted time, more if you are trying to be careful. Bumping the walls WILL immediately drain your shields. You will die a lot. If this level were different, I would have loved every aspect of this game. However, I cannot beat the last level because everything I did in the former levels meant nothing. This game demanded precision in a game where it is not necesary.If you want to get this game, I recommend you do it... If it's on sale. If you are on PC, I would recommend Strike Suit Infinity if you want a fun game like this one, but without the story.			"

												I've only got a few hours on record, and only made it to the fourth mission. Considering I got this on sale for $5 I'm as happy as could be! This is the first space combat sim I've found that feels really authentic, where aggressive posturing, liberal use of secondaries, and strong piloting skills make a real difference. Getting your first mech is friggin awesome, though it is difficult to control.Controls for the game have me a little worried. I'm using a Kinobo Playstation USB controller that I've mapped for the game specifically. It kinda feels necessary to make it work given the high number of controls you really want to have access to at your fingertips, especially given that the difference between your fighter controls and mech controls is very noticable and you need to be able to move between either without blinking. Mouse and keyboard might be able to make it work, but it feels like a bit of a gamble. Investing in a controler is definitely worthwhile.			"

												SSZ is a mixed bag - great graphics, an absolutely stunning soundtrack by Paul Ruskay but unfortunately the gameplay is a bit uneven sometimes. While most of the missions are fun enough and the bright explosions keep you happy enough, some of the later missions are real stinkers and just frustrating without any redeeming qualities. The story is somewhat lackluster as well.Overall, this is a decent game if you look for a pretty, short-term space shooter fix. Don't expect it to keep you busy for a long time though.			"

												While this isn't a bad game it sure ain't a great one.  Probably my biggest complaint of this game is the gameplay.  It just felt like a slightly improved Battlefront 2 space battles.  Probably the only cool component of gameplay was the Strike Suit (which you dont even get until a hour in).  Another thing that ruined the game for me was the missions.  They were way too long and generic.  It was go kill these invaders...oh look more of them go kill them too.  The story to go along with it was alright but nothing too special.  The graphics were great for an indie game.  The ship graphics were okay, but the backgrounds (space and planets) were awesome.  Probably the best thing about this game was the soundtrack.  I usually don't even think about the soundtrack when playing games but this one was different, its amazing. Too bad the game wasn't on par with the soundtrack.			"

												Move along, you've played this game before.If you've ever had a story about humans colonizing space, you know this plot.If you've ever played any space shooter at all, you've played this game.In fact you know what? Just go download Freespace 2. Download the launcher, it'll come with mods that will have the same graphics as this game. The plot will be a little more interesting and the controls will feel more like you are actually controlling a space ship.I've only played through the first mission, but it's so boring I can't get to the second one.If you've never played a space shooter and know very little sci-fi, this game is for you! There is nothing specifically wrong with it. It's just meh.			"

												If you like mecha anime like Macross Frontier, play this game.In it's normal mode, the fighter combat is pretty solid although most weapons feel like pea-shooters.However despite what some say, I feel that the game's a bit too easy on the normal difficulties. In fact, most of the time I end up dying due to rubbing my hull against an enemy ship than from enemy fire. Another complaint is that the controls for the space-mecha mode are broken to the point in which you can basically give up on manually aiming. I end up selecting my target beforehand and hit-and-running my target into submission.Despite it's flaws, it's a really solid game. I throughly enjoyed it and I would recommend you buy it.			"

												Strike Suit Zero is generally an OK game. The gameplay is fun and exciting, I mean, YOUR FLYING IN SPACE, but some moments are rather boring, and the mechanics can be a bit irritable a lot of the time. It's worth getting the game if you have a lot of time and/or money, but other than that it's not the best game out there.			"

												This game tries to hard to be the next Zone of the Enders... But falls flat on the execution. While the idea of changing between fighter and suit modes are interesting, it still feels limited on what you can actually do. Enemies are another issue where there are a few types of fighters and then larger ships that you go up against but.. Beyond the corvets going down to suit-mode missiles or just taking a long time doing strafing runs with your normal weapons, the frigate and cruser enemies just have a load of gun hardpoints that don't actualy factor into the enemy ship's health and it takes ages trying to kill them on your own.. Which, while you have NPC help, oftentimes it feels like they're just there to make pretty explosions around you. And remember the cool bosses that ZoE had? Like that giant sphere Zakat! Nothing like that here unless it's at the very last level... Which I honestly can't be bothered with getting past chapter 10 of 13. Honestly, it's a good basis but it doesn't capture the same fast and frenetic feel that you might be looking for as from the ZoE series. On those grounds, I can't reccomend this title			"

												the game gets repetitive pretty fast. jump in, destroy fighters, destroy torpedos, destroy turret/supply, end mission.I read the other reviews saying just the same about the repetitve mission design, but I never thought it could be that boring.the games jumps from battle to battle with absolutely no time in between. the story is dull and not even worth following.the voice acting is bad. for example: a captain of a capital ship reports with a stoic, bored voice that the hull has been breached and the life support is failing, then the ship explodes.the skybox and the visual effects are nice, the ships have low resolution textures and look pretty uninspired.the tranformation into the mech feels completely unneccesary. IMO worth about 5 bucks.			"

												At first this looks like a good space fighter sim with some Zone of the Ender mechanics, but man did they ever get it wrong. Whoever did the game balance doesn't know what they're doing. Maybe they used to make board games? I'm not sure. But the regular ship takes forever to build up one volley of shots. This means taking out 20 fighters (a common objective in the first 3 missions) can take about 20 minutes. Why would they do that? Restrictions are fun! Let's restrict everything!Like the Strike Suit. You'd think, ""okay, cool robot form that's even in the game title: Of course you should be able to change that whenever you like, right?"" Wrong. You have to destroy debris and enemy fighters to 'power it'. How does that even make sense? Shooting in the Strike Suit turns into Motion Blurr City, which is extremely laggy. There's also no lead targets in Strike Suit mode, so good luck hitting anything with primary fire. The suit itself seems terribly underwhelming. Its best attack when you first get it is a volley of missiles. Not very exiting, and doesn't make you feel powerful.The game was advertised when it came out as if this was a successor to the Zone of the Enders series. No. Its just a cheap powerup gimmick in a space sim with a standard engine (think Star Wars: Star Fighter on the PS2, but not as easy to control or as intuitive). The balance is abismal. The story seems interesting, but every time you think a level is going to end you get ""wait, we've got 50 more fighters inbound"" and it just makes me sigh. I gave up after 10 minutes of the Strike Suit being seeming utterly useless and unable to kill even one turret on an enemy frigate.Maybe I'll come back to it one day and find out something I missed, but man does this game make me want to cry. Look at my name. How disappointed do you think I am?			"

												Everything about this game just misses the mark for me.. Graphics, gameplay and the controls in particular. The space combat can be fun however it can get a little tedious and frustrating (for me in particular, being an angry gamer) at times.. All these problems all just combine for an average space combat sim in my opinion. Also the game itself honestly is not good enough to be compared to other games of its genre specifically in ways of visual appeal/graphics, after all isn't space meant to be a ""beautiful enigma""?.. e.g Star Conflict is free to play (although some things must be payed for) however the controls and visuals are far superior than SSZ and for me (Star Conflict) ""destroys"" SSZ in the field of which SSZ professes to be the best at: Combat.. Strike Suit Zero has a good story and can be entertaining at points however those are the only positives I can state about this game.. If you are to get this game.. get it on sale.. P.S: This is my opinion don't rage at me if I don't have the same viewpoint as you.			"

												I love flying shooters, from arcade style sideways shooters to planes and everything in between. From all the space shooters I have played this one is the worst. The game looks pretty, has great music, and seems to have a decent story, but the controls and everything in between are terrible. With a controller the flying is on the right thumbstick, Not sure who thought that was a great idea but let that set the stage for the rest of the crap playability. The dialog is so low its practically muted, meaning you need to crawl through setting until you adjust the audio to where you can hear it.  This game is a classic case of how developers build a world but are clueless about making it enjoyable for players, from the audio, to controls, to the junk ship you ship, this game is a waste of space.  Gameplay fatal flaws:Also being a 3D shooter, there is no distance to target over the lockon icon for the enemy you are tracking, and their so small but the icon stays the same size its impossible to tell when their right on top of you.  There is a distance thing with a picture in the lower left but I cant look at that while chasing these  mosquito enemies.The enemies suffer from the syndrome of them flying all over like their hopped on drugs with no pattern or logic to what their doing.  Its like those sniper games where for no reason enemies run back and forth in place while sniping you from across the map with their guns while you with a sniper rifle are helpess. Your ship is soooOOooo slow until you beat the mission and unlock the other ships.  HEY DEVS! how about just making it fun to begin with?  Picture a Volkswagen bug chasing a Ferrari and you get this game. This is a game where there are other ships but you cant access them until you beat a map, which means playing the crap way then later hey you can have fun, no thanks, your game sucks. The nail in the coffin for me was the shooting mechanics, to fire a missle its right bumper meaning you must stop firing your machine guns to fire a missle.  What modern plane would be designed so terribly that only one weapon works at a time, this is the future right, I mean their in space.   Rating: 0/10 Value: $0.00			"

You can complete three large objectives and still be thrown right into the first bit of the level again, difficulty is absurd, enemy ships have obescene amounts of health where as three missiles will instantly kill you on easy difficulty. There's an escort mission with a ship that literally doesn't move or protect itself in any way, while you have to kill the enemy ship which has 8 flak turrets and 7 missile turrets, you can't stop in one place and the range your weapons work at is so low that you'll end up flying into the ship and being instakilled.

												Mecha yay! nope :/Wow this game made me do all the things i hate the most in those king of games, A LOTThe first Mecha Mission tuck me two tries so it not as hard as people say but its not Fun to do what the game want you to do.So your some dude no one cares about getting something thats like a nuke for us but it needs to charge....and wen active uses it like a timer that need to recharter so you can use that why every one bought the game, a unmobile, wanky to control, hovering target, that by the way needs to protect the biggest peace of♥♥♥♥♥♥from ?torpedos? to that point that you are surprised when you don't have to.ow did i forgot to say that the Mecha can do things like doge dash that consume charge so you run out faster?But the begging story was good.....nope, didn't care after the first missions :DIf you like sparklers and painting with them, this game is for you, because shacking around an just seeing light is what that Mecha is good at :D			"

												EVERYTHING is red,  the missiles are red, the ENTIRE BACKGROUND IS RED,  the enemies are all glowing red just like the reticles and the background and them issiles and EVERYTHING ELSE!I CANNOT SEE WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE SHOOTING AT. Oh did I  mention that each ""mission""  is 3+ parts long where you don't know how long you are going  so if you so much as think about firing a few extra missiles or rockets just to make sure you will run out on the 3rd section AND THEN  when you die/fail the mission and it respawns you at the last checkpoint the difficulty is increased noticeably. 2nd mission in and I'm like, I'm bored and fatigued from staring at the glowing red and trying to  see what's going on.

												I got this game on sale thinking it was another good single player space fighter with some cool giant robot elements. While it delievered in some of those areas the actual flight mechanics of the game bother me. I play a lot of space engineers and such I really noticed the lack of the last 2 axis of movement, or the up/down straff. Its not a game ender for some people but I don't like space fighters that fly like aircraft.Then theres the very repetitive nature of the missons. Once you've done 2 or 3 you've seen all your going to see. The last mission was also a big let down.			"

												I'm not sure what to say, the game is great until about the third level, where you get switched into a different ship (the strike suit) and pretty much everything you've learned up to that point becomes invalid, and you suddenly have to learn a completely new control system while the enemies only get tougher. What's worse, it seems utterly impotent compared to the previous ship, but perhaps that is only because there is no explanation on how to properly use it?? Its weapons can't even shoot down torpedoes (which typically just go splat), how are you supposed to fight entire enemy fleets?The artwork is beautiful, even if the special effects are a bit half-baked (cutscene hyperspacing?). I wish You could iron-out that spot where the gameplay just stalls and release it as an update, because up to that point it is a very fun game.			"

The story and presentation leave a little to be desired (as to be expected from an indie title) but the gameplay itself is rock solid. It's difficult but not unfair, just as space flight sims should be. The addition of a Macross-esque transforming space ship mechanic is so well done it's a wonder how these types of games ever did without it.			"

												- Gorgeous graphics, awesome soundtrack- Game is mission based, not open-world like Freelancer- Less on flight-sim, more on fast-paced arcade style dogfights (think Freelancer)- You will pilot a spaceship that transforms into a ♥♥♥♥ing robot, complete with Macross-style missile swarms! What more do you want?- I wish Gundam or Macross had a game that plays like this- Premise is nothing new: humans colonized the stars, and the colonials want freedom from Earth government; premise is same with Gundam, Zone of the Enders, and a bunch of other similar settings- Lots of flat one-dimensional characters, although I was too busy owning enemy fleets to be bothered by this- Pretty short game, although I found the whole thing to be sufficient, considering the price- A few bugs here and there, including one crash incident that happened to me:

- I hope there's gonna be a sequelThoughts on improvements:- Upgrade system is weird. You complete achievement-esque goals per mission to get upgrades (finish mission in 15 minutes or less to get a shield upgrade or something.. what's the context for that?). May have been better using a purchase system (as in, you would earn some sort of credits/resources after every mission and purchase upgrades for your ship).- Controls could do with some simple improvements. For targeting, there's only ""target nearest enemy"", and ""target nearest objective"". Later on you will realize that you will need a ""target nearest enemy torpedoes"" because ♥♥♥♥ those torpedoes.- The cutscenes in the middle of battle takes away your control and shows whatever it wants to show you in some pretty camera angle. This breaks your flow, especially if you were shooting at a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ interceptor when the cutscene triggers. They should implement a picture-in-picture style instead.			"

												In a word: forgettable.Ship unlocks don't carry forward to new missions, only previous missions - and there's no real reason to replay them.Side objectives - which are your sole source of basic upgrades (armor, shields, etc) - are only gained from completing side objectives, but with no radar, it's hard to pick out side objectives from the swarm of angry arrows swirling around the edge of your screen - nevermind that you must cycle target priorities until what you want pops up. This is especially agonizing as many side objectives are ""stop all the torpedoes""; there are no audio or visual warnings for when torpedoes are launched, so unless you are constantly mashing 'F' to see if any are in-flight, you have absolutely no way to tell - and if even one hits, the side objective is failed...but it gets even worse! When you fail a torpedo side objective, you don't even receive a notification - so you don't even know you failed it until you've sunk ~15 - 20 minutes into a mission and see the results screen. On top of that, on every single mission that has a ""torpedoes"" side objective, you are required to constantly monitor corvettes, capital ships, and fighters - which you cannot really find unless you set your target priority to each in sequence by tapping 'T'...but since there's no warning when torpedoes are fired, you have to constantly cycle target priorities and mash 'F'...and then you find out 20 minutes later when you've cleared the mission (hopefully) that one single torpedo must have snuck past ya - no unlock for you!At one point I was boosting away from an enemy cruiser to let my shields recharge - note that this was a good 14 minutes into a mission - and I was abruptly greeted by a ""MISSION FAILED. YOU WENT AWOL. EVERYTHING BLEW UP. EARTH BLEW UP. ALL THE PUPPIES DIED. GAME OVER."" screen. There was no warning, no audio or visual queue that I was getting close to the edge of the zone like a better game would do, NO - it just springs a ""GAME OVER"" on you.Your AI allies are comparitively crippled, dealing significantly less damage and having less hull/shields than enemies. They also pretty much suck at covering you when you're in a slower craft, like the bomber you are required to fly in a few missions.While the ship agility is fine for open space where there aren't really any obstacles, the last stage will have you smashing your face through your screen trying to guide your ship through 9 minutes of obstacles inside a tunnel.Altogether it's not a terrible game, it's just underwhelmingly 'meh'. I plowed through it in probably < 8 hours on normal and do not care to play it any further. The issues mentioned above are pretty darn pervasive and aggravating throughout the course of the campaign.			"

												Those who grew up watching Japanese mecha-themed anime (like anything out of the Gundam universe) will enjoy this game for it almost-perfectly captures the sense of overwhelming power and superiority one might get when piloting the proverbial weaponized suit. That feature alone can carry this game to a ""good"" rating from most fans of anime and the space combat genre. Add colorful and vibrant graphics, a wonderful soundtrack, intense gameplay, and scalable difficulty (from ""Grandparent-friendly"" to ""WTF""), then you've got a wonderful reason to give the developers your time and money.

												Strike Suit Zero is quite the entertaining experience. Its graphics and soundtrack are -- forgive me for the pun -- stellar. It feels like you're actually flying through a remote, unexplored section of deep space, giving a sense of near-complete immersion to the game. Although the story is somewhat generic and not all that compelling, to me, it's not the story that matters; it's the fun you have while playing. Some people bash this game for reasons I do not know; I am not one of those people. This game also features Steam Workshop compatibility, allowing you to create your own custom missions! With all that and an awesome space-fighter to boot going for it, why haven't you already bought this game?			"

												This game is the nostalgia-fuel I needed to re-live my X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter days.

												Mac users beware. I purchased the game a few months ago and as of the writing of this still have not been able to play it. I experience a black screen with only the audio playing. After following all available troubleshooting guides I contacted the developers through several methods (twitter, e-mail, forums, etc.) and while I recieved an e-mail response I never got any replies after submitting my computer data to them. With that being said, if you intend on playing this on a Mac computer just be aware that some users are experiencing issues and that the developers seem to be ignoring myself and others who are experiencing this issue. Until this critical issue is fixed and the developers actually provide support I cannot recommend it.			"

												It was...ok. Quick version: Game = hard and frustrating but kind of like Dark Souls hard and frustrating. Cool ships. Sci-fi Michael Bay. Plot is eh, but Sci-fi Michael Bay. Longer version = Game is definitely one of the harder ones I have played in a while, and it can be down right frustrating at times, but not because of bugs. In fact this is one of the least buggy games I have played in a long time. The game makes sure you know that what you did was wrong and you need to rethink your strategy.Plot is inconsequential. Difficult to explain why until you start playing. Similar to Dark Souls, at least for me, as neither game seemed about plot, but about gameplay.Explosions. Lasers. High Speeds. Science Fiction Space Wars Michael Bay. If Michael Bay made a game, this would be it.			"

												This has been one of the most frustrating games I think I've ever owned.  Looks beautiful when in the game, but to get there, I had to set my main monitor to the Oculus Rift resolution of 1280x800 to play with the Rift.  Otherwise you end up with a small window in the upper right corner that does no good for Rift viewing.  Once in the game the menus are readable, but only if you keep your head very, very still.  Then when you think you have everything figured out, you try to tweak the little options in your menus, but ....can't figure out what controls to use in menus, can't use joystick apparently, so you're stuck taking off  the rift to try and see the keyboard, but standard keys do not work.  Had to escape out by doing a ctrl, alt, del because nothing else would let me.  I ran just the game without steam, but cannot use your Rift if you do that.  So I just went in to change all my controls to something I know, and now I'm going to try all of this again.  The main problem is probably my choice of controller, which is a Saitek X52, and when a menu pops up that says ""hit button 30 to continue"" I have no idea which one they are talking about.  I tried them all but nothing got me past the menu, so we'll just see what happens next.  This game has soured my mood and I""m just about done with it.**  Edit**  After a much needed break, I returned to the game and got things configured to my liking.  The little issues are still there, like having to set my main monitor to 1280x800 but that is do-able for right now.  The game is very nice looking and responds well with the Rift and my joystick.  I changed my recomendation to YES, because its a good game to add to your library if you own an Oculus Rift.			"

												A game from a tiny developer with a successful kickstarter project, Strike Suit Zero is an accomplishment I'm sure many will remember. What this game lacks in complexity, it more than makes up for elsewhere. If anything, all you can really complain about is that it feels as though there's just not enough of it! So you want to know what this game is, what it does, etc. Well, imagine for one moment if the RTS game Homeworld, was smooshed together with the TV series Battlestar Galactica, the pacing of Super R-Type, the mecha styling of Mobile Suit Gundam, the atmosphere and vibrance of Zone of the Enders and infused with the soul of the X3 series. Now imagine that all of that comes together in an orgy of frenetic 3d-space combat, beautiful, vibrant graphics, a challenging AI, a good selection of ships/mecha and weapons and a soundtrack reminiscent of the musical stylings of Talvin Singh.Bottom Line : If you love your twitch gaming, but also want an atmospheric, challenging, not to mention stunning, 3d space shooter with an engaging story and an AI that'll keep you on your toes, then look no further. This really is a gem, and at under a fiver on steam, you've really got no excuses if this kind of thing is your cup of tea!Overall : 9/10Audio : 9/10Graphics : 9/10Gameplay : 9/10 "

												While I'm sure I'm missing out on a lot of the game by not having a triple monitor setup, I've gotta say this is a really nice game to just boot up, gawk at the nice nebulas, and get shot out of the sky. As I only have experience with Rogue Squadron II as my scifi flight sims, this was a nice step up. I found the game worked best with M/KB over gamepad, and the controls themselves were fair smooth. Overall I'd reccomend it if you're not yet tired of being an earthnoid tied down by gravity, as I think the game would've been much more fun to play on the colonists' side, since they were a bit overly demonized.

													For my first mech game, it was an amazing experience. The music was fantastic and fitted into every scene and fight. Speaking of the fights, the dog fights were epic. They kept getting bigger and bigger, with the stakes getting higher and higher. The keyboard controls took getting use to, but at the end I could handle everything. 	If you are looking at this game, I suggest getting the Directors Cut, because you can get more for the same price. You can get all the DLC, and a graphic and story overhaul. If you can get the directors cut, do so.	Speaking of DLC, It was pretty good. A nice change of pace from the main campaign. Each level had something unique coming and each had an unique challenge. It was worth it, The extra strike suit maybe not, but still this game was fun all around. 	The gameplay can get repetitive, but I never found it boring and was an exciting journey all around. Each battle was fun and the different difficulties add a little replay. The last level took a while and was frustrating at times, but it was such a small problem that whole experience wasn’t spoiled. If I had to give a score it would be a 9/10I would recommend this game to those who like mechs, explosions, and epic space battles.This was defiantly worth the money and has some good repayable levels.I pretty much 100% this game at 27 hours and still replay it every now and then!Enjoy.

												This game is a lot like Freespace 1 and 2. Basically, if you took those games and gave them a modern engine, it would be this. The only big difference (so far) is that after a few missions, you get the Strike Suit, which can either fly (when it's in ship mode) or hold relatively still and fight (in robot mode). Robot mode lets you turn a lot quicker, and it can lock onto lots of targets at once. Highly useful. However, the game (so far) doesn't have some of the stuff I miss from Freespace, like missiles designed to take out specific ship systems. Pretty good for an inexpensive game.I feel like there are a lot of keys to memorize, but it's easier if you keep your left hand on ASDF.			"

												Strike Suit Zero is one of the best games that I have had the honor of playing. The graphics are great, the story is interesting, the combat is absolutly fantasic and the music. OOOH the music. But without furthur or do here is the review. Overall Rating: 8/10Graphics: The graphics are absolutly fantastic. I don't have to specify why, because if you look at the screen shots, and the trailer you will see why. The effects, and the lights make it feel like your in a fire fight, and the sounds that go along with the graphics are just fantastic. Although since the lights and textures are bright and colorful and they are of abundance so players you are warned.Combat: The combat is the highlight of this game. The combat goes as followed. You move with the W,A,S,D keys and can use the left shift to use thrusters to boost around the battle field. You have two guns, the Primary which is usually fast fireing and powerful that has unlimited ammunition that uses energy (which regenerates over time). Then there is a various amounts of missles in the game that you can use that have their own speical properties and effectivness in situations. Some times in combat you can have your weapons lock on to the enemy, and the bullets will follow them. Mot of the time I find myself using my primary guns, and to use them effectivly you have to arch your aim so that the enemy flys into it. Fortunatly it gives you a place to fire, so you know where you need to shoot (However you need to be close or the circle will not show up). The primary weapon has unlimited ammunition since it uses the energy of the ship, but the LMG's, and various missles have ammunition and can be depleted fast. There are many different ships you can use, and I personally perfer the Strike Suit. You can switch from Mech to ship with the space button and just like regular primary weapon fire, the Strike suit requires power to be used. How do you do that? By blowing things up! All in all the fighting in this game feels ""realistic"" so to speak and is very fun and challenging. Although the large amount of enemys in the area of combat can be over whelming, it always pays off to be moving, and to not get to close to the main enemy ships until the fighters are taken care of. In that way its tactical and makes me want to stay with my team. Music: The mustic brings a tear to my eyes, as its as epic as it is interesting. Many times I find music repeating but I don't mind that very much as it is quite epic and makes me fight harder and get into the heat of the moment. Pros- MusicGraphicsCombatlight effects and sounds around the areastoryCons-No multiplayerGets repetitiveFinal Opinon: This game is really good. There are some things that didn't live up to my expectations, not much DLC, no multiplayer, not alot of missions, etc. But on the other hand the dlc isn't a need, the multiplayer would be fun but isn't a thing that needs to happen. The missions are long and increse in difficulty as you go on. The combat, music, and graphics are all in my own opinon great. I bought this game today, and played it for 2 hours. No regrets. If you like Mechs, and the Sci-Fi genres this game is worth the $19.99 and is worth picking up to play.			"

												Well I really enjoyed that, the mouse and keyboard controls worked great and the combat was just the right difficulty. I really enjoyed switching targets and managing the priority of threats as they came up, as well as ensuring I was using the right weapons at the right times... it was a lot to think about whilst in the midst of a space war.. and I must admit it was really engaging. Got me very much in the mood for Freelancer, another game I have never finished, which has similar controls... ableit isn't involving huge capital ships blasting away at one another in an overarching space conflict like SSZ. The graphics and sound are perfect and it's a well put together game. I can't credit it with originality though, the music seemed to be from Homeworld, the way the capital ships duked it out with huge laser beams streaking between them.. really felt like Freespace, the controls seemed to be taken from Freelancer like I've said, the unflappable naval officers seem to be ripped out of Nexus - The jupiter incident and the narrative.... inspired by them all I'd say.Still! A good game and enjoyable, if they do a sequel I'd certainly keep an eye on it and pick it up at the right price.The Heroes of the Fleet is an enjoyable DLC revolving around simulations of key battles, mainly one's that were historically defeats for the Earth forces you pilot for, all of which took place within the main story line however the protagonist wasn't part of them. . I liked the narrative twist and enjoyed the fact they'd even *put* a thread of story throughout 6 stand alone DLC missions. I think that's commendable. These level's are hard and I found my self on the edge of my seat during the last level in particular, fun times.			"

So just get this, fire away and lock-on targets to release endless streams of deadly missiles. That's how it rolls. Ignore the minimum specs, it can ran on weaker configurations but your mileage may vary. But, yeah, this is Omega Boost meets Freespace 2 with touches of Homeworld!			"

												This game's value, like any, is dependent on what it is being sold at. Regardless of how much man power and energy went in to making this, the effort you need to expend in this game is very minimal and mindless. At it's current sale price (as of 12/13/2013 at $4.99), it's way more than worth it. When I bought this game originally it was $20, the marketing behind it led me to believe it would be on the same level of quality as Freespace and Homeworld but don't be fooled. It's a pretty repetitive space shooter with a nice visual flair to it. The call backs to many different space genres of cartoons and games is nice but it's shallow and not too engaging. I wouldn't recommend it unless you have $5 to spare and are very bored at the moment.			"

												This game is pretty good. The controls for mouse and Keyboard combos is pretty solid. Sensativity will need adjusting, however, especially in Assault mode. The visuals are gorgeous and the gameplay is easy to understand after about 30 or so minutes of playtime. The mouse though can be a bit slow at times and the visuals can lag at some points. It is not enough to significantly hamper the gameplay but it is noticable, especially at some of the higher resolutions. The cockpit mode is awesome and adds a new dimmension to this game. I give a solid 7-8/10. Reccommended for the people who space shoot em' ups or is looking for something a bit different.			"

												Best mech combat simulator/space flight sim since Zone of the Enders. Gameplay is fast and fluid, offering easy of entry and an adequate difficulty curve as the game progresses. The story serves as little more than a backdrop for the absolutely massive space battles, but to be fair, did you really look into this game for a deep and thought provoking story, or just because you wanted to feel like a badass mech pilot? My only complaint is that sometimes tracking the location of your highlighted target can get difficult in the more frenzied encounters since the directional arrow highlighting it's location is the exact same color as all the other high priority target indicators on the HUD, (of which there will be many in later missions). It makes manually prioritizing your targets somewhat annoying, but not game-breaking in any way.			"

												I was a big Freespace and Starlancer player back when those games were popular. I was also big into Star Fox and its Nintendo 64 counterpart, in addition to an unhealthy addicted to Earthsiege, Starsiege, and the Mechwarrior series. Suffice to say that I love space combat games and sims, and it is a genre that has sadly lacked any real entries over the last decade to speak of. Strike Suit Zero fills that niche very nicely.When I started SSZ and began playing, it took a little bit of time to re-acquire the whole 'flying in space with a mouse and keyboard' feeling, but once I got the hang of it, it felt as natural as ever. The controls are nice and tight and there isn't a lot of slop. The graphics are polished but the animations during cutscenes can be a little janky sometimes. Voice acting is of far better quality than I would have expected - if you think the voiceovers are going to be as bad as, say, X3, you're wrong. Egosoft could take a note from this game. Graphics and style are overall awesome. I love the depth-of-field/blurring effect when boosting through space in cockpit view. My only gripes - the HUD situation sucks. Honestly. I hate that it's a bar at the top of the screen. It's jarring and unnatural; I would have preferred the HUD to be integrated into the cockpit in first-person view and at the sides or bottom of the screen in third-person. My other gripe - and this is going to be kind of an assanine gripe, as it centers around a key concept in the game - is the strike suit. I hate the strike suit. It just feels like a gimmicky, juvenile anime trope. I've never enjoyed mecha anime and I've never enjoyed humanoid mechs. I've always preferred the gritty down-to-earth mechs of later BattleTech and the hercs of the Earthsiege universe, they just seem more probable and more likely to exist. But I guess it's more a matter of taste, really. In gameplay the Strike Suit mode is very helpful and incredibly powerful - you can lock on to an insane number of enemies and launch cluster rockets that obliterate everything, not to mention the big giant plasma shotgun thing that wrecks face. It's definitely fun. It's use is balanced out nicely by flux mechanic, and I have not really felt the game get easier as a result of having the strike suit. The only real gameplay-related gripe that I have about it is that in strike suit mode you are forced into third person view. I hate that.It's a hard game, too. Really hard. It goes easy on you at first, but once you get your first strike suit, all bets are off. In particular the first level that takes place in a nebula is difficult (due to the fact that sensors, radar, and lockon missiles do not work- you have to rely on dumbfire rockets and visual sight). I love difficult and challenging games. The good:- Difficult- Beautiful visuals and style- Interesting concept in the strike suit- Unlockable ships and progression- Variety in space environments keeps things from getting stale- Feels like a natural progression of the space shooter genre- Music is very catchy- Voiceovers aren't half bad- Price- IndieThe bad- HUD design and placement is awkward- Music can be repetitive at times- Strike suit... mainly on aesthetic grounds- Forced third-person view in strike suit mode- Makes you wish for a modern FreespaceThis game gets 4 out of 5 cookies from me! I look forward to the next game these guys put out. I hope they keep this genre alive and renew interest in it.			"

												Trying to play this on a gamepad is just pointless as the controls there are far too sensitive, making you unable to shoot the broad side of a barn. Keyboard and mouse are a lot more easier to use and result in much improved accuracy. Visuals are fine, though nothing special. I honestly can't understand this games PC requirements being as high as they are. A complete lack of checkpoints throughout every mission I've played so far is also quite baffling and will lead to many ragequits. Weapons are pretty easy to use.All in all, it's an....OK game at best. If you want a simple space shooter (emphasis on simple) then go for it. But in all honesty, I wouldn't recommend. There are other games out there that do it better.			"

												The game didn't leave a good impression on me early in, but I stuck through it until mission 12 hoping for it to grab me, and now I'm done with it.  The game just isn't well designed, and mission 12 fully expressed that to me.  The weapons you get are limited in selection throughout the level.  The objectives and things you do rarely change and deviate from a formula they repeat every other level or 2.  It's basically defend X, attack X, or attack turrets on X to then get to attack X afterwards.Worse yet is on larger vehicles you're supposed to destroy you get little in terms of visual or auditory feedback that you're actually doing decent damage yourself, or if it's just your friendly ally ships.  When the objectives change, the game will do a poor job explaining what you actualy need to do, and point out targets that don't remotely matter to actually finishing it.  The game just does nothing remarkeable outside your strike suite can lock on, and let you paint multiple targets to fire a large missile barrage.  Fun for the first few times, but quickly becomes a tedious activity, as you'll use it a bunch to ween down health on ships with inflated HP.			"

												I absolutely love this game. Came into it relatively blindly. Had just done a revisit of some of my older favorites from the Wing Commander series, and was looking to jump into something similar that made use of newer technology, and SSZ happened to be on sale on Steam that day, so I made the purchase without really knowing what I was getting into. Infinitely happy that I did. The controls take a little getting used to, but the game eases you into them by giving you what's essentially a tutorial mission, followed by a few missions that are pretty light on difficulty and present you with basic forms of each fighting scenario, for example squadrons of fighters you have to take down, a capital ship you have to protect, etc. Once you get used to the key placements it's all pretty straightforward in that regard. The graphics are nothing short of spectacular both in their smoothness running and in presentation. I'm playing on a fairly decent, but not cutting edge machine, and I've experienced very few framerate issues, really only dropping slightly when so much is happening on screen that it's more than my brain can process all at once either. The sound and music are just as good, really fitting the atmosphere of the game, helping to enhance the feeling that you're taking part in massive epic space battles. There's also a good amount of replay value added in the form of mission medals and stat upgrade unlocks, that I know have me revisiting mission after mission to try for higher scores and get the unlocks/medals that I want. The only thing even remotely negative that I can say about the game is that it's pretty light on plot. The majority of the plot is communicated through text that you get both in mission briefings and post-mission reports, along with some cutscenes that take place during missions, but at times it's developed so little that I found myself scratching my head when something big happened, feeling like I didn't really know what was going on at all. But at the same time it's really not the emphasis of the game. The fast-paced large scale beautifully rendered space battles in amazingly atmospheric settings is. So basically if you're looking for something really plot heavy, this may not be the game for you, but if you're looking for a straight up space battle simulator and can live without having much of a plot to go along with it then you won't regret the purchase.

The dogfighting mechanics are top notch. The lock system for both missles and free fire is smooth as silk and the story is intriguing but doesn't get in the way.

More aptly named 'Strike Suit Zero Performance'.  The lowest ranking smallest enemy ship can easily beat your shields down in 2-3 shots .. making the illustrious 'Strike Suit' more a liability than a bonus.Again the game is ok, just lose the suit asap.

												I remember watching Gundam and Macross Animes growing up and wishing there were video games like those. There have been many but VERY few manage to capture the scale, scope, and heart of those Mecha-Space Operas and as Space Sims died out over the past 10 years I gave up hope of seeing a great Space Opera game. Until I saw Strike Suit Zero during the Flash Sale.Strike Suit Zero isn't a TRUE space sim in the sense but the arcade style it promotes actually meshes well with the Gundam/Macross styles. Swarms of missiles flying everywhere, ships exploding, pilots screaming out death cries as their ships fall apart around them. The action is fast and intense and after babysitting you for ONE mission, SSZ kicks it into overdrive and then into crazy what the hell how do I beat this mode. HUGE thumbs up for SSZ.While I would love to see some version of Multiplayer emerge, the MOD tools are freely available for someone to attempt it, the single player is excellent and the story very thought out. The music sounded familiar to me as I played and as I did more research discovered it was composed by the same guy that did Homeworld. (A FANTASTIC Space Opera RTS in it's own right.)BUY THIS GAME!

												Ideal for space cowboys.  Linear storyline rather than open world, but contrary to some reviews, I relish the frantic action and storytelling of SSZ.  It's such a nice change to have a game with some challenge to it.  The 3rd person view of the ships reminds me of ye olde Battlestar Galactica.  Taking out the gun turrets on the larger cruisers looks impressive.  Trying to get on the tails of your enemy using piloting skills and thrusters requires some perseverence in order to blast them into oblivion.  SSZ runs very well on my modest AMDm gpu.  It gets quite hypnotic at times, certainly not one for epileptics, and the in game audio is atmospheric.  I must admit i'm not one for the combo exploiting SSI sequel, but it's more of the same I suppose.  I think it was also this game that you can actually get skinning mods for several sci-fy favorites for!  7/10 whilst I await Elite.			"

												I'm really enjoying this game. To put it simple, It's exacly as GUNDAM SEED, just made into a game. You will notice that the captaplut is the same design :PThe missions are a bit light on text content but all is voiced. Although I believe by mission 5 you will be skipping most of them. The plot is also weak, which makes me think they did not put much time into the writing, which for this game, i'm completly fine with.As for the combat, it certainly needs polished. The fight can be caotic and if you are not familiar with your mouse sensativity you will find free aim completly unplayable. The lock on ability also needs more polished when in Striker mode, mostly tied to the free aim feature. Be aware that using the guns(rifle or energy) i did not find any trouble with it.As for striker mode and persuit mode, it feels swift, DIFFERENT(really important) and balance. On Striker Mode(humanoid, GUNDAM FUN) you feel overpowered like you should, you can simple auto target everyone with Shift and gun them, dodge enemy fire, etc. But the limit you have with it, making that fun end a little bit early ends up balancing it and making hardcore a really challenging difficulty (Although i would like more of that mode). Notice that the multiple lock on feature is very bad, u need free aim and won't detect enemies that are there. It fail completly compared to something like Zone of the Ender, so much that you wouldn't use it at all almost. As for persuit mode, It feels different, both on the weapons you use(you have more range of weapons in this mode) and the fact that you can thrust away from situations that might turn way too bad.  Here i didn't had much to complain, it feels like a fighter should feel. The space bar is perfect to change mode btw.Combat is caotic and the camera doesn't help. Then again, i like that part because it feels real, and having both 3rd person and cokpit views is a plus. The targetting system needs a bit polish, but i find the weapon selection limited. All weapons so far feel different and choice does matter, both guns and missles. But Only 2 buttons to cycle through either guns or missiles isn't enough. I would like to bind my weapons to 1-5 or similar and change them that way.As for the UI, I don't actually like it, but it does the job. I would change many things, but those that I feel that pass personal preference and became somewhat damaging to the player are the fact that your weapons are display through text. Each should have a little image, a machine gun and a rail gun, a Rocket and a Seeker missile, for exemple, that would allow quick recognition of the weapon selected. This doesn't affect guns too much(your aim changes acordingly) but the missile selection is harder than it needs to be.Lastly, regarding the aim i would like to see priority targets more distiguish. The game targetting is somewhat good, but it 3D icons suffer from the same problem games like BF4 and others. Its hard to target exacly what u want quickly or while dealing with an interceptor or changing targets.To Conclude, I found this game alot of fun. The gameplay is fast, challenging and each feature feels different. Although there are not that many types of targets(don't expect 5 types of inteceptors, 10 types of carriers, like in ZotE), the missions are sufficiently different and the form you tackle a interceptor squad, or a carrier or a full on base with carriers and squads, while protecting your bombers, feel very well made. The game certainly needs polished, therefore I would like to see where it goes. Please keep them coming, i want to see more.			"

												Played it, loved it, but it's too short a game (about 12 levels). Overall, it's a pretty decent game, and if you're a fan of the Armored Core series, then this is a game for you. The layout is pretty much the same, and has its own twists to make it a bit more enjoyable. Unfortunately, even when played at the most difficult setting, I was able to fly right on through each level without much effort. See, the game allows you to hire troops, and if you have them all, then playing it becomes way too easy. If they removed that aspect, then it'd be more enjoyable, in my opinion, anyways.			"

												An inteligent, fast, smooth, and unfailingly beautiful game.  The game is small for the sheer enjoyment it brings, and with the Mega Bundle coming wth the full soundtrack and a kick♥♥♥♥♥artbook, it's what I recommend to buy.  This game is an excelent sci-fi experience in a rich and well rendered universe, the characters are distinguished but not obtrusive, letting the game speak for itself, and boy does it.  Enemies are inovative when given the chance to be, and showing any weakness will result on them mercilessly pursuing you.  Not to mention the incredibly active and powerful capital ships that power through space as you dart around every nook and cranny chasing enemy fighter craft away from your ship's critical systems and opening enemy ships up for attack.Chase and dogfight your way through swarms of enemy fighters, then switch to 'Strike Suit Mode' and completely erradicate the lot.I recommend this for any space combat fan, even if dogfights aren't your thing, the vistas, music, and watching massive ships slug it out around you is well worth the price.

												9/10: 30 hours of game play. Wide screen support. Multi-monitor support! Light strategy and simulation, but mostly just a space fighter RPG (transformer, sort of). Some replayability via difficulty levels and  with Steam Workshop content, should provide additional play. Well worth the sale price, but well executed in nearly every aspect. Game difficulty at normal can be challenging. Audio issues with voice actor is frustrating, too quiet, and being reported by others. No amount of tweaking corrected it. However, the album either as DLC or with the game, was surprising very good. I will likely pull it out in a year and replay through.			"

												This game falls into the ''criminally underrated'' category. Remember when IGN gave Godhand a 3 when everyone else gave it a 7 or 8? It's kinda like that. I'm not gonna spend too much time on this, but the reviewers that gave it a low score did so because they are inept at playing anything harder than Mario. ''It's too hard'' was the MAIN complaint, and it's pathetic because it's not.Anyway, think Star Fox 64's 'all-range mode', but with a lot more enemies. You get 13 missions with an unfolding plot, and upgrades along the way that are unlocked by completing optional objectives that present some difficulty, but hardly the difficulty the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥reviewers say it posseses. You're given objectives in the middle of the mission, but it boils down to killing♥♥♥♥♥♥and blowing up big ships. Each mission varies up the scenario to avoid repetetiveness: protecting a fleet, taking out a ship in particular (or protecting it), taking out incoming torpedos, loss of missile systems. Just a tip: press the camera button (default is 'C') to go into first person. You have to do this for both your fighter and the Strike Suit, otherwise you're in first person in fighter mode and third person in Strike mode. It makes the fighting a lot more intense and increases that sense of inertia.Incredibly fun; highly recommended; intense dogfighting on dogfighting action; buy it now.			"

												The game didn't leave a good impression on me early in, but I stuck through it until mission 12 hoping for it to grab me, and now I'm done with it.  The game just isn't well designed, and mission 12 fully expressed that to me.  The weapons you get are limited in selection throughout the level.  The objectives and things you do rarely change and deviate from a formula they repeat every other level or 2.  It's basically defend X, attack X, or attack turrets on X to then get to attack X afterwards.Worse yet is on larger vehicles you're supposed to destroy you get little in terms of visual or auditory feedback that you're actually doing decent damage yourself, or if it's just your friendly ally ships.  When the objectives change, the game will do a poor job explaining what you actualy need to do, and point out targets that don't remotely matter to actually finishing it.  The game just does nothing remarkeable outside your strike suite can lock on, and let you paint multiple targets to fire a large missile barrage.  Fun for the first few times, but quickly becomes a tedious activity, as you'll use it a bunch to ween down health on ships with inflated HP.			"

The massive space battles, gratuitous explosions and full sound are all quite satisfying. I haven't had this much fun with a space combat game since Freespace!			"

												Welcome to a game of frustration and balls all in your face. This is a game where left is right right is forward up is backwards and down is still down.... You will most likely spend the first several missions screaming at your PC while debating if you should go sit in a corner and cry. A game where you and your NPC buddies must fight insane amounts of bad dudes only to have your NPC buddies sit in the back diddling each other while the enemies forces themself on you. For some people this could be fun, for others is a nightmarish PTSD flash back in a can waiting for you to open you eyes so it can punch you in the face and spit on your mother.Ok so it gets better... but really its like prison sex, it gets better after a while.

												This game is really great. It has all the features of space combat simulation, and adds an extra gameplay improvement with the Strike Suit's strike mode.Pursuit mode is dynamic both when you're against fighters and capital ships (the big ships). The targeting system is very efficient and allows you to easily spot the best target. Strike mode adds a new gameplay with a different (and more interesting) movement control (especially efficient against capital ships) and deadly weapons very useful against fighters.The thirteen missions have a wide variety of objectives which make every one feel unique, and the improvement of both your ship and your pilot's abilities give it a high level of replayability.Even better with a joystick, in first person view.

												I really want to recommend this game. I really do. But I can't. While it is fun to play, there's a few poins that, in my opinion, reduce the fun significantly.+ Gameplay is fun (most of the time).+ Graphics and sounds are great.+ Mouse/Keyboard controls are responsive and intuitive.- Playing with controller is difficult. I have an XBox360 controller for windows. The left stick is for rolling the ship (pretty useless), the right stick is for gearing. I'd rather have it the other way round. Since you also shoot with the right hand, I play the entire game with the right hand. And there seems to be no way to change that. Thus I resorted to mouse and keyboard.- You get additional fighters during the game, and you get a ""choose your ship"" screen. However, even if you already have other fighters, you can't choose freely. Most of the time, you're stuck with the Strike Suit.- The Strike Suit is annoying. You play it in pursuit mode most of the time, meaning it's basically a mediocre fighter. The standard fighter you get in the beginning has more firepower. When you magically charged your Flux bar by killing enemy ships, you get a short moment of the Suit's ""glory"". The Suits cannons are useless and effective only against enemy fighters. When attacking a capital ship's turrets, it likes to target turrets that are on the other side of the ship (and thus can't be hit) or the ship itself (for which it has way too little firepower).- Attacking capital ships is hard, even in easy mode. You get barraged with plasma cannons, beam cannons and flak, which can tear you apart within seconds. Which is why I never made it past mission 8. The bloody carrier is too much for the flimsy Strike Suit. Especially since there are no other friendly fighters, this it focusses all of its attention at me.- I'm not exactly fond of vocals in background music.			"

												I would recomend this game if you like space sims and also arcade styled games. But if you are getting this for the oculus rift support please do not get it unless its on sale. The oculus rift support of this game has majour flaws like the locking system (the red thinge that locks on objectives and enemy spaceships is 2d. so when u watch it through vr it realy disorients you untill you kind of get a general idea and just follow the direction. I must say its a realy fun arcade shooter to play and the story is fun but predictable. So i am sure i will be putting quite a few more hours in this game. Also if i understand correctly when this game releases the directors cut edition. i think they plan to provide an update to all the strike suite zero owners.I hope they fix all the issues that make it  less fun than what it could be. IF YOU ARE USING THE OCULUS RIFT IN THIS GAME . WHEN YOU START OF THE GAME WITH YOUR WINDOWS IN FULL HD . THE SCREEN WILL LAUNCH IN 1024X768 AND JUST RESS IN TOP LEFT CORNER OF THE SCREEN. SO REMEBER TO GET YOUR WINDOW RESOLUTIONS TO MATCH THE 1024X768. DONT BOTHER ABOUT THE WRONG ASPECT RATIO. IT WILL KIND OF RUN IN THIS SETTING			"

												Trying to play this on a gamepad is just pointless as the controls there are far too sensitive, making you unable to shoot the broad side of a barn. Keyboard and mouse are a lot more easier to use and result in much improved accuracy. Visuals are fine, though nothing special. I honestly can't understand this games PC requirements being as high as they are. A complete lack of checkpoints throughout every mission I've played so far is also quite baffling and will lead to many ragequits. Weapons are pretty easy to use.All in all, it's an....OK game at best. If you want a simple space shooter (emphasis on simple) then go for it. But in all honesty, I wouldn't recommend.

												If your looking for a decent dogfighting game for fun this game is exhilirating except for the last mission. I found the controls a bit clunky but aside from that the only thing that continually frustrated me was the inability for me to lock on to the specific target I wanted. The brief in game explination hardly covers the use of the system adequately and knowing where those torpedos are when the entire screen is filled with explosions is quite difficult at times. All that aside I would recommend this game but wait and get it on sale. It is not a $20.00 tittle I feel it missed out on much needed development such as character development, story depth, and scenario design. Unlike what I've seen from the rest of the reviews I had no issues with the checkpoint system incorperated they were well placed and the entire point was to make sure you werent just throwing out a million rockets willy nilly so you would have the required resources to beat the end of a mission segment and reach the begining of another checkpoint. All in all the checkpoints did not hamper me in fact they were an asset once I figured out how they were placed and I knew when it was okay to waste what I had to make it to the next checkpoint after which it was acceptable to die and get more special weapon ammo and armor.

												I really enjoyed this game. Some of the main criticisms were with the control scheme and with the length of the game. Personally I got used to the controls quickly on keyboard and mouse, and if you have a controller they are supposedly better. They are also very customisable if you don't like the default system. As for the length, the game has a lot to offer for its price in my opinion, and at a reduced price you can't complain! Missions are a good length (though the checkpoint system can be rather punishing on harder missions) and it is an arcade style game in the sense that you get points for everything so replaying missions for platinum medals is encouraged.The other main criticism was that it wasn't enough like some other space flight game that the reviewer liked. Personally I don't see how this is a valid criticism for a reviewer to make who is supposed to be reviewing this game and not one that is over ten years old. This is its own game, go watch some gameplay if you are undecided, don't presume it will be like x-wing because thats what you want it to be like, you may be dissapointed.If you like bright flashy space combat and a game that rewards players that learn the mechanics and uses them instead of expecting it to be like that space game you played in 98 then pick it up!

												This game is amazing.  If you want to play a game where you pilot a starfighter, it will be hard to do better.  The difficulty is well balanced between ""keep at it"" challeneges and maintaining a life outside of a videogame.  You will feel overwhelemed at the start but by the end you feel like the ""Last Starfighter"" or a Jedi.  Realism, including traversing a full three dimensions has been meshed with movie cliches like hearing defeated fighters crash.			"

												Not a very long game which might make more of a recommend when on sale, but overall, it is definitely a fun and to the point game. The space dogfighting feels very reminiscent of Starwars Battlefront 2; especially when I set my controller scheme to match it. Fast and allows you to move from target to target making you feel like an ace fighter pilot. Special note: when you acquire the swarm missiles, the awesomeness increases.Once you acquire the Strike Suit, the mech transformation, you really feel like the nightmare of the enemy forces. Probably good, though, that it is limited to a usage bar, forcing the player to balance and prioritize when to unleash the mech form and holster it.Overall: Good Game. Buy it, maybe. Sale? Buy it now.			"

												Well, I have really mixed feelings on this one. It is a decent space-shooter, but lacks many tiny bits that could make it great. What I find bothering is:- bad narration, you only get to know the story from an intro (made of static graphics), some brief texts before and after missions and rather mean dialogues during missions- no characters, no background for them. you just get some static pics and different voices telling you what to do. this makes the whole story rather dull and dry.- no personalization for your ship or anything else.- dry fighting system. it's fun during a few first missions, but then it's just all the same, all the time.- annoying difficulty spikes- bad ship upgrade system - you don't get to decide what you want to upgrade, you just get an upgrade or not, based on your mission score (""shoot down 10 figthers with a bomber during this mission to get this upgrade"" or ""save a cruiser during this mission to get this upgrade"")- ...and so on...All in all, this game is not worth the money I paid for it (EUR 18.99).

												It's an okay game when compared to other mobile games, but on the PC platform the game really falls flat. I never really enjoy space-fighter sims, but I don't dislike them, but this one just isn't really good. It's got acceptable controls, a cliched and boring narrative, and 2006-level graphics. If you're going to port any kind of 3D game over to PC, you might want to consider starting from the ground up, because as we can see here, compared to other games on a mobile platform it can hold its own, but on PC it never even stood a chance.

												Strike Suit Zero starts out very strong, and hit me with a major nostalgia bomb when I first started playing it. It reminded me very strongly of several space games I had played over the years, most strongly the combat of Freelancer. The game's presentation is tight, with good visual effects and atmospheric sound design, but is plagued by poor optimization, resulting in increasingly intolerable frame stutter and worse, the video lagging behind my button inputs. In addition, over the course of only a handful of missions in the game total, the difficulty quickly spirals out of hand. The titular Strike Suit is difficult to employ properly, and oftentimes I found myself unable to take full advantage of its multi-target locking missiles. It is not unmanageable for the player to take down numerically superior enemy fighter groups, but multiple times the player is expected to protect flimsy friendly targets, some of which can be destroyed in seconds by withering hails of fire from the aforementioned enemies. If you hate escort missions as much as the average gamer does, as I do, Strike Suit Zero is liable to make you pop a blood vessel. I would be willing to forgive that, since I love space games that much- but here's where things get ugly. The frame stutter ultimately resulted in my being unable to finish the final level, and that's why I give this game a thumbs down. I was unable to finish Megabyte Punch simply because I wasn't good enough at the game, and that's not enough reason for me to dislike it, but the technical problems foisted on me by SSZ are simply unacceptable.

												This game is really great. It has all the features of space combat simulation, and adds an extra gameplay improvement with the Strike Suit's strike mode.Pursuit mode is dynamic both when you're against fighters and capital ships (the big ships). The targeting system is very efficient and allows you to easily spot the best target. Strike mode adds a new gameplay with a different (and more interesting) movement control (especially efficient against capital ships) and deadly weapons very useful against fighters.The thirteen missions have a wide variety of objectives which make every one feel unique, and the improvement of both your ship and your pilot's abilities give it a high level of replayability.Even better with a joystick, in first person view.

												I went into this not really expecting very much; indeed, I wouldn't even have it if it were not for the humble bundle, but it is actually pretty good.  The campaign is a little bit on the short side, and it's nothing like the Wing Commander series of old where the outcome of a mission influenced what happened next, but over all this was a highly satisfying experience for me.  The combat is fast-paced, the story is not too bad, and it looks quite nice visually.  The ability to replay most missions in any ship you have unlocked and try and get a higher score in them is kind of nice for added replayability (bomber runs anyone?).  The music was ok, it didn't detract from the game, but it didn't really stand out to me either.  Overall, very worth the price of admission, and inclines me to be interested in the devs maybe making a longer game with more missions, ships, weapons, and wingmen.  I think they'd be great at it.  8/10			"

												I wanted to like this game. I've had it in and out of my Steam cart for weeks at a time. It wasn't until I picked it up through a Humble sale that I was able to finally play it.What a disappointment.Well, kind of. It's a decent arcadey space shooter, but beyond that, the whole ""flying a mech that does stuff"" is pretty underwhelming. Sure, you can shoot a bunch of missles all at once, but missles don't really do much damage except to torpedos, so, hooray? The ""main gun"" in mech mode is pretty much worthless.Skip it and find a copy of Xwing vs Tie fighter or something.			"

												First of all: This ain't a game for anyone. You absolutely NEED a gamepad/joystick and some gaming experience because this game requires some ability to be able to effectively play it.That being said, I can continue now with my considerations about the game:I've grown in a generation with lots of fantasy and mistery around intergalactic dogfights with Starwars, Starfox, Gundam, Battlestar Galactica, etc etc. and as a game I've set a minimum mark for every game that featured dogfights + space: Starfox 64 (the DS one is good, but not THAT good).Since then, I believe, I've lived in a limbo. There's been, of course some games that filled some of that gap like BF3 with it's cool dogfight, but nothing like that.Well, you may fire at me as many apples as you want but, for me, this game has set another mark for spaceship dogfight.It's more deep, more consistent, more beautiful, more realistic (control and weaponwise) and it has a playable gundam.Now to the game's basics:This game is about control. You need to understand and get used to it. It can be hard and punishing first, but after you get the hang of it, it'll all start to feel right and interesting. The story of the Strike Suit Zero is about a fight between Earth and it's colonies and you play the pilot of a new prototype fighter developed by the earthlings: the Strike Suit, a Fighter that can take the form of a Gundam for a limited time. Before the missions take place, you can (and it is recomended to) customize your weaponry according to your ship capacity (the standard strike suit has 2 slots for machine guns and 2 for missiles).The game counts with a good voice acting (but not as deep and engaging as of the Starfox's) and during the mission you'll hear a lot of conversation to keep you informed of what's happening and what you have to do and you're pretty much free to do anything (knowing that by doing anything but the mission's goal may fail the mission :P) and fly anywhere, vertically, horizontally, etc.The game is very dynamic and you'll often find yourself in a situation that you'll have to be aware of many factors (e.g: torpedoes being fired at your capital ship, fighters on your tail, enemy capital ships firing at you, mission targets, missiles being fired at you, etc etc... all at the same ♥♥♥♥ing time) and that may be a little difficult for people who aren't used to this type of game.The good:SSZ can be a little punishing for mistakes and that's good, I miss that in games. I miss that sometimes, decisions need to be made and you need to be cautious about your actions (at the same time that you need to be fast while you make your decision; The game is gorgeous, you'll often find yourself more focused into looking at the scene than on your objective; It let's you deal with situations creatively and I mean it. It's not the false creative (as in Trine), you'll actually end up having to formulate some sort of plan of action on a mission after you've failed a few times (even more if you're aiming for mission achievments which rewards you with a ship upgrade); The creators of the game said they have plenty of content ahead of us which will keep the game running (still waiting for multiplayer co-op); Not so dumb AI. Look, the AI isn't good, but I've seen worse and it can, sometimes, challenge you, so, for now, that's good enough.The bad:You'll have to pay for replayability. The game has no replay (unless you count achievment as scorehunting as replayability). To work this problem around the devs launched Strike Suit Infinity which costs almost half the original game's price and that's, uhh, not fair; The Strike Mode needs some tweaking, because while it has the function to lock-on multiple targets for your missile barrage, you'll end up in a situation where you try to lock an enemy and the game won't let you; The AI is dumb, at least dumb enought to let you shoot them down without little reaction. You'll face 2 kinds of AI in the game: The Elite and the ""commoner"", the Elite is actually kinda good, they can mass♥♥♥♥♥♥you, react when you tail them, bother you while you try to execute your mission etc, but that's not good enough, it could've been a lot better; in-game communication isn't so engaging. As I've said before, Starfox has set a mark and, at least at character communication, this game falls far behind to it. The voice acting is good, but you don't feel that immersion as you do with Starfox so you may feel a little betrayed :/Tl;dr:Like dogfights? Buy it.Like cool visuals? Buy it.Like balanced difficulty in games? Buy it.Like indies? Buy it.Summer Sale? Buy it.Winter Sale? Buy it.You have no money? Wait for the last 2 lines above then buy it.			"

												I absolutely love this game. Came into it relatively blindly. Had just done a revisit of some of my older favorites from the Wing Commander series, and was looking to jump into something similar that made use of newer technology, and SSZ happened to be on sale on Steam that day, so I made the purchase without really knowing what I was getting into. Infinitely happy that I did. The controls take a little getting used to, but the game eases you into them by giving you what's essentially a tutorial mission, followed by a few missions that are pretty light on difficulty and present you with basic forms of each fighting scenario, for example squadrons of fighters you have to take down, a capital ship you have to protect, etc. Once you get used to the key placements it's all pretty straightforward in that regard. The graphics are nothing short of spectacular both in their smoothness running and in presentation. I'm playing on a fairly decent, but not cutting edge machine, and I've experienced very few framerate issues, really only dropping slightly when so much is happening on screen that it's more than my brain can process all at once either. The sound and music are just as good, really fitting the atmosphere of the game, helping to enhance the feeling that you're taking part in massive epic space battles. There's also a good amount of replay value added in the form of mission medals and stat upgrade unlocks, that I know have me revisiting mission after mission to try for higher scores and get the unlocks/medals that I want. The only thing even remotely negative that I can say about the game is that it's pretty light on plot. The majority of the plot is communicated through text that you get both in mission briefings and post-mission reports, along with some cutscenes that take place during missions, but at times it's developed so little that I found myself scratching my head when something big happened, feeling like I didn't really know what was going on at all. But at the same time it's really not the emphasis of the game. The fast-paced large scale beautifully rendered space battles in amazingly atmospheric settings is. So basically if you're looking for something really plot heavy, this may not be the game for you, but if you're looking for a straight up space battle simulator and can live without having much of a plot to go along with it then you won't regret the purchase.

												A really well made indie game.  The graphics and gamplay mechanics are increadible, and the special strike mode of the Strike Suit(While limited) makes you feel like death incarnate.  And the weapons are truely balanced.  Better, more powerful weapons have less ammount of charge or supply.

												one of my favorite styles of game's use to be the space ship simulator but that faded somewhat as they slowly got rarer and rarer. so seeing a game that was basically fly in space and shot things and rain death i needed to pick it up.how does it compare? well the combat is fast and fluid with only one or two miss steps about how to make the combat deeper, the world it makes is really cool and i would really love to see more of this world, the art style works really well and makes everything look pretty dam cool and the music is... well its a little hard for me to say... see they seemed to go more shadow of the colossus style well i think it needed a more power rock feel to it as i turn into a mecka and rain hell fire death on a ship that never saw me coming.the real question is is it fun? and yes it is, its a cheap little game that provides as much fun and enjoyment as it can well given the constraints of a tight sale price. so i would recommend			"

												Like the IGN review below, it IS a unique blend of arcade combat mechanics with good ole' fashion space combat simulation movement. The graphics are lovely, and the soundtrack is like something out of Ghost in the Shell ( a quintessential cyberpunk anime). The difficulty spikes greatly within two missions, and the battles can be very frantic to the point of being distracted by EVERYTHING on screen. The game has some replay value, and allows you to use unlocked strike suits/ships on previous missions, as well as leaderdoards for each mssion.Unfortunately, it lacks a multiplayer, but the developers aren't ruling out a multiplayer function in the future, as well as an SDK for mods.A definite buy for space combat/mecha junkies, but if you want multiplayer, you might have to wait a bit.

												This is a game that tries to continue a strong, and lately forgotten, pedigree which includes the likes of Wing Commander and FreeSpace.Dogfighting does bring memories of those classic games, and coupled with some very impressive visuals that borrow a bit from Homeworld (fused with some Japanese aesthetics) and a great soundtrack, it's a very strong offering.The game is unforgiving. Really, really unforgiving. The difficulty curve suddenly spikes upwards and in the end you are required to not hesitate at all in your decisions. You 'must' be able to achieve that zen-like state of mind to overcome the final levels, and if you're like me, the kind of person that completely loves that......then there is no other quite like it.

												JIST: It's basically colony wars (PSX) + Freelancer, but with no depth. The missions toward the end were frantic and quite enjoyable, but it takes too long to get to that point. There is replay value here, but I feel that playing the entire thing over again may not be a priority for me.GRAPHICS: Not as great as the marketing suggests. The texture quality and models look a tad dated, and do not have the detail that I was expecting. The sky domes however are very nice to look at, but there is nothing revolutionary or impressive here.GAMEPLAY: The game has solid mechanics, and controls. From K+M, controller, and joystick they all work wonderfully. The only issue I have here is that with this control style you cannot make percise movements very easily.STORY: This is not the main attraction of the game, and it's fairly bare bones.VALUE: I purchased this @ $15.

Pros: amazing soundtrack, nice variety of ships, enjoyable gameplay, good challenges and length of missions, ecstatic immersive pew pew space combat. Missions are fun enough to re-do on higher difficulty and once unlocked you can use different ships when going back to replay missions.Cons: Lack of customization in ships (you can make a couple choices in weapon loadouts but all other upgrades are tied to nailing mission achievements and don't come with options), targetting itself works well once you get past the learning curve but switching target priorities could be done a little more intuitively, story is so-so - decent enough in a generic way to move you on to more pew pew goodness.

Although this game was short (only 13 missions that last about 10-20 minutes per), the action was good, and worth the price. The storyline is predictable (the usual save the earth spiel), the controls need a little extra configuring (if you're using a gamepad), and the physics for space are not ideal (no drift).But as much as I am complaining about it, I still had a lot of fun, and look forward to any mission DLC they may develop.

												I remember watching Gundam and Macross Animes growing up and wishing there were video games like those. There have been many but VERY few manage to capture the scale, scope, and heart of those Mecha-Space Operas and as Space Sims died out over the past 10 years I gave up hope of seeing a great Space Opera game. Until I saw Strike Suit Zero during the Flash Sale.Strike Suit Zero isn't a TRUE space sim in the sense but the arcade style it promotes actually meshes well with the Gundam/Macross styles. Swarms of missiles flying everywhere, ships exploding, pilots screaming out death cries as their ships fall apart around them. The action is fast and intense and after babysitting you for ONE mission, SSZ kicks it into overdrive and then into crazy what the hell how do I beat this mode. HUGE thumbs up for SSZ.While I would love to see some version of Multiplayer emerge, the MOD tools are freely available for someone to attempt it, the single player is excellent and the story very thought out. The music sounded familiar to me as I played and as I did more research discovered it was composed by the same guy that did Homeworld. (A FANTASTIC Space Opera RTS in it's own right.)BUY THIS GAME!

												I'm really enjoying this game. To put it simple, It's exacly as GUNDAM SEED, just made into a game. You will notice that the captaplut is the same design :PThe missions are a bit light on text content but all is voiced. Although I believe by mission 5 you will be skipping most of them. The plot is also weak, which makes me think they did not put much time into the writing, which for this game, i'm completly fine with.As for the combat, it certainly needs polished. The fight can be caotic and if you are not familiar with your mouse sensativity you will find free aim completly unplayable. The lock on ability also needs more polished when in Striker mode, mostly tied to the free aim feature. Be aware that using the guns(rifle or energy) i did not find any trouble with it.As for striker mode and persuit mode, it feels swift, DIFFERENT(really important) and balance. On Striker Mode(humanoid, GUNDAM FUN) you feel overpowered like you should, you can simple auto target everyone with Shift and gun them, dodge enemy fire, etc. But the limit you have with it, making that fun end a little bit early ends up balancing it and making hardcore a really challenging difficulty (Although i would like more of that mode). Notice that the multiple lock on feature is very bad, u need free aim and won't detect enemies that are there. It fail completly compared to something like Zone of the Ender, so much that you wouldn't use it at all almost. As for persuit mode, It feels different, both on the weapons you use(you have more range of weapons in this mode) and the fact that you can thrust away from situations that might turn way too bad.  Here i didn't had much to complain, it feels like a fighter should feel. The space bar is perfect to change mode btw.Combat is caotic and the camera doesn't help. Then again, i like that part because it feels real, and having both 3rd person and cokpit views is a plus. The targetting system needs a bit polish, but i find the weapon selection limited. All weapons so far feel different and choice does matter, both guns and missles. But Only 2 buttons to cycle through either guns or missiles isn't enough. I would like to bind my weapons to 1-5 or similar and change them that way.As for the UI, I don't actually like it, but it does the job. I would change many things, but those that I feel that pass personal preference and became somewhat damaging to the player are the fact that your weapons are display through text. Each should have a little image, a machine gun and a rail gun, a Rocket and a Seeker missile, for exemple, that would allow quick recognition of the weapon selected. This doesn't affect guns too much(your aim changes acordingly) but the missile selection is harder than it needs to be.Lastly, regarding the aim i would like to see priority targets more distiguish. The game targetting is somewhat good, but it 3D icons suffer from the same problem games like BF4 and others. Its hard to target exacly what u want quickly or while dealing with an interceptor or changing targets.To Conclude, I found this game alot of fun. The gameplay is fast, challenging and each feature feels different. Although there are not that many types of targets(don't expect 5 types of inteceptors, 10 types of carriers, like in ZotE), the missions are sufficiently different and the form you tackle a interceptor squad, or a carrier or a full on base with carriers and squads, while protecting your bombers, feel very well made. The game certainly needs polished, therefore I would like to see where it goes. Please keep them coming, i want to see more.			"

												One of the greatest space sims ever made! Fun gameplay, excellent immersion!You really feel like you are part of much larger battles.

												An awesome space combat game. Think of it like Macross the video game. Combat is challenging, but fun and very flashy. Game starts off a bit slow, but picks up after mission 3 once you get the Strike Suit. The game can spike in difficulty very randomly, but never to the point of impossibility. The only thing I would hold against it is the bonus upgrades. Some of them ask you to complete a secondary objective of some sort. However, many of these objectives go against actually doing well on the mission. Very often, when I replayed the mission to get the secondary objective, I ended up doing far worse rating wise then I did just playing the mission normally.All in all, a fantastic dog-fighting, large-scale, space combat game and well worth the price of $20. Even better when it's on sale.			"

												I absolutely love this game. Came into it relatively blindly. Had just done a revisit of some of my older favorites from the Wing Commander series, and was looking to jump into something similar that made use of newer technology, and SSZ happened to be on sale on Steam that day, so I made the purchase without really knowing what I was getting into. Infinitely happy that I did. The controls take a little getting used to, but the game eases you into them by giving you what's essentially a tutorial mission, followed by a few missions that are pretty light on difficulty and present you with basic forms of each fighting scenario, for example squadrons of fighters you have to take down, a capital ship you have to protect, etc. Once you get used to the key placements it's all pretty straightforward in that regard. The graphics are nothing short of spectacular both in their smoothness running and in presentation. I'm playing on a fairly decent, but not cutting edge machine, and I've experienced very few framerate issues, really only dropping slightly when so much is happening on screen that it's more than my brain can process all at once either. The sound and music are just as good, really fitting the atmosphere of the game, helping to enhance the feeling that you're taking part in massive epic space battles. There's also a good amount of replay value added in the form of mission medals and stat upgrade unlocks, that I know have me revisiting mission after mission to try for higher scores and get the unlocks/medals that I want. The only thing even remotely negative that I can say about the game is that it's pretty light on plot. The majority of the plot is communicated through text that you get both in mission briefings and post-mission reports, along with some cutscenes that take place during missions, but at times it's developed so little that I found myself scratching my head when something big happened, feeling like I didn't really know what was going on at all. But at the same time it's really not the emphasis of the game. The fast-paced large scale beautifully rendered space battles in amazingly atmospheric settings is. So basically if you're looking for something really plot heavy, this may not be the game for you, but if you're looking for a straight up space battle simulator and can live without having much of a plot to go along with it then you won't regret the purchase.

												Definitely satisfied a Macross itch that needed to be stratched. Fire dozens of swarm missles at rebellious colonists as a mech. Fly around large capital ships. Chase down enemy fighters in dogfights. It is all there!However, the checkpoints within the levels are quite spaced out and I found myself playing some sections multiple times, especially during escort missions. My HVT would go half to zero health in a mater of seconds, which could be quite frustrating. There are 4 types of ships, although the ""strike suit"" was the most enjoyable. I felt that the customization was lacking and would have liked to see more variety than level 1, level 2, level 3 of the same three weapons. The story is decent for a short game and was enough to keep me going level to level. Definitely worth a playthrough.			"

Longer version = Game is definitely one of the harder ones I have played in a while, and it can be down right frustrating at times, but not because of bugs. In fact this is one of the least buggy games I have played in a long time. The game makes sure you know that what you did was wrong and you need to rethink your strategy.Plot is inconsequential. Difficult to explain why until you start playing. Similar to Dark Souls, at least for me, as neither game seemed about plot, but about gameplay.Explosions. Lasers. High Speeds. Science Fiction Space Wars Michael Bay. If Michael Bay made a game, this would be it.			"

												A good space shooter which can really recall nostalgic of those old days. The strike mode might feel awesome at first, but it lose its magic after you're used to its limited maneuver. It really got most of the important gredient. But unfortunately with some apparent shorts:1. The strike mode need more attack pattern or functions. Probably consider something like infight.2. Story is not well-written. The settings are spilled on the player suddenly in last mission.3. Enemy AI is too simple. And there is no other spacecraft being a threat to the strike suit.4. The last mission is totally a mess. You shouldn't put this so lengthy.But overally speaking, this is still a game worth your time.			"

												It's a fun arcade space shooter. The backgrounds of the levels you fly in are gorgeous, I found myself just admiring them often times during the levels. There's a decent story, with some decent voice acting to go with the campaign. The space battles reminded me of Star Wars in scale, particularly the Battle of Endor, with lots of ships firing on each other from different directions. It was pretty neat. The gameplay does get repetitive, which is my main criticism of the game. It's just shoot this group of fighters, now this group of fighters, now this frigate, now this cruiser, now these fighters again, etc. There's only 1 level in the campaign that has significant variation. Overall it was a fun game and worth your time. The DLC Heroes of the Fleet is decent, I'd only grab it if it's on sale as it's pretty short, but it adds some decent scenarios and mechanics to the game.			"

												Note: This is my impression after playing the base game without DLC or the Director's Cut, depending on the changes in the Director's Cut, some of these complaihnts may have been resolved.A space game in the vein of games like Star Wars: Rouge Squadron or Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance.  Due to the lack of games in this genre lately, I was greatly looking forward to this when I first heard of it.  Unfortunately, it didn't quite meet the mark.  The story starts out farcical, becomes mediocre, and then decides to be incomplete and farcical again on the final level.  When I first started playing, the controls felt too sensitive for me to fly straight, but this was solved by turning up the blind spot on the controls.  The difficulty spikes a couple times throughout the game, typically due to the targeting system not highlighting the targets you want it to in some levels, the ease of having your vision obstructed by explosions or damage preventing you from visually locating important objectives, or the dense, hyper-accurate turret concentrations on carriers.  The game also leaves you to figure out which weakpoints on large craft are actually important to kill in order to not fail the mission instead of telling you what the symbols mean.  It took me a while to come to the realization that the Strike Suit was mostly useful for its ability to kill massed enemies or bombard targets from beyond your normal range.  Also, collisions deal fixed damage regardless of speed or impact angle, which can frequently result in your instantaneous loss of all your shields from drifting too close to something while trying to kill a target.  Also, I found that it was necessary to rebind most of the weapon control keys to something else in order to not keep hitting the wrong button accidentally.Strike Suit Zero generally manages to be a game from a dead genre that reminds you that you want more games in the genre, but rarely manages to be even average at what it tries to do.

												I really want to recommend this game. I really do. But I can't. While it is fun to play, there's a few poins that, in my opinion, reduce the fun significantly.+ Gameplay is fun (most of the time).+ Graphics and sounds are great.+ Mouse/Keyboard controls are responsive and intuitive.- Playing with controller is difficult. I have an XBox360 controller for windows. The left stick is for rolling the ship (pretty useless), the right stick is for gearing. I'd rather have it the other way round. Since you also shoot with the right hand, I play the entire game with the right hand. And there seems to be no way to change that. Thus I resorted to mouse and keyboard.- You get additional fighters during the game, and you get a ""choose your ship"" screen. However, even if you already have other fighters, you can't choose freely. Most of the time, you're stuck with the Strike Suit.- The Strike Suit is annoying. You play it in pursuit mode most of the time, meaning it's basically a mediocre fighter. The standard fighter you get in the beginning has more firepower. When you magically charged your Flux bar by killing enemy ships, you get a short moment of the Suit's ""glory"". The Suits cannons are useless and effective only against enemy fighters. When attacking a capital ship's turrets, it likes to target turrets that are on the other side of the ship (and thus can't be hit) or the ship itself (for which it has way too little firepower).- Attacking capital ships is hard, even in easy mode. You get barraged with plasma cannons, beam cannons and flak, which can tear you apart within seconds. Which is why I never made it past mission 8. The bloody carrier is too much for the flimsy Strike Suit. Especially since there are no other friendly fighters, this it focusses all of its attention at me.- I'm not exactly fond of vocals in background music.			"

												Trying to play this on a gamepad is just pointless as the controls there are far too sensitive, making you unable to shoot the broad side of a barn. Keyboard and mouse are a lot more easier to use and result in much improved accuracy. Visuals are fine, though nothing special. I honestly can't understand this games PC requirements being as high as they are. A complete lack of checkpoints throughout every mission I've played so far is also quite baffling and will lead to many ragequits. Weapons are pretty easy to use.All in all, it's an....OK game at best. If you want a simple space shooter (emphasis on simple) then go for it. But in all honesty, I wouldn't recommend. There are other games out there that do it better.			"

												one of my favorite styles of game's use to be the space ship simulator but that faded somewhat as they slowly got rarer and rarer. so seeing a game that was basically fly in space and shot things and rain death i needed to pick it up.how does it compare? well the combat is fast and fluid with only one or two miss steps about how to make the combat deeper, the world it makes is really cool and i would really love to see more of this world, the art style works really well and makes everything look pretty dam cool and the music is... well its a little hard for me to say... see they seemed to go more shadow of the colossus style well i think it needed a more power rock feel to it as i turn into a mecka and rain hell fire death on a ship that never saw me coming.the real question is is it fun? and yes it is, its a cheap little game that provides as much fun and enjoyment as it can well given the constraints of a tight sale price. so i would recommend			"

												I'll start out with the good, this game has reasonably paced space-combat with decent controls and enough mechanics to vary it up a little. Combat proves a generally enjoyable experience and there are challenges and difference in ship design/loadout that create enough variation to keep things going.The story is incredibly basic and at times makes little sense, there are no real twists and turns during the game that make you feel ""woah, I didn't expect that"" and I am left with a feeling like the story had only just started and there is much more left to be told as two key moments are left somewhat hanging, including the ending I got. I also am left feeling half the villain on a train-track ride of a game, forced down one path.However, I still would recommend the game if you can get it cheap. It sated an urge for some space action and although it has its flaws I still thoroughly enjoyed the experience and if the studio that made it manage to keep going I would be keen to see what they come up with in future.

												Strike Suit Zero is influenced heavily by the classics. The ship design takes inspiration from Macross, Homeworld and Gundam, and the gameplay borrows elements from Freespace, Wing Commander and the X-Wing series. It makes a solid attempt at reintroducing what seems to be a lost genre, then makes an even bolder attempt at  adding to it. This is definitely a game for  fans of the aforementioned titles, and is highly recommended as a foreword for anyone who were to explore the mecha or space combat genres.			"

												Strike Suit: Zero is an awesome space fighting simulator that scratches an itch that few other games in recent times have.The story is told sparsely, which can be good or bad depending upon how focused you want to stay on the gameplay. The dual-nature of the Strike Suit is the central focus of the game, and it really does change combat completley when the ship transforms.You're given the option to unlock new weapons as you progress through the campaign which can also turn the tide in combat drastically. For most missions, you're locked to the strike suit (despite having unlocked other fighters) for the first playthrough. After the initial playthrough, the other fighters become unlocked and you can have another go at the level in a different ship if you so wish.The difficulty curve is fairly consistent, though the final level is just stupidly designed and plain boring. If you're not an utter completionist, leave the game at the second to last level and call that it.The Heroes of the Fleet DLC adds a new ship (the Marauder) and some new combat scenarios in the training simulator. Like the main campaign, the final level is horribly designed and gets to be an unfun grind session retry after retry. Up until then, the few missions in HotF are quite enjoyable and a nice change of pace.Ultimately, a great game marred by poor game design in the later levels in the developer's attempt to artificially ramp up difficulty.

												This game's value, like any, is dependent on what it is being sold at. Regardless of how much man power and energy went in to making this, the effort you need to expend in this game is very minimal and mindless. At it's current sale price (as of 12/13/2013 at $4.99), it's way more than worth it. When I bought this game originally it was $20, the marketing behind it led me to believe it would be on the same level of quality as Freespace and Homeworld but don't be fooled. It's a pretty repetitive space shooter with a nice visual flair to it. The call backs to many different space genres of cartoons and games is nice but it's shallow and not too engaging. I wouldn't recommend it unless you have $5 to spare and are very bored at the moment.			"

												This game is pretty good. The controls for mouse and Keyboard combos is pretty solid. Sensativity will need adjusting, however, especially in Assault mode. The visuals are gorgeous and the gameplay is easy to understand after about 30 or so minutes of playtime. The mouse though can be a bit slow at times and the visuals can lag at some points. It is not enough to significantly hamper the gameplay but it is noticable, especially at some of the higher resolutions. The cockpit mode is awesome and adds a new dimmension to this game. I give a solid 7-8/10. Reccommended for the people who space shoot em' ups or is looking for something a bit different.			"

												Best mech combat simulator/space flight sim since Zone of the Enders. Gameplay is fast and fluid, offering easy of entry and an adequate difficulty curve as the game progresses. The story serves as little more than a backdrop for the absolutely massive space battles, but to be fair, did you really look into this game for a deep and thought provoking story, or just because you wanted to feel like a badass mech pilot? My only complaint is that sometimes tracking the location of your highlighted target can get difficult in the more frenzied encounters since the directional arrow highlighting it's location is the exact same color as all the other high priority target indicators on the HUD, (of which there will be many in later missions). It makes manually prioritizing your targets somewhat annoying, but not game-breaking in any way.			"

												I was a big Freespace and Starlancer player back when those games were popular. I was also big into Star Fox and its Nintendo 64 counterpart, in addition to an unhealthy addicted to Earthsiege, Starsiege, and the Mechwarrior series. Suffice to say that I love space combat games and sims, and it is a genre that has sadly lacked any real entries over the last decade to speak of. Strike Suit Zero fills that niche very nicely.When I started SSZ and began playing, it took a little bit of time to re-acquire the whole 'flying in space with a mouse and keyboard' feeling, but once I got the hang of it, it felt as natural as ever. The controls are nice and tight and there isn't a lot of slop. The graphics are polished but the animations during cutscenes can be a little janky sometimes. Voice acting is of far better quality than I would have expected - if you think the voiceovers are going to be as bad as, say, X3, you're wrong. Egosoft could take a note from this game. Graphics and style are overall awesome. I love the depth-of-field/blurring effect when boosting through space in cockpit view. My only gripes - the HUD situation sucks. Honestly. I hate that it's a bar at the top of the screen. It's jarring and unnatural; I would have preferred the HUD to be integrated into the cockpit in first-person view and at the sides or bottom of the screen in third-person. My other gripe - and this is going to be kind of an assanine gripe, as it centers around a key concept in the game - is the strike suit. I hate the strike suit. It just feels like a gimmicky, juvenile anime trope. I've never enjoyed mecha anime and I've never enjoyed humanoid mechs. I've always preferred the gritty down-to-earth mechs of later BattleTech and the hercs of the Earthsiege universe, they just seem more probable and more likely to exist. But I guess it's more a matter of taste, really. In gameplay the Strike Suit mode is very helpful and incredibly powerful - you can lock on to an insane number of enemies and launch cluster rockets that obliterate everything, not to mention the big giant plasma shotgun thing that wrecks face. It's definitely fun. It's use is balanced out nicely by flux mechanic, and I have not really felt the game get easier as a result of having the strike suit. The only real gameplay-related gripe that I have about it is that in strike suit mode you are forced into third person view. I hate that.It's a hard game, too. Really hard. It goes easy on you at first, but once you get your first strike suit, all bets are off. In particular the first level that takes place in a nebula is difficult (due to the fact that sensors, radar, and lockon missiles do not work- you have to rely on dumbfire rockets and visual sight). I love difficult and challenging games. The good:- Difficult- Beautiful visuals and style- Interesting concept in the strike suit- Unlockable ships and progression- Variety in space environments keeps things from getting stale- Feels like a natural progression of the space shooter genre- Music is very catchy- Voiceovers aren't half bad- Price- IndieThe bad- HUD design and placement is awkward- Music can be repetitive at times- Strike suit... mainly on aesthetic grounds- Forced third-person view in strike suit mode- Makes you wish for a modern FreespaceThis game gets 4 out of 5 cookies from me! I look forward to the next game these guys put out. I hope they keep this genre alive and renew interest in it.			"

												Targeting is very difficult for two reasons: 1) everything is red (crossharis, enemy ships, background) which makes it very difficult to see what you're actually doing, and there's no ability to change the color of your HUD.  2) cannot cycle through targets, you can only target the closest enemy and what your crosshairs fall on.  In a game of high technology these are some pretty big holes which make what should be a fun game pretty annoying.			"

												This has been one of the most frustrating games I think I've ever owned.  Looks beautiful when in the game, but to get there, I had to set my main monitor to the Oculus Rift resolution of 1280x800 to play with the Rift.  Otherwise you end up with a small window in the upper right corner that does no good for Rift viewing.  Once in the game the menus are readable, but only if you keep your head very, very still.  Then when you think you have everything figured out, you try to tweak the little options in your menus, but ....can't figure out what controls to use in menus, can't use joystick apparently, so you're stuck taking off  the rift to try and see the keyboard, but standard keys do not work.  Had to escape out by doing a ctrl, alt, del because nothing else would let me.  I ran just the game without steam, but cannot use your Rift if you do that.  So I just went in to change all my controls to something I know, and now I'm going to try all of this again.  The main problem is probably my choice of controller, which is a Saitek X52, and when a menu pops up that says ""hit button 30 to continue"" I have no idea which one they are talking about.  I tried them all but nothing got me past the menu, so we'll just see what happens next.  This game has soured my mood and I""m just about done with it.**  Edit**  After a much needed break, I returned to the game and got things configured to my liking.  The little issues are still there, like having to set my main monitor to 1280x800 but that is do-able for right now.  The game is very nice looking and responds well with the Rift and my joystick.  I changed my recomendation to YES, because its a good game to add to your library if you own an Oculus Rift.			"

												A game from a tiny developer with a successful kickstarter project, Strike Suit Zero is an accomplishment I'm sure many will remember. What this game lacks in complexity, it more than makes up for elsewhere. If anything, all you can really complain about is that it feels as though there's just not enough of it! So you want to know what this game is, what it does, etc. Well, imagine for one moment if the RTS game Homeworld, was smooshed together with the TV series Battlestar Galactica, the pacing of Super R-Type, the mecha styling of Mobile Suit Gundam, the atmosphere and vibrance of Zone of the Enders and infused with the soul of the X3 series. Now imagine that all of that comes together in an orgy of frenetic 3d-space combat, beautiful, vibrant graphics, a challenging AI, a good selection of ships/mecha and weapons and a soundtrack reminiscent of the musical stylings of Talvin Singh.Bottom Line : If you love your twitch gaming, but also want an atmospheric, challenging, not to mention stunning, 3d space shooter with an engaging story and an AI that'll keep you on your toes, then look no further. This really is a gem, and at under a fiver on steam, you've really got no excuses if this kind of thing is your cup of tea!Overall : 9/10Audio : 9/10Graphics : 9/10Gameplay : 9/10 "

												Once I got used to the controls (I used Keyboard & Mouse), it was actually a pretty good game.  The combat was intense and using the strike suit to obliterate entire formations was a lot of fun.  They even managed to make the bomber not feel like a flying coffin, which is a major accomplishment in my book.  The only blight on otherwise excellent level design was the absoluteley terrible the final mission.  I don't know why devs keep putting ""flying through tunnels"" missions in games about shooting things in space.  With that said, if you enjoy arcade style shooters like Star Fox and Rogue Squadron this is definitely worth checking out.			"

												While certainly not the best game I've ever played, Strike Suit Zero nevertheless scratches a space combat shooter itch that I've had since playing Tachyon: The Fringe back in the early 2000s.  Indeed, SSZ seems to borrow many elements from Tachyon, including most of the mechanics, feel, and weapons.  The graphics in the game are a bit underwhelming, looking more like a game from the late 00s, rather than the 2010s.  Still, for an independent title that was funded through Kickstarter, SSZ is definitely worth your time.  The main draw of the game--the mech transformation--is actually the least fun, in my opinion.  I greatly prefer the starfighter mode to the mech mode.  But, if you are looking for a no-frills space shooter that calls to mind the golden age of the genre, then this game is certainly worth that money, especially if you can get it on sale.			"

												Great space sim.  Like FreeSpace 2 with modern graphics and more action.  Dug out my old Saitek X45 and plugged it in, and I was in business.  Turns out it works natively with Mac OS X Mavericks.  Who knew?  (You can also play the game with mouse/keyboard.) Single player only, though.  But for 5 bucks, iyou can't go wrong.			"

												IF this was the studios first project, I am really excited to see what they do next.  For a kickstarter project, this game is really polished.  The controls feel really good once you get used to them.  I am playing with a 360 controller for PC and now I wish that all my old experiences with space sims were with this type of controller.  The dual joysticks really work well for giving you yaw.  I really like that they have different ship types and didn't focus exclusively on the Strike Suit.  Playing the Bomber or Interceptor was really enjoyable and added more variety and depth to the missions.  It was kind of nice that they control how much time you can spend in the mecha form, but I think if they would of balanced that form better, there wouldn't of been the need.  I just have a hard time with it being a sci-fi genre and them saying you need to charge the suit by shooting stuff.  Why not just have it be a thermal cool down thing or something.  The story isn't overly exciting, the main character is just a name, although they are trying to manufacture a bit of a story with him.  The story doesn't add too much depth to the game, other than serving as a minimal segway to different types of missions.  But the gameplay is really fun, and the graphics are really beautiful.  It feels really amazing when you barrel role over to the underside of a capital ship after making a turret run over the top.  It really feels like you are playing in one of the epic sci fi movie battles.  I don't think I have had a game get this right before.If you are into the space combat sim genre, check it out.  The mech suit transformation is what this game brings to the table, along with updated controls, graphics and sound.  It makes me wish these guys had a license to redo wing commmander or tie fighter, they just need a few new writers. "

												A nice refresh of the space combat genre that delivers an incredibly thrilling and fast-paced combat experience.Strike Suit Zero is indeed reminiscent of FreeSpace 2, but the addition of the ability to transform into a nimble space mech adds a whole new dimension to the experience. The game’s controls proved to be highly intuitive; it’s relatively easy to pick up, and the ships (be it fighter or mech) were an absolute joy to pilot. Once the Strike Suit is acquired, much of the challenge revolves around the careful management of flux energy, which is replenished upon successful kills, and expended when utilizing the high-powered weapons in strike mode. The story does an adequate job of tying the missions together, and even has a sufficiently interesting twist at the end. As to be expected from the genre, combat is potentially repetitive, but the game mitigates the problem by intensifying the challenge significantly as the campaign progresses, with enemy attacks becoming ever more relentless.The game's balance does leave something to be desired however, especially with regard to its roster of ships. Once the titular Strike Suit is made available, there's little in the way of incentives to warrant the selection of other ships. Furthermore, only generic information is provided on unlocked weapons and ship upgrades (granted upon completing mission-specific challenges). Without stat-related information, most of the weapons unlocked over the course of the campaign seem pointless. i.e. It's hard to justify the choice of heavier weapons when they incur penalties (like reduced projectile velocity) without delivering a discernible difference in dps.Graphics-wise, there's nothing revolutionary here. Nevertheless, it is a step forward as far as space combat sims are concerned. The game maintains a pleasantly minimalist (if somewhat Tron-esque) aesthetic. Each faction's vessels feature sufficiently distinctive designs with a good balance of details, and a number of missions are set against surprisingly breath-taking planetary backdrops. The bloom lighting effects can get over-the-top at times, but on the whole it fits the game well. If I were to nit-pick, some of the shortcomings would be:- completely static HUD portraits- inconsistent attention to detail: absurdly, some large objects like comms relays and shield generators attached to installations disappear without leaving any wreckage when destroyedThe game isn't perfect, but I personally find that it brings enough to the table to be a worthy addition to the genre. If you've been on the hunt for a new space combat simulator, this is one heck of an exhilarating ride that you wouldn't want to miss.			"

												Played it, loved it, but it's too short a game (about 12 levels). Overall, it's a pretty decent game, and if you're a fan of the Armored Core series, then this is a game for you. The layout is pretty much the same, and has its own twists to make it a bit more enjoyable. Unfortunately, even when played at the most difficult setting, I was able to fly right on through each level without much effort. See, the game allows you to hire troops, and if you have them all, then playing it becomes way too easy. If they removed that aspect, then it'd be more enjoyable, in my opinion, anyways.			"

												Ideal for space cowboys.  Linear storyline rather than open world, but contrary to some reviews, I relish the frantic action and storytelling of SSZ.  It's such a nice change to have a game with some challenge to it.  The 3rd person view of the ships reminds me of ye olde Battlestar Galactica.  Taking out the gun turrets on the larger cruisers looks impressive.  Trying to get on the tails of your enemy using piloting skills and thrusters requires some perseverence in order to blast them into oblivion.  SSZ runs very well on my modest AMDm gpu.  It gets quite hypnotic at times, certainly not one for epileptics, and the in game audio is atmospheric.  I must admit i'm not one for the combo exploiting SSI sequel, but it's more of the same I suppose.  I think it was also this game that you can actually get skinning mods for several sci-fy favorites for!  7/10 whilst I await Elite.			"

												Strike Suit Zero is quite the entertaining experience. Its graphics and soundtrack are -- forgive me for the pun -- stellar. It feels like you're actually flying through a remote, unexplored section of deep space, giving a sense of near-complete immersion to the game. Although the story is somewhat generic and not all that compelling, to me, it's not the story that matters; it's the fun you have while playing. Some people bash this game for reasons I do not know; I am not one of those people. This game also features Steam Workshop compatibility, allowing you to create your own custom missions! With all that and an awesome space-fighter to boot going for it, why haven't you already bought this game?			"

												Genuinely surprised at the mediocre-negative reception this game is getting from sites like Eurogamer. The story and presentation leave a little to be desired (as to be expected from an indie title) but the gameplay itself is rock solid. It's difficult but not unfair, just as space flight sims should be. The addition of a Macross-esque transforming space ship mechanic is so well done it's a wonder how these types of games ever did without it.			"

												This game is a mix of style from Omega Boost, and Colony Wars for PSX. Although this game was short (only 13 missions that last about 10-20 minutes per), the action was good, and worth the price. The storyline is predictable (the usual save the earth spiel), the controls need a little extra configuring (if you're using a gamepad), and the physics for space are not ideal (no drift).But as much as I am complaining about it, I still had a lot of fun, and look forward to any mission DLC they may develop.

												Game is ok. The 'Strike Suit' thats supposed to be the centrepiece for the game, flys like a bus and shoots like a 9 year old. Almost all of the low level spaceships out-perform the amazing 'Strike Suit' easily, and you dont get much choice or option but to fly this sack of crap for most of the game. More aptly named 'Strike Suit Zero Performance'.  The lowest ranking smallest enemy ship can easily beat your shields down in 2-3 shots .. making the illustrious 'Strike Suit' more a liability than a bonus.Again the game is ok, just lose the suit asap.

												Strike Suit Zero is a very unique game. It's offers a level of immersion that other space opera games lack. This is a heavy action-oriented game and the story is not merely a vehicle.  Controls are not complex and only several keys are required and the game doesn't dump a rediculous ammount on you, forcing you to stretch your hand all accross your keyboard. The plot is not pointless too. It will fool you into thinking it's a total linear story line. So SPOILER ALERT: at the very end you have a choice.Combat is very satisfying. Ships are graceful, fair, and not clunky to handle. Controls are simple, easy to operate, and convenient. The story surprised me as stated above.If you like mecha games such as armored core, military themed areial combat, space opera, then you will love this game and it's sequel Strike Suit Infinity.

												Once I got used to the controls (I used Keyboard & Mouse), it was actually a pretty good game.  The combat was intense and using the strike suit to obliterate entire formations was a lot of fun.  They even managed to make the bomber not feel like a flying coffin, which is a major accomplishment in my book.  The only blight on otherwise excellent level design was the absoluteley terrible the final mission.  I don't know why devs keep putting ""flying through tunnels"" missions in games about shooting things in space.  With that said, if you enjoy arcade style shooters like Star Fox and Rogue Squadron this is definitely worth checking out.			"

												While certainly not the best game I've ever played, Strike Suit Zero nevertheless scratches a space combat shooter itch that I've had since playing Tachyon: The Fringe back in the early 2000s.  Indeed, SSZ seems to borrow many elements from Tachyon, including most of the mechanics, feel, and weapons.  The graphics in the game are a bit underwhelming, looking more like a game from the late 00s, rather than the 2010s.  Still, for an independent title that was funded through Kickstarter, SSZ is definitely worth your time.  The main draw of the game--the mech transformation--is actually the least fun, in my opinion.  I greatly prefer the starfighter mode to the mech mode.  But, if you are looking for a no-frills space shooter that calls to mind the golden age of the genre, then this game is certainly worth that money, especially if you can get it on sale.			"

												This has been one of the most frustrating games I think I've ever owned.  Looks beautiful when in the game, but to get there, I had to set my main monitor to the Oculus Rift resolution of 1280x800 to play with the Rift.  Otherwise you end up with a small window in the upper right corner that does no good for Rift viewing.  Once in the game the menus are readable, but only if you keep your head very, very still.  Then when you think you have everything figured out, you try to tweak the little options in your menus, but ....can't figure out what controls to use in menus, can't use joystick apparently, so you're stuck taking off  the rift to try and see the keyboard, but standard keys do not work.  Had to escape out by doing a ctrl, alt, del because nothing else would let me.  I ran just the game without steam, but cannot use your Rift if you do that.  So I just went in to change all my controls to something I know, and now I'm going to try all of this again.  The main problem is probably my choice of controller, which is a Saitek X52, and when a menu pops up that says ""hit button 30 to continue"" I have no idea which one they are talking about.  I tried them all but nothing got me past the menu, so we'll just see what happens next.  This game has soured my mood and I""m just about done with it.**  Edit**  After a much needed break, I returned to the game and got things configured to my liking.  The little issues are still there, like having to set my main monitor to 1280x800 but that is do-able for right now.  The game is very nice looking and responds well with the Rift and my joystick.  I changed my recomendation to YES, because its a good game to add to your library if you own an Oculus Rift.			"

												It's a fun arcade space shooter. The backgrounds of the levels you fly in are gorgeous, I found myself just admiring them often times during the levels. There's a decent story, with some decent voice acting to go with the campaign. The space battles reminded me of Star Wars in scale, particularly the Battle of Endor, with lots of ships firing on each other from different directions. It was pretty neat. The gameplay does get repetitive, which is my main criticism of the game. It's just shoot this group of fighters, now this group of fighters, now this frigate, now this cruiser, now these fighters again, etc. There's only 1 level in the campaign that has significant variation. Overall it was a fun game and worth your time. The DLC Heroes of the Fleet is decent, I'd only grab it if it's on sale as it's pretty short, but it adds some decent scenarios and mechanics to the game.			"

Anyone that has ever watched a gundam series should absolutely love this game. The strike suit handles just like I imagine a gundam would. It even has a transverse frame allowing you to switch between strike suit and jet modes on the fly. It's a great offering for a indie game, and support from the devs is proving to be pretty solid so far.			"

												Note: This is my impression after playing the base game without DLC or the Director's Cut, depending on the changes in the Director's Cut, some of these complaihnts may have been resolved.A space game in the vein of games like Star Wars: Rouge Squadron or Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance.  Due to the lack of games in this genre lately, I was greatly looking forward to this when I first heard of it.  Unfortunately, it didn't quite meet the mark.  The story starts out farcical, becomes mediocre, and then decides to be incomplete and farcical again on the final level.  When I first started playing, the controls felt too sensitive for me to fly straight, but this was solved by turning up the blind spot on the controls.  The difficulty spikes a couple times throughout the game, typically due to the targeting system not highlighting the targets you want it to in some levels, the ease of having your vision obstructed by explosions or damage preventing you from visually locating important objectives, or the dense, hyper-accurate turret concentrations on carriers.  The game also leaves you to figure out which weakpoints on large craft are actually important to kill in order to not fail the mission instead of telling you what the symbols mean.  It took me a while to come to the realization that the Strike Suit was mostly useful for its ability to kill massed enemies or bombard targets from beyond your normal range.  Also, collisions deal fixed damage regardless of speed or impact angle, which can frequently result in your instantaneous loss of all your shields from drifting too close to something while trying to kill a target.  Also, I found that it was necessary to rebind most of the weapon control keys to something else in order to not keep hitting the wrong button accidentally.Strike Suit Zero generally manages to be a game from a dead genre that reminds you that you want more games in the genre, but rarely manages to be even average at what it tries to do.

												Well I really enjoyed that, the mouse and keyboard controls worked great and the combat was just the right difficulty. I really enjoyed switching targets and managing the priority of threats as they came up, as well as ensuring I was using the right weapons at the right times... it was a lot to think about whilst in the midst of a space war.. and I must admit it was really engaging. Got me very much in the mood for Freelancer, another game I have never finished, which has similar controls... ableit isn't involving huge capital ships blasting away at one another in an overarching space conflict like SSZ. The graphics and sound are perfect and it's a well put together game. I can't credit it with originality though, the music seemed to be from Homeworld, the way the capital ships duked it out with huge laser beams streaking between them.. really felt like Freespace, the controls seemed to be taken from Freelancer like I've said, the unflappable naval officers seem to be ripped out of Nexus - The jupiter incident and the narrative.... inspired by them all I'd say.Still! A good game and enjoyable, if they do a sequel I'd certainly keep an eye on it and pick it up at the right price.The Heroes of the Fleet is an enjoyable DLC revolving around simulations of key battles, mainly one's that were historically defeats for the Earth forces you pilot for, all of which took place within the main story line however the protagonist wasn't part of them. . I liked the narrative twist and enjoyed the fact they'd even *put* a thread of story throughout 6 stand alone DLC missions. I think that's commendable. These level's are hard and I found my self on the edge of my seat during the last level in particular, fun times.			"

												Decent space fighter sim. PROS : Impressive visualsHad some of that ""one awesome fighter can take out a cap ship"" feelInteresting space battles - cap ships fight each other and you're often called on to take out torpedoes and big guns on opposing ships. Weapons & ship customization, but not TOO much. Voice acting wasn't abominable. You're a transformer in space (man wut?)Bonus goals in each mission give actual in-game rewards that increase your effectiveness in subsequent missions. The bomber was a crapton of fun, even if it couldn't transform. Seroiusly, sometimes I still get on just to go torpedo stuff in its stupid face. CONS : Plot is pretty good, then takes a turn into WTF land. Transforming doesn't feel robot-y, or rather it's more like you're just transforming into another fighter that moves differently & has different weapons. Couldn't do anything robot-y like rip parts off ships or fistfight dinosaurs. Didn't feel like I was in space - fighters perpetually move forward & nobody takes advantage of inertia & lack of atmosphere. Repetition - ""go blow up X thing"" can get old fast. I wouldn't pay the regular $20 for it, but if it goes on sale, I'd say check this one out.			"

As pretty alright as the soundtrack is and as pretty as it looks it's not a very big game, the story's not exactly the most engaging out there, and there are only 13 pretty-short missions to go through. The mission objectives themselves are all generally the same protect-this & destroy-these missions so it can be repetitious.When it comes to the base gameplay they work and control great. The combat can get pretty intense the more enemies you're up against especially when suddenly your targets are large fleets themselves with guns covering practically every surface its got and the sudden priority is to take out the things that fire back.Surviving involves you keeping your ship's armor (health) and regenerating shield up and as far as I know there's no way of repairing your ship's armor without reloading a checkpoint or getting it repaired when told in one particular mission. The reload-checkpoint-to-recover-everything deal looked to me like an exploitable mechanic of sorts even though there aren't very many checkpoints throughout the game, especially the later missions with their longer mission times and limited amount of checkpoints.Each mission has an optional objective you can do that will unlock an upgrade but each one are just shared stat upgrades for all of the ships you have. What you're to do and what you can unlock are shown in the mission select screen upon preparing for the mission chosen. New ships and weapons are unlocked through progress of the missions.After a few missions you'll eventually unlock the ""Strike Suit"" ship which basically transforms into a straight-up mech (Strike Mode) if the ""Flux"" bar it comes with is filled enough through received or given damage. It's able to move more relatively freely in the three dimensions its got, has a very capable auto-locking targeting system on chosen targets within distance, and can target & lock-on to large numbers of targets for use of the barrage of the seeking missiles it can fire. The Flux bar starts to drain upon use of Strike Mode's firing capabilities but if used efficiently the Flux bar can prolong its usage without transforming back to ship mode.Kind of surprisingly the Strike Suit you use is the only mech in the game. No ally or enemy has anything similar although the mech may as well just be a temporary ship with a few more capabilities.There's not a whole lot else to this game outside of the well-done space-dogfighting.

												No game makes you feel like an Ace Pilot the way this one does. Won't scratch your Gundam itch, but if you're into transforming starfighters with ZOE style mega lock-on missile barrages, check this out. Just the right kind of arcade-y, without being too overwhelming.			"

												This one has a difficulty curve a mile high and is a little repetitive, but it does the sort of high-speed, high-risk space-dogfighting that you'd expect to see in any decent sci-fi flick and does it well. Throwing in a transforming fighter as a sort of temporary super mode doesn't hurt either			"

												Even though I still haven't finished the first campaign, I still heavily recommend this to any sci-fi fan who likes anime or space sims. I have enjoyed this game so much since it was the first game since Freelancer in a space setting that I played. 8/10 Because it could be longer, and maybe a little more versatility. Other than that, I love this game.			"

												It's a fun arcade space shooter. The backgrounds of the levels you fly in are gorgeous, I found myself just admiring them often times during the levels. There's a decent story, with some decent voice acting to go with the campaign. The space battles reminded me of Star Wars in scale, particularly the Battle of Endor, with lots of ships firing on each other from different directions. It was pretty neat. The gameplay does get repetitive, which is my main criticism of the game. It's just shoot this group of fighters, now this group of fighters, now this frigate, now this cruiser, now these fighters again, etc. There's only 1 level in the campaign that has significant variation. Overall it was a fun game and worth your time. The DLC Heroes of the Fleet is decent, I'd only grab it if it's on sale as it's pretty short, but it adds some decent scenarios and mechanics to the game.			"

												This is not an easy game, in fact it's one of the harder I've played in awhile, system requirements are off the charts too. That being said, it's still awesome. Anyone that has ever watched a gundam series should absolutely love this game. The strike suit handles just like I imagine a gundam would. It even has a transverse frame allowing you to switch between strike suit and jet modes on the fly. It's a great offering for a indie game, and support from the devs is proving to be pretty solid so far.			"

Loads of weapons to use (10 for each class with 4 x 2 clases existing).The Suit Mode is still the best, I dont understand the coments of 'hardly able to use it'It is very straight forward and you pretty much obliterate anything in sight.I agree the tutorial is lacking but that adds to the fun of the game for me!Gl hf			"

												Those looking for a starfighter game that brings back thoughts of nintendo 64? look no more. This game has the feel of a game from that console, albiet with graphics slightly more up to date. Now, I'm not saying the graphics are amazing (they definitely aren't), but their not bad either. The game is also just a LOT of dogfighting, but its a lot of fun. so here are the pros and consPros:+Has that nintedo 64 starwars shooter feel.			"

												Note: This is my impression after playing the base game without DLC or the Director's Cut, depending on the changes in the Director's Cut, some of these complaihnts may have been resolved.A space game in the vein of games like Star Wars: Rouge Squadron or Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance.  Due to the lack of games in this genre lately, I was greatly looking forward to this when I first heard of it.  Unfortunately, it didn't quite meet the mark.  The story starts out farcical, becomes mediocre, and then decides to be incomplete and farcical again on the final level.  When I first started playing, the controls felt too sensitive for me to fly straight, but this was solved by turning up the blind spot on the controls.  The difficulty spikes a couple times throughout the game, typically due to the targeting system not highlighting the targets you want it to in some levels, the ease of having your vision obstructed by explosions or damage preventing you from visually locating important objectives, or the dense, hyper-accurate turret concentrations on carriers.  The game also leaves you to figure out which weakpoints on large craft are actually important to kill in order to not fail the mission instead of telling you what the symbols mean.  It took me a while to come to the realization that the Strike Suit was mostly useful for its ability to kill massed enemies or bombard targets from beyond your normal range.  Also, collisions deal fixed damage regardless of speed or impact angle, which can frequently result in your instantaneous loss of all your shields from drifting too close to something while trying to kill a target.  Also, I found that it was necessary to rebind most of the weapon control keys to something else in order to not keep hitting the wrong button accidentally.Strike Suit Zero generally manages to be a game from a dead genre that reminds you that you want more games in the genre, but rarely manages to be even average at what it tries to do.

												Great indie game and space shooter. Bought during steam sale at 75% off definitely worth it! Soundtrack reminds me of battlestar galactica and the battles are epic as well. Immersive game. Also there is a bit of Mecha thrown in which is okay with me since I am an anime fan. Minor technical problems such as game sometimes plays windowed and had steam crash a few times. Don't let those issues stop you from playing an otherwise great indie game!			"

												Strike Suit Zero is a well-paced mission-based arcade style space odyssey set in the distant future when humans have colonized the galaxy, and a civil war has broken out among mankind. The player plays as a reformed fighter pilot who is re-commissioned to the front lines in a desperate suicidal struggle to stop the rebel onslaught against Earth, along with their new and mysterious weapon that is literally ripping holes through entire fleets and worlds. While you have very little interaction with the enemy faction, what are incredible are the believable archetypes of the allies and friends you make along the way. You will care very much about the allies you rescue and that rescue you from the perils of interstellar warfare. With themes from several science fiction settings and ominous overtones about the rise and fall of mankind, there is plenty of depth to be excited about as you meet new characters and face new challenges. The gameplay is magnificent and convincing; once you get ahold of the strike suit, you go from being a regular pilot hanging on to life with sheer grit to a space hero like unto those in anime of this genre, hell-bent on keeping your friends and comrades alive through each and every encounter. You will hang turns, glide around gigantic ships and launch attacks so devastating that afterwards you can't help but jump up and roar with righteous vindication. To that end, the protagonist and the enemies are so quiet that you are left space to imagine you are any kind of hero or anti-hero you like, the plot ambiguous enough to let you have your own adventure while still shaping the events and circumstances you fight your way through. Are you a grizzled space cowboy back for one last ride? Or are you a bloodthirsty convict, with nothing left but a war to fight? It's up to you to impose your personal motivations on the main character. In spite of or perhaps due to these intentional gaps in information, the story telling, the sound, the visuals and the music are all clearly a labor of love and do exactly what they're intended to do: Let you have your own robot space fighter fantasy.Are there negatives? Yes, a few. The game is too short. The director's cut is oddly paced and undercuts the original vision of the game. The combat is samey and the upgrades are extremely difficult, impossible in some cases, to obtain without replaying missions later on, which greatly pads out the playtime with replay. However, as an Indi title and one of the best games so far this millennium, all of these negatives can be completely overlooked. There are plenty of modes and versions for you to satisfy your desire to dogfight and ace your way to victory, and ultimately all add up to satisfying content. Never mind how amazing some of the mods are for this game.11/10. If you like arcade shooters, sci-fi, anime, space odyssey, warfare, dogfighting, or just stupidly impressive visuals, play this game. Strike Suit Zero is a fantastic time.			"

												I have not played other space flight simulators extensively, so I cannot review this game based on how it compares to others in the genre. I can say that the graphics, controls, and level design do deliver on one thing - immersion.When you're making a hard turn, going upside down to try and flank the ship on your tail, the tension is real, as is the feeling in the back of your mind that you are travelling through endless, empty space. When another computer controlled ship in your squadron swings by and bails you out of something or steals your kill, it feels like a real, chaotic dogfight.Possibly the most important immersive part of the game is, once you unlock the Strike Suit, how much it really does look and feel like you are piloting a Gundam. When you first get it, with the music playing in the background and all of the swarms of enemy ships, you completely annhilate almost everything you can see. Then, in the next mission, the learning curve picks up, and you start to feel the limitations of this awesome machine. Quickly, because of how powerful the strike suit is, you get thrown into messes that are too much for the ship alone, and you have to knuckle down and enhance your skills to keep up. Meanwhile, the war rages on, and its emotional toll is felt by all.Doesn't that sound just like the plot of most Gundam shows? I was impressed by how the designers used their game's difficulty curve to reinforce the feel of being that one pilot with the super weapon on whom everything depends. This game is pretty hard, or at least it was for me, and as the best hard games do, it pushed me to get better and really hunker down to get specials from the missions so that I was well equipped enough to handle later ones.The story is nothing to write home about, and some of the combat scenarios get repetitive, especially since you often have to replay missions to get power ups. But the overall atmosphere of the game? Superb. And that makes playing it a joy, even if part of you is thinking 'torpedos? Again?'			"
