												What is this? No, seriously. I'm beyond making jokes today. What in the name of whichever god, creation event or tentacle-waving space beast that managed to vomit up this galaxy is this catastrophe?I've played bad games on here before. We all have. We've all suffered that involuntary cringe when the 'Made in Unity' launch screen pops up, anticipating the sea of stock assets and buggy unoptimised crap that's about to come flooding towards us like that scene with the crimson elevator in The Shining, except with a tidal wave of livestock diarrhoea but... this?Bubonic: Outbreak isn't just lazy. Oh, that it were simply lazy. Lazy would just rip unmodified asset maps straight out of the pack they were bought from and use them for every single stage. Lazy would be taking the lockpicking and safe-cracking mini-games from one of those same packs and failing to ensure that they even functioned. Lazy would be forgetting to take the useless 'Journal' out of the game from a previous build so that should you activate it by accident, there's no way to remove it from the screen. Lazy would be the same enemy repeated ad infinitum throughout the game. Lazy would be neglecting to map any button for a player to read the notes. Lazy would be placing a script for a door key inside a safe and then not actually bothering to PHYSICALLY place a key inside that safe, leaving the player to just ♥♥♥♥ing guess that they were staring at anything other than thin mocking air.No, what makes this game special is that you're given a torch and a camera with two vision modes to make your way around: night vision and ghost vision. Ghost vision, as I'm sure you need spelling out for you, is the only way to see the spirits that will otherwise insta-kill you so guess which other two lighting methods become immediately redundant? Guess what you'll be staring at for the entire playthrough? That's right! A TINY NEON BLUE BOX. Wow, it's like a tour of all my favourite Unity assets IN GLORIOUS MIGRAINE-INDUCING 240p. This is an honest-to-god atrocity. £5.99 is a sick joke for something that will be begging to be played for £0.17p in the next sale or clinging to the arsehair of an IndieGala bundle. If you have to see it in action, my full review's below.

												After having no end of trouble getting the safe puzzle to actually play sound (after loading the game about 15 times I got sound & could continue), I played through a boring hedge maze, followed by a boring mine stage which I'm relatively sure is the same map used in the mines in Kidnapped & then a very long & boring sewer tunnel sequence & now I'm in a map that was the map used in the last level of Lumber Island: That Special Place. In what I hope is the last stage, I keep encountering a glitch where you bump into seemingly random geometry & it reloads the level & with no sprinting & a basically useless jump, re-doing this level for the 6th time has done me in; kind of wanted to see if this got good but seeing as it is 8 levels long & it seems like I should be fairly close to the end, I don't feel like I've been given the story at all.If you're hard up for a horror game to play, fine, the atmosphere in some sections is quite good; but overall, no.

												I think all you do in this game is walk around an old mansion filled with empty picture frames, open a safe then get killed by a ghost_ REPEAT_ if you like that you might be into this game_			"

												TL;DR is this game is missing a lot basic things like controls list, audio and video options and basic game direction.You have this camera that seems important to the gameplay, but you wouldn't know it because the game doesn't tell you about it or how to use it or why you need it. This game seems like a proof of concept demo, not a game that is 10 bucks.

												Despite the reveiws I got this feb 13 for $8.99 and I just now got to play it and not bad needs some work but other than that its really good although I think you guys discarded this game I bleave you guys could make it better if you tryed, one thing that you should really fix is the jump scare in the kitchen it was abunch of yelling than this face showed up and I died both in game and of laughter in real life. But I did enjoy this game and I do recommend it (even if it was alittle buggy at times)			"
