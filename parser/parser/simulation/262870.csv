												This game is outright horrible. Apart from the epic title music, there's no other music in the game. The sound effects are minimal. The interface is unhelpful and the mission progress is baffling. The game is nearly unplayable.The most frustrating element is that the tasks are incredibly vague and difficult to locate. This game is mostly about finding small things like watches or footprints, but the graphics are so poor that these are nearly impossible to locate and the game does not make it any easier to identify. To make things worse, the game doesn't even tell you what to look for. Mission 5 involves searching for a red hat, but when you get to the area you waste time looking for a hat, but you're actually meant to find footprints that lead to the next clue area.The stamina system is unworkable. You get tired from running or riding the bike - which is fair - but there are only two ways to regain stamina: either wait, or buy energy bars. Waiting is unfeasible because you only have a few minutes to complete each mission. Energy bars cost points, which are earned by completing missions. However, EVERYTHING you buy and use is persistent. If you use an energy bar and then abort the mission, the game saves that, which means you lose both your points and your item even though you left the mission. You could literally make the campaign unbeatable and you have to start another one from scratch.The game is also buggy. On mission failures (very common when you're not told what to look for), the game may not take you back to the menu and you cannot quit the game, forcing you to force-quit the game.Presentation is mystifyingly poor. There is NO ambient noise. No birds, no animals, no wind, no water. The visuals are downright lazy. There are perhaps five tree models and the same tree has clearly copy/pasted into an area to save time. The items are often plain models without any skins rendered. Then there are invisible walls everywhere. Don't touch water by the way: water is death!The worst thing is that the title is an outright lie. Except perhaps ""Recovery"", since you spend most of your time finding lost hats and mp3 players. This is certainly no simulation. You go to this vague waypoint, look for something undefined, click on it, and done. There's no rescue or first-aid or any interactivity AT ALL.The game basically allows you to cheat in order to get through the levels. You can call in a helicopter to take you ANYWHERE on the map at the cost of points, which is desirable and less expensive than having to ride there and consume energy bars. And if that doesn't excite you, by aborting the mission, you unlock the next mission anyway.There are 40 something missions and they are literally all the same.I'm a sucker for these cheesy little buys, but this isn't even worth the low cost. You are buying a headache. Playing this will necessitate a search & rescue for your sanity.Video review here:

			10 days into January, and I may have played the worst game of 2014. Is this meant to be serious? Note: Apologies for the volume.

												You don't play this game free roam.You play missions that are pre determined.The gameplay is not bad....BUTYou get an objective like ""go find this thing"" and on the map it is supposed ""high-light"" the  location of where to start searching for said thing or person.I've played about 7 missions so far and was only able to complete 3 - 4 of them because the map location is not showing up.I really hope this gets updated...gets add-ons etc.I believe it would be a very fun simulator.As of now I cannot recommend this game because to me it seems as though it is in ""Alpha"" stage.From what I see this is supposedly a completed game.If this isn't alpha this it has some rather annoying bugs that need to be fixed.What I like:-Graphics.    --On the fantastic setting they're beautiful.-Concept.-Gameplay.  (Or what it should be)What I DON'T like:-The game does not seem to be configured for PC (Unexpected frame drops when turning etc.)-Broken Map.-The fact that the missions are TIME based.-Energy meter (If this runs out, the mission is over and you fail..you run out of energy so fast it aint funny, after 3 minutes of straight jogging you lose the mission because ""You are unable to go any further"").What I want:-To be configured properly for the PC-Free Roam <--- This would be very interesting.-Possible CO-OP mission.-The fixing of minor bugs- UPDATES PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF RAPTOR JESUS UPDATES.Hopefully I will be able to review this game again in the near future...and be able to recommend it.I really like the concept of this game and believe this kind of a simulator could ""make-it""If you want to spend the money on it now, go ahead.BUT BE WARNED THIS GAME FEELS AS THOUGH IT IS UNFINISHED. EXPECT SOME MINOR BUGS!!			"

												This game is nothing more then a point and click version of hide and seek. All you do is pick crap up off the ground. This game should be really called click and search,.. no rescue, no simulation.			"

												I feel like it would be fun with a story. But the stamina bar is too ridiculous. If you bike too much you'll pass out and it's game over. I have not seen stamina this bad since I Am Alive			"

												Perhaps one of the worst 'simulation' games I have ever played (or attempted to play, in this instance).As another reviewer stated, the missions are exactly the same. Fail? No problem, just keep going. It's not like you'll be doing anything different anyway.I am absolutely baffled as to why I paid $11 for this - lured in by that epic starting music I suppose. I spent a good thirty minutes repeating mission three trying to find the next set of animal prints after finding the first. They don't seem to exist. Sure, there's a couple stags running around, but nothing within the ridiculous red-circle-of-searchiness you'll be chasing throughout the entirety of the missions at hand. Some woman's pocket watch? Failed. Not enough time because I was too busy riding my bike like a madwoman trying to get to another poorly-designed log cabin. Let's go chase a hat instead, shall we?Ambient sounds, music, animal design...they're all lacking, with the first two nonexistent. Enjoy the pitter-patter of your own feet, or the vacant emptiness as you zoom along on a bike with your thumbs obviously up your bum because you darn sure aren't holding the handle-bars. Gameplay is laughable when it comes to the graphics at hand. Look to your left, look to your right, and see the same thing, with a few smoothed hills. Try to turn up the draw-distance because you *know* a game like this is something your GeForce GTX 780Ti can handle. Hah! Think again, as you will get constant freezes every 5-10 seconds that last 2 seconds themselves before you can continue. I had to turn the draw so far down it was like I was in the map editor of Deer Hunter on Windows 95 all over again (if memory serves me right...perhaps the editor was superior and I am not doing it justice).Take it from me, this game is complete and utter rubbish. Don't bother buying it - there are better sims out there. Only Pro? Sitting in the menu listening to the music and pretending you're about to go and save the world.			"

												I'm really not quite sure what the developers were aiming for when they designed this simulator. What is claimed to be a 'Search and Rescue' simulator is more like a 'chase the red dot, and find the tiny objects hidden in the grass' simulator. You'll spend mission after mission traversing the countryside, searching for asthma inhalers, inflatable crocodiles, baseball caps, boots, and if you're really lucky, an immobile human being. Although the people looked more like broken animatronics slowly thrashing in the grass than any kind of real, injured person.You have two modes of transport: your feet and your trusty bicycle. Although your bicycle seems to tear across terrain at the speed of an F16 Falcon fighter jet. Furthermore, your character seems to suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome, and has trouble traversing the landscape for more than a few minutes at a time. Whether you're on foot or on bike, you'll likely become exhausted before you can complete your arbitrary mission. Once you get exhausted, your boss blessedly will end your outing... ""You're in no condition to continue, Ranger.""You'll encounter all sorts of wildlife that meander around aimlessly, oftentimes with their hooves slicing through the air and failing to come into contact with the ground. They do not mind your presence, until you come within spitting distance, and then they'll leg it like a bank robber on methamphetamines. I approached an alligator, largely because I was bored out of my skull. I expected it to lurch forward and tear me limb from limb, a fine diversion from the monotony of collecting lost miscellania. But it did not even turn its head to look at me; it scrambled away like a frightened rabbit, and disappeared into the opaque water of a nearby river. There was nary a pixel shader or transparent surface to prove that there was ever an alligator there.Graphics wise, the game is not particularly acceptable. Don't expect graphics along the lines of theHunter 2013 or Crysis. I turned the graphics quality up, and my hefty gaming rig experienced repeated stuttering and pausing. The grass became so dense I could barely find anything, and it even began poking up through the solid floor of my ranger station and through solid rock. I turned the graphics quality down, and it felt like I was playing on my old Nintendo 64. And in the default graphics quality midpoint, the object and grass pop-in was so obvious and awkward that I began to feel like a mystical druid from a discarded fantasy novel, causing plants to spring up and grow in seconds, whereever I tread. I also noticed z-battling issues on some of the textures (flickering between two textures for two objects occupying the same physical space), particularly on the battlements of the fort.The boss of the ranger station, who only appears in text messages and never actually seems to appear in game, makes the attempt to be a lighthearted sidekick and ally, and the primary source of the weak 'stories' that might exist. He makes 'quips' when you find the wrong objects during your missions, and makes lousy excuses as to why he is not taking the missions himself: ""I'd do it, but I've... uhh... I've got a migraine."" One particularly strange mission requests you to find a little girl's diary, and a couple of emphatic comments are made about never, ever looking inside. Presumably she keeps her plans for world domination within.The game might be fun for people looking for a very simple hunt and click game, and who are willing to overlook the aforementioned shortcomings, but I could not tolerate it for long. Perhaps worth the price for a few dollars, but not full price.			"

												As sad as it is, the graphics and 3D affect is quite poor and some of hte missions are so limited on time that the simulator quickly become a headacke.After a hour of playing this, i started to ask myself why am i playing this...

												In short: terrible game.longer story: bad graphics even on ""fantastic""; lagging (i have quiet a good computer, but this game manage to freeze every 10 secs for 1-2 or seconds); nothing realistic in here, which is quiet a negative point, seeing that this game calls itself an simulator. your riding on a unbelivable fast bike, loosing stamania like hell, which you than have to refill with candybars all the time. basically your just running arround from point A to B which is almost everytime highlated for you on the map, looking for baseballcaps or mp3 players lying around in the gras.this game calls himself a Rescue Simulation, but you dont even have some basic tools like a compass, a watch or binoculars. but a map, that is always showing your exact position and candy vending machines in every ranger station.

												First Impressions: http://www.cublikefoot.com/video/recovery-search-rescue-simulation-first-impressions/Recovery Search & Rescue Simulation is a simulator for wannabe park rangers, by the team over at Excalibur Publishing. It's supposed to teach you how to be a park ranger and I, not being a park ranger, have no idea if they've accomplished this. If the game really depicts how a park ranger's life is, then it must be pretty dull.Recovery Search & Rescue Simulation basically has you run around looking for different items every mission. It's okay if you fail a mission, because the next one is unlocked just for trying. I abused this mechanic, as I could not complete the first several missions, due to the sheer difficulty of each task. There's two problems with most of these missions, one being that my character's stamina would rapidly drain, even with energy bars equipped. Some missions I could not even get to where the objective was simply because I ran through three stamina bars trying to bike there. I may be doing something wrong, but I wasn't really instructed with how that works.The second problem with the game's missions was the fact that each was the same. The majority of the missions were all ""fetch quests"", were I was tasked with finding an item (or animal footprints) in a general area marked on my map. I failed to even accomplish something as simple as that because there was little indication of where these items could be other than a red circle around the general area of the item on the map. You've got to be a hardcore ranger in order to complete some of these tasks.

												In a sentence, I owe my life to this game.  Before this game, I was an ordinary man, not too different from yourself, perchance.  I'd get through the daily grind, and ""do my bit"" for society, and at the weekend, I'd relax with a glass of Mountain Dew and a session of CS:GO.  This routine became so familiar to me, however, that I started to become disillusioned to the very idea of life itself.  I started to question myself existentially and berate my psyche with grating interrogations; Why am I here?  What do people do when they go home at night? What do people think of me?I developed a seemingly insatiable thirst for spirituality, and moreover, happiness.  I felt numb, and I felt like nothing in life would be able to satisfy me again.  I thought back to when I was a child, when I'd climb trees just to lose myself in the   breeze, I'd stay up to wish on the stars, and I'd sing with the birds until voice was faded.I decided to end my life.  I travelled out to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, and I was prepared to end it all.  I booked a hotel room, and blasted some cash on hookers and drugs.  On the stroke of midnight, I tied the SCART lead from the hotel VCR around my gullet and stood atop the mini-fridge.  I counted 3... 2... 1...As I was about to leap to my foul demise, I heard the chime from my phone, signalling that I had recieved an e-mail.  Huh.  It was PewDiePie, he gifted me a copy of Recovery: Search & Rescue Simulation.It was a sign.Pewds searched for me, and he rescued me.  By playing this game every weekend, I too can spent my time rescuing others, and helping people.  I'm finally at peace with myself, and I know why Im here, on earth.Summary:Found myself11/10			"
