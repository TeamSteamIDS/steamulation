												First off, ""Fully Destructible"" is a complete falsehood. This fact is important in highlighting the biggest problem with this software: the group that made it just doesn't care about their audience.As quickly as possible, they try to force-feed you everything about the character you're playing and the situation your in. There's so much information that nothing stands out, so it isn't clear what the atmosphere is. Suddenly, you are driving a vehicle capable of movement in any direction and the controls aren't explained. Your character is inside a maze where nothing about the environment pops out to clue you in as to where you should go, and half the time the waypoint system lies to you (what did I expect, though, right?).On top of all that, you are under attack, and to make a very difficult situation even worse, if your vehicle takes damage you might have a breach, which leaks out your oxygen unless you find a repair powerup (read: rare health kit), turning your screen dark as it slowly kills you.The game is mercilessly convoluted and brutally unforgiving to it's player. At one point while trying to find the ""exit"", I found an opening and headed that direction to escape, only to realize as I was blasted to bits that the ship I saw outside was THE ENEMY, and after reloading realizing that I was supposed to come out of the doorway, then turn AWAY from the opening to see the doorway which was the intended direction.I played with a friend and found one of the audio parts hilarious:Evilsupervisor: ""Did you exterminate them all?""Evilsurbordinate : ""Most of them. One or two miners escaped, but they have no idea what's going on"".How right they were, how right they were.Save yourself the disappointment.			"

												This game has the privilege of being one of only a handful from my Steam library that I've actually asked to have permanently removed from my account by Steam support.Cashing in on the nostalgia for classics like the Descent series (all of which are vastly superior to this dreadful ""game""), Miner Wars 2081 is a broken mess.Everything about the game is just ""off"" somehow.  The scale is really weird and difficult to describe.  Rather than feeling like you're flying around in a spaceship inside an enormous space station, it feels like you're driving a Micro Machine around someone's living room; nothing's got a sense of proportion or frame of reference and the design of the space station interiors seems designed to confuse, with little in the way of landmarks or anything that might actually make it look like it could be inhabited by actual people.The combat mechanics are basic and the menu/inventory system is a nightmare to navigate, let alone understand.The voice acting is pretty poor and what little I could glean of the story from the opening mission made no sense, being totally without context.  After the first mission ends you're dumped into a world/solar-system map with no idea where to go next or why.  Pretty much wherever you do decide to go, some people will autoamtically attack you, but it's not made clear why that's happening either, or if any of the ships are meant to be friendly.Finally, the setting is so utterly absurd that it does nothing to help this sorry excuse for a game.  The idea that anything on/around Earth could survive its destruction by the Sun exploding is total nonsense.  That functioning societies could spring up from the debris and even start building new structures in a scant few years after an apocalyptic event is the metaphorical icing on this turd of a cake.I cannot urge you strongly enough - do not buy this game under any circumstances.

												I supported this game from the very get go.  They said ""Pay 25 dollars for Alpha.. the game will get better."" They promised an MMO.  The game never really materialized what they planned.  The developers never kept their promise.  Now I come to the forums to see if the game has gotten better and I am surprised to see I am permanently banned from the forums.  This is what is wrong from early access games.  Stay away like the plague from games like this where you are giving your hard earned money away just to be mistreated.  To the developers: I don't care whether you ban me from your stinking forums.  Keep your game.. lose your customer.(Edited spelling errors)			"

												Miner Wars 2081 promises epic space battles, but instead gives you a frustrating game of resource micro-management. Every amenity on your ship - from ammunition to oxygen to fuel - is limited, and runs out rather quickly. Even if the vast, bland environments were actually worth looking around, the game simply wouldn't allow you any exploration due to your limited resources. When you finally actually do get to fighting, the balance is atrocious, with some enemies barely leaving a scratch on your hull, while others in the same area annihilate you as soon as you get in range.I was hoping for a spiritual successor to the Descent/Freespace series, as those remain among my favorites of all time, but sadly this is nowhere near pulling it off. Stay far, far away.			"

												Horrible cash grab of a game. The 0.7 hours I put into this allowed me to discover just how bad it is. If you try to play singleplayer you will find the odds to be ridiculously uneven against you, with the developers hoping you will pay to unlock cheats. If you play multiplayer it is no different except that even if you survive til the end together, at least one of you will run out of fuel before reaching the end, because they do not even bother to give both of you fuel/ammo/health pickups.Do not get this game. I'm disappointed that steam continues to support such a complete waste of money. Keep an eye out for other ""indie"" games that are done by similarly corrupt developers.			"

												Please don't spend money on this, even though I've only played it for half an hour there is so much wrong with this game it's unreal:The control scheme is clunky, playing with a mouse will require constant fiddling with sensitivity, playing with a controler is a waste of time as there are not enough buttons. If like me you have a joystick and think that that will work you will struggle even more (as the unified sensitivity will make it unplayable)the graphics are meh, for the price I wouldn't really expect much more, but it is VERY dull with little to help the colours of space other than a ridiculous bright sky (would you call it a sky?)The HUD is broken, yep, broken;the guns seem to be a 2D image that renders behind, yes - BEHIND, the 3d objects in the scene (I didn't even realise that my ship HAD guns until I left the starter station and found weird 2d objects moving arround with me clipping through every other visible object.mining doesn't make sense (at least to me it doesn't)the AI of both your teammate and enemies is pretty uselessupgrades seem pointless.For a game claiming to be ""miner wars"" there is very little mining and the war involved is hardly worth fighting.save your money.

												A bland story, a ""open world"" that again is bland and boring. This was supposed to be an MMO out in space however they either didnt have the budget or didnt have the right people to make it. So we have this game instead.Dont even get me started on the resource system that is in place. Apparently in the near future its going to look a like the present. You need oxygen and unlike star trek that has a life support system this game has a scuba type oxygen tank meter in place. Save yourself the $10 dollars from a dead game. Go buy almost anything else besides this game. You have been warned.			"

												This game was promissed to be something along the lines of Space Engineers and Descent. As it turned out its just an arcade shooter.Additionally, I got blocked by the Developer on Steam forum for saying truth and asking for answers (and i was much more calm than now/in this review).Developper lied to the pre-Steam customers and closed his ears for any criticism. Judging by the way he handles Space Engineers PR it is clear he has learned the PR lessons well already but it doesn't change the fact his actions were just unprofessional.			"

												Miner Wars is a shoddy, half-done mess whose developer realised at some point in development that they couldn't deliver on any of their promises, and rather than doing right by their community, decided to cut and run by shoehorning in a half-baked story campaign and calling it a finished product. That they still dare to refer to it as open-world is a farce. Avoid, and be wary of the developer's other products.			"

												The only way I can describe this game is predatory. It's grossely misleading - class action lawsuit misleading. And I don't use that term lightly. They compare it to Descent with a fully destructable enviornment, but it's more like an amateur Unity project.First off, you need fuel. Remember those old Nintendo games where you had to constantly pick up fuel to keep moving? The ones where  taking just a second longer to get the fuel meant losing the game? Well, imagine that in a 3d enviornment while you're being shot at and you have no clue where the fuel tanks are. Do you get into cover (yes, you have to take cover in your space fighter)? Then you just used fuel and probably can't reach the next tank. Do you rush to the next tank and fight from there? Then you'll get your oxygen system taken out and die.The AI always knows where you are and has pixel perfect aiming, even when you're trying to shoot back at a target no bigger than a pixel. There are hardened turrets stationed everywhere.So some stuff is destructable. Tunnel through it and flank them? Nope. That uses your fuel. You HAVE to take the shortest route possible or you run out of gas.Even better, if you're fighting outside, there is a solar flare every 10 seconds or so. And yes, it will kill you. So you have to spend more fuel trying to hide in a meteor cave (how does this protect you from a SOLAR FLARE again?) or try to dash through a cluster of enemies which while tear you to pieces.On the odd chance you do collect some resources, they're just used for a really basic crafting system.Bottom line - stay away from this garbage and the developer. They also made Space Engineers, and I refuse to give them another dime until they fix this game.			"

												To start: I loved playing this game. To a point. The controls seemed awkward at first, but once I got the hang of them, it turned into sheer awesome. That is, for a while. I've played through every single level of this game. Twice, actually. First complaint: I have never received a single achievement. There are 12 achievements. They are all based on story progression. I have none of them. I beat the game twice. There is an issue there. Next, the... sheer incompleteness of it. There are a huge number of extra missions and things, and... Well, you see, by the end of the game you have three allies. Before a certain point, you only have one. Then, I think, you go up to three. Then back down to two, then up to three again. No matter what time during the game you venture to the optional side-missions, you WILL have all three allies. Even if you have no idea who the hell they are, or if you currently believe that ally to have DIED HEROICALLY. He's just hanging around with you in a sidemission.But that's not even the worst of it. Some of the sidemissions are just plain crap. You have, basically, a bunch of random crap that's really not useful at all and maybe a few mineable things just... there. Around you. Blow 'em up if you like. Maybe a few enemies will wordlessly appear. There's no mission. It's just... There. Pardon for the lack of specifics, but it's been a while since I last played, but... One of the 'sidemissions' is New Moscow, or something like that. The Russian's big main city... Er... Sorry, did I say city? I meant a few defense turrets mounted on buildings that you can blow up if you shoot a hell of a lot. There's not even a shop.Which reminds me, if you expect all the shops to be actually functional, you'll be sorely disappointed. There's quite a few that are just completely and totally nonfunctional. Heck, the 'shop here' button shows up. Mash it 'til your keyboard breaks. Have fun. No point to it.And then there's the mining. I could have enjoyed that so much. I love mining in games. I LOVE open world sandboxes. But you know what? I hated it here. I'd prefer to just waste a missile on a uranium deposit instead of take the time to actually mine it. And I tried. Oh, I tried SO hard. But the default mining equipment is the ONLY mining equipment. There's no way to enhance it. So the 3 or 4 seconds it takes to mine ANYTHING will ALWAYS be that way. And it's just plain not worth it. Not in the slightest. MAYBE if you're mining one of the really, really valuable resources, but still. You can find more money by just looking around and looting things. And don't bother with the secret rooms. They have nice loot, but not nice enough.And beyond that, sometimes the game just stacks crap against you to a stupid extent. One level, the offensive turrets are literally indestructible. Literally. You actually HAVE TO disable them through the control console for them, or you won't even be able to progress in the mission. I blew up the generator that powers the console for those turrets... And wound up trapped in the level, basically. I couldn't do anything at all because I had disabled the console which I literally could not progress without accessing. And the game just... kept going. Didn't really care.And one of the secret rooms I mentioned before? I found it. I could see inside it. I then spent ALL MY AMMO and EVERYTHING I could think of on trying to get into the damned thing. There was nothing. At all. Not in the slightest.This game is a brilliant, beautiful START. ... But it's only a START. It needs to be refined. It needs to be FINISHED. It needs to be added to.And the worst part? The very end of it is just an enormous cliffhanger. And I haven't heard of Miner Wars 2082. They got their money and they're done.You see this on sale? Maybe you get it. Just don't expect things to be perfect. It won't be perfect. It'll disappoint you in a dozen different ways. But if you can get used to the controls, like I did, you might just find you enjoy it enough to bother paying... say... five bucks. I don't recommend it at-price. If you get a sale, MAYBE. But don't expect it to be complete. You've gotta take it into your own hands a little. And don't be afraid to change the keybindings. I definitely had to.			"

												Bunch of scumbags lied about what I purchased and never provided the second game that I also purchased with it; the Miner Wars MMO.No refunds. No compensation. Just a notification that they'd since moved onto other games; Space Engineers and more recently medieval engineers. Not even a free copy of either games as an apology for abandoning this one. Oh no, instead I had to buy Space Engineers myself.And had I looked at the developer of Space Engineers before buying it, I wouldn't have bought it either.			"

												Terrible.  Creators pushed pre-purchases promising a huge open ended sandbox experience reminiscent of freelancer crossed with descent.  What was delivered was a 2-3 hour linear campaign that never lets you explore the environment.  Combat is dull and the campaign literally ends just as it gets interesting, leaving you floating in space with no objective or anything else to do.The multiplayer is non existent, simply dropping several people into the same world as single player, but with no missions or, again, anything to do but fire randomly at each other.Seems they're trying to do the same with their newest game Space Engineers.  PLEASE don't fall for it, they love to over promise and under deliver.			"

												I bought this game for the same reason as everyone else: it promised a lot of neat ideas.  From reading the other reviews, it appears that the game was a disappointment, but I never got to experience that, becaue it simply didn't work for me.  The game claims that it runs on XP, but my XP machine, which happens to be able to run any game (later than 2000) that I've attempted to play, crashed on startup.  I googled the problem and it appeared to be fairly common.  I wasn't surprised considering that the game (at the time) was new, and simply gave the developers a helpful email that featured what I attempted to do to fix the problem, and gave them my crash logs.Someone emailed me back, and very politely thanked me for the helpful email, and promised that they would fix the issue.  After trying to launch it again each week for the next month, it wasn't ever resolved, and I lost interest in the game.  Some six months later, I attempted to play again, figuring that it must be fixed by now, and yet it wasn't.  So much for promising that they would fix it.  It was my mistake for paying 20 dollars for this game before at least waiting to see whether it was promising or not, but I've learned my lesson.			"

												This game is co-op, and I didn't realize it for the longest time. People would join my game and not say anything and I didn't notice any sort of announcement of them joining me. After quite a few hours, I found an NPC with a odd name and behaviour. When I shot at it, it shot back. No other friendly NPC does that, and that's when I realized I had probably experienced most of the game with a stranger by my side.And it spooked the hell out of me. ♥♥♥♥. There's no telling what kind of stupid ♥♥♥♥ some random shmuck saw me do. The game is a pretty good descent clone. Plenty of claustraphobic space station dungeon crawls. The mining element is fun as well, not to mention you can blow holes in anything not manmade. The galaxy map and the ability to go where-ever when-ever is also pretty awesome. I think some people would be turned off by the voice acting, but I liked how campy it was. But there is a steep learning curve. You need to keep oxygen and fuel in good supply, they will run out quicker than you'd think. I feel like modern space ships are better at storing/using oxygen. As for fuel, you can shut off your engine and just float around space to travel long distances so its not as much of a problem. Your starting machine gun becomes inefficient very quickly, which sucks because its the only gun you can find tons of ammo for. Your ship is also quite fragile and most enemies have hitscan machine guns. If you cant find cover or knock them around with missles, your ability to dodge their attacks depends mostly on the distance between you. Descent got it right by making the hitscan machine gun and the enemies that use it uncommon. To top off my list of complaints, raising money is hard. Maybe I didn't play long enough to find the stupid easy way of getting cash but a new ship costs millions and I was lucky if I had a hundred thousand on me.I realize I have a lot of compliants, but I swear I enjoyed the game and would recommend it to anyone looking for a new descent-like experience.The game launched with some crazy DRM scheme, but its gone now. If you see anyone complain about it, ignore them.Also, Nazi Space Blimps.			"

												I cant really say much to this game, because I wasnt really able to play it.While most of the other players never got behind the loading screen or the main screen, me and my Coop Partner were able to open a Coop Lobby. But starting into the first mission, it was mostly a total confusing mess:The controls are strange and not very movement friendly. Most of the time you find yourself helpless rotating around, looking for the enemy shooting at you, never having the feeling of flying through space. It feels like controlling the spectator camera of an FPS game, that controlling a space ship moving through vacuum of space.The missions are unclear and hard to understand. You shoot at everything that shoots at you and try to follow the objective keys, which is very irritating and boring.The game is full of stuff, that seems to be really important, but is never explained to you. It seems that you need fuel, air and ammunition, also you can somehow get new weapons and equipment. But all of that is unclear and really hard to understand. Often you find yourself getting shot and starting to loose air until you die, which isnt very satisfying. Also in Coop you instantly respawn with 1% health, just to get killed again.Last but not least: Disconnects, asyncron gameplay and bugs. It wasnt very easy to maintain a nice multiplayer round.All in all, we never got to the end of the first chapter and deinstalled the game. I know, many of the problems were a player-side problem of understanding the game, but it is so frustrating and boring, that you simply dont have the mood to understand it.Beside of that it lures you with an open world, that simply doesnt exist. Maybe it is somewhere in there, but we never found it.			"

												When I first bought this game I was hoping I could step off my ship... so if you're looking for that it's not here!However, this game does bring a certain addiction with it. The gameplay is relatively simple, your ship is flown in a bigger ship that travels around a certain area of space which is controlled by different countries or factions. There is a storyline to follow and is a decent one at that. Like every game I play though I base its greatness largely on the game play. This game is about what you can expect from any first person space shooter game with a multitude of upgrades available (from armor, to weapons, to ammunition type, engines etc...). Adding the ability to dig through rock or mine adds a different paradigm to the game (... sort of. You can mine and then sell the rocks/element types). There is a different drill though if you press ""m"" that just rips through any asteroid in your way. This is not only pretty cool to mess with physical features of the map, but launching a few missiles also changes the shape or hole size in the asteroid.Although I personally like playing it, for it to really stand out and be something else and differentiate itself from any other game I can't really say. It is definitely a fun game to play, and worth a buy if on sale. The amount of control you are able to have on how your ship moves/rotates/displaces itself is quite notable in this game. If you really like having control of your space craft, this is it! Beware though, some players may find this repetitive.

												Gameplay is punishing and unpleasant, exacerbated by bad framerates and load times. Runs badly on hardware way above recommended spec.The developers appear to have made a pretty involved implementation of an Elite / Freelancer style game here, with mining, equipment hacking and terrain alteration. However, they promptly make an utter hash of it by starting their - extremely complicated - game in media res, with alarms and explosions and characters screaming at the player. There's a reason why Freelancer starts its player in a calm spot and introduces its game mechanics one at a time. Miner Wars 2081 completely missed that concept. This flaw culminates in characters screaming at you while you are trying to read tutorial pop-ups.Miner Wars 2081 tries to have a combat oriented campaign but sabotages itself in several ways. The combat design is atrocious and the missions devolve into ""please now fly at a turret which will kill you in 0.5 seconds and is already pointing at you"". The level designs heavily punish attempting to do anything amusing or sneaky to go around or sneak up on enemies. For no apparent reason, there isn't a quicksave / quickload feature, only unmarked autosave checkpoints, so the game becomes tedious and painful if you get stuck at some obstacle, having to repeat the same actions over and over again to get back to where you can try again. Specifically because of the fact that they've tried to implement a broad Elite style game with features like mining, there's inventory micro-management gumming up the combat sections.			"

Both PC's DMZ'd and forwarded to proper ports. Both PC's firewall exceptions and/or disabled. There should have been no issues.

												Disappointment. I didn't expect Descent, just something like it. At least get the combat right. Something right. But this game is so unoptimized that despite a realtively okay graphics, computers struggle with it. The combat is repetive and the resources for combat is not handled well, resulting in ships stock piled with supplies to the gills. Inventory management is annoying at best, frustrating at worse. Resource management? Unncessary non-sense. Joystick is supported, but done ♥♥♥♥ poor. The ship moves like it's on a swivel, instantly switching back and forth like a person's head despite being a fricken' space ship. Descent is my game. This game is a mockery to 6DOF combat and space sim alike. I've never experienced such sadness as I did when I was first trying this game. If you are seeking a successor to the rare, but potent 6DOF combat... this is not it. Hopefully NEON is better.I will say, fighting with little blips at 500 meters away is not really fun, and feels more like I'm trying to play Freespace again, but without dog fight like mechanics... it loses any sense of enjoyment. It should be tight, focused combat with diverse foes that present unique challenges. Not the same enemy over and over with a few evil turrets.			"

												Lets talk about what this game is and not what it was meant to be, that's mostly why it has it's undeserved negativity around it.It is a rather basic arcade shooter, it is a bit flat if you go to random sectors, but it does have some open world aspects. In some areas you can stop to mine things and if you look in the right places (templar zones) you can find some really good treasure.This isn't relly that bad of a game, I quite enjoyed it for what it is, and that is a sort of arcade style 3d space shooter with a well thought out inventory system and a nice bit of freedom despite not being open world.Despite what everyone else says that this game was a disappointment, in it's current state it's actually okay.

												Background: Anyone else around here remember Descent from MS-Dos and Win 95? Steam had Descent 1/2/3 on the store at one time, really old Gems from the birth of the PC Gaming Era. Miner Wars 2081 is a fast paced 6x shooter with a flat story line attached to the side.  This mashup of a game. So you pilot a space faring mining drone, capsule, pod; Ship. It’s hard for me as a space sim fanatic to say you’re in a Ship in this game. Anyways.  It has your typical storyline with the Russians as a copout for the enemy. As you progress through the game you are able to buy new weapons that go on your Arms on the Ship, stronger shields, different hulls, but you never really bust out of First person Cockpit View.  To me everything in this game feels small, which is weird because the maps in this game are actually very large in physical graphical size. I get lost on the maps sometimes, it just has a weird feel to me. Your ship also has a mining towcable + grinder on the front that you extend into rocks and pick up everything from gas to precious metals that you can sell for ammo and upgrades. Final Thoughts: With as many game reviews as I do, this one is the hardest one for me to explain with words. I didn’t love this game, but I didn’t hate it either. Definitely watch gameplay videos before buying this one gang.  "

												This review is long overdue for a game I consider to be worth the $4 bucks it's on sale for now.   Dear reader, you've probably seen the overwhelming negative reviews for this game.  Take the time to read mine.Let's talk about positives.  * If you like 6DOF like Descent, or some of its clones this game does the job nicely.  * Environments are fully destructible (this can be in issue on some missions, like if there's a terminal checkpoint you have to access but it's been blown away)  * Weapons for the most part are ballistic, and energy based weapons like lasers are non-existent.  * Levels are ""sandbox"" in nature.  One example I'd use is, you can attack an asteroid base through the front door with all kinds of defense turrents  coming at you... Or you can fly to the other side and blast through the asteroid, and knock out the power generator from the back disabling all the turrents.* Very cool game engine.  Graphics are pretty tight, sound is good, levels are big.  I don’t have crashes on my hardwareVoice acting is top notch.   We have to do some focus here. Steve Blum, Beau Billingslea, Wendee LeeMost people aren't going to know these names unless they're super Otaku and into anime.   It's the cast of the English version of Cowboy Bebop.   Either that or it's some very good impersonators (it's not)  (You should watch it if you never have, amazing) After realizing who the voice actors were, the games overall feel and tone took on a whole new meaning to me.  Your character is Spike.Negatives.A community  hell-bent on saying the entire game is ruined on a few added features.  At one point the dev’s tried to put online DRM into the game, and it seemed like that’s when the brigaiding of negative reviews began (coming from reddit) The feature was removed, but the community is still jilted. This is perhaps the biggest negative about the game.  You might not even buy it at $4 bucks, because of the bad reviews.OK now for some actual negatives.* Angry Video Game Nerd professes his love for “Megaman X” because of how the first stage teaches you how to play the game.  I don’t think there’s enough of that in Miner Wars.  The first level *should* be a little slower.  Instead it’s “BAM!”, and the player has no time to learn the controls, or how to use the weapons properly.* Too destructable sometimes.  There are key terminals/checkpoints that need to be used at places in the game that can get destroyed by NPC fire.   *Multiplayer is a ghosttown* Development has somewhat ceased.  Advice to Keen.  You’re doing good on your other games.  You *might* want to revisit this one.  Maybe tie it into the Space Engineers universe.Advice to gamers.  Don’t expect this to be anything more than a 3d platformer get key open door 6dof game.  If you enjoy the genre, the game is worth it. "

This game you never leave your ship but is very interesting for the combat experience you can have. I enjoyed the game on the aspect of the dog fights, this game still has its flaws and will feel like your lost any time your trying to get to some place and explore. This game is good for the price that it is, but I would also say its also worth waiting for a sale to get it.*edit* Not worth getting any more, after playing all the way through to the end and the story just ending, and you don't even have a system map to help you get around your prety much just screwed once you get to the end of the storyline.

												I don't know where to start to say that this game's a disaster.  There's little player feedback from your 'extra resources' you're allowed to carry around.  Take damage and you have a repair kit?  Not giving you that feedback because the 'extra' you have isn't shown on the HUD.  Basically once the HUD starts showing a deficit you're ♥♥♥♥ed.  The games' missions are interesting and it has this tinge of nostalgia, but the 'bunches of systems to explore' kinda feels silly when there's no real 'go off and do your own thing' beyond the main story missions.

												The techincal achievement of the game is quite impressive - Large asteriod bases with destructable surfaces, seamless combat inside and out.  The backstory is quite original, but the in game universe doesn't quite feel real; the characters on the comms are undercooked, and locations are underpopulated at times.The inventory system is clunky and a little confusing, load times are long (unless your game's installed on an SSD.)Combat is okay, but enemies are more quantity than quality, they don't require much more than firing at the right spot for a while until they explode.  There's just not a lot of ""I"" in the ""AI.""There's a crafting element I haven't explored yet that offers an interesting layer to the gameplay. It's easy to spot the problems, but there's a lot of orginality and risk-taking in this title; It's an impressive game from an indie developer that has me intrigued, I hope to play more when I have time.

												This game is better than it's Metacritic score gives it credit for. I think the negative reviews are mostly for problems that have since been addressed. It's not Descent, but it's the next best thing. The controls are functional, the gameplay is fluid.... It's an 6DoF shooter... that's all that should matter.			"

												MinerWars 2081 is a 6DOF space shooter heavily inspired by Descent, but quite a bit more ambicious in scale. The game takes place in the remains of our solar system, which after a large scale space accident got reduced into an astroid belt. The large astroids, which have space stations build in and around them, form the levels in the game, but unlike Descent one is not restricted to the inside of those astroids, but can fly around in open space as well.While the game does have ambitions to be open-world'ish, they are at the current stage of development extremely restricted. Jumping freely around between different areas in the solar system is possible via a mothership that acts as start and end point for each mission, but as the game doesn't provide any side quests, so it is pretty meaningless to visit areas outside of the main plotline, aside from a visit or two to mine some minerals. The trade system that the game has also feels mostly redundant at this point, as while buying and selling is possible, none of the minerals give any useful amount of money in return and the rest of the loot in the game is just ammunition and health packs which are better used for their intended purpose then sold. Money is also rather hard to come buy, so a lot of the additional gear stays unavailable. The way the stores are placed is also a little weird, as they most often are in the mid of a heated battle, making a quick shopping trip feel rather out of place.The game also has a rather detailed damage model, instead of just shields, the game splits things up into player health, armor, oxygen, hull damage and fuel. But as with the trading, it doesn't impact the game a whole lot. Armor is by far the most important stat, while player health only becomes relevant in a tiny few situation where there is radiation in the environment. Fuel is a bit of an annoyance, as is it's easy to run out of it, without a clear indication on how to get more. As it turns out, the engine in your ship can not only consume the rare and expensive fuel packs, but also a specific mineral and that mineral can be mined. Doing a short mining trip can provide enough fuel for the rest of the game.The way the inventory works in the game is also a little confusing, all the health and repair packs one collects stay in the inventory, but they can't be used manually, instead the game automatically consumes them when the healths goes below 100%. This means your actually hearth is the value shown in the HUD plus however many health packs you have, but as the game doesn't show how many health packs you have, so your total health isn't easily visible.On the control side the game gives the option to use either keyboard and mouse or a joystick. Unlike most other modern games, MinerWars does not provide any preconfiguration for the Xbox360 gamepad, but Getting a decent manual mapping for the Xbox360 controller is possible, with the exception of the menu and trade systems, which have to still have be controlled with the mouse. Once the controller is mapped the game controls quite well and fluidly.On the story side MinerWars is suprisingly good. The game has constant communication and mission objectives that frequently change over the course of the mission, not just simple key collection as one might have seen in the first Descent. The story also goes across the whole solar system visiting plenty of interesting places and factions. All the characters in your crew get quite well established and the whole things as a Firefly-like vibe to, it's essentially a really good space adventure story.Overall I had a blast with this game. The game certainly still showing signs of not yet being fully finished, but all the core elements already work quite well. The game is essentially the Descent I always wanted and never got, as Descent always fell a little short in one area or another, MinerWars one-ups the whole thing in scale and wraps it up in a quite entertaining story. While the detailed damage model is not of much consequence to the gameplay itself, it still does a great job as enhancing your immersion, as having your systems fail and blacking out from lack of oxygen is just a more interesting way to go then simply exploding. Having the ability to just dig through an asteroid is also a neat little feature. My biggest issue with the game, other then the whole not-yet-finished part, is probably that the enemies could have been a little more varied, as you end up fighting the same ships for most of the game, with little variation in weapons or size, but given the varied mission design and the great story, I didn't mind that to much.The game takes around 14 hours to finish. I recommend playing on Easy due to the rather bumpy balancing in spots, the game does right now not allow you to switch the difficulty mid-game. Checkpoints are however plenty in the game.			"

												This game reminds me of Nickelback. Everyone wants to say it sucks just because other people think the game sucks, even though it's really not that bad. So I say hop off bandwagon, spend more than 25min playing the game and give it a chance. This is one of my all time favorite games! It is very difficult but at the same time extreamly fun. You start out at a Mining Camp and are attacked by the Russians. You escape and start a quest in the final frontier to find out why the Russians have beed attacking Mining camps!			"

												Think id best describe this as a first-person action-survival space simulation game. I bought this game a year ago when it was in alpha as the premice sounded awsome. After seeing how th game has come on i am pleased i got in on this early and helped support the development of the game. Its on of tose games thats easy to jump into but a bit trickier to master. Co-Op seems to be the way to go other you AI partner doesnt really get too involved and as ever in most ai partners you end up doing all the work.If you liked 'descent' back in the day you should really consider this. The controls i feel are better suited to a joystick pure given how the ship feels and moves in the six degrees of freedom movement, im not saying keyboard and mouse doesnt work but if you have a joystick i think you would get a better experiance.Like EVE Online, players will able to spend their days mining or exploring the cosmos instead of fighting. There are over 20 different ships in-game now and each can be upgraded with new equipments, plating, and weapons.There is also an MMO release planned for this next year which having played this sounds like it would be hilarious fun. It will be a buy once job so no subs. Hope to see a few more people playing this when its out on steam! "

												I purchased a copy of Space Engineers and was pretty stoked that it came with this. Starting the game up, I was greeted with a reasonably pretty game based around a solid concept and horrible writing which over the course of a few hours play, completely falls on its face and becomes pants-on-head ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Gameplay-wise, the controls feel solid. Sorting out your weapons can take some getting used to. When switching ammo types, the games reminds you of the controls you set for different weapons. If you're near a minable resource, it'll remind you of your controls again (though it will only remind you of keyboard controls). But that's really the only positive point.Even on Normal, a few missions in you'll start seeing some flaws that will likely end up killing you and forcing you to put it down. Endlessly respawning enemies are very commonplace. If the game tells you to do something, it wants you to do it now, and you can explore later. Even where there is no objective (see the map, Gates of Hell), you'll find enemies respawn anyway, and in some cases, a couple of seconds after you kill them. A few other negative points include:- If you travel to a new area and it gives you a quest, you cannot leave until it's completed. It rarely offers you any reason for what you need to do.- Different merchants have different market values, for seemingly no reason.- Achievements (for some people) don't trigger. - No indication how much damage you're taking.- Allies only spawn sometimes, and only in some areas. - ""Fully destructible"" enviroment is not fully destructible. Much like Red Faction, it's only destructible to a degree.- Rewards for completing the ""31 epic missions"" are... well, not a thing. You get another mission. Thanks.- Marcus' script is terrible, and makes him look like an idiot.- I didn't see any mining upgrades, and I couldn't figure out hacking upgrades.- No unique hacking minigame.Overall, this game isn't worth $9.99USD (price at time of writing). It lacks personality, and looks like another Greenlight product that overpromised and oversold what it wanted to do, but it has a couple of redeeming qualities. However, if it's a space trading/pirating sim you're looking for, best look somewhere else. Buy it if it's 75% off or more.			"

												Funny bit about the game is that it's so strict about what it wants from you, but you can do whatever you want to complete it. You have a rinkydink space mining bubble that shoots rockets, lasers, and somehow can create all these things from ore you deposit into this bubble you reside in.It's not very performance friendly. Lots of clipping of ""terrain"" occurs. You can blast your way into a base... OR you can mine for 15 minutes and get to the end without having to shoot one single rocket at an enemy. But you can destroy the base's innards! and then drift to the checkpoint.I don't really understand if it had a story or if it was some sort of random ""fight"" that occurs between companies, because you should be dead by the second wave of enemies if that was the case.I say: Don't waste your cash or time.

												Absolute trash. Avoid. I bought this, and I regret doing so. Terrible/non-existent optimization, terrible multiplayer, terrible campaign, annoying ship voice, and gameplay is over-complicated with too many different stats that you need to keep track of while being expected to perform combat effectively. These are: Oxygen Fuel/Power Temperature Pilot Health Shields Hull IntegrityThe last two are expected, but the rest really bog the game down. Why? Well, for one, they run out too fast, second, if any of these run out, you're either dead, dying, or severely crippled or unable to move any faster than a frozen turd. Also, when any of these stats are low (which will be always, due to how difficult it is to recover), your onboard ship AI is going to be constantly ♥♥♥♥♥ing at you about it, amongst all of the other things it ♥♥♥♥♥es at you about. Seriously, it never shuts up.I usually consider myself pretty good at video games, and normally can handle a lot of chaos. Plus, I don't need to have my hand held. However, I couldn't even pass the first level. There's so much ♥♥♥♥ going on, no sense of what you're supposed to be doing, and you die repeatedly before figuring things out. Seriously, I've died within the first level of the game multiple times until I just gave up because of this ♥♥♥♥. It's like being in a crowd of screaming, panicking, disorderly people during a crisis, and you're just trying to get your bearings and figure everything out, but you're given no room to breathe and you can't even hear yourself think... making you want to seriously hurt someone because it's just overwhelming and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you off.The multiplayer is unplayable, it's poorly designed... and since your stats are inevitably and constantly running out, you're going to be spending 90% of your time as a sitting duck. This is a big part due to the fact that ammo, fuel, and whatever else isn't obtained via pickups, they are bought via shopping terminals scattered through the map, where you can be instantly shot and killed while using. Even then, you need minerals or other materials to get the money to buy these things, which requires you to do tedious mining for minerals, which will almost always lead to you getting shot and looted, wasting your time and putting you at a huge disadvantage (you lose everything, making all that resource gathering and upgrading your ship useless).If players were honorable and played everything as intended (mining, selling minerals, buying weapons, repeating the process until strength is built up, THEN fighting after all is said and done), multiplayer would still be a tedious slog-fest. It usually just devolves into shooting everyone until you run out of resources/fuel/ammo or freeze to death due to temperature loss thanks to hull damage.That this game was compared to the likes of Descent during it's infancy is an absolute insult. This game would have heavily benefited from being more arcade and video-game-like (Which is like Descent), instead of trying to be some sort of terribly executed, unfocused, everything-plus-the-kitchen-sink simulation.

												I enjoyed it, and that's because I got it very cheap and went in with low expectations.  It exceeded tham, a little.  They built a world that the game could only make use of about a third of, so it seems like a game that was going to have much more content.  What's there works and is fun.  People who remember Descent as awesome might be hyping it up a bit in their memories... This game has what decent never had - an open world (space?) design.  It might only be half implemented, but I'd probably still rather play it than an updated Descent.Just get it cheap or on sale and don't expect to have your mind blown.			"

												I don't understand all the complaints this gets. It's not a ""Descent"" game by any means, though it has a similar feel if you've played those (I own all of them) in that you're in a small one-manned rig of a spaceship that has multiple abilities and interchangeable weapons, upgrades and other interesting tidbits. The story is direct and relatively engaging - though if you're looking for freeform roaming you're not going to get it here as it's pretty linear thus far. I've only clocked an hour and half or so on Steam with this but I'd say it's worth shelling out five bucks or so at the very least. Certainly better than trying to relive the past by wading through a hundred mods to make the old Descent look even marginally like this little gem does!			"

												Generally the game is interesting, and provides interesting action and fun for a couple hours, worth IMO 5$.The game seems largely complete, however feels quite like a beta. There are a couple semi-major bugs around the main campaign (useless messages repeating over each other at the junkyard race, rift meteors hitting though the station killing unsuspecting trading player), unexplained necessary functionality in the otherwise quite simple controls of the game (in order to equip ships and hacking devices, you need to load them into the mothership, who knew? Also, afterburner using shift, required for junkyard race. A better explanation for equiping ammo would be nice as well) And the massive lack of detail and content in non-campaign areas. These deserve a special mention since apart from several well made areas, others appear extremely rushed. Among others, there are the capital cities, being nothing but a bunch of big blocks, unuseable or empty merchants in others, and enemies instantly respawning out of mid air.The game world is static and non-reacting, rather surprising for a game describing itself as open world. If you want to preserve a feeling of immersion, stick though the campaign. Otherwise, you will meet NPCs set as enemy, neutral or friendly for no reason what-so-ever, friendlies and neutrals being so much as having zero care while you demolish their entire fortress or capital city, and a certain villian still being sitting around despite being supposed to have been blown up during the campaign. As opposed to the game description of millions of sectors, there are only around 65 visitable locations, two-thirds of them worth mention.Generally the action is solid and the difficulity is rather balanced, but despite the rather large variety of weapons, ammo and ships, you will probably stick to the default ship configuration from the start of the game. Buying ships is pretty much impossible, as the campaign itself will give you almost no money, while the only other way of profit is selling ores, which is an extremely slow and tedious progress, and you will spend most of the gain on scavanging fuel and oxygen. (Worth mentioning, however, is that in a certain non-campaign location which i forgot the name of, there is a building completely full of ""Treasure"" in cargo boxes, being expensive ores) You will most likely be able to upgrade your engine and armor, though. On the weapons and ammo side, there isnt really a reason to not stick with the rocket launcher and the basic missle for most of the game. The weapon has what appears to be the strongest DPS in the game, contary to displayed statistics, since the cannon is supposed to be able to have more than double the rocket DPS. Not to mention that about every ammo deposit will have basic rockets to more than restore your ammo pool, unlike about anything else in the game with the exception of the gatling gun basic ammo.The game largely sticks to its promise of keeping the entire game world destructable, with a few noteable exeptions of massive station building blocks, or, wierdly enough, astroids. However, to destroy anything that is bigger than, say, barrels or doors, expect to spend anywhere between a dozen to a few hundred(!) of missles. (other weapons are simply not damaging enough to destroy in a reasonable time) It appears that some of these werent even tested, as, for example, what appears to be a futuristic house has the explosion radius of the nuke back from the beginning of the campaign, and small, almost invisible wire has a solid explosion and massive debris to boot.The campaign itself is interesting, and has its fair share of experience, and the GPS is pretty much god's gift, as without it you wouldve been hopelessly lost inside the stations where its hard to tell rooms apart from each other, although the failure conditions are completely mishandled and could be made better. If you lose a mission objective, you lose control of your ship, while the rest of the game goes as if nothing happened. This includes losing the pirate base generator, not managing to escape a self destruct sequence (noteable is that the explosion doesnt actually happen, so you are left staring at a completely intact station!), mining in fort valiant, or losing the junkyard race (despite not supposed to have any meaningful objective other than ""show off your ego to this random guy!""). The end of the campaign also leaves you in a very distasteful cliffhanger, with the protagonist ironically saying ""So whats next?"", for the non-existant sequel or expansion. The developers also saw fit to display the end of the campaign at the very beginning of the game, no more, no less. Why bother building suspension if the artifact is already known?Of another thing thats worth a mention, is that the save points could be handled better. They save the moment you complete an objective. No more, no less. Even if you are one life bar away from death, and an enemy is aiming a missle at you. Good thing that the game keeps track of all save points made, though, so you can load from an earlier point from the menu.If you buy the game, buy it expecting a FPS experience, as, sadly, the other aspects are not really developed. The FPS experience, however, is solid and is worth trying. The 3D, zero gravity combat is interesting is fun, and the weapons feel statisfying while the surroundings are often destructable and/or explosive and is nice to interact with.			"

												For some reason, I remember looking at the trailers before this came out and saying ""This looks like it has a lot of potential"" and boy was I sure wrong. Depsite that though, I had no idea what to expect from this game before starting it. Something about looked promising enough for me to purchase it. After beating this game, I admit that I regret the decision.From learning how the world was brought into such an awful, there are so many contradictions that come from the explanations. You would think if the world was destroyed by a giant solar flare, the odds of surviing would be impossible, especially to make a comeback with advanced technology. Also you wonder they all survived with limited resources.The story was strange and confusing, with you really not understanding much about what's going on and the ongoing fighting between factions. You don't really know your faction or why you're there, only having the main goal of finding the alien artifact and whatnot.I liked the idea that ships were a little customizable and there were quite a few that you could buy later on but it felt like there was really no scaling. Combat wasn't exactly the smoothest ever when you try to manuever with the AIs and the ship controls. Sometimes it was a pain to a hang of it and sometimes you might hit the wrong button, throwing off your flying and aiming. Speaking of AIs... they were such a pain in the ♥♥♥. Though they do follow you around, they do so with the intent to do everything they can to get into your way, especially if you are trying to dig through asteroids with missels. As far as I can tell, they're just there with no reason and don't get targeted very much.Since they are trying to advertise the game Space Engineers I'll throw in my thoughts on why you shouldn't get it. Like several sandbox games, you are gathering resources and building... except there is no survivalist aspects in the game. Besides the threat of you crashing your ship, there is no challenge in the game except those of building. Cool, you can build your own spaceship but that's all there is to it. It doesn't even deserve to call itself a survival game.			"

												Like this game a lot, though the objectives can be confusing. There was this strange glitch where it the consoles would appear behidn the background, but no big deal. The mechanics are intersting and the combat is exicting. the story is also kind of cool, and a little out of place in 2013, seems like it was writtenin the 80s, when Russia was still the Soviet Union and the Nazis were still fresh in everyone's minds.basically, you are in a little ship and discover evidence of aliens (whose existence is being covered up), so you go around the solar system to the various powers (who live in space because of an increase in solar activity that destroyed the earth) finding friends and enemies. it all leads to various battles and searches, all the while you can upgrade your ship and equipment by mining resources on the side and selling them. you don't have to do that, but it is amusing.its fun, but the ending is a little disappointing, it just kind of hangs there like a cliffhanger and there's no real conclusion			"

""Mining"" in mining wars offers little to no money and the constant search for fuel and oxygen gets old really quick as betsy, the horrid name i gave the constant computer voice, reminds you again and again you are out of some resource every few seconds. The secret rooms you search for give you yet another weapon similar to the last and the storyline is mediocre at best. i gave this game a worth attempt of 4 hours before i quit and uninstalled.			"

												Did you ever play Descent in the 90's? Well, if you did and you liked it, you'll probably love this game. This is a grinding FPS where you are constantly piloting a spacehsip that you can customise with different weapon and tool loadouts (i.e. shielding, mining & digging tools). It's constanty action-packed so you won't have an idle minute of gametime (unless you decide to mine instead), the blue trail that indicates where you need to go during a mission is a great feature that saves a lot of faffing around. Visually, it's a bit cluttered but I like this game because I contributed some money to it during development and got to see it slowly evolve. ***			"

												If you liked the fabled classic games Descent, you'll probably like this game too. Its a great addition of an old game style of play that hasnt been seen since.			"

												Miner Wars 2081 is a 6DOF action-survival space-shooter simulation-game set in the year 2081, 10 years after the destruction of all planetary objects in the Solar System. You operate an advanced mining ship in a fully destructible and open-world environment, which remains persistent as you complete missions or play online with others. Realism and survival are key aspects of gameplay. Inventory and the way you use resources such as fuel, ammunition, oxygen, ore, and weapons are important when surrounded by dozens of warring factions. The gameplay is driven by an epic story and offers a choice of single player, co-op, and death-match multi-player. The story will introduce you to many types of missions: rescue, exploration, revenge, base defense, theft, transportation, stealth, search and destroy, pure harvesting, racing, or just flying around and destroying everything you see.

												One of my first ever pre-orders, I bought this game before it was even on STEAM but sadly, it feels like an online date from tinder. At first you are excited, to find something different and feel a connection to something you've desired for a long time, time goes on and you decide to interact.At first have a good time, you think things are going great then a few minutes later you realise that your date has ran off leaving you a lone at the table with a huge bill to pay for.This game had huge potential but the devs abandoned the projects and left it half baked.If you're interested then get it if its part of a very, very cheap bundle package. Otherwise, avoid it like a tinder date! "
