												It may not be your ""Next gen ARMA"" But it is definatley worth buying. Some aspects in this SHOULD Be in ARMA 2 And 3. It does have that arma feeling behind it. But in some aspects it is better than 2 and 3. Content wise is fantastic. There are THREE Campaigns. THREE, Plus scenarios. I have played on of the Campaigns and it is pretty good so far. You see today you get all these people saying 'EWW OMGZ TEH GRAPHICS ARE HORRIBLE, I'M NOT BUYING THIS PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥' Well, they are not truely gamers. But idiots. The ARMA Series is HIGHLY underatted. But this is game. Is the true starting point of the franchise.			"

												Ahhh the Arma series, really, we should enjoy nothing about this game - the frame rate drops (even in this old version on a high spec machine), the so serious its silly tone, the terrible coding, the egotastic ""we know best"" attitude of its developers, the absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ai, the even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fan boy player base, the poor modelling of anything outside of infantry - THOSE DAMN FPS SUCKING BUSHES THAT LOOK LIKE A CLOUDY COLLECTION OF RED PIXELS WHICH NO MATTER HOW FAST YOUR SYSTEM IS WILL KILL YOUR FPS IN THE MIDDLE OF A GAME CHANGING FIRE FIGHT LEADING YOU TO BE SHOT IN THE HEAD BY A SNIPER YOU CAN'T SEE 1000 M'S AWAY BECAUSE YOU HAD TO SET THE RENDERING DISTANCE TO 1200M TO COMBAT IT -- **HOWEVER**--You keep coming back to the series time and time again, why?  Simply because there is nothing else like it available and for all its technical faults (of which it has too many to count) and being one of the most poorly optimized 3D engines I have ever played on - there is no other sandbox platform that does what it does. When it works, its the best military simulator I have ever played and when it doesn't you will lose hours of your life to googling tweaks, mods and tricks for getting it to play better.You have been warned.

												Look, let's be honest here! You have to be a particular (probably neurotic) kind of individual to be into this game. I do not know much about realism, but I know there could be too much of it, and this game is the living proof of that.The game is not bad, but it lacks a lot in the graphics department, do not get me wrong, it looks fine, but it seems glitchy and over demanding for a game this old. CS, CoD & BF fans should avoid this, the key of this game is patience, and unfortunately I lack a lot in that department.Fanboys are probably pitchforks at hand at this point of the review, but let me tell you I am actually recommending this game, but you have to be the kind of individual who has lots of patience, enjoys a lot tweaking stuff, and really, really love the military; otherwise avoid it like the plague, because it will offer zero fun and a ton of frustrations!

												The main problem with Arma is its unwieldy design, offputting tutorials and unrelenting difficulty, but gold edition has alot more accessibility than others in the series. Combined with its low cost, decent singleplayer campaign & mission selection, make it a good entry level milsim.Where others in the series would have you begging for the mission to end, here they have decent pace and design.For example, one of the later missions has a mechanized group attacking a base from the south, armour from the north, and special forces from the east, each with their own objectives, all the while airborne assaults are being carried out. You can choose to be any part of any said battlegroups, and switch between them at will.			"

												THIS GAME DOES NOT SUPPORT INTEGRATED GRAPHICS CARDS!!! If you have one then you have to Google ""Arma Gold black screen fix"" and watch the first video that comes up to find out how to fix it. Once it's working it's a great game. It's Arma with a smaller amount of weapons that can run well on older machines. That's really all that can be said.			"

												This game keeps on bringing new content to the table, every time you play its different, the warfare game mode has entertained me and my friends for countless hours. i seriously recommend Arma for anyone who likes realistic military games. this may be one of the older Arma's, but if your computer cant run the newer ones, this is the perfect choice. my computer is capable of Arma 2, yet i still prefer Arma: Gold over it. Its graphics arent the best, but the gameplay outweighs the graphics massively, but it is still very immersive. Arma: Gold goes on sale quite often, usually going down to $7.50, $5.00, or even $1.99. I honestly cant count how many copies i have gifted to friends.			"

												Typical of the Arma games: you only get to see the games in their full glory ten years after being released due to affordable computer hardware lagging behind for miles.I don't get it ... why not make Arma 3 using the version of the engine used in Arma Gold (or 'Armed Assault'). At least we'd get a game everyone would be able to run and enjoy.Okay, the old engine could probably use some tweaking and optimization but it's not fundamentally different from the newer engine versions and yet my quad core CPU and medium rang graphics card still struggle to render a village environment in Arma 3 with viewing distance set to a meager 1.200m ... Imagine how terrific a viewing distance of 1.200m would be when flying an aircraft and trying to locate a ground target while also avoiding enemy AA ?! - That's right, it isn't ...In Arma Gold I can easily turn up the viewing distance to 5.000m, have medium/high detail settings and still have nice frame rates.To cut a long story short: this game runs like a charm and basically offers the same gameplay that Arma 2 and 3 have to offer. There are plenty of mods and addons to enrich the experience and for the price it's an absolute steal.Get it!Note: I'm using Windows 7 (64 bit)			"

												This is not your typical Brick Protagonist shooter, so let me tell you why this game is the best thing;I was given a mission to terminate an enemy convoy. I immediately set about deploying mines on the road, then I placed satchel charges in a line, so the explosions would overlap.The enemy convoy appears; one BMP-2 in front, followed by four Ural trucks and one BMP-2 in the back. The lead BMP runs straight over the mines and stops, literally smoking; the crew evacuates.It is at this moment that I detonate the satchel charges, destroying their crew and two god damn trucks.I whip out an AT4 and pop rockets into the final two trucks, but the remaining, unmolested BMP-2 has other ideas; it sweeps my position with a hail of 7.62mm, crippling my legs and sending me to the ground.I have one magazine in my M4. I can't use my AT4 from a prone position.The surviving enemy infantry are moving into the town.I CRAWLED MY CRIPPLED ♥♥♥ BACK TO THE BOAT, OVER 300m. Under fire. Buy this.			"

												After all these years, why should anyone keep playing ARMA: Gold Edition? The controls are clunky. The graphics are old. AI can't fly or drive worth a hoot. It almost seems designed to repel newcomers. But...... this game rewards the patient and those willing to look past a number of technical flaws. Aside from the other ARMA games, no other FPS titles even attempt this level of realism, not even Codemasters' iterations of Operation Flashpoint. With its unforgiving difficulty and unparalleled depth (and I'm serious about the depth; look up Dslyecxi's ARMA guide, where he makes reference to FM 21-75 because the advice therein is applicable) it is among the closest approximations of war we are ever likely to see in a videogame. ARMA: Gold Edition is not just for military enthusiasts. Anti-war persons may also like it, since it has potential to dissuade you from ever joining the military (and seeing as the game consists of dehumanizing long range combat where you're killed by stray bullets from enemies you never get to see, it might conceivably have that effect). For those of you who like the original Ghost Recon, try this. It's just a little bit harder.			"

You can buy 2 copies and try to make ""mapping night"" where you create maps for your friend(s) to play and rate them. Pretty much the game. Multiplayer - useless. GameSpy is down, you might find something on the internet to play online, but i don't know anytging about MP of this game. Btw, it's tactical shooter, where you die from 2-4 bullets. So try not to feel like a Rambo and make yourself a machinegun and 100 enemies in front of you. Bad idea8/10 as ArmA game (ArmA 2 is only better because of DayZ)9/10 as a game			"

												Game may be old, but I still enjoy it. It has one of the best Afghan war mods I'd ever played even today with Arma 2, and 3. I would also reccomend the Vietnam: The experience mod. Full of content, and there is a Dynamic campaign where you play a SEAL team. You can choose which type of operation you, and your team will take on. There are 7 or 8 different missions you can choose from each one is randomly generated, so if you like Ambushes you can do those all over the map. If you enjoy patrols where you never know if you'll run into contact, they have that too. There are Assualt, and defense missions, and a few others I can't(like sabotage or something) remember at this time.In closing it may be dated, but there are many finished polished mods that will keep you busy for hours if you can get passed some dated graphics, and function.

												The Sequel to Arma: Cold War Assault improves upon graphics tremendously, gameplay is different but similar in ways. Animations and radio comms are still robotic and almost frustrating at times. The campaigns have great voice acting and a good story line but immersive cinematics are lacking and inferior to the original. I have always maintained that the release of this title was premature and incomplete in many areas, believeing that Arma 2 was what this title was intended to be, except released early to rake in some funds to finish developing it. The user made mods and missions can be found at Armaholic[www.armaholic.com] and a limited few missions at [urlhttp://www.ofpec.com/]OFPEC[/url]. I recommend the Cold War Rearmed Mod[www.armaholic.com], Finnish Defense Forces Mod{/url], and [url]The Unsung Vietnam War Mod[www.armaholic.com].I am on the fence with recommending this one. For you folks with lower end PC's, defnitily grab this title and download some of the user made content to extend its life. There is not much of a community for this title anymore but there is plenty of content out there to get your moneys worth. For those who can run Arma2 or Arma3, I say move on to those. The community is still thriving and many of the user made content for Arma 1 was ported forward to Arma 2. Have fun!!!			"

												A very fun game to play. The graphics have aged well almost 9 years on and still looks good even today on maxed settings, the only bad thing about this game is that Gamespy is not with us and this game now is only held together by single player. The lack of multiplayer does not mean this game is lacking content and you won't get board in a hurry: the single player is challenging and can cause some frustration at times, the editor is a fun tool and I have fond memories of putting two sides together and see who will win, but I do get board of it because I lack a imagination and sometimes I can't be arsed to put the work in to build a base or do some configuration. Overall I recommend this game because you can do what you want and also it offers more challenge than the corridor linear shooters today that claim to be true military shooters. Be warned this game has a big learning curve. (I also recommend Arma 2 and 3 because I find them fun as well)			"

												[Notice] Best ♥♥♥♥ing ArmA there is. (Biased Opinion)The game itself is amazing, the campaign missions are great. And I love how it's based off joint service branches. The Army and the Marines, but the developers when they made this was a bit un-informed on terms of the branches. The Marines never wore ACU's so therefore they maybe didn't know the difference between MCCUU's and ACU's. But I can look past that. As in ArmA 2 there is a 3D Editor that I wish was installed onto this game, I can't line my FOB walls up correctly therefore wasting my time to make a Forward Opeartions Base. Probably just me, or could be others... The map likes to go invisible then come back to visibilty on the mission editor map which is so damn annoying. Multiplayer was shutdown a few weeks after receiving the game, that's a drag. I liked playing CTF and playing 'Realism Unit' missions with my lads. But that all soon came to an end, but it's still a great game to play single player with. Just install some more missions, and mods and you're good to go. Great game.			"

												They fixed the thing I hated most about arma:cold war assault, the inability to do multiple saves. Though if you save at the wrong time, well it's your fault. Worked fine on an XP computer, enemy are still a little pixilated, but at least I can see them. Still haven't figure out how to fly a helicopter well. Wish you could choose what weapons to bring at the start of all the missions. Was tedious getting to the arms merchant. AI about the same as in Cold War. Some missions did glitch on me or I could have been too impatient. If graphics isn't important to you, this is a good game to get when its on sale.			"

												ARMA: Gold Edition is just thatGOLDENAs if any more explanation would be necessary, but I will give it anyway.This game was a literal gift to me and thanks to the good will of a friend.  We decided to play this game due to the absolute crappiness of our PCs at the time.  So really we played this out of necessity than anything else.  By some miracle it turned out this game has a ridiculously fun and longlasting cooperative game mode.  WARFARE.  Many great memories have been had there.  I would list them but they are too many in number and too crazy in content to by included in a steam review.  All the strange situations you find yourself in are the reason I went so screenshot happy with this game.Playing this oldie was a gamble at first, but it turned out to be a gem.  I'm still yet to find an equally fun but simple experience on the later ARMA games.  10/10			"

												I have nearly 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews - Game 11Arma - Gold EditionPurchase Date: 1/16/2014I ended up getting a bunch of the Arma games as part of a Humble Bundle.  I only really heard of Arma because of the DayZ mod that everyone talks about.   Normally this isn't the kind of game I would be looking to buy, but I appreciate that the Humble Bundle gives me a good excuse to try out some games I'd otherwise ignore.The first thing I did when I started the game was go right to the graphics options.  Since Arma has been out for awhile, it looks a little dated, but this also means that I can crank up all of the graphics options to make it look as nice as possible.  Arma gives plenty of options to tweak, much as you'd expect from a modern game.Since I had no idea how to play or what I was doing, I made sure to start with the tutorial.  Arma provides a series of tutorial missions, starting with a basic obstacle course to run through.  It gave me the option to do a run through first without being timed, which I'm glad it did as it took me a little bit to get used to the controls.I had an issue with the default mouse controls.  By default Arma is configured to have this huge 'floating' area on the mouse.  This floating area defines how far you can move the mouse before the camera moves.  So it's kind of a sensitivity thing, but for me it just made the controls feel super laggy.  Luckily the options menu let me turn this all the way down.  I can't imagine why someone would want it configured otherwise.Once I had the controls nailed down, I finished the obstacle course, with the drill sargeant barking at me as I went.  Next up was a shooting range, so I could have a chance to get used to all of the weapons.  The game offers various lanes, each with a different weapon.  The game gives certifications on each weapon, based on how well you can shoot.  First I trailed with a rifle, then a sub-machine gun, followed by a pistol.  I ended up doing pretty well with these, but then I bombed with the grenade launcher.  The last lane contained a sniper rifle.  The next tutorial introduced me to my squad, and consisted of me giving my squad various commands.  I found this part of the tutorial rather cumbersome.  I get that this is a simulator so it's supposed to be in-depth and give a lot of options.  But it also seems a lot harder to get things done than it should be.  I hit a key to toggle my whole squad, but it wasn't really obvious to me when all of my squad was selected.  I wish it had been a little easier to know which squad members were selected and which ones weren't. The squad menu has an impressive list of options.  I can do things like order my squad into a particular formation, or move the squad members to a waypoint.  This took some getting used to; in particular I had a hard time getting my squad to enter a vehicle I had targetted.I should mention that the game is fully voiced, which sounds nice, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the implementation.  Some of the voicing was fine, like in the earlier tutorial where the drill sargeant was bossing me around.  But I didn't like the squad voicing as much.  A lot of the dialog is stitched together dynamically, where words were recorded one at a time, and then spliced into sentences.  When played back like this, it just doesn't sound natural, and it's kind of jarring.Once I got the basics of squad combat down, the next tutorial put me in a tank.  This ended up being pretty fun as I rode around and fired at various targets with different weapons on the tank.  Again I struggled with the controls, and remembering which key is supposed to switch weapons.  I liked how the game simulates the different positions in the tank, as I went between driving, gunning, and commanding.  I mentioned above about the dialog being stitched together.  This got really old when I was trying to command the tank to move back to the base.  I had a hard time telling which direction the tank was facing, so I kept hitting keys to rotate the tank.  Every time I hit a key, the game would bark that command to the driver.  I kept hitting keys in fairly rapid succession, and the game kept barking commands like I was directing some kind of demented Simon Says game.Once I parked the tank, the final tutorial mission I took part in was flying a helicopter.  The mission starts out with the helicopter pilot telling me to get in and fly, and he'll join me as a co-pilot.  So I hopped in the helicopter and started up the engine, and the game proceeds to explain the controls.  So I take the helicopter up slowly as directed.  Then the co-pilot starts yelling at me because I left him behind.  Oops!  It was kind of hilarious because on one hand, the game is happily telling me how to fly, and on the other hand my co-pilot is screaming at me from the ground.  I tried to land the helicopter so I could let the co-pilot board but instead I ended up killing the co-pilot with the helicopter blades approximately .5 seconds before I crashed the helicopter and died.I ended up restarting the mission so I could get a proper start.  This time with my co-pilot in the copter, I took off and started flying around.  It didn't take me long to realize that I am pretty terrible at this.  I was doing okay until the game wanted me to hover, which I couldn't do at all.  I finally ended up skipping that step in the mission, and next the game had me go to pick up some soliders.  Instead I ended up crashing the helicopter.  Predictably I died.At this point I was over my hour, and I didn't get to check out the final tutorial, which would have taken the helicopter into combat.  It's probably just as well I didn't try that one, given my meager piloting skills.So I'm left deciding whether to give this game a thumbs up or thumbs down.  I'm going to be reviewing Arma II next, so I'll be curious to see how it differs from this one. I'm really pretty torn here because this was really a mixed bag of things I liked and things I didn't.  I can see where this game would be fun, and I know I barely scratched the surface of what the game has to offer.  But I also have to be honest with myself and realize that I don't see myself bothering to come back to this game.  So based on this I'm going to have to go with the thumbs down.			"

												I would say this is the worst page of ArmA's history. Here we have neither ""warm lamp gameplay"" and really good story, like in my so much loved Cold war Crisis, nor good graphics with advanced simulation at a modern level. Tons of lags and bugs from nowhere and plot ""about nothing"", even without a main character are present though. So, if you want the ultimale simulation, you should purchase A2 with addons. If you want excellent graphics unsurepassed ballistics and things of such sorts to the prejudice to the simulation itself to some extent, this is surely A3, if you want an excellent plot, neither lags nor bugs and probably something most challenging, then have a look at OFP Cold war Crisis (now it is called ArmA: Cold war Assault). Still recommend it, because of a good simulation for its time, outstanding music, quite attractive models and my overall love to BIS.			"

												I want to like this game, I do, but I just can't. I am going to give this another try later, but right now my first impressions are not good. For starters, I am playin gon a Windows 8.1 PC, and I had to fix a graphical issue that a lot fo other people have also experienced. It wasn't a big deal, but is an inconvience.As for actualy gameplay, that's not too good either. The controls are uncomfortable and strange, and any sort of aiming is just bad. I realize that real life bullets don't always go where we want them to, but aiming felt almost usless and sometimes the sights didn't line up, I would shot at a target, and see the bullet hit the dirt off to the side of where I was aiming, or overhead, or underneath, and I was stationary and prone when firing.Maybe I just don't get it, maybe it's just too much mil sim for me, either way, I just don't like it.

If you love frustration, horribly scripted missions, the AI equal to that of a McDonald's burger-flipper and the most frustrating controls by all means get this game. This is a mockery of the Arma series. Do not waste your money or time by buying this filth. Avoid and go right to Arma II or III.			"

												This is terrible. It takes a pretty good idea and executes it horribly. It's incredibly confusing, the controls are awful because there are so many actions that most are mapped to random keys, a key that has to pressed twice in a row, or a combination of both, and the game just generally feels really bad to play. It is boring beyond anything I have played before and on top of the that, the world is extremely bland. There's just a bunch of ugly trees and ugly grass. The maps are pretty big, but they might as well be the size of a bathtub, because there is nothing of interest to fill up thos maps. Absolutry nothing at all. And the helicopters control like garbage. This ""game"" is not worth your money or your time, so save them both and don't get Arma. P.S. I've heard that Arma 2 and Arma 3 are good though. I'll go play try those now.P.P.S Arma: Cold War Assault is garbage just like this one.			"

												TL;DR -- This ArmA title is inferior to the other ArmA games.I don't understand why some gamers dislike this review. Is it because of the ugly layout? *sigh*Here are reasons why I don't recommend this game:First of all,THERE WILL BE A GRAPHIC GLITCH  if you're using an Intel HD4000 graphic card; the main menu will be totally black/missing textures. Replacing the original Arma.exe (downloaded from Steam) with the version 1.14 Arma.exe will sove the problem. Just search 'arma 1.14 exe' on google. Not a big deal.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Here are the reasons:ArmA 1 is the transitional game between the original OFP and nowadays ArmA titles.It was supposed to present gameplay as ArmA 2 provided later on. Sadly, the game engine was not well-developped at the time. The AI is poorly implemented, and the problematic optimization results in frequent frames-drop issues.Meanwhile, just like ArmA 2, GAMESPY SERVERS ARE DOWN -- which also renders that the built-in Internet Multiplayer is no longer functional. Even let alone of that, ArmA 2 has more servers hosted than this game.Verdict:If you want to experience Mil-Sim gameplay, which are also featured in ArmA 2 or 3 with more choices of weapons/vehicles, better graphics, better sounds, improved AI and fully functional multiplayer, and tons of spendid MODS, then you are strongly recommended to try ArmA 2 or 3.Only if you're a hardcore fan of the ArmA games, this game does not worth that much. PS: ArmA Gold Edition = ArmA Armed Assault + expansion pack Queen's Gambit			"

												Thank god I bought this as part of the Humble Bundle, because the mouse control is the worst I've ever experienced. It's awful by design. FPS Rule #1 should be: Camera follows mouse input. Instead, the reticule moves like a mouse cursor and you turn by scrolling to the edge of the screen? It's like it was designed to be played on the Wii. The rest of the controls are also convoluted and make no sense.I understand this game is trying a different take on the military shooter, but violating fundamental controls to achieve that is asinine.

												The fun thing about ARMA is that it's ""realistic"".The suspense if good, because if the bad guys see you, they will shoot you dead. Game over. One bullet is all it takes. And vice versa. So you have to play it really careful. After the first few minutes of play time, as soon as I heard shooting I was dropping prone, frantically looking around hoping to be able to shoot the shooter before he got me. That's fun.Of course, realism has its drawbacks. Sometimes you spend like 10 minutes running from point A to point B, just to get to the action.However... the controls are clunky, there's a LOT of bugs (mainly graphical glitches, but also in scripted events and the like), the graphics are rather bland and boring, and the AI is stupid (I spent half an hour crawling in the dark - with night goggles - looking for a guard who was yelling: ""he's over here, I can see him moving"", only to find him all alone, standing still, with his back to me. As matter of fact, he was the only guard left. So, I shot him. Done.)All in all, while this game can be a lot of fun, it frustrated me more than it gave me game pleasure. So... Next!			"

												ARMA: Gold is pack of ARMA: Armed Assault and an expansion pack ARMA: Queen's Gambit.ARMA is a first person tactical military shooter with large elements of realism and simulation. This game features a blend of large-scale military conflict spread over large areas alongside the more closed quarters battle. The player will find himself thrust in the midst of an engaging and expanding storyline, fighting against smart, aggressive enemies who will continually provide a challenge over a massive landscape.

												Awful controls, terrible AI, tons of bugs and some quite hideous graphics, but may be worth it to experience the origins of Arma for die-hard fans.----Arma is definitely a unique concept. It's a Military Simulation game. Like Battlefield, but less hollywoody and on a bigger scale. I think the idea is fantastic and it makes for some amazing gameplay moments.This particular entry into the Arma series though is chock full of extremely annoying bugs, see-through game design (triggers for mission objectives are very rudimentary), some god awful controls, AI that doesn't respond to the orders you give or consistantly bugs out and runs in circles and some pretty gnarly graphics, particularly in the ""cut scenes"".All in all, incredibly frustrating.The game has no multiplayer anymore but there are apparently lots of single player campaigns and scenarios available for download on the internet and a bunch of mods too - I think that the future installments will be far better uses of your time, though.

												The squad system is broken, the controls are all over the place and the mouse aiming is incredibly difficult to fine-tune properly. Those are three pretty important things that the majority of PC games, ESPECIALLY first person shooters, get right (except for the squad system, not every game has one, but most games that do, hey, at least it works in those games) and, since it's been a pretty long time since the original game's release, I doubt we'll get a fix for any of these issues. This game had so much potential...			"

												This game is awful. It is a bloody joke, it has to be. It claims to be a realistic simulator, but apparently it's realism is based upon the fact it simulates you being a soldier with a light case of sclerosis, because it has the most convoluted controls I have ever had the disgust of using. The game doesn't control, I can't dare call this ""controlling"". For every simple thing you'd just do naturally, you have to scroll through menus. Every time. You wanna switch to another weapon? Scroll through menu. Want to give a simple order to your squad? Scroll through menu. Want to exit the vehicle you're in? Scroll through menu.Adding to the fun mechanic of ""Scroll through menu"", there's the fact your soldier can't even hold his weapon straight. Now, okay, I know keeping accuracy with a heavy weapon at a distance is tough, but even if your gun has a bipod, your character won't use it. He'll just keep shambling his arms along. Hell, even jumping on the ground barely helps the aim shaking on the sniper rifles.The animations are a lot of times awful, if not non-existant, but those aren't that important. The tutorial missions were filled with bugs on my end, not a single one didn't have to be reset because an objective decided to not count as completed after I did so.This game is a travesty, I know it's old, but doesn't make it any less crap. I'm thankful I got this on the humble bundle, if I had bought this at full price, I'd be ready to kill someone right about now.Now, on to first find a mod to make this game actually control and, if I don't succeed, move on to ArmA 2, see if that has ANY improvement over this.

												Arma is a very difficult game it simulates war very well it is also the most frustrating tactical shooter to date. While you are being shot at you may have to push at least 20 keys on your key board and don't even try to play this with a controller because you can't. But it is extremely long and you will spend hours of enjoyment in arma. The Merc story is a little cliche but it does have some fun missions. The Army campagin is more intersting and enjoyable.			"

												I only played this game for a few hours but I'll tell you what I've gathered:-- DO NOT get this game for multiplayer, after gamespy went out of buisness there are no public servers, if you want to play online you'd have to get in contact with some faithful arma 1 players and join there IP (that is the only option and I cant swear theres still even enough people for a game,) Most players have moved onto newer ones.-- There is alot to learn in this game, its ARMA. Be prepared to sink some time into learning controls strategies and techniques. ---- From what I've seen of the single player the missions are very wide open and theres almost unlimited freedom with how to deal with them, Very cool. This is the most tactical game I've ever experienced, they really did a good job making the game. --- I have a very low spec computer and this game runs well on it.I'd say overall its a good game, just dont get it for multiplayer. It looks good from what I've experience but I'm not ready to sink the hours into it, if you think you are go for it.			"

												I really liked Operation Flashpoint and I just wanted more of the same.  But now I see why ARMA 1 got such bad reviews when it was released.  The single player campaign is so terribly botched that it's unplayable.  Some missions are laughably easy.  Others are unwinnable because of scripting bugs.  There's even one that's supposed to be a night stealth mission but you can't win because it happens during the day.  And then there's the missions where it just suddenly says you won, probably because the enemies died flipping over their vehicle or falling off a roof on the other side of the map.If you want multiplayer, get ARMA3.  If you want single-player get Operation Flashpoint or whatever they call it these days.			"

												For those people who dont have the money for a good gaming pc or have poor pc specs i recommend buy this! If you want an Arma experience and cant run Arma 2 or 3 then buy this. The campaign is pretty fun and the mission editor is awesome. Wouldnt say theres are big crowd with online servers but this game is fun even on its own. There are only 3 factions, BLUFOR, OPFOR & Independant, unlike ARMA 2 and 3. Still have an amazing amount of fun just editing a map so heaps of BLUFOR jets bomb the hell out of an OPFOR tank convoy.Controls are very similar to ARMA 2 and 3 which are smooth controls. Can have some glitchy moments but is expected of a game this age. Does also have some pretty fun mods which can be found all online.Definatly worth the $12 AUD :D			"

												One of the best Armed Assault games to ever exsist. This is by far one of the best ones i've played. You have every type of combat situation and you feel as if you arn't super over powered, but still challenged. You can play however you want and all the ways you play work and help your team out.This game offers vast huge *cities* to play with, and has nice landscape scenery that make you feel more like you're on a island. You character has great walking animations and shooting abilities. (running isn't that great). *by cities I mean cities with buildings that are more than 5 stories tall. arma 3 isn't cities its towns.*			"

												LOVE this game it is great has great storyline with lots of content great realism and fun to play you should buy this game because its $1.99 and even with that it is still worth $15.00 in my opinion.			"

												I have wanted this game for years, and i finally get it and I get the black screen, If you can fix this problem ill give it a 10 but since i litterally cant play it after spending 2 bucks and theres nothing to review it is a big fat zero. I would like you all to fix this problem but dont be selling a product that doesnt work please.			"

												I really liked Operation Flashpoint and I just wanted more of the same.  But now I see why ARMA 1 got such bad reviews when it was released.  The single player campaign is so terribly botched that it's unplayable.  Some missions are laughably easy.  Others are unwinnable because of scripting bugs.  There's even one that's supposed to be a night stealth mission but you can't win because it happens during the day.  And then there's the missions where it just suddenly says you won, probably because the enemies died flipping over their vehicle or falling off a roof on the other side of the map.If you want multiplayer, get ARMA3.  If you want single-player get Operation Flashpoint or whatever they call it these days.			"

												don't bother, the patch broke it and it has been unusable unless you want to spend time taking it back to an earlier build. not worth the price of admission...			"
