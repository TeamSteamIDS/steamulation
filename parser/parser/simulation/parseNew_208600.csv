												To start off - if you currently have an Oculus Rift, stop reading and purchase this game right now... It's ok, I'll wait for you to do it.Done? Good, because this game currently has the best native support for VR available right now.  A perfectly realized virtual cockpit with great functionality and UI suited for VR.  The sense of immersion is quite spectacular, and the game itself is also very fun.For those without a rift, the game is quite good as well.  It places you on the moon (or mars) in control of a lander type craft, in which you perform missions for experience and cash, with which you can upgrade your lander's capabilities.  The lander handles as a low gravity vehicle would handle, and with practise you can pull off some very impressive manouevers.  The types of missions available range from surveying certain locations, searching for misplaced or lost cargo and transportation of cargoes.There is a multiplayer component as well, though I have to attest i haven't really played much of this mode (was having way too much fun in the single player portion of the game)Overall, I'd heartily recommend the game to anyone with a slight interest in space exploration - and if you have a Rift this is a must purchase.

												A nifty simulation of flying a lunar module.  Takes a little while to get the hang of (there's some video tutorials included) but once you're flying around without any assists it's great fun.Radio chatter and some fitting background music add atmosphere to a lunar environment that would otherwise have none (zing!).  You will also have the opportunity to fly around a map on Mars where dust storms and increased gravity and drag make flying much more difficult.Some physics knowledge is definitely a bonus.  Physics nerds like myself will take pleasure in having to plan ahead, taking into account things like cargo weight, fuel efficiency, conservation of momentum and more.  You will feel like you've mastered lunar flight when you line up a trajectory for the landing pad, using your RCS thrusters to reduce your transverse speed while throttling up your main thruster to keep the vector over the pad, to finish with a quick yaw at the end to line up a perfect landing.Probably the biggest drawback to the game is the relative lack of mission variety with only three types.  The environments are of course pretty barren as you'd expect so like with many flight simulators you are more occupied with what your craft is doing and how it's flying.  This is where Lunar Flight really shines.It supports TrackIR and Occulus Rift too so props to the developer!Overall recommended!			"

												Lunar Flight is a simple sim that allows you to fly an Apollo style lunar module around four different maps (difficulty varies between the maps) simulating the moon and mars environments.  It has a steep learning curve but is extremely satisfying to master. Initially it feels a bit like playing the classic 8 bit 'lunar lander' type games in 3D but there's more to it than that. Missions include carrying cargo between locations, gathering data from survey sites and recovering lost cargo.  As you progress with missions you gain XP and are able to upgrade your ship to make it more fuel efficient and more manoeuvrable. Multiplayer introduces combat, adding 'sidewinder' style missiles and decoy flares to the mix.  Combat isn't easy; changing direction can be hard due to inertia and it's a pretty unique experience.

												I am a fan of simulation games. I own about every flight and space flight simulator there is, and I must admit, this game was quite a fun experience.First, you'll have to learn about thrust vectoring, which is about the hardest thing to learn if you don't know physics. It's very long for some people and you may get desperate and begin hating this game. But once this is done, you'll understand just how fun this game is.You can carry out mission, such as locating lost equipment or transporting cargo. And yes, weight does affect your flight. There nothing more intense than landing on a platform with 0.3% left fuel because you underestiamted the weight of that cargo.And there's multiplayer : Shooting other people on the moon/mars!And the best part is : The developper (independant, as far as I know) oftens adds stuff to the game and they're awsome. When I bought the game, there were 3 maps, no multi. Since then, Mars was added, multi was added, Occulus Rift support was added and I can't wait to see what's next.A definitive buy for any flight sim enthousiast.			"

												Wow. This one is making me consider buying two side monitors...It's a Proper Simulator, but not impossibly fiendish to play, assuming you have a decent controller.  Still possible to enjoywith just the keyboard though.Brings you inside a LEM, and there really isn't much to do apart fromflying from A to B, and C, and D;  but it doesn't matter, because the Trip is the Message.pros:-What I just wrote, that was all positive.-You are Inside that tiny Lunar Lander from the 80s! Or was it the 70s?-That good old feeling from the Sublogic and co. simulators, that we thought had been killed by Big Byte, but with all the modern eye-candy and smoothnesscons:-You will only see two colours: Grey and Green,  and Red, that makes three,but you don't wanna see red,  unless you're on Mars. And Blue; Blue's good. So that's four colours. It's the freaking Moon! Live with it.			"

												Really solid Lunar Module sim but also a great game of physics and precision landing. It may look boring or perhaps even overly complicated at first, but when you get the hang of the mechanics it becomes EXTREMELY enjoyable. I also gotta mention the nice high fidelity graphics, excellent performance and fantastic sound design. I don't know if its real LM radio chatter from the 70s but it sure sounds like it and makes the game really immersive.Overall its nothing short of awesome all around, my only grievance is that the dev doesn't want to make the oculus rift virtual 3D cockpit available without having the oculus, so you're forced to play with a 2D cockpit with windows and monitors to the 3D world. A real shame but besides that this is great and I strongly recommend it if you enjoy fun games.			"

												Lunar Flight is so realistic! Being an astronaut myself, having flown and operated many spacecrafts (ranging from lunar modules such as this, to commandeering an entire flotilla from a mothership), I can say, with a professional background, that Lunar Flight is spot on. Whether you are fending off incoming missiles or carrying out missions to grab randomly appearing space-crates of space-candy on the moon, firing missiles at your fellow astronauts', then this game gets it right. No seriously though, it is not space-candy, it is high-tech space loot that you would not even understand. Bored? Spin around in space. It also features multiplayer, so grab a friend and play play chicken with your lunar modules.			"

												A true spiritual successor to old games like Lunar Lander. Yes, there is a learning curve here. One thing that is a bit unfair is a stock lander with no upgrades lacks a stabilizer, if you get the craft rotating in mutiple axis you will have a hell of a time getting it stabilized. As you progress and upgrade the LM you won't have this problem, though of course you will have more experience flying and won't be so fazed by basic flight. Bottom line: when starting out only use yaw/rotate and leave pitch and roll alone. Mission types are fine though they boil down to fly from base X to base/point X and do something. Lost cargo is a little more interesting as you have to use your eyes to locate the target (the beacon is too short ranged to be of too much use in locating the cargo). Some other mission types would be useful, like a photo-mapping mission, where you have to fly a designated strip of territory taking images as you go along. The actual feeling of flight is superb. The Hills map in particular has a very authentic Lunar Highlands feel to it. Others less so. Canyons is challenging but the verticle exageration makes it look a little unbelievable. Mars is also a challenge but after the ""purity"" of Lunar flying is a bit frustrating. As far as this game being too difficult, well, I disagree. If you watch the basic tutorials you should be fine, esp if you obey the basic rule of ""no pitch/roll w/o a stabilizer"". If you want difficult, try Eagle Lander 3D which is a hardcore LM sim, no game, no missiles, no HUD, just the DSKY and a scribed pattern on the LM window to guide you and historical Apollo scenarios. For a niche title an impressive level of support. After the initial release we saw release of Oculus Rift support and then multiplayer, and continuing support into 2015. The developer has demonstrated maturity and staying power by supporting this very excellent sim/game.			"

												This unassuming title delivers far more than you might expect on first glance and has become one of my all-time favourite games! Yes - it's that good!The visuals and physics are superbly done giving you a real sense of low-G flight while keeping the controls very straight-forward. However, just because the simulation is limited to basic thruster controls, don't be fooled into thinking this is a simple arcade flight model.It takes a while to master flight and get used to the fact that (unlike an aeroplane) the direction you're facing is not always the direction you're moving and that your primary thrust (assuming you're upright which frequenly you are not) is pushing you up rather than forward. Learning the art of flight and mastering precise landings is tons of fun and very addictive.It's the *feeling* of low-G flight that this game does so incredibly well! I don't have an Occulus Rift yet but it supports it and I imagine it would be nothing short of incredible! After you finish a flight, you can optionally save it and play it back which is a great feature if you've done a particularly interesting manoeuver or perhaps recovered from a minor crash.*Note: I am a long standing PC gamer and get frustrated when the control scheme of a game is compromised to support gamepads that lack the precision of a mouse. However, Lunar Flight is a notable exception to that rule. This game is best played with a controller. A joystick/HOTAS setup works well (I've tried it) as it does with any flight simulator but in this case a gamepad is definitely the best option.There are 3 lunar maps of increasing complexity and a 4th Mars map that has stronger gravity and wind storms which push you off course and obscure your vision adding a nice extra challenge.Missions are one of three varieties: Transporting cargo directly from one pad to another; surveying (hover over) an area; or searching for and returning cargo that has been lost somewhere on the surface. In addition there are time trials where you have to fly from pad to pad through a series of gates as fast as possible and you can equip missles to shoot at either unmanned drones or other players in multiplayer.Personally, I find the magic to this game is in the flying - not the shooting - and I would have been just as happy if the combat had been removed from the game entirely. The time trials never grabbed me either as I prefer to fly at my own pace. The missions are fun but extremely simplistic. After 100+ hours in the game, I fly cargo recovery exclusively as it is the most interesting of the three.In some ways the game suffers from it's sucessful flight model as it's so much fun that even once you're past the challenge of learning, you still want to keep flying around. But, the simple and limited missions mean that there just isn't enough to do.PROS: - Well executed and realistic flight/physics model. - Excellent sounds and graphics. Both are simple but very effective. - Wonderful *feel* to low-G flight. - Oculus Rift support (even though I don't have one to try yet).CONS: - Simplistic and limited missions that quickly become repetitive. - Relatively small maps. They're sufficient but would be nice if they were bigger.Mastering flight can be a challenge at first. However, the realistic physics coupled with simple controls strike a nice balance between game and ""light sim"", making it easy to pick up.It's the wonderful sensation of low-G flight keeps me coming back for quick fixes despite the repetitive missions. I highly recommend this game to anyone that has an interest in flight games.			"

												This game is an absolute gem.  I only wish I had an Oculus Rift to play it with, but my TrackIR does perfectly well.Ever since ""Lunar Lander"" on the ZX81 and ""Thrust"" on the Atari ST, I've loved these kinds of gravity-based vector thrust games.  This game takes it into a whole new dimension: 3D.    Everything about this game is delightful: the mini tech tree to upgrade the lander, the background sounds, the retro green UI, the perfect lunar landscape rendering.  I have to hand it to Shovsoft, this game is so polished you can see your face in it.This game is for people who have EXCELLENT spacial awareness.  If you get a bit sea-sick, or can't read a map upside down, go elsewhere.   This is the sort of game where you have to be upside down, spinning, while flying in a parabolic arc, trying to calculate thrust vectors to slow you down and cancel rotation before you become a lunar smear.   I absolutely love the sense of ""being there"", especially with the head-tracking, and in-ear microphones.  Sitting with the lights off, listening to the NASA commentary and carrying cargo around, I'm in hog heaven.I really REALLY hope that there's a sequel to this which goes in the direction that HardWar (or SubCulture) took.  Thank you shovsoft, I've loved every second of playing this! "

												Okay.... had this game for a long time.  Today, HTC Vive support added.Blew my mind.  This is going to be an amazing experience going forward.  Thanks to Sean Edwards for his indefatigable efforts on this project - that some (myself included) - had thought was shelved.The addition of the Vive element creates very immersive experience and adds a greater essence of situation awareness - I had recently played a little on this previously using TrackIR, which was still very enjoyable.I'm looking forward to playing this a lot more.  This will be one of my go-to games that I typically use to ""wow"" my mates who haven't tried VR gaming before. "

												This is a very neat game, haven't played it in a while, but I did get 10 good hours out of it.And yes it is hard to fly, if it was easy, everyone would be an astronaught.I just saw a negative review that centered around how he wished this game was easier, are you kidding me?Here's a thought: Try hard to suck less.I wasn't great at this game the first time I played it either, in fact I crashed a LOT, but I persevered and was rewarded with a sense of accomplishment that only comes from doing well at something truely difficult. You cannot cheat your way to that feeling. I love this game.If you have patience and want a game that will hold your attention, but not your hand, buy this game.CoD players will probably get bored, and frustrated.			"

												For me, this is the defininitive Oculus Rift VR experience (June 2014).First, unlike most Rift-enabled games, this works perfectly simply by plugging in your Rift (note: for me it works best if you plug in your Rift first, THEN launch the game). No tweaking necessary, only minor customization for Xbox controls to suit your own preferences. Second, it rarely gives motion sickness, as long as you avoid spiraling out of control! This is the perfect game for people new to the Rift and should come bundled with the consumer version when it is out, IMHO. It is my go-to game to ""get my Rift legs back"" from a period of inactivity.The physics are spot on. The Xbox 360 controls and in-cockpit controls/HUD are the best implementation I've seen. It takes a few tries but once you get the hang of them everything is intuitive, and it doesn't take long. But for the fact I am sitting in Earth's gravity, I would think I was actully flying around on the moon retrieving lost cargo. And shooting missiles at my competition in online multiplayer. It is a relaxing and serene experience.If you have enough money to buy a Rift, you have enough money to buy this game. You owe it to yourself, the community, and the developer to give it a try! Otherwise, you are missing an out-of-this-world experience!I cannot give this ""game"" enough praise. It is more of an experience than a game!The non-VR version is probably also good (and higher resolution) but the VR version is so good I don't want to stop. This is a benchmark for Rift-enabled games, and an instant legend! Kudos to the dev and I hope to see more titles of this quality!			"

												I have been meaning to pick this game up for a while as I have always thought it looked interesting but for some reason never have ... until now. I have been recently hunting for demos and games that work with the Oculus Rift DK2 and when I noticed this had added beta support for it , well it made up my mind for me and hit the buy button straight away.I have no idea what its like to play on a normal flat display , but my god ... playing it with the Oculus rift , its an outstanding experience. It lends itself perfectly to a seated VR experience and the game does a fantastic job making you feel like your sitting in and piloting a huge moon lander.Hell I even had butterflies in my stomache ( the kinda feeling you get on a rollercoaster ) when my lander ran out of fuel and started spiralling to the ground.I guess you could say the game as a whole is a little repetative but it still gets a big thumbs up from me as far as a great VR experience with the Oculus is concerned.Well worth the tiny price tag however you get to play it.

(this is windows and oculus, NOT this game specifically)- If controls are somewhat or entirely not working, try removing InputData.dat from C:\Users\""yourname""\Documents\Saved Games\\LunarFlight\.

												I don't get it, the reviews are raving about this but as far as I can see, it fails as both a game and a sim.For a start, as a game, you have no variety and it gets boring VERY quickly. Yes, there are four maps but thats a bit of an exaggeration. You have TWO maps, the Moon and Mars, with the Moon having three different sizes. Apart from that, they look EXACTLY the same. You can choose between missions, either delivering cargo or searching for some 'lost' item but that gets VERY samey very fast and you get points/cash and XP for completing each task. However, what for? As far as I can tell, the only way you can upgrade your craft is to make it able to carry more stuff, its not like there's a proper tech tree or even different craft to choose from.As a simulation, it's not bad, its AWFUL. It kind of feels right when you first play it but it's not long before you realise youve been conned. For a start, you lift off, set a trajectory and cut your engine once you have the required velocity. Now, rotate your craft slightly, the thing will start to turn as if it was an atmospheric craft!!! Changing a space vehicle orientation does NOT affect it's path once the main engine has quit and even on Mars, where there is an atmosphere, you have no atmospheric control surfaces, so again, no difference would be felt. Also, WHY would it be considered realistic to have a Lunar type vehicle used to shuttle cargo on a planet with an atmosphere? Putting that aside, there is NOTHING else that you can call a simulation, no systems, no proper navigation, etc. It's just Up/Down, Left/Right, Yaw/Pitch. If you want a REAL simulation, look for a game called 'Orbiter'. It's been around for years and is pretty much a FULL simulation with very good recreations of proper systems and physics. There are tons of add-ons for it and you can fly anything from fictional futuristic craft to a very good representation of a PROPER Lunar Lander complete with the Saturn V launch system as well. Oh and there is no score, no achievements, no leaderboard, if you screw up your flight, you die, the end. The price? £0.00. No, sorry, can't recommend, certainly not at the full £6.99 price. The only thing I can see this making it worth a try is if you have a VR device. On sale for a couple of quid? sure, give it a go but these days, you can buy alot better at this price and you certainly can't argue with the above example that is FREE.			"

												""Simple simulator"" sounds a bit like an oxymoron, but I'd say this is one. The creator seems to think it's more on the arcade-ish side, but I think the flight model is complex enough to make most people think ""simulator"". You will have to think about when and how to turn to gain right kind of velocity, when to start braking in time and other things like that. I would also recommending using an analog control of some kind. Keyboard is too clunky. Personally I'm using a joystick. I guess the most arcadey thing might be the missiles that were added later. Probably to make the multiplayer have some point. I just ignore that and fly around doing missions. Very relaxing. There's also a simple level up system for buying better thrust, gyros to kill your spin and such.It had been said that this is one of the best early Oculus Rift games. I wouldn't know about that, but the virtual cockpit is enjoyable enough with just headrtracking (I'm using EDTracker with FreeTrack).			"

												Super fun game, super solid VR presentation!I've always liked flight sims and the space program and played the original Lunar Lander arcade game way back in the day. This game is exactly what it says it is - a modern take on landing little spider like ships on the moon. Except now it's in 3D and in VR, and not just any VR but GOOD VR. This game has got that VR ""presence"" that convinces you that you're sitting in a space ship flying over the moon. The bubble canopy of the ship gives you a great view as you coast low and slow over the moon. It made me feel like an astronaut and that's what VR's all about.This game might not have been natively VR but it sure looks and feels like it was. It's good purchase for that alone.The game itself surprised me since it's basically a sim version of the arcade game. It's not Kerbal Space Program but the flight model is way beyond Elite Dangerous (for lots of different reasons, mind you.) It's newtonian with 6DOF, which means you can get into serious trouble as you realize you're coming in too fast for a landing or that little bit of yaw you were ignoring has crept up and turned you sideways. Leaning to fly takes a little bit of patience and you should expect to crash.But once you get the hang of it and start completing missions, something clicks and you start pitching over for max thrust and pitching 180 to counter it, mindful that gravity is always pulling you down, mind you. It's never a set-it-and-forget it sim. You have to be on top of every bit of momentum and inertia that builds or it's crater time. But again, with the VR implementation, it feels like mastering the physics of space flight rather than a chore.I've only got a couple hours in but I'm loving it. I've found a game controller is the best way to fly for me. I have a HOTAS setup, but having a twin stick controller is just perfect for the thrusters and the triggers for the descent engine. So, it's a fun little sim that's been upgraded to a great VR game. Bear in mind that at the time of this review Vive support is beta, but so far I've had no problems other than the gaze-style selection system really makes you twist your neck to hit some of the controls on the side panels.

Well, if you like flight sims then you'll love this.  Fun game, VERY challenging (for me anyway, 'cuz I'm a lousy pilot), nice graphics, cool physics, etc.  Overall, well done.			"

												While this game was not initially released as a VR game, the cockpit was entirely redesigned for the Rift with large and easy to read indicators that may not look super realistic but help provide a very comfortable VR experience.The initial contact was a bit frustrating but once I figured out how I was supposed to fly this thing, it was rather easy. Unfortunately there are only 3 types of missions (+ a time trial mode) so after a while it becomes a bit repetitive.Overall a very cool lunar lander simulator that I recommend to Oculus Rift owners.

												Lunar Flight is a modern take on the Atari and arcade classic Lunar Lander. The game is on the verge of being a simulator, which is both a blesssing and a curse: the game is highly realistic, thus bringing a great challenge; however, the controls are ridiculously complicated, and there is no built-in tutorial.The missions are fun, but there are only three types and the game thus gets bland.The game really shines in multiplayer deathmatch. Flying around, targeting friends, then taking them down is extremely entertaining, and brings hours of enjoyment.Lunar Lander playtime is rather like smoked samon: while it isn't enjoyable in large quantities, small portions make it much more digestable.The $9.99 price seems rather steep as a result, but if you buy the game, you get a 75% off coupon to give to friends. If you get the game in a sale for $4.99, then add on the coupon, the game is just around $1.25. Utilize your Steam Sales, or this game isn't worth buying.Final Score:7.75/10C+			"

												Lunar Flight is a very enjoyable game that can be both relaxing and challenging. It comes with a unique flight model that provides a new experience even for accustomed flight / space simmers, yet is easy enough to learn if you are completely new to this genre. You only need to remember to pay close attention to the important flight properties such as trajectory vector and velocity which you have to bring down manually only by yourself as there is no atmosphere (except for Mars, but the atmospheric braking effect is very subtle anyways), and fuel that is realistically consumed even by minor attitude adjustments, as every spacecraft movement and rotation is done using thrusters. Another big difference compared to the usual flight model you're probably used to is that you also need to account for spinning which isn't gonna centre on it's own, but there are upgradable stabilisers that make it easier.The music style is fitting and unobtrusive, and together with the background comms chatter creates a strangely soothing atmosphere. Visuals are nicely done, the models are very detailed and textures have a very high resolution that should look great even on screens bigger than FullHD. Although I absolutely refused to use a 2D cockpit in any flight simulator I ever played, I didn't have any problem with it here, as it's very nicely done both on the functionality and usability side and also because it's mostly resembling the Apollo Lunar Module cockpit. Despite the small windows and tiny forward-facing screen, landing isn't difficult at all thanks to the very cleverly designed nav monitors. It can also be easily switched to a clean HUD with toggleable GUI screens, quickly configurable by buttons; or to a 3D cockpit.My play time should tell roughly how long it takes to complete the game, including all the single player achievements, without playing MP at all (for a reference I'm experienced in several flight sims and have a good HOTAS controller). If you want to play multiplayer, remember to ask your friends to get this game aswell, as there are usually no servers at all (which may change after the big update). But I believe you could get other players online if you asked at the discussions section and planned a meeting. You're definitely gonna need a joystick with at least one POV hat (preferably 8-way) to control the very needed lateral thrusters, or an adequate gamepad such as the X360 which the 3D cockpit includes a matching model for (soon to be replaced with a X52 Pro, I guess).All in all, I would recommend Lunar Flight to every space nerd who isn't afraid to try something new!

												I'm hereby going to write an exceptionally long review of this game. In addition to what everybody says about the excellent VR implementation in this game (or rather, sim), which I wholeheartedly agreed to, I'd like to add that bringing a HOTAS into the mix makes the whole thing sing like... an orca stranded in the red seas of Mars. Beautiful, isnt it?Anyhow, I lied about making the review long. I do want to say however: When some say that the Rift or Vive at the current level of technology is a fun little novelty which people will tire of and never use again after a few hours, I say; show them Lunar flight, together with some of the other new, really intuitive offerings that are popping up like rats in a forgotten picnic basket. I say; these people are so wrong, it almost hurts.PS: Remember that you, at the point of time this long review is written, have to go into properties in steam and opt in on the beta tab. This enables VR natively. This only works for the cv1 at the moment.			"

I was considering sending it back, or lobbing it on E Bay and commiting to will wait until 4k or OLED HMD get put in the Rift/Vive etc before getting excited.... and then I tried this.The work done on getting this into VR is outstanding, the cockpit is so well done, the seating position is perfect, the sounds, the lighting.... and yes in my playtime I only made 3 landings, but I will be back for a lot more..... this is ""The Best Experience on the Rift"" you can currently have in my view. Patience, care on the controls are needed, but it is serene, it is clear..... Absolutely blown away.... and blown up, several times...Great work!!			"

												With the addition of the 3D cockpit, OR and TrackIR support I have recently become addicted to this game.  Playing with an xbox controller, headphones and TrackIR - I forgot I was at home and not in a little cargo carryin space mobile.  I've blown through multiple hours in a day, gliding over the moon (and mars) while listening to the wonderfully ambient soundtrack and the chatter from astronauts.Missions vary from Cargo hauling which involves cargos of various weights and require different techniques to manage your fuel properly, to Data Scanning and Lost Cargo missions where you need to explore in a general area to find a lost cargo container. There are also Time Trials, where you fly a predefined course from one base to another in as fast as time as possible.  I cannot speak for the multiplayer, I see no active servers.  I would be interrested in giving it a go though if I could find someone to play it with.As you progress, you'll gain money and XP.  Use both to upgrade your little ship.  There's 4 components to upgrade, with 3 levels of upgrades for each module available.  First flight will be bad, but stick with it.  Once you learn the physics and techniques needed to fly and your brain associates all the HUD elements to what t he ship is doing, it becomes quite easy and you'll soon find yourself pulling advanced maneuvers while sailing over the moon.I highly recommend this game if you're interrested in actual space flight, or games like Kerbal Space Program.  You're going to need an hour or 2 of dedicated time to acclimate yourself to the controlls / feel of the ship but it's highly rewarding once you do.  Check it out!!			"

												They took the old arcade game Lunar Lander - from a bona-fide franchise that has existed since 1969 - and turned it into a detailed simulator. Let that sink in for a minute.Well, okay, Lunar Lander was fairly in-depth for an arcade title to begin with. Lunar Flight though is a full 3D sim with VR support and...deathmatch multiplayer, for some reason I'm not going to question because dogfighting in Moon landers with missiles is an awesome idea.It's fairly cheap on sale and has a good amount of content: you can even go to Mars now. Space nerds, physics nerds, and salty sim dogs will probably get a kick out of this; if that sounds like you I'd say at least try it.			"

												Lunar Flight is a game that one can easily become lost in. I find space and extra-terrestrial exploration to be a fascinating subject, and being able to explore the lunar landscape in such a detailed and physics strong game allows me to experience that, in some small sense, in person. When starting out, and learning the controls, flying even the most mundane mission is extremely challenging. After several hours of practice you can become proficient in the basic flight skills which can lead to some further exploration of the various lunar bases, lunar surface, and your ability as a lunar pilot. The game keeps things interesting as the player can fly back and forth from various bases, accepting missions to deliver goods, exploring areas of the moon, or recovering lost items. You are paid for your efforts resulting in further upgrades, maps to unlock (including Mars), and various achievements. The game can be very challenging and offers its players variable environmen modifiers especially when on Mars. Highly recommended for those who enjoy flight simulations and/or space travel though I would strongly suggest preparing yourself by purchasing an applicable joystick of some type.			"

												I have always been a space/moon landing fan. When the game graphics are optimised and the app stops crashing in Win 7 32 this game is fabulous. I am now running it windowed at 2560x1440 60Hz with no anti-aliasing, low settings except high terrain. I can now play hours on end without a single crash in 32bit.I have found the experience of undertaking missions on the moon/mars on my 27"" monitor combined with the superbly appropriate audio track totally mesmerising... for space fans this is a truly awesome game. Can't wait till the developer makes a frosty Titan level DLC with Saturn shining in the sky. The lander would need to drill in the ice to recover appropriate samples for analysis. Or how about a DLC mercury lander that tries to stay in the shadows to avoid overheating? Keep it up. EDIT Dec 2015: This game was abandoned by its developer stating shorting of funds with no promise of further input!!! Well if you abandon a game so abruptly, you obviously wont attract more purchases. With only 4 levels to play, no DLC releases and mounting negative reviews, what does developer expect exactly? what a waste of developers effort. I have waited long enough hence the bitter ending to my review.			"

												Lunar Flight may have taken the basic game concept from the classic Lunar Lander, but this game is implemented in such a spectacular fashion, there really is no comparison between the two. Lunar Flight is truly an amazing simulation experience. The upgrades, missions, and experience points make it feel fun and rewarding. Also works great with a gaming controller. $2.50 is a bargain for this masterpiece--check it out.			"

												Update: Just played the new beta build that includes native Vive support and it's the best the game has ever been! Works beautifull in the Vive with an xbox controller and is still one of the best VR experiences available.This is the best game currently supporting the Oculus Rift. Even without a Rift, Lunar Flight is a lot of fun to play. It's fun to play with both keyboard, controller and joystick and the multiplayer is a heap of fun. I highly recommend this to any simulation fans or anyone interested in space. It's the most realistic way to simulate lunar module flight.			"

												Lunar Flight is refreshingly solid 3D lunar lander. The difficulty curve is quite a bit higher with the added dimension, but once you hit the plateau, there isn't much more to do. Be prepared to crash and burn until you understand how to read the displays, but once you can reliably land somewhere, you can do it anywhere. I recommend Lunar Flight for what it is at $10, but when you add in Oculus Rift support, the story changes completely. This game is the high bar for native Oculus Rift compatiable games. The effort that was put in to make this work on the Rift is astounding. The entire UI has been successfully scaled and converted to head-pointable buttons, and the experience playing it is without comparison. Anyone who has an Oculus Rift owes it to themselves to play Lunar Flight, you won't regret it.			"

												Absolutely fantastic game, especially if you like physics-based challenges. It's a very simple scenario on the face of it: just fly your lunar module from one place to the other, but it is so well made that it draws you into its baron lunar (and martian) landscapes. The physics of your vehicle are brilliantly made so that it is a challenge to fly, but an extremely satisfying challenge. You don't have to use all of the thrusters to start with which makes things a bit easier, but as you get better you can start to use of the thrusters to get places a bit quicker (resulting in the occasional crash when you get cocky!).Just great and fun to play!

												This game is one of the best VR experiences I've had, bar none. There's something about cockpit, seated, experiences that let you seriously fall into the world. There are no districting wires getting tangled, the slow motion feels natural (you'd experience acceleration in real life, but you never feel like you're missing out here), it's just you and the world.I've only spent 4 hours in this game, because I mostly played it back before it had the latest VR support (Oculus DK1). Even still, for a VR game for me, this is massive. I've spent very little time in other games, I find it too annoying to stay in VR for extended periods of time, but in this I pulled out 4 hours in 2 sittings! With the recent VR support added again it looks like this is something I'll be spending a bunch of time in.The game is fairly basic, but I think this is what makes it special. And at such a good price point, how can you go wrong!			"

												A simple idea with superb execution. One of the best VR games out there, even though not made for VR originally and steam VR support still in beta.I'm not sure how I could miss this game for so long - maybe because I was scared off by its presumed age, or because the logo didn't look ""serious"" or whatever. Could not have been more pleased with this discovery. It's a very ""physical"" game - all about putting you in control of a low-gravity vehicle on the moon (and later on mars), you control thrusters in all directions (main thrust for up/down, side thrusters for left/right/forward/back movement, and combined thruster control for all 3 rotational axes, i.e. pitch/roll/yaw). Initially the whole thing seems totally overwhelming and uncontrollable, but it's amazing how you develop a better and better sense for it after a few hours of play.Graphics seem better to me than most VR games out there currently. Sound is amazing - chill space tunes, convincing engine and warning sounds, NASA radio recordings in the background for extra ambience. The HUD appears big and simple (probably because it's scaled up for VR), but is extremely functional. I didn't read the manual and only watched a single tutorial video, but could figure out what all the indicators meant relatively quickly (my limited flight sim experience probably helped though). Note that this isn't a serious simulator though - it's very much focused on the flight/thruster control mechanics; there are no systems to manage or anything of the sort.Only real downside is the limited content - three types of simple missions; four maps total (with the same missions); there are ~50 achievements but they're not that hard to get either. Using your in-game credits earned from completing missions, you can also purchase up to 12 upgrades for your moon lander to improve its performance and handling, but that's it. Apparently there is some kind of multiplayer/deathmatch mode as well, but that's not yet supported in VR so I haven't tried it. I prefer non-combat anyways. I'd love to see more mission variety, maybe a campaign even, and/or more challenging achievements. Coop multiplayer would be amazing too :) Also can't wait for replays to work in VR.Even for what it is though, I found the price absolutely fair. I think you too might like this if some or all of these points may apply to you:- you like space- you like flight sims- you enjoy docking in elite dangerous- your favorite part in euro/american truck simulator is backing up and parking your trailerThanks to the dev for this amazing piece of software!

												This will start a bit like goat simulator. You'll be amazed how fast you crash on your first flight, and your second, and your third, as you are having a good laugh, how even steering the freakin' module seems impossible to achieve!But then the impossible becomes possible and you eventually manage to steer the module. Then, many crashes later, you become able to land it without crashing, sometimes even where you wanted it to land. But touch the roll controls - those arrow keys that your daddy had warned you never to touch - and you will soon go into an uncontrollable spin to a fiery doom!Hours and days pass, and eventually you realize you are now able to steer the module so beautifully that it's amazing. Using the roll, getting out of spins and carrying heavy loads is not a problem for you.Yes the learning curve was hard, but you will be amazed how fluid the piloting has become. Then you notice the landscapes are soothing and you realise how immersive the sound and music are.I love just playing this game to relax, fly around the moon and mars and play about with the controls. Yes, the types of missions are rather limited, but just flying the thing is a really smooth experience.Recommended for all kids age 9 to 99.			"

I love the calmness and that it is really hard to learn!I play it with the Oculus Rift DK2 and and there is no way to describe how well it works.You ARE in the cockpit of that Lunar Lander and you ARE on the moon...Give it a try, don't give up and after a while when you succeed to safely land for the first time I promise you that you will feel great! You will feel like an astronaut......and play it with a xbox360 controller! This is a must!As a game I rate it 10/10 and when playing it with the Oculus Rift I must rate it 12/10!			"

												Do you remember a little game called 'Lander'? Well, if you liked that, you might like this.In this game you're in a Moon-lander, and you can do missions such as scouting, surveying and delivering. For this you'll gain ""experience"" and also money to buy upgrades with. This time, of course, it's in 3D. It feels very much like a simulator, you get very extensive controls (it's best to use something analogue, by the way). You might even have a lot of trouble getting used to the low gravity and slow response. But once you get the hang of it, it's quite fun and challenging. The graphics might be simplistic, but they're not bad and do the job. The audio could be better, but it also works. Recommended if you want an updated ""Lander"" or would like to fly in space.			"

												While basic in nature, gameplay itself is both fun and time consuming once you get to know the controls. There is a bit of a learning curve as with most games and also remembering you are in zero gravity, the pod will not maneuver like a car. There are a lack of missions I think so in that respeck it may become repetitive for some, but, each mission does allow you to advance and opens new doors for you to go through. The graphics are good, they don't have all the glitz and glamor of some games but your on the Moon or Mars after all, the text is clear and readable.Overall I like the game and don't consider it either a waste of time or money, it's fun and the multi-player works good, I've done  over a dozen MP sessions without a problem either in connecting or in MP gameplay.

												I purchased Lunar Flight a few years ago and didn't really get into it because I found the controls difficult to master even with Saitek X52 Pro. However, some months ago I had a brainwave and went back to configure it differently... Instead of assigning joystick to roll, pitch axis as you would a regular flight sim... I assigned the joystick x axis to thrust sideways left and right respectively. Joystick Y axis assigned to thrust forward and back. Throttle controls main engine for Y axis travel.  Thus with x52 pro I am able to maintain level flight and in addition the yaw is controlled by joystick yaw axis (twist of stick).I like this sim a lot.  I like the graphics... I like the non arcade nature and realism of flying moon or mars based missions to transport cargo or recover things.  Haven't tried multiplayer yet but I guess that will be fun since u have rockets and flares.I recently purchased Oculus DK2 and was amazed to find Lunar Flight is an incredible experience... Incredible because the developer of this sim has created an amazingly realistic experience through oculus.  You sit in your fully 3d cockpit and can control the instrument screens by looking at them and hitting activate button.  Everything is life size and in stereoscopic 3d with oculus and with Lunar Flight it just looks mind-blowing.I use runtime 6.0.1 and in direct mode for this sim.If you own Oculus... buy Lunar Flight.  If you don't own Oculus.. Buy the CV1 when it launches in Q1 2016.			"

												First of all, I am sorry for any mistakes I may make in grammar or/and vocabulary.This game, as you may already know, is a game about controlling a space probe on the lunar surface and moving it from one base to the other. Although it sounds interesting, after an hour or so it may start becoming a little boring and tiring. That's because the probe is extremely sensitive to the surroundings and controlling it is a little difficult (at least for me). As a result, it can become a little annoying. So nope I don't recommend this game.Keep in mind though that this is just my opinion. I don't want to keep you from buying a game that may grant you many hours of enjoyment. So do a little more research before buying this (or any) game.			"

												I gave this game a fair chance. The controls are poor and you are bogged with information that doesn't really provide any help. The mechanics just plain suck, and there is no significant help to improve the experience. Furthermore, there is no story and landing a lunar module? I think Kerbal Space Program is more up your alley if you like this kind of stuff. I got the game as a gift, so I can't complain too much.			"

												Lunar Flight... Is not really a game per se. It's Lunar Lander, except now it's in full 3D 6-degrees of freedom and you still have the same constraints as limited fuel. At least you don't have to maneuver in canyons, but you will have to figure out how much to burn, how much to rotate, how much to counter-burn... so you can land at the other base while spending minimum amount of fuel. Some objectives like cargo run, salvage run, and so on had been added, but the game is insanely hard as it is. There are some powerups you can ""buy"", but don't expect them to save you. This game is for masochists. Enough said.			"

Very hard at first, but like the guide says, it makes it that much more rewarding when you finally do get it right.

You will crash many times but it's worth it. Might be easiest to play with a joystick or controller but I use the keyboard with no problem. One of the finest examples of why indie gaming is such a great phenomenon. Check out the developer interview: http://games.on.net/article/15242/Aussie_Gamedev_Spotlight_Lunar_Flight Great to see it come to Steam!			"

The same combination of relaxing, peacfeul gameplay highlighted by thrilling close calls as you land, collect objectives and glide home to base hoping not to run out of fuel. Pretty easy to grasp but definately tough to master. Variety of maps and the addition of Mars give it some solid replay. Just wish there were folks playing multiplayer so I could check it out.			"

												Having been a great fan of the original Lunar Module game, I couldn't let Lunar Flight NOT be in my game library. The developers of this game have taken what was once a simple arcade-style 2D game into something quite wonderful. A 3D lunar landscape faces you out the window as you recheck calculations to ensure your thrusters are pulsing enough to lift you and your cargo. Certainly more complicated than the original game, this takes some getting used to. Still, if you're willing to sit through a nicely done tutorial, you'll be flying missions in no time. A wonderful game, indeed. Four stars.			"

None of your commercial radio rubbish.The whole thing hangs together in a way that you don't get from the big corporate games houses.It's not perfect - It's just really good.Serious challenges within a small range of mission types.If you fly serious flight sims, you will rate this one.It feels like a 'casual' game, but not an arcade game.This is up there with Illyushin-2 1946 (patch 11.1), Orbiter, Lock On Flaming Cliffs,and MS Flight Simulator X.And all from one programmer!

												A bit of a niche game, but what it does cover, it does very, very well.  If you've ever wanted to pilot the Apollo 11 Lunar Lander, here's your chance.Excellent graphics, physics model, sound and music.  This is the 3D version of the old Atari Lunar Lander game.  Don't understand why people have knocked the standard controls... the lander's controls (keyboard & mouse) are very responsive and accurate.  You can't learn this game's piloting model in just 15 minutes.  And the Mars map, forget it until you've upgraded your lander with Level 3 technology.Just wished there were maps for other locations in the solar system.  The Jovian moons or the moons of Saturn would've been wonderful.  Or maybe one of the larger asteroids, like Ceres.  Alas...			"

												This game is a detailed simulation of a newtonian physics for a lunar lander. It is a major accomplishment to be able to smoothly transport a heavy load from one base to another. Where the game falls flat: Once you have mastered the flight control and explored the different maps, there is not a lot of re-playability. Still, for true space-sim fans, it's an enjoyable ride.

												This game is a great simulation of what could be moving on the Moon and Mars with a Lander. In Lunar Flight, the simulation is realistic, it respects the laws of Newton and it gives you the feeling of driving the real lander. It takes time to get aquanted to the controls and the most difficult part perhaps is to get trained on yaw, pitch and roll, i.e. the real attitude. You can progress a lot without using YPR commands, but the most rewarding part comes when you manage those controls.  The graphic part is accurate: light, dust, shadows are just ok and on a recent PC it flows quite smoothly. The soundtrack is really good: it is an ambient track which fits the deepness of the moon environment, in which everithing else is silent. Always on audio, the flight controllers dialogues are a bit repetitive and once you got the main dialogue it's a bit boring hearing over and over.     Ok, I don't know if in a future in which the man could be on the Moon the best vehichle to use would be a Lander like the one in Lunar Flight,  which is almost the same of 1969-1973 Apollo Missions. Anyway, especially with the 3D environment, the simulation is really immersive. I also suppose that the Oculus Rift port will be amazing.Concerning single player, the major missions are  transport, cargo rescue and going from A->B. Some cargo rescue missions are quite difficult and be sure to have additional tank of fuel with you. Additional missions typology other than could be beneficial to the longevity. I personally don't care too much about multiplayer on this game. The upgrade system is normal: make money with missions, upgrade tools and so on, but IMO it does not really drive the game/story.  Something I really miss is a Linux porting: I'd like to be able to play it also on that platform.In synthesis, I definitely recommend this game if you are a passionate about astronautics and have the patience to learn how to control the lander, which is not immediate.

												Probably my favorite simulator on Steam besides the Universe Sandbox series. Ultra-realistic physics, this game may take a few attempts to master, but is a well rewarding and immersive experience and worth the patience. It really gives a sense of how critically important each tiny burst of fuel is in an atmosphereless low gravity environment (for a real challenge, there's accurately simulated high velocity dust storms and winds on the Expert Mars map.) I reccomend setting up your controls for directional thrusts with a gamepad for simplicity's sake. Runs smoothly on even fairly low-spec'd PCs. Trading cards a bonus. 8.5/10			"

												If you have an oculus and you haven't played Lunar, you need to.  It's fantastic.  It's an amazing beautiful one of a kind experience.  I love it and I've spent upwards of 4 hours playing with my headset on not coming up for air.  It's exeptionally emersive, you feel very present inside this little lunar lander.			"

												I had a hard time getting into this game, I just flip-flopped all over the place and crashed and burned. Let it rest for six months and came back to it. Took it easy, watched a few tutorial videos... and finished a few missions, upgraded my gyro, learning the thrust table, understanding velocity vector... I felt like a friggin space captain! Now I have all upgrades and a few hundred k credits to give away, haha.That said, I played all this in the DK1, every second I've spent in this game has been in VR, I have not played it on a monitor. If you have a DK1, you should have this game, if it feels too hard check out some of the developers tutorials, and definitely get an Xbox 360 controller. Hopefully Oculus will sort their Unity SDK soon enough so we can get DK2 support :D I'm looking forward to be able to lean forwards to see where I am landing... soooo much! The four pack is also great value, I bought that and then forced copies upon friends and family. Not sure if they have played them, but whatever! They will, eventually!			"

												Awesome spaceflight modeling.  It has a slight bit of a learning curve, but if you've played KSP you'll be fine; the controls are pretty similar.I'm honestly not sure if it's worth $10 because I completed most of the objectives within 3 hours, but holy shitballs does that money go to a good cause.  The dev's next project will probably be a modernized Strike game.			"

												Probably my favorite simulator on Steam besides the Universe Sandbox series. Ultra-realistic physics, this game may take a few attempts to master, but is a well rewarding and immersive experience and worth the patience. It really gives a sense of how critically important each tiny burst of fuel is in an atmosphereless low gravity environment (for a real challenge, there's accurately simulated high velocity dust storms and winds on the Expert Mars map.) I reccomend setting up your controls for directional thrusts with a gamepad for simplicity's sake. Runs smoothly on even fairly low-spec'd PCs. Trading cards a bonus. 8.5/10			"

Now I'm not sure if Shovsoft have made the game easier or if my ability to see in 3D has helped me gauge distances, but I certainly found playing this time was much easier. Either way I'm finding the game is now better with a joypad over a keyboard.

												There's not many games about the moon and there's fewer still that let you control a Lunar Module-like spacecraft. Lunar Flight offers an experience that quite simply can't be found elsewhere, and does it rather well to boot. The graphics are lovely, the gameplay tough but rewarding and the flight model feels authentic. Above all it is immersive and open-ended, which is just what I think it needs to be.			"

												Lunar lander games have a long history going back to the year that the actual landing, per the wiki page [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Lander_(video_game_series)].  This one combines a rich graphical experience contrasted with the 60's era technology that would have been available.  No stabilization or autopilots here.  Move from pad to pad, investigate areas, retrieve wayward cargo, and see if you can manage the lunar gravity without adding a new crater to the surface.   For a beginner, keep it simple.  Make changes in one dimension only at a time.  Gain altitude, stop.  Rotate the craft so that you're pointed at your destination, stop, pitch to a reasonable angle, reverse the pitch thrusters to stabilize the angle you're pointed off vertical, fire the main thruster to maintain altitude and a ""forward"" velocity.  Reverse the process when you get over the target and finish the mission.  If you insist on making multiple axial changes at a time, tighten your seatbelt and good luck to you.			"

												The developer has the solid core mechanics of a game here.  It's a real challenge to fly without exploding -- but that's a good part of the fun.My initial hour was confusing, as there's no tutorial, but I would have managed decently if I had just known to start off travelling base-to-base by staying level and using my RCS thrusters instead of tilting and using my main thruster.  The latter can come later once you get a hang of the vehicle and maybe some of the gyro upgrades.In the Oculus Rift, the game is amazing.  Being able to look up and around at different displays just feels so natural, especially when played with a throttle and joystick.  The sense of height and distance as you skim the surface, sweep over a cliff, or dodge the wires from the antenna tower is very immersive.  At one point I just started jetting up into the sky and doing rolls and loops, and couldn't stop giggling at how much it felt like I was drifting hundreds of meters above a lunar base.  For a Rift-owner and given the low price, I think this is a must have, especially if you have a HOTAS or gamepad.One of my most enjoyable experiences in the Rift has been skimming the canyons of the moon, hunting for a lost cargo pod, for over an hour, as it continued to elude me.  In many games this could have been frustrating, but with the Rift it was fun and immersive to simply be absorbed in a task _on the moon_.   Peering out my windows left and right, below and around, really put me there.Even without the Rift, the game is quite fun, and I recommend using the 3D cockpit mode, as it's simply more immersive.The cons?  Well, unfortunately, beyond the very solid and challenging flight mechanics, there's not a lot of depth in gameplay.  There's three mission types, which are good but very simple.  Once you've mastered flight, there's no real motivation to keep doing them (unless the competitive speed runs are your thing).  Note that I haven't tried multiplayer, which I hear is a blast.  If the developer added some more context for the flights, larger goals, and additional challenges, you could have an amazing game with lots of depth.  I'd love to be flying my lander to take part in building a lunar base, transporting materials of different types, emergency resupply for a biodome, or maybe a rescue during a Martian storm (there's a Mars level), increasing in difficulty as we build towards goals. Perhaps some additional decision making on where and how to retrieve or use materials, manage fuel supplies and cost, etc.  These could make the game explode in playability, and given the low initial price, I'd be happy to pay for some of this depth as a substantial DLC pack. Take my money!Unfortunately, the developer shared that he's not really making enough money on the game to continue developing it, which is a real shame considering he has a solid core mechanics -- he just needs to add the contextual layers.   So while I'm hoping that we do see more in the future, I'm not holding my breath.  That said, the experience was totally worth the price of admission, and I'll dropping in periodically to re-experience it.			"

												Excellent 3D remake of the old arcade classic ""Lunar Lander"".  I'm a classic cabinet style arcade game junkie and I can still go into the arcade rooms and play that old 2D vector graphics game that had the player landing on moon ridges by controlling thrust and angle of your lunar module, all while watching your fuel diminish.  This game ""Lunar Flight"" takes that idea and converts over to 3D.  The game is an excellent 3D landing simulator with superb physics simulation that allows for all angles of camera view and multi split screening for precise landing and threat analysis.  The game is a great progression from that old classic with added multiplayer support, weapon systems that also include counter-measures, and now has ""Oculus Rift"" Integration as well.  You can control x,y,z axis' and spin of your craft as well as angle and speed of the module.  The game gives you tasks like delivering supplies, Steam achievements to farm for and trading cards to earn.  Some controller stuff works but I couldn't get everything working on my flight stick so it's a partial controller and partial keyboard playing scenario for me (but it works).  Like most games though... wait for this one to go on sale :)			"

Graphically the game looks really good and the sound effects / soundtrack perfectly suit the game.It is one of those type of games where you start playing and without noticing you spent hours on it...

												One thing I'd like to see is the capability to orbit the moon. Even if there's no orbital mechanics, just the idea of having a spherical planet and the delta-v to orbit The Moon would be fun! It might even be a neat way to transfer from one map to another! Maybe even docking to a transfer stage to go to Mars.I do highly recommend this for any spaceflight fan or hard-sci-fi fan. It's not futuristic, nor modern, and it's also not as vintage as the Apollo missions. It reminds me of the 80s. ""What if we kept going to the moon?"" Well, perhaps we'd be using Xbox controllers!I haven't played since Scott Manley of KSP fame made his third video of this game last year, although I first bought it as soon as It was in the recent releases page.

												Lunar Flight is a beautiful game to play in virtual reality. Once you figure out the somewhat involved method to take off, traverse to the next checkpoint and land safely then you will start getting lost for hours building up experience on the lunar maps. After that, you upgrade your craft and attempt more complicated travel maneuvers involving axis rotation that reduce fuel use and speeds up mission times. While many VR games are more fun standing up, this game improves with sitting down and taking your time. Outside of multiplayer combat which I have not done, there's little need for twitch style gameplay. Take it slow and have a blast with the relaxing gameplay (well, relaxing till you actually have to slow descent and land correctly).			"

												Really good game! Throw-back for all the old Lunar Lander gamers out there. Loved the flight physics of the game, that's probably the #1 difficulty for newbies to overcome, once you get that craft moving forward, equal opposite force required to stop it, not so easy sometimes. Pootz's music for the game is awesome, listen to it frequently!!One major negative about the game though, suffered a hard drive crash and can no longer continue my pilot that I had over 200 hours playing with, real bummer!!! Also there's little support for problems with the game. The Lunar Flight forum is pretty much useless, when there's no answer to a question posed from several months earlier, then what's the use for a forum.Just hate that I invested that much time and cannot continue with my same pilot. Was in 3rd place on the global ""Experience"" leaderboard behind FlukeRogi and Ripcurl. Actuallly was told that Ripcurl has had the same thing happen to him, hard drive failure and can't continue his pilot. Overall though, it was an awesome 200+ hours of gameplay!			"

												Lol, was always intending to rate this as interesting but flawed, since I had only tried it with my joystick. With a joystick, the control rates are wonky, and you're missing out on a bunch of HOTAS style interface control you get with a controller. Just tried it with a generic Xbox 360 controller and it's GREAT! Flies nice and the interactions in the cockpit with a Track IR and the controller are fantastic. Highly recommended now, but understand that it seems to be built and tested mainly with a controller in mind (I don't like keyboard/mouse with this or Kerbal type games either), so be sure to try it with your controller of choice.

												This was one of the first 'proper' VR games, and was a revalation: a completely immersive experience where you felt that you really were controlling your lunar lander.   The further development of the game since then has meant that it remains one of the best VR experiences you can have.It also stands out because it is more grounded in reality than most space games, so there is a sense of it being a simulator of work on a lunar base, which adds to the experience.  It takes a while to get to grips with the controls, which are simple but realistic, and once you do there is a real sense of achievement and of having mastered a complex craft in a demanding environment.Definitely recommended if you want to a novel VR experience that is a refreshing change from the usual shooty space games.

												A bit of a niche game, but what it does cover, it does very, very well.  If you've ever wanted to pilot the Apollo 11 Lunar Lander, here's your chance.Excellent graphics, physics model, sound and music.  This is the 3D version of the old Atari Lunar Lander game.  Don't understand why people have knocked the standard controls... the lander's controls (keyboard & mouse) are very responsive and accurate.  You can't learn this game's piloting model in just 15 minutes.  And the Mars map, forget it until you've upgraded your lander with Level 3 technology.Just wished there were maps for other locations in the solar system.  The Jovian moons or the moons of Saturn would've been wonderful.  Or maybe one of the larger asteroids, like Ceres.  Alas...			"

												Superb on the HTC Vive :)The cockpit is scaled perfectly (life-like size), so it looks like you are really in the cabin. When you look down on your space-suit it's like looking down your body (size-wise)When you fly the light-effects are brilliant. The flashes from your thruster below... wow :)The shadows moving over your cabin-panels... wow :)There is just one tiny thing I dislike, but can somewhat understand why is there, and that is the 'dirt in the air' that helps you guide your velocity when flying. It does make it easier to judge your movement by eye, but also kind of spoils the illusion of empty space a bit (it's not a major issue, but more of a geek-thing I guess. It's the kind of thing that belongs in submersible sims more than in space-sims, in my opinion)It's a great and fun game and loads fast without all kinds of bloat or lengthy setups or startups. You just get going :)It's good enough without VR, but perfect with VR :)(Oh yes, one more thing; thankfully you can turn off the shooting-mode, if you're more interested in the flying part. Good thinking by the developer there :) )10 stars out of 10.			"

Now I got my consumer Rift, and still games in general tends to be very muddy, even with pixel density raised.. But not with Lunar Flight. This is one of those rare gems which is perfectly fit for our generation of HMDs.. It just looks fantastic due to it's simple, yet superb graphical aesthetics.Furthermore, the game is really immersive.. It provides you with a great stellar experience, it has a really good sound quality and a good dose of challenge. Also, the radio chatter is top notch. It gives the game a big lift in my opinion.

Thanks to the dev for working on the support for new headsets. The game is on the sim-side, without being too difficult. I'd say that you go from ""I don't think I'll ever be able to control that"" to being pretty comfortable in an hour or two.I wish we had more maps and more things to do. I'd be more than happy to spend a few dollars on DLC/map packs.			"

												Started to play the game (2D, not VR), for a few hours now, I like it pretty much.The immersion is great, and as soon as you have understood the LEM movements and the different rules to control it, the game is pretty addictive. It reminds a bit how you are flying the helis in FSXSome points I regret however, and I figured out after browsing the discussion threads that they were design choices, concern the way the XBOX controller is handled and has to be configured, and the weaponnery.In short, the controller is seen either as an Xinput controller, in which case you cannot change any setting, or as a Direct input controller, which you can configure, but unfortunately it does not receive a default configuration. So it's a bit of a hassle to set this up, given also that the game documentation does not state these subtleties.Also, the game controller in Direct input need to be up before starting the game, otherwise it is not detected (and you need to go in deep settings menus to have it redetected), this is also a design choice, but you have to figure this out... Not so noobs friendly...A bit confusing also is that weapons are still present even if you choose the No combat mode, and your XBOX controller will fire those in Xinput mode... no way to change this, unless going to Direct input mode, and again, documentation not in line with this constraint, so it takes a bit of time to figure this out also. Given also that weaponnery is only used for multiplayer combat mode, this design choice is pretty awkward too. But hopefully, the gameplay is pretty fantastic if you like flying in simulators, and enjoy the peacefulness of this moon atmosphereDefinitely worth trying, and investing some patience to go through the beginners pitfalls, after that, it becomes a great enjoyment to play with, especially using your instruments like in IFR flights!
