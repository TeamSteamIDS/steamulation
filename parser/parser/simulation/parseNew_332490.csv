TL:DR? See ConclusionNOTE: I clocked around 5-6 hours in this game but mostly while Steam was OFFLINE. Steam does not count game-time in Offline Mode.INTRODUCTION:Battle Fleet 2 is a top-down turn based strategy game by Capital j Media. It was made for both the mobile platform and the PC which was released simultaneously. The game features multiple ship classes, each having their own unique weapon systems and abilities with a tactical and strategic map you can play on.The player can either be an Admiral for the United States Pacific Fleet or the Imperial Japanese Navy during the Second World War. The game has an open world map including most major areas during the war like: Japan, Philippines, Australia, Wake Islands, Hawaii and many more. Lead your fleet into victory through careful planning, precision attacks, Navy composition and proper positioning.PROS:+ Acceptable graphics with very detailed ship designs. (although the water graphics is nice, the land texture could use a little more work.)+ Good core gameplay+ Ship variety with different abilities+ Historically accurate names and details of the ships+ Simple game with an adequately complex game mechanic (range finders, bearings etc.)+ AI (Also a Con): Tactical Map AI is competent on Hard mode+ Hotseat Multiplayer (two or more players taking turn using one computer)+ No Microtransactions (specially since it has a mobile counterpart)+ Customizable hard points when building new shipsCONS:- Short Campaign (could have used more maps to extend gameplay)- No tutorial- Land texture is horrible- No ship upgrades during campaign (I've been told Captains level up though)- AI (Also a Pro): Strategic Map AI is brain dead and leaves important territory poorly defended CONCLUSION:Its a NICE GAME, good for passing the time and a good way to satisfy an urge for a 'not-so-deep but also not dumb strategic game. For a mobile-pc multiplatform game, Battle Fleet 2 is COMPETENT. It plays nicely, has decent visuals, easy to understand game mechanic and it can run with almost all modern computers.I would RECOMMEND this at full price ($10 USD or your regional equivalent) if you're really into this kind of game, but if not, WAIT for a SALE.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												This could be a really fantastic little game with only very minor tweaks from its developers but as it stands it only has a couple of hours worth of gameplay. Why?Campaign is excellent, battles are fun, if slow, and its a great concept for a game - news of an atlantic campaign is very exciting, would love to see some Royal Navy and German ships in there. But it has a critical problem in campaign mode - once you destroy the enemys capital ships they dont produce any more. They spread their ships around instead of concentrating them, so you build up a couple of strong fleets and then wipe out all their ships. They replace them with only frigates, the odd destroyer, very occasionally a cruiser, and sometimes a submarine. I havent seen them build a single battleship or carrier. So i switched to ""hard"" mode. Nothing changed except accuracy of enemy ships and gauges for my own fire.This game would be brilliant with the following simple changes: - in campaign mode, ensure the enemy builds all types of ships(!!!) - people want to fight battleships and strong fleets, not lowly bands of frigates. - concentrate the enemys fleets, dont have them spread out with one or two ships to a region to be picked off.- have a speed button enabling enemy fire to be sped up. It can be very dull watching 10 individual shells at normal speed.- have an atlantic campaign with RN and German ships!I really hope the devs can fix these bits because if they can this would be a superb game and I'd happily support it with more money.

												There are two parts of the game, the overall map of the pacific and naval battles. Both are turn-based.The naval battles are fun if you enjoy turn-based fights based largely upon positioning your ships and estimating distances. Though unfortunately, you don't choose the starting formation of your fleet. It is definitely satisfying to see the shell hit from over a mile away, you can really feel the distance between the ships, and then see it crash into the ship and possibly disable some critical component such as one of their guns, or engine. The armament of your ships will also play a role in how things go. For example, the submarine can be shielded from most damage by being submerged, but can only hit the enemy from 1500 yards while the largest guns have a range of 4000 yards. It pays to have a versatile fleet. The enemy may have a tightly formed fleet with many AA guns, making your carriers less effective, or battleships with big guns but few/no torpedos, making your subs more effective. The battleship can otherwise outshoot anything, but can fall prey to repeated airstrikes from an aircraft carrier that is too far away to shoot. Ramming is possible and could be fun, but I've only accidently rammed my own ships. Try not to do that. When your ships can destroy the enemy from miles away, you tend not to end up getting so close.  The AI on hard provides enough of a challenge to be interesting.The overall battle map is fun, but the AI doesn't play it well. Oddly, America is the more challenging side to play. New ships can be built, but only about one per turn (or every other turn, if you want a battleship/carrier) while each side starts with over 20 ships. New ships can be customized in terms of their armament to some degree, to make the ship better against regular ships, aircraft, or subs. You can make the right side of your battleship able to fire torpedos at subs, with the left side specialized for regular ships, with all standard turrets to complement the heavier turrets on the front and back. Or replace regular guns with a few AA guns to help fend off airstrikes. There's always tradeoffs, and you want to consider what your enemy has and what supporting ships you already possess.You earn points to build new ships by controlling sea zones, and some are worth 2-6 times more than others. These valuable zones tends to have coastal defenses and ports where ships are repaired. You do control the defenses and they can make a significant difference in battle to favor the defender.  You can send a lone sub or frigate to capture undefended sea zones while your main force blocks the progress of the enemy fleet until they bring the fight to you. You win by occupying all sea zones in the pacific.			"

 TL;DR Battle Fleet 2 is a rather serious recreation of naval fleet battle set in a turn based settings where you have manually control every ships as distance and shot power data had to be taken from the test firing itself. Enjoyable for the armchair armada commander. Game Detail Name: Battle Fleet 2Genre: Literally Chess, Naval Command, Turn Base StrategyPersonal: Rather unpromising in the beginning but catches your attention relatively easily.Has multiplayer. What is Battle Fleet 2? I went into the game without any prior knowledge as to what its predecessor is and so without any expectation set. With that said i hated the game in during my early times with it marred by weird UI, incredibly cheating AI and various other factors that could have been avoided by taking the tutorial. Which i ignored. Then again after hurdling through without any idea the base game is good fun if rather lacking in content at the moment.To simplify manner Battlefleet 2 is a either a fleet turn base simulator or an armada turn based simulator depending on which mode you happened to click at the menu. Lets go in depth shall we? 1:Gameplay Like any good pair of old comfortable sock Battle Fleet 2 proceed to destroy you in its brutal, harsh and unrelenting gameplay during the early hours you struggle to find your wet feets in the game. The 2 main mode are the skirmish mode and the campaign mode with the skirmish mode further divided into custom matches and quick battle which is my favourite of the lot. Custom matches allows you to choose what type of ships you and your nameless fleet commander bring into the foray. While it is fun to simulate certain historical battle witht the abundance maps shipped within the game the real highlights are of course the battle itself. Gameplay starts you and your foes ships are dump into the oceon in a random formation with in the case of quick battle you wont know what kind of ship you ended up with until the battle starts. Everything is played in top down view seeing as you have to make all the range estimates yourself. Incidentally you can somewhat influence it by choosing the ship budget during the map selection menu but thats not very fun. Just choose the full budget and let it rip.Every ships turn to act are determined by their onboard commander with battleships of course going first but resulting in them acting last in every other turn. There is fog of war so recon the area searching for the enemy till you obtain visual is a must in which case you move on to the firing phase. Setting the gun on every part of your ship manually you have to guess based on the range indicator given what angle and power you need to set them to and if a hit occur the enemy status will be displayed with either only a damage occur or a module is taken out with it that could range from being deadly exploding munitions bringing you whole ship down to a mere incovenience with damaged munition that prevent that gun from being use next turn. There's are also engine damage and so on and specific part of the ship can be targeted albeit a bit unreliable at times with shots going all over the place the farther they are. Past their maximum range the shells and torpedo simply stop working.Not contend with only a battleship the game also comes with several other type with each suited to a different role. Battleships are the behemoth or 'tanks' of the ocean dealing death with their broadside bombardment, the historically accurate destroyer with their torpedo launchers and sub killing depth charges and the aircraft carrier with their deadly plane delivering bombs which are the only thing battleships fear. A few other unmentions are the submarine, cruiser and frigate. Admittedly the heart of the fleet will always be the aircraft carrier and battleships and during the story mode where it is possible for both to be present in a single battle it is often a struggle to eliminate them.Speaking of campaign mode this game has one! Even though  the skirmish mode would have easily suffice but the addition doesnt hurt it in the slightthest. Essentially you play the pacific campaign with it being US vs IJN in a grand battle risk style to take out the whole board and claim victory in a historically innacurate way. You can either choose to play the premade 'inspired by the historical fleet formation of that time or you can say darn it all and build howerver many battleships your funds or prestige point will allow you and finally kick those dirty yanks with 20 yamato on the tile based map. Campaign mode introduces extra elements such airfield that will bombard your fleet and coastal artillery which surprise surprise will bombard your ships. The reverse is true if your enemy decides to attack the tile containing these modifier and these fortification can be destroyed to stop their harassment during the battle.Did i mention you could also customize your ships armament? While historically destroyer are the sub hunter of the fleet you can always remove everything to add more cannons to blast those yanks off the water or you can install more AA gun to help your poor pitiful 12 gun battleship from the harassment of the aircraft carriers. At the end of the day nothing beats a broadside to a crippled ship while listening a particularly melodramatic violin composition.Of note is the difficulty and what it affects. While the AI do regain part of their lobotomized brain the higher you go the interesting thing is the distance marker starts to be less useful and at the highest difficulity simply dissapear requiring all the calculation to be made with the gut instinct. Or you know, fire a shot and go from there, like a true armada general. 2:Sound Nothing to really praise here, the sound department did a good job of making the ambient sound easily tuned out as you do all those calculation in your head and second guessing every mouse click confirmation. Seriously i'll give it a 8/20 for ambiency. 3:Graphics As with most turn based strategy games the graphics are not that high on the checklist [with exception such as xcom come to mind as you basically staring at your soldier throughout the game so they better be good] but Battle Fleet 2 surprise this reviewer with rather well made water physics and ships models [the landmass is ugly but this is a ship game not land battle].Choosing the highest setting showcase high level of details on the ships and the water being more believable although performance does take a hit with mid being the best of both world. With even the barrel of the ship being distinguisable instead of lump of clays slapped together in some shady backroom it fulfilled its requirement well enough. Conclusion You have well detailed ships set in WWII for heaven sake blasting each other with volleys of shells and sinking magnificently so what did you think the score would be? 8.5/10Could use a bit more content although there are online skirmishes if you got bored bombarding the AI with shells. Just dont get too cocky.Verdict? : Buy it if you ever felt like being a narcissist armchair fleet commander who wants to control what their ships does. And losing that expensive Yamato, priceless.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupCheck out the Original Network Groups.

												Hey, Harpoon it's not. But then again who has the time to invest ina game like Harpoon. Battle Fleet 2 is a mix of fun, some light strategy, a little bit of tactical thinking and the satisfaction of watching your salvos hit the mark. It isn't for someone that wants total immersion, but it does give us elements of everything that one needs to to lose themselves in the S Pacific or Atlantic while waiting for the kids to get home from school or on that boring flight to Tampa for business. Historically accurate, up to a point and interesting enough to hold the attention of a military history student such as myself, I think that the developer has hit the right mix to appeal to someone who otherwise might not purchase or be inclined to play a war game on any level. Furthermore, the developers do care about what the customers say...more than I can say for some companies. Pros:Fun Decent Enough Graphics and SoundSome Good History Engaging, but not demandingHas replayabilityCons:Not deep enough to appeal to real military houndsFeels a little 'appy'Overall, This gets my thumbs up for the way it can fill in the void of stupid apps to a pretty darn serious PC gamer like me. Like I said before: Fun, Engaging enough and fills the niche left between dumb apps and super serious strategy.			"

												I bought this off Steam for $8.49. I've been looking for a naval strategy game, so I took a flyer on this.As I understand it, this is a game designed for mobile phones and has now been ported to PC. It's turn-based and pretty basic, easy to learn, and fun to play. My first time playing, I spent five hours without even realizing; that's about the price of a movie ticket, so it's already worth it to me.My biggest complaint is getting saddled with random ships at the start of the campaign with no way to modify or mothball them. The only way to delete them is to get them destroyed, and that gives your enemy build points (and experience?). There's no way to 'refit' the ships with different hardpoint options (some destroyers and cruisers don't take advantage of being able to mount medium guns - 1 and 3 respectively, and sometimes even battleships don't have heavy guns mounted - one of the biggest reasons to have a battleship at sea as they outrange everything, sans aircraft, and are invaluable in taking heavily defended ports). When you play a one-shot skirmish you can build your whole fleet out of points (higher point battles, please!) and designing your fleet is easily half the fun.As I understand it, this is a growing and still developing game, so I hope these things improve. One way to help that happen is give the game your money. Less than $10? Totally worth it.			"

												A rare thing these days. A ""small"" game, simple in the best way possible, and a true example of ""easy to learn, difficult to master"". As you play and learn your way around the game, you start to realize that there is actual depth (no pun intended) to this naval game. Clever tactics and coordinated operations are rewarded with victories.Actually a nice singleplayer game - with both a campaign and ""quick battle"" mode, but also a wonderful multiplayer game too, with both network and hotseat play available. This isn't exactly ""Harpoon"" - but it's fun, and if you've grown up reading about Midway and the many other historical battles of the Pacific, this will feel ""right at home"". One of those games you can play ""while watching a game on TV"", or with a friend, over a few beers. For the price, it's immensely satisfying, and one of those ""juuust one more round"" games that..  caused me to be at work for the second day in a row after having *way* too little sleep. But hey, the Japanese have no more carriers in the Pacific, so I've got that going for me, which is nice ;)			"

												Picking up inexpensive games during Steam sales is always a roll of a dice. This one was a pair of 6's.This is a fun, top-down tactical wargame. While there is no tutorial, one really isn't needed since the controls are intuitive. Movement is done in turns, with one ""move"" and one ""attack"" command available per turn. Fog of war is present, so some ""attack"" moves have to be used for the purposes of recon.Attacking is done by way of aiming various weapons (guns of several different sizes, torpedos, depth charges, etc) and then setting their range. Near-misses do small amounts of damage, just as they would in reality. It can be nerve-wracking to watch your opponent shoot at you multiple times during a turn, each round coming closer and closer and closer...There are standalone battles, custom battles that you can create on your own, campaigns, and a multiplayer system. I have not tried the latter yet, but the single-player portion has been quite addictive, and is definitely recommendable. "

												A simple, fun naval-themed strategy game.  Beyond aesthetics, don't expect too much WWII history, it's a simple strategy game that lives in the guise of the fight in the Pacific with random forces for each side.  That said, the tactical combat is quick, easy to learn, and entertaining.  If it's available for a few bucks and you're looking for something to pass the time, it's worth the purchase.			"

												Nice! I used to enjoy playing battle ships on paper as a kid. Playing alone I felt transported in time to the second world war and the epic battles that ensued. Playing with a friend it felt like battle ships or chess, but of course this time with nice graphics and music. Overall the game is well polished. The GUI, music, animations and gameplay is uncomplicated and well thought through. Well worth the $10 I payed.			"

												For the money this is a good turned based naval battle game. Set during the pacific war you can play either the Americans or Japanese. Has a single player campaign, multiplayer and quick player modes. The game is set around a group of pacific islands. There are two stages to the game. The first is set on a large campagin map where you can move / engage fleets or build / repair ships. The second takes place after you engage an enemy fleet. These battles are not over quickly as the larger ships move slowly and the range of guns / torpedos varies. At your disposal are submarines, frigates, cruisers, battleships and aircraft carriers.The graphics are not bad and has detailed ships. Controls are very simple and the use of a range guide helps give you an idea of how far you should fire the guns. One nice touch is that if you miss, the detonation points are recorded so you can see how far you missed before planning the next attack.The damage model is realistic with different ship parts capable of being destroyed or disabled. Your individual ships will earn prestige as they survive each battle so it pays to keep them alive. In my first battle I was heavily outnumbered by both land, sea and air. Although I won pretty much all my ships were damaged. Back on the campaign map you have to move damaged ships back to the nearest friendly port in order to repair them. Thats where the game can become tense, especially if your fleet is a few moves away from the port and the enemy starts pursuing you. Just like it was in the real pacific war things become a game of cat and mouse.This game will give any naval strategist hours of gameplay. I only really have a couple of moans and one is that despite seeing a nice close up of the ships in the stats mode you can't actually zoom right in during a battle. The other is that I would have liked to have seen some historical scenarios as the pacific had many well known battles. I'm probably sounding greedy now but I would have also like to have seen an atlantic campaign with the British and German navies.Update: You can ignore my last part about the Atlantic campaign as apparently there is one on the way. Good stuff.			"

												Wargames are still alive on Steam. I really like old school, tactical wargames with some decent graphics, a good dose of action, and non-heavy strategy (not so much into base building or building up my empire or civilisation). Battle Fleet 2 is a fun game. The graphics are pretty ordinary but moving your fleet around while trying to torpedo the enemy fleet is exciting. The single player campaign is quite good which you can't say about many games. The AI attacks you strongly and in my last battle the enemy zoned in on my carrier and sunk it with the minimum of fuss despite my attempts to stop it. I haven't tried multiplayer yet but this kind of game would be very good to play against friends. It is quite simple to play and a great way to relax for a few hours.			"

												Great game, no keyboard input, total control by mouse, I enjoy playing it after finally understanding how it all works. It takes a little experimentation to figure it out.  The skill is in timing, angular positions and movement and estimating distance to target. You can target specific areas of a ship if you know the distance.  After 50 hours there are still a few unknowns like - the order of turns from ship to ship - it is predetermined and you do not get to pick which individual ship goes next be it Allies or Axis. Care must be taken in moving as you can collide with friendlies or enemy alike, the AI even has collisions. I am not sure I like the floating rewards in the water where the first one to get close to it gets the prize be it a free recon, air strike, repair a ship or put out an array of mines.  Perhaps if they could be turned off as an option.  As soon as I think I have mastered this game I look forward to my first multiple player experience. Last, it is really fast at saving the game but you are forced to exit the game at that time and while you get put back to the exact circumstances on restart the last range finder setting is lost for the last ship to ship encounter, a really minor annoyance. Overall, the replayability is great, it is a lot of fun and you are never rushed to do anything.  The highest of 3 difficulty modes is a challenge to most gamers. If you like fleet level WWII sea battles you'll like this.			"

												If you like Panzer General or any WW2 turn based game. Then Battle Fleet 2 may be for you. It's great seas battles at a low cost. The mechanics are simple to easy to pick up. This has all you need in ship warfare. Great Carriers, subs, destroyers, and simple Risk type gameboard. This is a classic tactical strategy game. Very much fun and addicting.PROSA: Very easy to play and straight forward. Battleships rule in this game by farB: Fun Strategic Cards that can turn the battle in your favorC: Damage is handled great in this game.D: Compass targeting and some fun features make the confrontations fun instead of 2 vs 2 affairs you could wind up with massive battles.CONSA: Manuevering is an issue, so careful of collisions. B: The lack of scope can make it too simple for those who like massive campaigns. C: The AI gets obvious in the two campaign modes. It becomes more about out numbering the front line than actual strategy in the tactical map.D: Figuring out Targeting from long distances can be tricky and falling behind the AI with hit/ misses can be a killer, but you will adjust. OVERALLIt should be Pacific Storm or KoeI's PTO, having more additional Strategic abilities and more scope to it, however for the price. This is a fun game to have. Check out Videos in the workshop to see gameplay. This is a great addition when it's 50% or higher off and a new expansion is coming. I can see a better version down the line. You love WW2 Turn based strategy, Battle Fleet 2 is a must have. My Grade:3 out of 5 stars "

												It has been a fun ride commanding ships and carefully calculating and placing my salvos.This game is simple, easy to grasp, and time-consumingly addictable.Board-game-like strategic zone capturing is a fun element, but pure battles are also reminiscent of those naval warfare boardgames, which I enjoyed greatlly.If I may present one major complaint though, is the re-usage of all the same ship models regardless of countries.Im not even requesting for some grandiose World-of-Warship-esque detailed ships for each ship classes, but even for generic ship models, I think ships should at least have some aesthetical designs representative of each nation's ship types.I mean, Japanese cruisers shouldnt look like USS Pensacola, at the very least.. Or, American battleships looking like IJN Yamato, for that matter.			"

												What can I say it's a great strategy game. If you dislike strategy games then it's probably not for you. But you're here reading these so I highly doubt that's the case. There's a good amount of variety and with online multiplayer battles you can easily sink a ton of hours in. Everything works really well, I've seen a few other reviews say it but the game runs really smooth and has very few issues. The graphics are great and the sound effects really draw you in. There's a ton of strategy and tactics trying to outmaneuver the enemy fleet and setup a proper ambush to run them over.I do wish there was more to the game and it's certainly not perfect but I had a lot of fun.It's a pretty low cost so give it a shot. I'm sure you wont be disappointed.			"

												I just finished the pacific campaign and must say this game is pretty entertaining. It is definitely worth considering if you are a fan of naval warfare. I would recommend it at a good sale price personally but i'm for sure going to get my monies worth out of it in terms of dollars for hours played. The game play is quite easy to pick up. The japs worked me the first campaign I played but by the second time through I had picked up enough to be able rule the waves.The graphics aren't anything special but this game isnt about the graphics, its about naval strategy and being able to calculate how far away an enemy ship is based on a 2000 meter circle and the fall of your shot. The having to calculate and figure out just what bearing and distance to put on a shot is what got me for this game.I give it a 7.5/10 and I hope all the potential buyers out there enjoy this game as much as I do.

												An excellent naval simulation game which should be an example and standard for all naval/space combat games.  A clear smooth interface, ship movement and firing arcs handled with fine precision and elegance.  After playing this game the bland inadequacies of most naval/space simulation games is all to apparent. Air surface and sub-surface combat are covered with a almost perfect balance of realism and playability . The accuracy and detail of the units are of the highest standard. For the price of this game there is no excuse it should not be in your library.			"

												It's not a massively complicated game but it does have nice little touches of detail and it's FUN, and FUN is what it's all about.  There's just something immensely satisfying about taking out enemy ships in this game.I was cackling with glee while finishing off an enemy carrier or having a destroyer finish off two wounded enemy ships in one turn.Das24680 has a couple of videos for this on youtube that show how to play and what the game is about (which is what inspired me to buy).

												Here we have ""Battle Fleet 2"", with a campaign map that actually reminds me of my model battles on carpet, while a part strategy game, part battle simulator that takes me back to imaginary duels I had my model ships as a kid. Distance is calculated not with rulers or yard sticks, but with the imagination and a slight advantage of range circles. Battles are fought by turn and the actions played out in real time, and there is nothing more agonising than watching your painfully 'calculated' shots fall short or long. Thankfully, you can speed up gameplay so these moments are short-lived.It took me a while to get around to playing this tremendous title for the simple omission of an in-battle save feature, as believe me the battles can and do go on. Ironically, since this has been addressed and there is indeed an in-battle save feature now, I tend to complete the battle...it's that ""Just one more turn"" phenomenon known so well to turn-based gamers.So, you have the Campaign Map, where you plan your advances, reinforcements, build cues and assaults. Then when battle is joined, you go to the top-down tactical map. One immersion-breaker is the use of ""Strategic Command Cards to surprise your enemies with special actions like deploying mines, sabotage, enhanced aiming, airstrikes and more!"", as while these are fun to use, the enemy AI always without fail makes a beeline for them instead of their objective. In fact it becomes a race to pick up cards. That aside, you attack, defend and send airstrikes against the enemy, and there is nothing more satisfying than pulling a hopeless situation from the jaws of defeat into a tactical withdrawal by the enemy with only a shore gun and a lone destroyer sinking an enemy battleship, starting a panic in the AI. Transports I still don't understand. They are obviously important for holding acquired territory, but just clutter the battle map and waste time getting them the Hell out of Dodge. Perhaps they could have been left from the battle, and their loss rate simulated instead based on victory/defeat conditions (as done in ""Victory At Sea"").While not as attractive nor immediate as ""Atlantic Fleet"", this is a far more engrossing and long lasting game for naval enthusiasts. If you re even mildly interested in W II naval conflict, and would like to test your skills from Admiral down to gunner...pick this up. You won't regret the hours lost playing this fine strategy simulator.			"

												Only played for an hour so far but at this price how could you not like it? Graphics are OK for this type of game although it would be nice if you could get up even closer during the action. It's got a pretty basic control system and is easy to learn, it could become pretty adictive if you like these kind of games. I've not tried the multi-player yet but will be doing soon.			"

												Battle Fleet 2,A game that doesn't look like much, but sure knows how to create a fun gaming experience.Within the game you've got several game modes: campaign, skirmish, multiplayer hotseat and multiplayer online (Devided in regions: EU, US, Asia, Japan)The core principal of the game is to battle it out with your custom selected fleet while hoping to survive another day. First, you think like: Ah, I gonno do this. Piece of cake. Then, a couple of minutes later you think: ""Woow, wait! What happened to my cool looking destroyer?""Battle Fleet 2 is like a cat & mouse game with the different types of naval vessel as cat or mouse. They all come with distinctive features. (torpedo, depth charge, deck cannon, etc.) You're even allowed to have planes in your arsenal.During the fighting you've got to plan ahead. Not that much, but a little. And using your weapons needs you to set the angle and power/Elevation of your charge/torpedo/shell.The fun part is when you're actually able to kick the nuts and bolts out of an enemy vessel with a perfect shot.Also, while you're playing with your cool toys you get a chance to pick up/collect so called command cards (They float as little boxes in the water) Those cards are a lot like the cards in the game ""Ruse"". They give you a nice bonus effect upon use. (Deploy mines, sabotage enemy ship, etc.)With all of that and for such a bargain price there's got to be a bad side, right?Well, yea, I guess.. The A.I. isn't of the best, but good enough to keep you playing. Just don't expect any Rommel or Eisenhower actions.			"

												I'm having a lot of fun with this game. Its easily worth the $10 to me. Hopefully the DEV will add more content to cover other nations Navies and areas of conflict. Weather effects would be cool too. This title has enormous potential to become something awesome if the DEV continues to improve it. Right now it feels like it was made for an iPad with quick play in mind for while you're passing time somewhere. Thats not a bad thing necessarily - The game is done so well that I love to play it. But its potential for greatness lies just over the next horizon...... and it leaves you wishing it had more. So with the content that it currently has I can still recommend this game. Lets hope it gets more content in the future or some extra mods!			"

												I never write a review on Steam but this little gem deserves to be the first!A great game for the casual player - with online options for those who like that (not me)The game is very easy to learn, although I still need to learn how to prevent my submarines to crash onto Islands ;)Every ship has it's own characteristics, giving the game a historical flavor, without making it complicated for the player. Aiming is partly done by being accurate and partly by your skill of guessing the distance. This makes that when you hit it feels like YOU achieved something, making the sinking of an enemy ship feel like a victory.The game starts with just a few options to play, but soon enough new options will become available. I was worried about the online games I needed to play to open specific options, but just one message to the developer made him opening these parts of the game for me (during Xmas none the less!!!).When you are looking for a fun little game on the side, with historical units/maps and a bit of  simulation - then this is game you should not miss. You wont be dissapointed!			"

												Battlefleet 2 has a quality about it similar to Civilization 5. You want to keep on playing.When I sunk my first ship, I was ecstatic. When I crushed the a Japanese fleet trying to move in on my territory, I was so happy. This game is awesome.The thing that sets it apart is the turn order. You don’t do your moves and then the other player does their own. Rather you move ships in a set order. You may move 4 ships in a row and then your opponent moves 3. I’ve never seen this before in a turn based strategy game.Also torpedoes are so satisfying.Highly recommend.			"

												First Impressions:Incredibly fun and addicting game.  I am a huge fan of the ""Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures"" and ""Star Trek: Attack Wing"" games and I'm pleased to report that ""Battle Fleet 2"" has a similar vibe in terms of play style...that is, each ship has a turn order based on captain skill and prestige points can be spent to add ships to your fleet.  I would have liked to have been able to specify the prestige point value for the custom skirmish mode, but there are a number of preset point values to choose from.  All in all, an easy recommend.

												Fantastic naval tactical wargame.  The strategy component is a little lacking and the system will still require some balancing action if the goal is to become historically accurate.  However, you don't play this for historical accuracy... You play this so that you can fire a full broadside from a battleship into a destroyer after you have the target ranger, and watch the tin can wither!  Definitely recommended!			"

												I enjoyed this game alot, not the best game but I enjoyed it very much. I would recommand it to my friends if they like this games combat system which is rather nice. And I rather enjoy this since it seems to me anyways of being the only WWII Naval Simulator out there. (again that I noticed) The turn based system is setup rather nicely and I like how alot of the gun shooting features. It reminds of me Battlestations Midway. Which was also a Naval simulator... Forget what I said about being the only naval simulator I know of, after thinking about it I know a few now. But the 1 downfall is the single player story whihc is rather short. I would recommand playing with a friend if all possible.			"

												I waited until it went on sale, but it's totally worth the money. I'm an older dude at 30 and I grew up with the old ""set the angle, set the power, then fire"" games in the 90's. This is like that but with better graphics. What I really like is the ability to damage specific systems. For example, I've only played a few battles but one I was murderously outgunned by the Americans. However, my little ships fired specifically, and accurately, at the cruisers main guns taking them out and defanging it. It was very satisfying.The campaigns are reminiscent of Axis and Allies and well, not sure what else to say. It's turn based, it has many ships and a rudementary economy. You aim and fire your own shots with luck and intuition to guide you. If that sounds kind of fun, buy it.			"

Great graphics and an intuitive UI.I have found that adjusting the window size can sometimes make the game unresponsive, but this is easliy avoided by not adjusting the window size from the default ;)Other than that one problem (that will probably be fixed soon), this game is hands down, the best strategy game you can own in VR.

												First no support for resolutions greater than 1080p.  Secondly to unlock single player maps, specifically Wake Islands and Australia you need to obtain online wins.  The ability to play as Japan or Germany first requires you to win as America (for Japan) or the UK for Germany.  Not just the Japanese and German campaigns, but to even use them in a quick battle (one off skirmish vs the AI).  I bought this during the winter sale thinking I'd launch it and get to have some fun a campaign marauding around the Pacific on the Yamato, but nope that's locked away.  You can't even start a campaign without playing other gamemodes first.  From the description about picking your own fleet, playing with weapons, etc. I was expecting much more freedom to set up a naval chess match however I wanted, instead I launched and found myself staring at a menu with 80% of the options greyed out.  It's an annoying arbitrary decision, I can launch into a battle as the USN, give myself max industrial points and run around but if I want to try another faction's hardware I have to grind. Refunded.As a later edit, I did some browsing on the Steam Forums and apparently these locks only came into place in a recentish update.  Others have taken to the forums to complain.  Apparently if you sign up for an account on the dev's forums and email the dev team, they'll unlock the game for you.  They can also do one time unlocks sans account (but if you reinstall later all the locks come back).  It's a few too many hoops for me, maybe I'll check back during the Summer Sale and if they've patched the locks back out.			"

There is still something satisfying about landing a salvo from your battleship on the the enemy carrier by just eyeballing it.  I had a problem playing this game, likely due to poor support for AMD graphics cards.  The dev contacted me immediately after I posted my problem and worked to help solve it.  Currently I am using a work around,  but I am confident that it will be fixed.			"

Definitely recommend this game! Totally worth the money and tons of fun.			"

												A fun and enjoyable game. A lightish mix of strategy and history, best suited for ""Average Joe"" gamers I think. Not much of a learning curve, even without a tutorial. I'm not into mobile gamimg so I'd like to see it a bit beefier but it is entertaining. The unlocking scheme has put many people off, but the devs will unlock things for you if you ask. I sent an email and it was done almost immediately. This is my first naval combat game, I've been strictly a landlocked turn based startegy gamer and this is a good way to get my feet wet, as it were. Looking forward to any future developments. I bought it on sale, but I'd say worth it at full price unless you are a hard core grognard.			"

												Bought this on a whim during the Winter sales and it turned out surprisingly fun.Turn based naval warfare with WW2 tech.Would recommend getting this when on sale.The system is easy to learn and uses simple mechanics. You have to set the angle and power when sailing and firing.There is no tech tree to speak of. Just some (3?) ships to unlock and parts.Its not a simulation, so dont expect much realism.Customization is limited to swapping out some guns on ships (eg - small cannon for an AA gun). No camo or paint jobs.Graphics wise, dont expect much as it is from a mobile game. Its simple and does the job (Eg - Ship parts burn when destroyed.) "

												Lovely little game of turn based battles and turn based campaign.  No twitchy features at all are a huge boost in this game.  What stands out about it is the 'worms-like' firing mechanic.  Hitting and missing is about careful judgement of range, which definitely gets easier to judge as you play more.There are some defnite downsides to this game, the main one being there is only one campaign to play, the pacific.  Other things are the ship customisation doesn't seem to remember what you chose last time, though that may be an option somewhere I missed, and finally, that guns are a bit more powerful than perhaps they shoiuld be, and torps a bit weaker.  None of those things detract from the overall effect of a really nice, simple, cheap game, playable in half hour bursts.  Great for the price, 5/5			"

												What a entertaining little game.It runs perfectly on a ""office"" toaster - meaning the absolute non-gaming rig. It is turn based so one can leave it running and do turns whenever there's a hole in the schedule, during lunch break, coffee timeouts etc.It is a mirrored setup wargame with no asymmetry, meaning all nations have access to the same ships with the same capabilities. This leads to a very ""alternative"" version of nations but it is by no means a deterrent. Quite funny to see Nazi Germany with a fleet of carriers...I like the ""scorched earth"" mechanics although it has ample space for further development - IMO the torpedoes should not be fire and forget but rather arm them for a distance.All in all a great buy and great ""little"" game with extensive replayability.

												Battle Fleet 2 is a fun and addictive game.  There are lots of ships including various battleships, cruisers, aircraft carriers, destroyers, frigates and submarines for both side of conflit: US and Japan.  For the single player campaign mode, the AI is very competent during the tactical battles, but I find it lacking in strategic layer, the strategic AI is too passive.  For those unfamiliar with this type of game, players take in turns shooting at each other by setting the angle and power for each shot, seeing where that shot lands and then adjusting their next shots until they hit and destroy their opponent's ship. Battle Fleet 2 has detailed shot and damage modeling, including the altitude of the shells are modeled during their firing arc.  The graphic are crisp and clean, interface is simple to learn and pick up, the sound effects and the damage modelling bring the fights to life.There’s not much to fault this game on, except no save during tactical battles and the campaign mode lacks depth, also one can argue it is entirely too easy to use smaller caliber gun to get bearing and distance, then obliterate the opponent with bigger guns.  But this is really fun and addictive game, highly recommanded.			"

												Combat is turn-based, requiring manual control of ship movement and aiming/firing weapons. You need to estimate the firing range of enemy targets (except when firing torpedoes or launching Airstrikes).There are 7 ship weapon types in the game (Depth Charges, Torpedo, Anti-Aircraft gun, Deck Gun, Standard Turret, Medium Turrent, Heavy Turret).Each weapon type has a certain firing arc, does a certain number of damage points (varies slightly in actual use during combat), has a certain maximum firing range. has a certain number of guns (if any), and has a certain number of times that it can fire each combat turn.Some territories are defended with a certain number of Coastal Artillery and/or an Airfield that need to be destroyed before the territory can be conquered.Each territory requires the attacking fleet to have a certain minimum number of transport ships (if any) in order to be able to conquer that territory.Each turn, you earn Prestige Points equal to the value of all of the territories under your control.You spend Prestige Points to build ships in any territory with a shipyard that is under your control.There are 7 ship types in the game (Transport, Submarine, Frigate, Destroyer, Cruiser, Battleship, Carrier).Each ship type has a certain number of certain weapon types that are mounted in certain fixed directions (either Fore, Port, Starboard, Mid (i.e. can fire to either port or starboard), or Aft).Each ship type has a certain number of Hit Points, a certain maximum movement range per combat turn, a certain turning radius, and certain abilities (depth charges, sub detection, recon aircraft, squadron aircraft, territory capture).Each ship type has a Bridge, an Engine, a Rudder, and Ammunition (the Carrier also has a Flight Deck) that each have their own individual Hit Points.Squadron Aircraft from Carriers can perform 1 of 3 possible action types (either Defend, Recon, or Airstrike).Conclusion: If you like very slow-paced, turn-based tactical movement and combat, and having to estimate firing ranges of targets, then you will enjoy this computer game.Personally, I think that this computer game is okay but I can't recommend this computer game because it is too slow-paced for my liking, I don't like the way that aircraft function from aircraft carriers, and I really don't like having to manually estimate the firing range of targets.I recommend that you buy, install, and play the naval combat computer game Victory At Sea instead which has a lot more ship types and, in my opinion, is a superior and more realistic naval combat computer game.

												This game is very detailed, involves strategic and tactical thinking and rewards it. There is nothing quite like correctly estimating the enemy position and just nailing them. However, the down side is that because it is ""turn based"" and there are so many units, and the AI goes through turns invidividually (which can really suck when AI has like 15 ships) it is a VERY slow game. on the strategic map you can see where to move your fleets, guess enemy positions or send planes to scout them it is cool. but the battle phase..literally one match where the enemy attacks you may take almost an hour (and this doesn't even count when game progresses and you are entering into a battle one after another (30-45 min matches x 5 in succession is just sooooo  slow. other than the very very slow paced combat, it is fun. I just wish there was an auto option for when your forces are crazy superior to the enemy or vice versa, so you could quick battle that combat and not waste 30 min's on a battle you know you can't lose or alternatively can't win. it just turns into a time sink. if they fix this issue, yes get the game. if not, well then do you long tedious drawn out battles where you know the outcome once a match starts? well then look no further as half your battles will involve this.

I just think the game is too easy and shallow.Minor things that I didn't liked:1. The movement of the ship is controled by a heading+distance, but the trajectory is not shown before advancing. Conclusion: I ended up sinking my own ship by sending it to the shore.2. the campain is too simple and has funny things, like allowing capturing the whole pacific with a single frigate.3. I can not fast-forward the enemy shots4. Carriers win against basically everything.			"

												Ok, the game is a load of fun. The graphics are cool and it's fun blowing ships up. That being said as it is now, you will play it 2 or 3 times and never look at it again. As others have said the A.I. only seems to build frigates. Basically all you need to do is wipe out there main fleet at the start. Which is not hard to do. Then build 3-4 fleets of a destroyer for subs and the Capitol ship of your choice and choke them off. At the end you will need a descent fleet because of the airports and ground artilliary but it's not that big a deal.The first thing I thought of was how cool would it be to have a Star Trek game like this?I slightly recomend the game but I could just as easily slightly not recomend it because of the replay value. If you have kids that like playing it I guess you would get more value out of it.			"

												Pretty fun but it has a few major glitches.  If you attack a sector and then retreat it actually makes the Enemy abandon the sector.  I actually won teh campaign just by having my Japanese destroyers blitz the American sectors with this tactic.It's a promising idea for a game but it'd be great to see a bit more depth.  There's a limited amount of armament so each ship feels generic.  A few things like giving the Japanese Long Lance torpedoes with extended range, or maybe a Radar upgrade for the Americans (which would add more range circles) would make the ships feel more unique.Overall it's worth the money if you really love games about naval battle, but there's still a lot of room for improvement and expansion.

												This is what I would refer to as a good ""laptop - airport"" game. What I mean by that is that its a good offline game that I imagine most laptops could handle and can kill a fair amount of time while waiting at an airport, or the like. Its not bad, but there is still a fair bit left to be desired so I could only recomend this as a on the cheap game.The parts that I like most is the gameplay mechanics. Having to use your brain and calculate distances by dead-reckoning brings a good level of strategy into the game. I also like how all new ships are customizeable, at least to a point. Plus having various parts of a ship destructable adds a good touch.The main point that I did not care for as much was the point system to fund new construction. I found it to be too limited and too difficult to save up points for high-teir ships. Additionally, I felt that the speed of the ships were lacking, and it made it tedious to get fleets into a good matchup. To follow up with this complaint I did not like how the game auto-deploys the fleet, usually spreading your ships all over the map without much rhyme or reason (at least to my mind).This is not by any means a high-paced action game, this is a sit-down thinker and for some people this game should be a good match. For everyone else, it is probably something to walk away from. Personally, I will probably put in a few hours into it here and there still so I will recomend it for that reason.			"

												I've been watching this game since voting for it in GreenLight, am pleased to see it released.  I've only had this two days now and have played as many games, one on Easy mode and another on normal.  Both levels were just the right agressive level for the AI, though the AI doesn't make very good decisions; I hope that there are fewer stupid choices made by the AI in hard mode (such as moving all 6 of it's fleet vessels out of it's home port worth 25 points to capture a space worth only 5 points when I have a fleet of ships sitting just outside his home port).From a new player's point of view, the initial game was a bit confusing.  Commands weren't quite clear and I didn't know how to work the interface.  It took me a few turns to figure out how to attack with a carrier, the listed commands while limited, don't give the right vibe as to the correct couse of action, at least not initially for me.  First bit of advice, make your first game on easy mode just to get used to the controls.That said, LOVE the graphics & details, sound effects and music are awesome.  I even had the graphics up on max spanning three screens and it looked amazing.  Once you figure out the controls, the game is quite simple and easy to play, it boils down to strategy and good range guessing.There were a few features of the game I didn't care for and would like to see a future update for.1)  The aiming line from your ship is lost over land targets, it would be very helpful if it didn't stay limited to water level.2)  Each map has a few strategy cards hidden on it, and for the most part they are placed in the travel lanes of the AI ships (so they can pickup while en-route to me), any of these cards near my ships require that I turn completely around or go quite out of the way to obtain.  This game features heavily favors the AI, and just gives me a negative feeling about that particular game feature being fair to both parties.3) It would be nice if the game allowed a joint attack option, if I have a fleet on opposite sides of a section I want to take over, it would be great if both could attack the sector together and meet up in the middle as opposed to only being able to move/attack with one fleet at a time.  Still, not a deal breaker but I have a feeling I'm going to wish I had this ability in hard mode.4) I'm concerned about the replayability of the game, my early impression is that I'll get bored with this over time due to a lack of variations of play, but the multi-player aspect will help with some of that.Overall, it's a very good game, appropriately priced, and so far pretty garsh darn fun to play.*Addendum*Finished hard mode, sadly the game is still spitting out only frigates.  Once you knock out the the initial nasty fleet, it's easy peasy so hopefully we'll see an updated with an improved AI purchaser.  AI continues to be horrible, higher skill levels just translates to fewer misses by the computer, not smarter game play.I also tried out the multi-player and nobody is ever showing up.  I hope this is a bug and not a sign that nobody else is playing or interested in this.  I also hope they come out with an email turn  based PVP campaign mode, taking it back old school but this game could really benefit from that and add some longevity to game interest.I've found that my old ratio's class I had waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay back in 5th grade has really helped with range estimation.  If you're pretty good with math or geometry, you'll be hard pressed to miss a shot in this game.			"
