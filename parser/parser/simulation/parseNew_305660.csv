Early Access Review
								As a true fan of zombie games I was dreaming about massive hordes, awesome powers from virus's mutations, fearsome human resistance and great strategies...I was wrong.[Long review, updated 3 times, last entry the 06/07/2015]  THE LAYOUT:You are a virus capable to create zombies from dead humans  and manipulate your dna to throw horrible powers.Your goal: kill humankind.   GAME MODES:The first one is Skirmish: Your goal exterminate all humans. To help you, you start with few zombies and marked locations such as radio towers, military depots that you can destroy to slow army spawning rate. Each kills brings a new zombie and some times you gain genes to summon a special unit (4 in total).Since the update of Virus 14 into Infect and Destroy 05/12/2015, the game plays like a rts. To get units you use your few zombies who represents a horde and run into buildings wich represents cities. Every time you run into a building, it collapses leaving a cloud or hundreds of chunks. Military units stays on the ground, even helicopters. This reworked skirmish is on tracks, because now the game has a view from above and a minimap to see where your zombies are and important locations. So on the rts aspect the game, now, looks better but it's sad that you don't have special skills anymore. Because special zombies are just a way to make hordes more resilient.The new maps added for the rts/skirmish rework of the game are questionable.First on the second map, your starting zombies are out of view. You need to clic on the mini map to find them. Second is the new hunger system. If you don't kill humans, your hunger bar will reach zero wich means game over. Instead of 10 mins timer, you now have to rush and kill everything to stay alive.So many maps are impossible, due to very powerfull soldiers (they now have artillery weapons who acts like sentry turrets), and the lack of time. The 2 new maps are good clues of this problems.The first one are few islands where the main one is heavily guarded, you have to reach the others to create your  hordes. The time your hordes spend in water is so important that you will surely loose (add to that poor controls as i said before).Or the other one where you start with a massive horde (i like the new ground skin wich represents infected dirt), your hunger bar drops so quickly that you can't even reach the city behind army's defenses !The only original mod/map, is the one where you play against antibodies in a human cell. You have to destroy (push virus strains to) a dna chain to win. You can infect blood cells to replicate the virus and mix them to make bigger and stronger virus cells. Not bad but slow paced with not much variety and quite buggy (few times the dna didn't collapsed, so i didn't won even with if dna's health depleeted). The second one is World domination: You use few hordes on the world map (a really disturbing sphere) to destroy cities and get more hordes to infect the world. You can ""build"" zombie's structures to increase horde's spawn rate, strengh, dna research's rate, ect... By talking about researches you can modify your hordes with a menu where health, speed, contamination and some other options can be upgraded.Seems fun at first, but the game is horribly long. You are unable to save and to finish... it's horribly boring!No different hordes, stress or moral  indicators are absolutely useless (frankly i don't know how to manage it and i don't see what's the difference between each moral states especially for humans). You can even receive nuclear missiles on infected cities. Human defenses are always the same: few soldiers, helicopters, and planes to deliver bombs. But the worse is related to fights and performances. When you kill soldiers, the ground will be covered with a huge pool of blood (1 pool can cover 1/4 of U.S.A). But the most difficult is that with burning cities and blood pools it increases memory usage dramatically ! Quickly, on my computer, the fps drops and makes this game mod barely playable.  CONTROLS:Much better there are still big issues. Like for the second skirmish map where your starting zombies are out of view. You need to clic on the mini map to find them. You are unable to make groups (you have to select on your screen zombies you need for attacks). An overall lack of shortcuts, wich is a real problem, because you loose the precious time needed to set up strategies and synchronize your attacks.Or when you press escape to leave a menu like the one for special zombies and it brings up the yes or no to quit the game...The most disturbing is the game's map for World domination where you can't have a global view of earth... you have to drag all the time something that could have been flat.     GRAPHICS:The game is ugly and maps are empty. As an example buildings explodes like piles of polystyrene and you have random objects like hotdog carts or bus stops scattered everywhere on maps without any reasons like buildings in general. No coherant cities, roads, and human activity in general.I don't ask for the new SimCity 15 000, but you could have done better.And World Domination is too unstable.Really sad especially on a game with so much potential!   MUSIC:Musics are good and i'm happy that devs have fixed it.Maybe more related to your in-game actions.   TO CONCLUDE:In Early access of course but there is no fun to send zombies to kill stupid humans and blad soldiers ( why bald soldiers ?!). Actually, even using special infected is uninterresting. You can't activate special skills (skills for special infected would be cool) or use movements such as jumping, climbing, crouching, ect....This game needs a lot, A LOT of work to bring a sufficient interrest.Infect and Destroy is too limited and World domination brings nothing better to the game.To players:Wait further updates because Infect and Destroy is actually (06/07/2015) too unpolished and even if some players might have fun on the game, for me it's not the case.To developpers:Please, make Skirmish maps longuer or give us ways to make custom scenarios because the hunger system is really annoying.Your game is too limited and be ware, you've changed the gameplay (it's allright for me) but frankly there are no strategies. Raising undead and throw them on soldiers is not interresting especially because controls are not optimized and maps are not funny (why did you add random items scattered on the map without creating coherent cities?). Keep it up guys, take your time and do something great !N.B: Can you try to bring one or two decent maps and maybe new game mechanics ? Why not new ways to get zombies, new ways to act like a horde ? To merge zombies into a real horde would be awesome, even merging in general to show the horribles capacities of the virus. The ultimate zombie should me more like a shapeless mass of fusionned zombies instead of a big zombie bodybuilder fed with virus. Managing zombies/human as a building material and troops like stealth approaches, especially on world domination to show impact of moral and virus discovery would be a great addition.And the most important: give us a roadmap. We want to know what do you want to achieve with this game. To go from action game to rts is a big step wich could mislead potential buyers.Thanks for reading.			"

								Okay, so I've played one game of it, and this game is a little mixed. I'll still rate positive.So far, there really are no negatives. Just areas that need to be implemented.Positive feedback:Love the fact that there NEEDS to be a horde before attacking anything major. This is brilliance! I lost my huge gang of zombies to a military group and lost serious time.Love the fact that there are running humans to keep it a little difficult.Love the control system.Things that could possibly or definitely need improvement (Seeing how this is early-access and I bought this the day it became early-access):Controlling the zombies is fun, but maybe make a way to always include new stray zombies into the horde? Instead of stopping to pick him up, then start moving again?Tutorials on Helicopters. I read through the tutorials while I was playing, and wondering ""What the heck are these? How do I counter them, and what the heck, now they're killing my zombies??"" Some tutorials would be nice. :3The camera angle is weird. Manageable, but weird. Especially when trying to round up an entire pack of them, zooming out to move and zooming in to herd them all up gets tedious and awkward.Of course, the content. Campaigns apparently aren't done yet, Multiplayer apparently isn't ready yet, and there's only Skirmish. I get it, it's day one. I don't expect much out of a 100Mb game.Love the idea! Keep at it, please!! I'll be watching for updates! :D8.5/10 (subject to change as content releases)			"

Early Access Review
								I personally found the World Domination gamemode the best and most fun but at certain point it becomes almost unplayable - the game starts lagging very heavily and the fps drops to below 1 and I'm sure it's not because my computer is slow or bad. And also when I finish a World Domination game I have to close the game everytime because I can't get past the stats screen. Also I hope they would add some more cities into the World Domination gamemode just because it's fun to destroy them with giant zombie hordes.The other gamemodes are alright as they are even though there's not many missions/maps.So, developers please fix the laggy World Domination.

								Can't turn music off!!!! It's really annoying!!! Better off playing without sound, or better yet, don't play the game at all.You don't even have time to read the tutorial. I kept dying of hunger, said the hell with it. There isn't much to the game. You grab a group of zombies and infect humans. My short time of play, I got bored quickly, not much fun if you have to constantly kill humans to feed, the hunger bar drops too fast and the military spawns in too fast. Humans also tend to wander on and off the map, makes it impossible to infect them all. Worst aspect I found is the zombies just stand around waiting to be killed. So if you're not everywhere at once, you'll get wiped out.Game is kinda boring, all you do is grab your zombie and target humans. No special abilities, nothing. When your zombies touch a building, it destroys it and you take damamge.Tried world domination. All you do is move 3 zombies around and attck cities then research. No tactical combat. Music was too loud, this version has no sound effect, just music.I didn't find any portion of this game any fun. Might have been okay had it come out in the 90s. This is more of an arcade game then a RTS.			"

								-Started from one zombie.-Surprised a group of humans, disturbing them from whatever humans do and turned them into zombies.-Kept this up until a massive hoard was assembled. All the while I was being discrete with my minions so as not to alarm   the humans.-Almost succeeded in infecting everyone except for one little pathetic human.-The little pathetic human runs and calls for reinforcements.-A transport chopper arrives with four soldiers.-Easy. My army overruns them and kills them off.-I lost the little pathetic human in the bloodbath. He is still somewhere running for his life.And then it all went South..-More choppers arrive, this time armed with rockets and heavy machine guns.-All hell breaks loose.End result: Countless dead from both sides. Massive zombie army annihilated. The little pathetic human is still alive....10/10 Would do it again. Controlling zombies has never been more badass.			"

								This game is a refreshing new 'thing' in the zombie-strategy-genre games. I really like the 'World Domination' mode it's alot of fun and involves pure strategy with a twist, you control the horde! Altough it's still in 'Early Access' it has alot of potenial. Altough it still needs some more tweaks and improvements, but I'm sure the developers are already into it. I'm looking forward for the next updates and features, especially 'Multiplayer' mode (I think this is gonna be a blast playing).			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game yesterday as I'm a fan of zombie and strategy games, and I can tell you this game was exactly what I was looking for.At first I was quite unsure on how to start playing the game, what the controls were, which game mode to choose and so, maybe this is because career mode hasn't been released yet. Nevertheless I quickly caught on.I started playing a few levels of Skirmish to get a good feel of the game. The first time I was a bit lost and I must admit the tutorial wasn't as helpful as I'd like since you have to read it and start playing before the hunger timer runs out.I proceeded to play World Domination, and this when I started to experience what the game was really capable of. Time flew by as I conquered city after city, researching to upgrade my horde and getting stronger, to combat stronger enemies and cities. For this game mode though I would suggest an optional 2D view of the map, and a Ctrl-A command to select all of your horde. At a certain point, nearing the end of my domination the game started lagging, this could be just my PC but I think some optimisation would help solve the problem.Also I quite liked the soundtrack, the only improvement I can see here is for the tracks to play depending on what phase of a game you are on (eg: varying on intensity)I see a lot of potential in this game, and do not regret buying it at all, I recommend it to all my friends and anyone looking for a new kind of game.

								Simply put this game is an innovative breath of fresh air from the otherwise rather static genres of both strategy and zombie games. It manages to blend the two in a uniquely positive way that feels different and new. Commanding hordes of zombies is extremely satisfying and seeing the puny efforts of man come to nothing as all human civilizations burn is quite enjoyable. But, like any EarlyAccess game it still has a lot of room for improvement.The number of gamemodes the game offers brings a lot of variety to the table. So far the Skirmish and the World Domination are quite well developed, with room for improvement. Being a fan of similar strategy games I found the World Domination gamemode more akin to my tastes. The Skirmish is enjoyable but the World Domination is where things get really interesting, personally. I am very excited for the other planned gamemodes the Campaign and the Multiplayer.The soundtrack is beautifully composed and provides quite a good amount of immersion. However the tracks that play are irrelevant to what is actually going on, so you may find yourself leading the final attack on humanity's last city while the music is relatively calm.Obviously the game has some room for improvement. It could be because of my slow computer, but I found it a bit difficult to effectively select and control the units. Also in World Domination when my hordes were being attacked I found it difficult to counterattack, as selecting the target proved a bit tedious. However apart from that and the music issue, all the game needs is a bit of polish and its good to go. It is ofcourse still in Early Access so such things are expected at this stage.In short, the game holds great potential. Its innovitave, fun, and quite challenging at times. A great way to waste away a couple of hours. To those seeking to buy this game I suggest you do not expect too much out of the game as it is, or you might be disappointed, however for such a low price the content it already has is worth it. I expect a lot from this game in the future, as its foundations have a lot to offer and the idea behind the game just draws me in, and I believe the developers will deliver. The game is frequently updated and its come a very long way in a very short time. I recommend to fellow strategy game as well as zombie game lovers, to keep a very close eye on this game. Even as it is, its well worth a playthrough.			"

								This game is too early access too judge, so far there is very little content what provides maybe 1-2 hours of entertainment, but hey... you get too control a horde, My ideas for this game would be too have a custom/sandbox mode, what allows you too spawn in zombies, humans and buildings and make your own games, humans should be stronger with Militry grade weapons and armed civilians, World domination mode should be different Scenarios instand of a bunch of massive zombies running around a tiny planet, An ability too customize your own zombie with powerups and Mutations, change his looks and his stats would be great and maybe the ability too play versus, with one player as humans and other as zombies(when Multiplayer is added in)   I only played the game for 5 minutes so far, so... :)			"

								Ever wanted to play as the zombies in a zombie survival game? Well here's your chance to bite, slash, spit, and infect hundreds of surviving humans in a matter of minutes. You start out with one or a small number of zombies and have to work in strategy to infect as many as you can before the military shows up. You have one goal, world domination. How you go about it, is up to you. The game is still in early development so the only things you can do is play skirmish mode at this moment but it has potential. It has the basis for playing as the zombies and invading all of the world until every human is dead. The movements are a bit odd, but overall it's not too bad once you get used to it. So I'd say if the developers continue working on this game, then yeah it will be worth it for sure. But in the current state, only playing skirmishes isn't very enjoyable. Overall I give it 7/10			"
