												Terrible game. Buggy ui, tutorial doesn't tell you anything useful and the gameplay is beyond boring. Insanely one dimentional with no content. How did this even get through greenlight?			"

												It doesn't feel like a finished game, but an ugly prototype.There's no help at all, it just throws you right into the game.When you select a building, the rest of the objects on screen turn into ugly black silhouettes.There's some text you need to read and it's written in black on dark red.You have to go and press a button and wait for it to calculate to find out if you have won the scenario.Vastly overpriced and low quality game. Avoid.			"

												No tutorial at all. Anywhere.I have zero idea what I'm doing, and never make any progress. I'm sure this game could be decent, but all I know is that I'm not doing what I'm supposed to do, but I'm not sure what I could do that would be any better.			"

												Forget about all the negative reviews complaining about the game's inaccessibility, and read these step-by-step instructions instead. Other buildings turning black when selecting a building is a feature, see link above. However, black font on dark background seems to be an individual technical problem, for me the font is yellow-white and well readable.This game is inspired by Transport Tycoon, but it isn't Transport Tycoon. It's more of a puzzle game than an economy simulation. There are predesigned levels with increasing size and complexity and a specific profit target. You have to create a road network consisting of different road types to connect the industry. Then you redistribute the limited workforce to optimize production. Houses need to be supplied with various goods, so they can get bigger and have place for more workers. This part works similar to the Anno series. The products not needed by houses have to be brought to export stations to make money. You don't have to buy anything, all that matters is the difference between income per second and upkeep per second.The music is surprisingly good for that price range. Apropos price, it seems a bit too high compared to similar games on Steam, but the devs need to eat. If this game won't pay off they can't make any more games, so I see the money more as backing of a startup dev team.			"
