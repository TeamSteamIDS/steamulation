												I honestly can't recommend it, not for the price it's asking.  The options menu only addresses audio volumes and quality, with no way to adjust keybinds and other important details you'd expect from a driving ""sim""...I use that term very loosely as there isn't even turn signals (none that I've found anyway).  This feels more like an arcade game without the bells and whistles.  You can drive through people (you ghost through them) and red lights without penalty, assuming there's no one in the car with you.  Disobeying laws or crashing with passengers in your car will either hurt or help you, depending on what they want.  You can wreck your car but the physics and damage are laughable at best.  The road signs for the US location aren't even correct...the speed limit signs are rectangular and white, not circular and white/red.  The game can also be a bit buggy at times.  GTA's Taxi mini-games were more enjoyable, which is a real shame.  Wait for a 75% + off sale if you must have it.

												Some really severe problems with this game with lots of bugs. Others have already pointed this out in detail. Worst of all if you  start to build up your taxi company and need to to go for a break, THE GAME WILL NOT EVEN ♥♥♥♥ING SAVE!!!!!! What sort of stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥is that and WTF are Steam doing selling this game in this condition?Potentially a good game, but obviously the developer could not be arsed to finish properly to have the required content and quality. Quite frankly I'd like to go around to their office and punch them straight in the gob for conning me out of £7.49.DO NOT BUY THIS RUBBISH UNTIL THEY SORT IT OUT PROPERLY!			"

												I've given this game some fair play time and I personally don't see what the big deal is with the negative reviews. If you're someone that grew up to this sort of graphics and actually play the game properly, whilst tolerating it for what it actually is, it's not half as bad as most of the reviews make it out to be.Whilst it's a very basic and feature-lacking game, it has a nice AI where passengers are placed randomly and drop-off points are random also, so each time you pick a passenger up you don't need to worry about having the same story, because it will ALWAYS be different.To add, I haven't even experienced most the bugs that other people seem to claim, the only bug (which is extremely minor, a graphical bug at that) I found was the street lighting to flicker.For the price it's at, it's obviously not worth it, but I found it in a bundle for about $1/£0.65, so no one can argue for that price. Really good game if you just need a few hours to kill or need something that doesn't require a lot of thought.			"

												Typical indie game, this time it's about driving the taxi.- game is a bit bugged, but nothing that can kill the mood. Be careful with hired drivers though, they have a tendency of being dumb when you spectate them- only one view, but camera is doing an okay job to show you the road. Traffic lights are shown not only as usual, but as lines on the road too, which is helpful. Speed limit is shown all the time, it's 30 or 40, depends on the street- no Steam Achievements, no trading cards. Yes, it has few in-game achievements, but when do Steam users care about them?- 3 different cars per each of three regions (makes 9 cars at the end), first one is unlocked, others are unlockable by collecting 5 of their parts- not too many opportunities for an actual management - hire driver, buy him a car, upgrade it a bit, tell him to go out and start picking passengers, spectate him, drive for him. That's pretty much it. Oh, and upgrades aren't enchancing the perfomance of car, but decreasing it's maintenance- money can be earned easily if you know what to do (you can fill 8-slot cab depot in 10 minutes by only completing emergency client pickups) and can be spent even easier on cab upgrades, which will in overall cost you ten times more than your car, trust me- physics.... It's an arcade! What would you expect?At the end i can tell you one thing: Look at the gameplay videos. Ask yourself, do you think it will be boring for you if you will be driving around like this for couple of hours? No? Not boring? Well, that means you are like me, who likes driving games. Spend some money, spend couple of hours, maybe couple of evenings, then forget about this game. Boring? Go find yourself somethins else, this is just an indie game about driving taxi, not some Crazy Taxi "

												Ever thought of owning your own Taxi business? Do you like games that are all about patience and following the rules? Then Taxi still isn't for you. If you can get around the game's lackluster driving, the big issue here are the game breaking glitches.The driving controls are easy, up to drive forward, down to come to a stop and go backward. Left and right to turn. While the controls are easy, its just a little dull having to follow the rules. The camera is automatic and as you drive faster it will change from a near top down angle to letting you see in front of you. It would be nice if you could move the camera around to either soak up the sights of the city or peak around the constant 90 degree turns.Since you run a legitimate business, any speeding will get you fined. Most of the speed limits are 30 or 40, so I try to keep it under 20. Does that mean kph or mph? The game never told me. Running a red light is a fine. Damage is a fine. Even playing the game as carefully as I do and learning how to be patient, it was a struggle to make money, even when I wasn't fined. In the game's defense, the speed limit and your speed are clearly marked, as is the street lights. What's really odd is the logistics of having street lights on the same side of an intersection rather than across. I suppose from a game standpoint it makes sense, since the camera looks down on you when you're stopped rather than looking from behind you.You own a taxi service, but in the hour that I played it, I never felt like I ran it so much as drove around picking up fares. In your garage, you can buy cars, hire other drivers, repair cars, clean them, paint them, and fuel them. They're all useless add ons to a shallow driving game.The core of the game is simple, you drive around picking up fares. Then you wait as they take their sweet time getting into your taxi cab. Once they're in, your GPS shows you where to take them and you just follow the red line. This red line appears on your GPS from where you start, to where you finish, so if you deviate far away from the red line, you need to hit the refresh button on your GPS to get a new red line.If you can't find a fare, you can click on an icon that will show you to one. These are the more interesting fares. People with luggage that needs to stay on top of your car, because apparently your trunk is full of dead bodies or something. Some people need getaway drivers, so you'll need to avoid cops, but that's okay because the game glitches out where it doesn't spawn cars until you quit and restart the game. Another quest had me following a car, but there was no subtlety. I could follow so close that when coming down off of a bridge I rammed it. That's cool, my passenger didn't mind I rammed what was probably his friend's car.Your fare has a happiness rating, break the law and the happiness goes down, but its so slight that its barely noticable. The further you drive, the more money you'll get, so always take the long route and your passenger doesn't care. If you want to drive around the city, when the person only wants to be dropped off around the block, go for it.There are a few fares with time limits and those feel impossible, because you'll need to end up breaking the law and therefore there's no profit from it. So its better to waste time than lose money in the process.One of the glaring issues with the pick up and drop off is how small the zone is. You need to stop in a narrow slot with no wiggle room. Its only a minor issue, until it comes to stopping in an area with a pot hole that takes up 50% of the zone. Your car takes up about 90% of the zone. So you have to take a hit from the pot hole.You see pot holes damage your car, which has what I can only describe as a health meter. If your car is out of health, it needs to be towed back to your garage for a hefty fine, but the bigger issue is pot holes are like objects. If you run into them head on, that's fine you can go through them, but if you try to turn into a pot hole or nudge it with the side of your car, it blocks you. In fact I've seen my car ram a pot hole and come to a complete stop.Each fare tends to be around $100 which is fine. The real problem is the expense of repairs and cleaning. Fuel goes down at a laughably low rate. You'd assume driving around 24 hours a day with no brake would have your gas tank empty three times, but no 24 hours of driving is worth 10% of your fuel. I'd say fuel and cleaning is reversed. Cleaning runs about $50 or so.You can get your car cleaned, repaired and fueled at your garage, but there are places out and about when driving to have it done. The really cool thing is your passenger sits happily as you get your car repaired. That's super nice of them. I wish I could say easy mode lets you do that and hard mode doesn't let you do that, but there are no difficulties.Another problem is my car would get damaged without me understanding why it was damaged. Did I hit a pot hole? No. Did I ram a car? No. Did I hit a sidewalk or a stop sign? No. yet it went down. Repairing your car from low to full health can cost $250 - $400. That's about 4/6ths of the money. To the game's credit, there are no shifts, you can drive around for days and days. Just like you can in real life! Hey someone out there has probably done it before! How else will you get from Alaska to Argentina in a week? Buy a plane ticket?While your car will need repairs, there's no damage effects. So when you crash, that's okay your car doesn't crumple up. No one gets maimed when you plow into them. Street signs don't even fall over when you hit them. Sure your car stops as if you hit a building, but the signs are okay.What you really came here for is to know about the glitches in a $5 game. There's nothing laughably awful, just game breaking. Such as the passenger that I picked up and the GPS didn't refresh to tell me his destination. So I refreshed... well his destination is where I picked him up. That's silly. So I drove around the block to get more money out of him. When I arrived back where I picked him up, there's no drop off zone. I was stuck with him. You can't tell a passenger to get out, you just need to make them unhappy, which is surprisingly difficult.Then there was the glitch where my car was in pristine condition, cleaned, fueled and repaired to perfect health. Then I made the mistake of saving and quitting the game. When I returned the car was badly damaged and half clean. Maybe someone used it while the game was closed? No.... the save file glitched where it used my car's status from a previous save using the same slot. I still had the same amount of money from my real save, which was virtually nothing. So I couldn't repair or clean my car, because its 100% or nothing. You can't repair 10% at a time.For all of the laws and fines, the cops don't care if you do a 3 point turn about in the middle of a 2 lane road, even when they're right there watching. If you break the speed limit after the game stops spawning cars or even people, they still care.The city feels like a shining point to the game, but anything can be a highlight in a game that I hold such low regard. There's a bridge over the city with 45 degree on ramps. Its interesting. You'll never get lost with your GPS and instant garage traveling icon. In a perfect world, the city would be vast and procedural generated.As for the music and sound, there's a music loop in the menu and your garage, but out on the road, you only have your car's engine to listen to. It almost sounds like what I imagine a gentle spaceship to sound like. Its a gentle sound, instead of an over the top 50s style spaceship sound or what the Jetsons would sound like.So with all that the game has going for it, how could I not recommend it? Well you see I like actual business with my business games. There is a business, don't get me wrong, but after playing the game I wasn't able to buy anything for the business.			"

												""Who created the AI in this game, a monkey or something?"" 5/10Even though I enjoyed playing this game for a few hours, I still can't recommend that anyone pay full price for it. That being said; I've never enjoyed a game with so many bugs in it before, but I guess there's a first time for everything. And when I say that this game is buggy, I'm talking like, walking naked, covered head-to-toe in maple syrup through the rainforest on the hottest day of the year buggy. For starters, the drivers you hire should all be in prison because they're menaces to society. Do not leave these people alone for even one minute because none of their actions make sense and they will surely kill someone.""Hey I'm a single block from that passenger, let me not pick them up and instead drive around in circles a few times before heading off into the opposite direction."" I imagine this is what's going through the drivers heads the entire time because I have never seen such horrible AI in all of my life. Not only that, but watching over some of your drivers for a few minutes, and you'll surely notice how they barely follow any rules of  the road at all. Red light? Let's run that. Speed limit? Let's go over that. I know some taxi drivers are drunk on the job, but this is just ridiculous. For a better experience just steer clear of hiring extra drivers entirely.Like I said, I had some fun playing this game, but then again I got it for like a dollar or two in one of those fancy pants bundles of games for poor people. Aside from that, the graphics are dated and very not good, there is no support for gamepads, the music is boring and also not good, and there is only one view while driving. Pick it up for a few bucks maybe, but for full price pass this one up like the hired drivers in this game often do to potential passengers. Yeah, that's right, I just made a joke about under performing virtual taxi drivers.			"

												This is not a bad game, just needs some loving. The concept is goo, I like the tree/grass and the water is very good. However, I just have a couple of pointers that need tweaking, and one major update that is needed, in my opinion.If you select England, for some reason the money earned is in $'s not £'s. Not a biggie really. But in the UK we don't follow km/h, but we do follow mph, like USA. That would be nice to update.But the big update that is needed is on the nighttime. During the day, loads of cars all over, and no problem following a marked car. Hit night time, no cars at all, including the marked car. So I was stuck on the mission. Tried a couple of times, and it still didn't show any cars.Apart from that, its a relaxing game, but there are so many traffic lights I feel I'm driving in London but in a tighter version.I'll recommend getting it, as its a cheap price, just needs to night time update!!Kro			"

												Good concept, bad gameThe concept behind this game is rather appealing to me, but the execution is poor.  There are two major game-breaking bugs that require reloading your last good save or restarting entirely. (Pick-up/drop-off points not loading properly, getting stuck on the map screen with AI taxi drivers) In addition, the concept of having a team of drivers and managing your taxi company is great, but you'll find that once you get a couple drivers, you'll be making money so stupidly fast that the game quickly turns from a fun interactive taxi simulation game to an idle game where you just watch your numbers grow.  It only takes a couple hours to completely max out.Overall, I'd say skip this and wait for a better game within the same genre.  I'd pay $40-$60 for a GOOD taxi simulation game simular to Euro Truck SImulator, but this is certainly not it, and not even worth half the price of what its listed for.			"

												Well that is five bucks I will never see again.The trailer looked quite good, and was boasting 3 cities, and 6 types of missions.I only recall seeing 1 city, and as far as the 6 types of missions, it was always the same type.The only time I got a different mission, was to get the passenger to her destination as quickly as possible.If you ever wanted to know the feeling of driving at 5 miles an hour, then this is the game for you.By the way, did I mention the amounts & length of times you HAVE to stop at red lights.And god forbid there should be traffic ahead of you waiting.As far as gameplay mechanics go, as I mentioned, most of the time, you are driving at about 5 miles an hour.Turning around is atrocious. The taxi actually freezes before you go backwards or forwards when you turn around.Don't take my word for it, and check out my video by clicking on the link.

Unfortunately you cannot run over any helpless citizens (the best part of any taxi game) trapped in the three cities you must plunder through.

												I had seen the trailer and screenshot for this game prior to release and was quite interested in it. Unfortunately when it was released I did see quite poor feedback.Nonetheless, I jumped on board and bought the game. The game was playable, but lacking quite a bit. There were many issues when playing on London, esp the roundabouts. The issues were so bad that they were funny. You can see the troubles I encountered in the clip I uploaded onto Youtube:

												Not a bad game at all. But you have to LOVE drinving a lot and wait at traffic lights (too much traffic lights).You can't choose between driving at night or day, the game chooses for you, as well as for the wether.Some little bugs with the AI, as regards your employed drivers. You have to check very often if they are not struck in traffic or else, cause they won't act by themselves.It's a shame the game was not enough worked at, it could have been better!Anyway, for 4.99, it's ok.

Disclaimer: The following recommendation is based on the perspective of this being more of an ""Early Access"" game despite being released.  So please consider this recommended with an asterick of sorts...as if only on a huge sale (like when I got it for 95% off, or if you find it in a bundle).I can honestly say I didn't mind the hours I tinkered around with this title.  It had some aspects I found interesting...and others I didn't.  Quite frankly,  it feels more like a beta/early access so I kept that in mind as I played it.  There are a few things that felt like the developer started...but never fully implemented.- Driver salaries:  each one had a salary, apparently based on their stats...but it was a one time cost.  I noticed that on the statistics area it showed today/yesterday and time periods which made me wonder if it was intended to have a daily salary.- Driver stats:  each driver you could hire had a ""stamina"" and ""morale"" that affected their salary.  There didn't seem to be a way to affect it after they were hired and there was no information just what they were for.  I never tried the lower stat drivers to see how different they were...only had ones that were near max or maxed already.The two items above could have made for an interesting business management to this software if they were more developed.  However, the AI of these drivers needed more development.  Too often they seemed like they were driving drunk...or just not paying attention.  Far too often I'd check on them and the cars had a LOT of damage...for no apparent reason.  The general traffic AI wasn't bad, but I don't know if you were supposed to let the drivers rest for awhile or if I'm just giving that too much credit.  There's really no apparent information on that.The types of taxi cars were...limited.  You had your starter that you could get more of, but the only other two you could get were after hoping you'd stumble upon the 5 ""car part"" boxes needed to unlock the two higher level cars.  And it was really down to luck if the boxes appeared as there were no set locations like you'd find collectibles in GTA or something.  The cost to buy one of the other two cars rose...dramatically.  With the slow income from fares it just didn't seem likely to get them unless you kept farming fares.  Unfortunately with the drivers as they seemed to be...they may help with more income, but eventually they seemed like a waste with all the crashes and repairs that ate all your ""capital"".The car upgrades and adjustments...didn't seem worth it in the current state.  For one thing, they cost quite a bit compared to the income you were getting.  I didn't bother with the paint jobs (looks like you could buy two presets and switch between 3).  Perhaps if I ever come back to this I may tinker with it.  The only upgrade that seemed remotely helpful was the addition (and upgrade) of a ""radar blocker"".  Which...I assume would allow you to speed more or drive more dangerously or something?  There were a LOT of police cars in this small ""city"".  Not to mention they were the highway patrol or something... lolThere were only a few missions I found:- random pick-up/delivery (one stop)- sight seeing (3 stops)- rush delivery (timed 1 stop)- VIP delivery (2 stops)- Luggage delivery (1 stop, balance loose luggage on top of cab)- Follow the car (long ""chase"" and 1 stop)The rush delivery and sight seeing seemed...most worth it.  The ""Follow the car"" was quite annoying and drawn out.  The luggage and VIP were interesting to try but didn't seem worth to do again.  Oh yeah, and you could only find the short trip, sight seeing, and rush delivery as random missions on the road.  Otherwise you had to click on the ""Dispatcher"" and hope it gave you one of them (it was always random).I know it seems like I'm ripping this game a bit, but the barebones that were in place were interesting to tinker with.  One thing I did find amusing was that your passengers didn't care about what routes you took...as long as you drove ""safe"".  You could run laps around the city and spike the fare, and they didn't care...they still gave you a 10 (if you didn't get caught speeding, running a red light, or hitting something).  Oh yeah, and there are 3 ""cities"", of which I played the American one (New York I think?).  I'm assuming the other two are similar, but just a different map to get used to.  There are a lot of bugs that are mentioned in the forum and other reviews, but I didn't really find much of those.  I noticed one time that I couldn't save but that was it.So yeah...tl;dr?  Fun little thing to tinker with and seemed like it could have had potential, but maybe the developer just gave up on it?  Only get it on a large sale or a bundle if you're really interested in playing with  it.			"

												This game is good. I like it. I am that type of person who likes these types of games. Controls are fine too, I don't have any problems with that. But, there is one thing: the frame rate is a little bit low, even if I put to lowest graphics, and I don't know why. I have a pretty good PC, so I think this game should run nicely. But even like this, the game is fun, you can drive around and pick up passengers, you can drive New York yellow taxi, the classic black British taxi, and I really am happy for the German taxi included too! No DLC, no in-app purchases, so that is good too. So I say, you should buy this game if you are searching for a light, simple to use, but still challenging, and fun game! I am happy with this game.  It's cool!			"

The only thing that i found so far that i don't like is the camera view(or there lack of) and that the map is not large enough . Other than that , buy it. i think you'll like it , and if not...no big deal it's cheap right now.			"

												The game isn't as bad as some of the other reviewers indicate. The graphics are antiquated. Neither the driving nor the management simulation portion are as good as they should be. When I bought it, it was priced at 12.99. I would say 4.99 would make this a good deal to kill a couple of hours.The repetition of the driving missions gets tedious. It takes too long to build up money. It's too easy to lose it. So, it's accurate to real life. I would recommend a bit more time spent developing the management side and then beefing up the driving portion. Perhaps the developer could spin the game into two separate components that can be combined? Maybe handing off the driving portion to someone who specializes in that, and work on a more sophisticated economy and management sim? I don't know. Just remember, this is an indie offering, and it really COULD be worse.For those still reading, there is one trick I found to help you get off the ground more quickly. Sell the first car you get immediately. That car is worth 2000. Then you can buy two of that same car right away, and hire a driver. That should help those who don't mind giving this simplistic indie offering a chance.			"

												OMG been a while since I have basically played a beta game. Thats what this game feels like. Its a half finished game with some ideas and doesnt do any of them very well. Ok first off why is it that these cheap/Indie games do not support a Xbox360 wired controller? I am so sick of of this. If you care about your game make it so that a controller works right off the bat. Is it so hard to make an Xbox360 controller work? OMG!!!!!!Graphics are simple. The towns are boring. The car was a pain to drive due to no gamepad working.  Its got potential but thats about it. The map doesnt show you any fares around town. So you aimlessly drive around the small city waiting for fares. I think they need to spend another 6 months to a year working on this game to be honest. Make the game enjoyable. The game is not ready for prime time. The music is terrible along with the side effects. Better off buying Crazy Taxi for you Iphone or Android phone and playing that instead and save yourself some money as well.			"

												This is an EXTREMELY buggy game. It's buggy enough that I am leaning towards calling it unplayable.1. It seems that if you play this for more than an hour at a time, you are no longer able to save your game. I don't know if this is precisely correct, but I do know that I am unable to save my current game. :-/2. After a couple of missions, you will no longer be able to complete your objectives. The only way out seems to be to load a saved game. Now look up at problem #1 and roll your eyes.3. Sometimes, just barely brushing another vehicle or an object will trigger the ""your vehicle has been wrecked"" event. Yea, that's $400 down the drain right away.Definitely not recommended.			"

												A LOT of errors in the game.Can't save the game sometimes(manually of course).The ""Follow that car"" mission occasionally don't give you the target car but the passenger is still in your car.Etc.Just don't buy it.			"

												I rather have gonorrhea than playing this more. But yea, I paid 0.49€ and for that I got entertained in 2-5 minutes. The idea is good - but the game it self is lacking in everything. Feeling for car mostly. Very static.I don't recommend it.			"

												A good attempt at a Taxi game which falls just short of being a good game. I would give this a solid 5/10 where it would not be a downright horrible game and they made a sincere effort to make a good one, but the content just doesn't justify a positive review. Has a stats and management system to it which is interesting, neat mechanics such as enforcing traffic laws with signals and speeding, and makes you feel like you're running a cabby company, but the gameplay itself suffers when it comes to manually controlling the vehicles with a few bugs spread about here and there.

												Do you like working for hours on end which you could be doing in real life? Do you wanna waste your money?Then buy this game. its honestly one of the worst gaming experiances i have ever played. its literaly going around and dropping people off in a taxi. Very buggy, Poor driving mechanics, Bad graphics, crap physics, and not worth any price.			"

												Seems like a fun game at the beginning! Building your own taxi empire, driving customers around, speeding tickets, upgrades and different kind of missions. Graphics look fine, when not driving...it is all lag this game...surrounding traffic is really bad...how the #$%#^% did they ever get their driver licenses. I do not understand....It is that is really cheap during sales....but it remains a waste of money :(			"

												Actually I like this game, BUT ...when you start hiring drivers they ever stuck anywhere in the map and often nothing can make them stop doing that. You can ram them, wait, push them ... they stay stuck. They usually not even get resetted or anything. If this bug would be fixed, the game would be playable and I would recommend it.			"
