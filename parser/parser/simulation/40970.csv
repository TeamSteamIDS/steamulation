												Your popularity...*Dramatic pause*IS RISING!Update:Wow, I honestly never imagined that this joke would reach the lengths it did. I suppose this justifies an actual review.Welcome to Stronghold Crusader, a game I picked up at a whim when I was 12 (actually have about 1,000 hours clocked in the disc version of the game; I was sheltered from Steam for a long time). I had, at the time, no idea what the game was about, I just knew that I was a huge medieval era fan and decided the game looked pretty cool. Trust me though, no matter of sweet, sweet disc cover could have prepared me for the fungasm that was Stronghold Crusader. Lets move on to an actual review now.Stronghold Crusader is an RTS (real-time strategy) game based on the First, Second, and Third Crusade, not to mention the conflicts within Crusader states. As with all RTS', this means that you will have control of armies, workers, not to mention fortification and building construction in an attempt to outwit your opponent and kill their king. However, Stronghold does this better than even most current-generation RTS', in my opinion, including games like Starcraft 2. It's hard for me to come up with a ""pros and cons"" list, because for me, this game doesn't have any cons; difficulty is to be expected as you progress in time spent in-game. Let me spend a little time bulleting what is so attractive about this game.-There is a multitude of units. You've got your various siege equipment (battering rams, catapults, trebuchets, you name it), melee units with their own unique advantages, ranged units similarly, various traps, MOATS (that's right nerdy kid who loves castles, moats), and chances are you will end up using every single one of these characters at some point during the game; which leads to my next point.-No two games are alike. Before anyone corrects me, I'm aware that there are (always have been) certain strategies to try and end games quickly; slave rushing; mercenary armies in early game, etc. That being said, these strategies are not always reliable and will leave you resourceless. The fact is that you are probably going to need a different strategy for each game you play, ESPECIALLY in multiplayer.-The game itself is rich in history, which I personally find fascinating. The single player campaign will have you drilling your way through multiple missions; these missions are based off the real accounts of the First, Second, and Third Crusades, as well as the intergroup struggles that grew in that time. You will command armies in historic battles like the Siege of Jerusalem, Heraclea, and Krak des Chevaliers. All this is accompanied by what I find to be a stellar set of voice actors and most likely the best squire a king could ever ask for creates an almost life-like representation of the era. You know what, the squire gets his own bullet.-The squire; this awesome individual is your in-game guide/cheerleader/father-figure. If you play the game, you WILL learn to love him. The squire is a non-physical character who informs you of how you are doing, whether you are under attack, or if you are out of resources. He will sit and shout in your ear ""WOOD NEEDED"" or ""THE GRANARY STOCKS ARE FULL, M'LORD."" -Resource management. While not really a new feature to RTS', the resource management in this game will force you to think steps ahead of your opponent, or suffer the consequences; every resource is expendable. ""Not enough stone to build your walls? Buy some from the trade post for gold, or trade your other resources to get that precious stone. Beware, though, trade too much of one resource and it may dry up and your stocks will quickly be depleted, which means you are screwed when it comes to anything that requires that resource.-Multiplayer. This is where 90% of my horus playing this game went. I could sit here and rant onward about all of my games where I had almost lost, but like the underdog of the story, I prevailed!However, I won't; as a matter of fact, I will make this really simple: take every bulletpoint I've created, and imagine what it'd be like to face another person. The campaign missions may not necessarily be the most difficult, but the multiplayer is where I am convinced Army strategists should be trained for real-life duty. How you act in a game, every move you make, every resource you spend/use, will affect the outcome and decide whether you are truly the king of the land, or whether you are a lonely peasant, not fit to lick the boot of your opponent.TL;DR:Despite not being the most ""relevant"" entry in the RTS genre, Stronghold Crusader still manages to remain an idol to be followed for other RTS games. If you are truly skipping my beautifully composed points above, just know that the game is wonderful. For the price it's listed at now, I would say you are criminally insane to not buy it.""Do you recommend this game?"" Steam asks.My response? ""Of course, m'lord!""			"

												If anyone ever asked me what was my favorite game as a kid, it would be Stronghold Crusader hand down. Today I keep it on steam to leave my old disc on the shelf as a momento of my childhood. SC is a classic with the perfect balance of light hearted castle sim charm and rts combat. Ive dumped easily 1000 hours into random skirmish matches against the ai lords over the years and this is one game that I can always turn back to at any time to pass 20 minutes to 2 hours and always have a good time. Learning how to balance your economy to support troop creation has a very mild learning curve but it takes time to master but yet is simple enough for even a 1st grader to learn as I did when I first started playing this game in 2001.This game has aged exceptionally well and still has an active multiplayer community because anyone that ever took a bite of this game knows just how good it really is. I strongly reccommend this game to add to your collection as an old fan or a newby looking for a new toy to reignite your passion for gaming all over again. Overall, I would rate this title 11/10 as it really is a unicorn in the PC gaming realm. Thank you			"

An old masterpiece came to Steam - in High Definition (or atleast high resolution...)I remember, when I was a little boy about 9 years old, I saw this game in a market and I begged my dad to buy me this RTS-game. I played everyday and it was never boring - not even a little bit! And now it is here - on Steam! Feeling the satisfaction of building your own castle while at the same time demolishing someone else's. Just. Great.to the m'lord-cave!++ best ""Stronghold""++ it's a classic+ one of the best RTS (in my opinion!)+ 16 different enemies with special tactics!+ many maps (whether balanced or not)+ historical missions+ 2 campaigns (2nd campaign is much harder!)+ skirmish mode! (80 missions)+ different modes: the peaceful and war path+ loads of playable options+ create your own maps!+ easy gameplay and easy to learn the mechanics+ no food? no fear! - beer is here!+ and it won't get boring - only harder :)+ you don't need a high-end gamer ultra 4k PC""buildings are in flames m'lord!""- HD? Just the resolution changed- ma' crusade ended 1781 AC (depends on how long you play)- AI won't build armies over 400 soldiers- The Kalif is an as*hole- what year is it?- campaign is less ""personal"" - got killed by 100 slaves- often you can easily rush the enemy in the first minutes- double rations- some people can't run the game! (you are warned)A little extra information: in ""Stronghold Crusader Extreme"" you are able to build armies up to 10000 soldiers... and the enemy too ;-)just an information if you would complain about the limited army size, like I mentioned before :-)Those negative aspects are just poop, so don't mention them.I can tell that you WILL have lot of fun. I'm through the first 50 missions and already at 35 hours! You don't need a sale to buy this, just 8€ and you recieve hours of fun. Don't mind the graphics, it's from 2002! But remember - This is a recommendation for Stronghold Crusader and not for the whole series (sadly the game became more and more worse).""Do you recommend this game?""- ""Of course, m'lord!"" 9/10little update: I am through the 100 missions of the crusade and have about ~60 hours playtime (because of connection problems, my counted hours are false)... and I didn't even started the real campaign :-DI think if you play every mission, campaign and possible option you can reach 100 hours!Some people have the problem that the game doesn't start at all - maybe this thread can help you: http://steamcommunity.com/app/40970/discussions/0/361787186433062259/ "

5 out of 5The gaming equivalent of heaven.Stronghold Crusader is a castle building strategy game. Whether you like castles or medieval times is irrelevant, if you like strategy games you will adore this game.Coming off the successful 2001 hit Stronghold, Stronghold Crusader removes and improves elements of its predecessor to galore the public with a map editor and a skirmish mode, however for newcomers a game tutorial is sadly not available.

												One of the first installments in the Stronghold series. An epic strategy game, with poor graphics that are made up for in amazing gameplay. You battle in the campaign or the trial series or just skirmish. You can have amazing battles with other players or AIs. Tons of different maps and a map builder that allows you to do anything. Great fps, and no crashes. I love this game, and if you like a good strategy game, you'll love this to.			"

												This game is a classic, I remember playing the demo sometime back in like, early 2002...? Can't really remember, but even today it holds great quality for a game this old. Graphics are obviously quite dated, but considering that the game was acctualy released in 2002 they arn't THAT bad, infact they are quite impressive and back in 2002 they were most likely very high standards. The gameplay is excellent, watching battles between 2 factions are just incredible. 500-600 men fighting for victory. The AI is smart and very, very different depening on which settings you play on. Some AI are REALLY slow whilst others are REALLY fast. This is both good and bad but it will keep you entertained for a good time. What makes this game so entertaining is that you must always keep your economy, troop producment, and other vital producments above your opponent. If not, you will most likely lose.The only REAL flaw with this game is that it has ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of glitches, and the AI can sometime get stuck when they build their castle.8/10			"

												There's nothing much like building a huge empire castle with seemingly undefetable defenses, and than it all falls apart just because your friend was one step ahead of you the whole time building his army of tens of thousands of men to take down your castle. Stronghold Crusader HD delivers this on every level. This game and I go way back, to 2006, My brother chose this game as a game that he wanted to buy from Target. At first I hated this game, mostly because I didn't try it. After I did try it one rainy day I fell in love with it. It does take a little bit to learn everything, but once you do it is one of the most addicting and fact paced Stragety games of all time!PROS:+ Simple but nice graphics: Sure they aren't amazing, but it has a disctinct art style that does help make you feel more a part of that world.+ Amazing strategic gameplay, It lures you in by seeming to be simple with a decent+The voice acting AWFUL, but it is the kind of awful that you and your friends can have a good hearty laugh at, and of course the quotes with the ""voice actors"" deliver really helps make this game feel all its own and have it's entirely own feeling to it.+ Fun Characters: the characters have their own personalities, and while some are addmitedly one note (the pig is fat GET IT!?) It adds more that subtracts from the experiance.+Great Map Selection (Some very basic ones and some really interesting ones, over 20! (Over 100 if you look at just the skirmish ones [Although I do belive they are exclusive to skirmish which I would like to see changed and probally there is a way to do it manually] And of coruse, you can make your own.)+ A ton of Gameplay types. There is, Custom Map Maker, 4 (or 4+) Campaigns, 3 (Including the Extreme Expansion) Trials (Which are linked matches between you and a bot, there are 50 on the original one. 30 on the Warchest one and 20 on the Extreme Trails) But, there is a major problem with the extreme trials (as of 12/30/13) it starts you at the final one for some reason) and of coruse Skirmish Mode (You can play what map you want with either friends, or solo and choose teams and such. oh and one more thing, Castle Sim Mode is just like Skirmish Mode, but without the batltes. ))+Fantastic Music! It is not only atmospheric but can also be catchy as hell and sounds natural helping the imersion of the game by a boatload! The game even changes music depending on the situation you are in, are you getting bombarded by a bunch of spear men? Then the game will switch to an intense battle song and fade out as soon as you (hopefull) defeat the spearmen. +The netcode is HIGHLY improoved in my experiances to the original, back in the original every game would be pleagued by the infamous ""Connection lost, sending current game state"" message, however  if I do ever encounter it in this version it dissapears in a split second!+This version is compatable with the original! So, if your friends computer can't handle the brand new resolution just install the CD version and you can play with the HD version (with GameRanger of course!) and this helps blend the line between the Steam players and the CD Players. The same can not be said about AOE2 HD or RON:EXE.+The game runs great on all types of hardware, from my ancient (Basically) 2010 Notebook to my modern computer (which I am writing this review with) and even my Aspire R14, the game runs without a hitch and surprisingly has minimal compatibility glitches [Not including the ones that were there]CONS:+Troops sometimes ignore orders, or take a while to do them. Sometimes you will tell it to do something and they will just wonder off which gets annoying especially in the heat of battle.+It's sometimes hard to see close into your castle with the brand new resolution, it would be nice if you could zoom into the map even further.+Some AI share the same animations (most notably, The Rat and the Wolf if you have them on your team.+Some Animation's are choppy (The blacksmith preview goes at about 20 frames)+When you zoom out all the way the FPS halves.+The AI is awful. They rarley (if ever) change up their attacks and do the same thing over and over again. Some AI is over protective making invading their castle a hastle [hahaha! GET IT!] to a point where I just save the game, quit, and never return to that saved game. +Balancing Issues: Little problems that they are you may have to (atleast in multiplayer) turn on the No Rush timer as to not allow people to bombard your castle with Assassins which are not only fast, invisible (unless nearing your men), and strong, but they also have a surprisingly large health bar which makes killing them annoying as they mow down even your strongest men and take out your king (how you loose) without a problem as early as the first few minutes. [They fixed this in the 2nd Game however that is a whole different can of worms.]+No proper Steamworks Multiplayer support, you must download a game client like GameRanger (which isn't bad, just inconvenient] +Awful expansion. Stronghold Crusader HD Extreme is the included expansion and adds some fantastic stuff [Maps, campaigns, 8 new AI Characters] but sadly starts to support castle hiding where you hide everyone inside your castle and let you generate stuff (yes this expansion adds a Mana styled magic bar that lets you create stuff and destroy your enemies castle with flying rocks that you spawn) which sounds badass. However, it throws all balancing and fairness out the window. Anyone can click on the rocks and click on the enemy castle to demolish it and make it ripe for the conquest, however what Stronghold Crusader HD (The base game) strives on is the ability to conquest the castle using your men that you build up which makes it imsenly more satisfying and more fair to put it bluntly.+Glitches. The main one that I am talking about is when you launch SC:HD Extreme for the first time and you go to the skirmish mission you get the due honor of skipping directly to the last level for no apparent reason, effectivly making the previous 20 or so missions useless. Overall:Even in the ripe year of 2016 Stronghold Crusader HD has surprisingly aged well. The problems (Some miniscule others annoying) really don't distract from the overall experiance as much as one may think. The PROS FAR outweigh the CONS in this situation and makes Stronghold Crusader HD (even with the Flawed Extreme expansion) a great time that is easily worth the 9.99 asking price. And even if you don't feel confortable about paying that much it goes on sale for down to 5 dollars sometimes so keep an eye out because I assure you, its a game that you will need to see to believe. [In a good way]If you enjoyed this review you should check out my fellow reviewers at  Completing the Backlog Edit: And hey this game has some great uses for cows...			"

This is a long review, so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend Stronghold Crusader skip to Results and read from there.Firefly Studies strikes again with the best Stronghold game in the series. Stronghold Crusader is a brilliant game that mixes Castle Simulation with RTS combat, and resource management. Story:As the title depicts Stronghold Crusader takes place in the Crusades. You play through the Asia minor, The Middle East, as Europeans and Arabians alike. The story takes place across four campaigns where you start your journey as Emporer Alexus of the Turkish Army commands you to take ahold of Asia Minor. You spread European influence across the land, but it is short lived as the Salidan rises to power and destroys the settlements of the Europeans and claims back the lands. Unfortunately for him the crusades were not over, and the Germanic armies arrive deploying castles across Asia minor as they claim lay to the holy lands. Stronghold Crusader takes place across the first to third crusades and then creates an alternate reality that is the post-crusade wars that pit you against your worst nightmare: The Rat, The Snake, The Pig, and The Wolf. Campaign:Stronghold Crusader has four campaigns which teach you how to play the game from the basics to the most advanced.The Call to ArmsCall to Arms offers five basic missions which although simple are in fact challenging in their own rights. The first mission encompasses basic castle siege, the second basic defense, the third resource management, the fourth resource massing, and the final one a more complicated castle siege. This campaign is a great way to start into the Stronghold Series as it introduces the elements of gameplay in an interesting way that keeps you entertained. Typical tutorials are rather uninteresting, but Call to Arms changes that by providing dynamic missions that introduce the game with diverse scenarios. Saladin’s ConquestAfter the conquest of Call to Arms you pick up the campaign as Salidan who is retaking the land stolen by the Europeans. All the missions in Salidan’s Conquest are sieges; these involve taking castles from the enemy. All of Salidans missions are rather simple, yet offer diversity in how you conquer your foe. You are limited on units and must use unique units to push through the enemy defenses. The Kings CrusadeAfter the Salidan has kicked out most of Europe the quest continues as the third crusade picks up and its up to the Europeans to hold off their fortresses from the Salidans onslaughts. The Kings Crusade mostly focuses on castle building and defense, similar to Mission 4 of The Call to Arms. Each level provides new features which give you a better mechanism to defend you castle and equip you against an ever stronger foe until you eventually must siege castle and rebuild it from the ground up. Crusader StatesThe campaign begins after the third crusade and is a fictitious rendition of what we expected after the Third Crusade ended. You play in the Middle East as lord’s squalor over various lands and it is up to you to defeat your foes. Your mission through the Middle East pits you against the foes of the past: The Rat, The Snake, The Pig, and The Wolf. The further you get into the campaign the more enemies you get pit against. Gameplay:Stronghold Crusader is noted as being the best Stronghold game; it took what was good from the original and expanded upon it beautifully. Stronghold Crusader is a castle simulation game, where you manage a castle politically, economically, and sociologically. You must maintain various food types, keep your people happy, while simultaneously ripping them dry for every penny they have. You need to build a well-oiled machine, but unlike most strategy games Stronghold has many resources. To build units you must obtain gold, you must build their weapons, you must provide peasant, you must feed them with various food stocks, and you must obtain the resources required to build those weapons. For all of this to occur you must keep peasants within your castle by making sure they are happy, once they start to leave your castle will crumble from within before your enemies even hit your walls. Stronghold Crusader takes that and incorporates mercenaries, units which cost gold and require less work to obtain. Of course they cost almost triple that of a non-hired unit, but offer quick turn-around. Not only did they add mercenaries, but they included Skirmishes with AI, which allow you to play the game without playing the campaign. The AI is rather intelligent and will keep you on your toes, and not only that but the maps are designed to require intense combat. This game will make you fight over limited agrarian land and low wood stocks. Hints:>When you start a map drop the gamespeed to 20, this gives you loads of time to set yourself up before the match really begins.>When playing the crusader states the game gives you sometimes up to 7.5k gold, if you drop the game-speed to 20 and place a market you can buy Maces and Leather Armor. Then quickly build an army of Macemen to take out your foes before the match can even begin. This does not work on all missions, but certainly helps.>Bread is the easiest food to build-up. If you are trying to optimize limited farmland use wheat as its easy to mass. Results:Stronghold Crusader is the best castle simulation game out there right now. It offers the joy of castle simulation with the intensities of combat. I would recommend this game to anyone who is thinking about taking part in the Stronghold Series, it’s a great place to start as it will pull you right in. Stronghold Crusader is a fantastic game for castle simulation fans and real time strategy fans alike. I would recommend this buying this game even at full price, but if you can get it at a discount its worth every penny and you won’t regret it. Pros:+Four amazing campaigns which teach you how to play the game without being boring or repetitive.+The AI has various levels of intelligence which makes them fun as well as challenging.+They added mercenaries which allow you to build emergency armies quick, but cost extraordinary sums of gold. +Finally Skirmishes have been introduced; you don’t have to play the campaign or multiplayer. You can just mess around by yourself. +New strategic limitations, such as limited grass for agriculture which makes you consider your strategies.Cons:-I couldn’t minimize the game; it would minimize but not maximize (Windows 8.1)-When playing you could not open steam overlay, one of the commands for steam overlay is a command for the games GUI display.

												Even though I only have 2.3 hrs on record in Steam. I bought this game on the disk (yes disk) around 10-11 years ago when it came out.The online scene was buzzing and me and up to 6 friends used to constantly skirmish on Gamespy Arcade. Now Gamespy is dead, you can only play another player through the IP option which is a little fiddly, but it is doable.The AI in this game is pretty good and you dont need to play humans to be challenged. The game is a timeless gem and I would recomend it to anyone. Crusader is by far the best in the series. Stronghold 1 is great is your playing the campaign. But I wouldn't go any further down the line than that, Firefly studios went down hill. If your in to top down stratergy games, this game is amazing. I'd advise you watch Total Biscuits video on it, he explains it very well.Go buy it, then contact me on steam if you want a game or a co-op partner! :D			"

												Another great classic among strategy games. Definately worth looking for Medieval History enthusiasts, Age of Empires players and generally everyone that's looking forward to a well done Castle Building (quite similar to city building with a military approach) Strategy Real-Time game.The style makes this very unique.The music speaks for a lot, with authentic and faithfully created Arab flutes, the desert everywhere! It's really worth it, even if the ""HD"" doesn't look as great as some other remakes - it works great and that's all that I personally could ask for, as there isn't that much to improve here really aside from issues with launching the game.

												The time I played this game says it all. I can recommend all of the Stronghold games but Stronghold Crusader is the best one and it was my first PC game when I started 9 years ago.I played the HD-version on Steam 300 hours in the last 1 1/2 years and uncountable hours before I bought it on Steam.Pros:- good price- 2 Crusades (2x50 missions) and 4 historical campaigns (4x4 missions)- Multiplayer against or with other players on Game Ranger-  a lot of siege equipment (catapult,ballista,trebuchets etc.) and troops (arabs and crusaders)- authentic landscapes- create your own multiplayer maps- epic music and characters- better graphicsCons: I cannot really find a negative aspect. It is fun to play alone and with friends.- Maybe it gets boring sometimes, but there is always a reason to play it from time to time.The game is almost as old as I am and first published for Windows 98, so do not expect too much and just have fun.

												A lot of sequels strike out in new directions, and end up falling flat for their trouble. Sometimes they get too far away from what made the original great, and other times they find a way to ruin that original appeal. The other side of the coin is that just giving players more of the original risks making the series stale. This is the approach that Stronghold Crusader took in the wake of Stronghold's success, but the sheer volume of content more than makes up for the lack of innovation.Just as you did in Stronghold, Crusader challenges you to erect and manage castles throughout a variety of scenarios and skirmishes. Once your keep and granary are placed, it's up to you to site farms, mills, workshops, and homes to keep your people safe and happy. So long as you remain a popular ruler more people will come serve at your castle, but more people means a greater drain on your resources. In the midst of balancing these two factors you'll need to raise walls and armies to fend off invaders seeking your crown.The familiar moors of England have given way to the marauding Moors of the holy land for this outing. There are a few big changes to be aware of, most notably the desert maps. Gone are the rolling fields of the first game, instead leaving you with small oases to supply your essential farms and woodcutters. A mercenary post allows you to recruit new Arabian units, everything from armored swordsmen to wall-scaling assassins. There's even a rudimentary diplomacy system, allowing you to form alliances and request resources.Stronghold Crusader features four historical campaigns, focusing on different parts of the Crusades. Each campaign is five scenarios long and features a gentle learning curve that provides a fair challenge by the end. There's little story to be found here in contrast with Stronghold's tale of political maneuvering, just some blurbs about historical relevance. The real meat of the game is the Crusader mode, a campaign of up to 50 battles against AI opponents. Right from the get-go you can access all the buildings and options the game has to offer in pursuit of conquest, building your perfect citadel and laying siege to nearby enemies. The strategy of castle-to-castle warfare takes a little getting used to after the easy pace of the campaigns, but it's thrilling to launch pitched battles and deploy siege engines to topple your foes.There's not a lot of innovation to be found here over the original Stronghold, but there really doesn't need to be. Crusader instead gives you plenty more to see and do, especially on the military side. The graphics are a bit improved, with sharper structures and cleaner animations, and the sounds of both peace and battle are just as immersive as before. Honestly, I consider this the superior game just due to the depth of content and the little additions to the proven formula. If you're looking for endless conquest and sieges, this is the Stronghold title you want.			"

												Stronghold: Crusader is an RTS (real time strategy) game based in the Middle East during the Crusades, namely mainly in the third. Some parts of the game, however, take place before that. It's a kind of extension of the game Stronghold, which Crusader in many aspects resembles, but Stronghold is set in medieval England.Stronghold: Crusader is Stronghold enriched with new mechanics, the most famous of these is the Skirmish mode, the heart of the game. It is a mode in which each player or computer opponent has one base on a map and they must develop, market, prosper and build castles and defense. Since all players are on one map, they can interact with each other, whether it's positively or negatively. Allies can trade with each other, defend each other and attack together. The game goal is most of the time to kill all the enemy Lords and not die in the process. The game balances the economy and the war very well. The player must develop their economy through taxes, food rations, trade and so on. They must seek to balance their popularity to not become unpopular, because in that case people will begin to leave the castle and it will severely impede the player's progress. If the player has a good economy, they can take up making a great army, which is usually quite costly. This is the way the game balances the economy and the war, and I like it. You should think about your tactics and castle management a bit and not just rush into war straight away - otherwise you go to your knees, whether you like it or not.The main objectives of the game itself are the 2 Skirmish trails. They consist of a number of consecutive Skirmishes. In each mission the player has certain enemies, sometimes allies, a set map and everyone's position on it, and a set amount of money and resources. There are 16 PC enemies altogether and about 80 maps (citation needed), so with such diversity there is also an option to play your own game, where the player chooses the map, their allies and adversaries as well as everyone's money and resources. Computer opponents are also quite diverse: 6 Arab and 10 Crusader leaders, each of whom has different castles, different tactics, different personalities, and there's a lot to the game to keep you interested long enough.In addition to Skirmish trails, one can play historical campaigns. They're based on specific historical periods and events during the Crusades. They are there to teach the player the game. The first campaign teaches the fundamentals of the economy, defense and siege. The second campaign teaches the player how to use unique Arab units. In the third campaign the player learns to defend against them, and the fourth campaign is already full-on Skirmish mode. In the first three campaigns the player doesn't have the Skirmish mode freedom because they either defend against attacks at certain intervals, while trying to achieve a set goal (Defend Antioch! Gather 300 loaves of bread!, and the like), while they often don't have access to all buildings - or they get a certain number of soldiers with which to conquer a city. This is exactly why a lot of people find these campaigns boring, tedious and difficult. In a sense they are right. These campaigns are fine, but cumbersome unlike the rest of the game. The game also includes a mode of free castle building without enemies, map editor and LAN multiplayer for 8 players.Crusader Extreme added a bar of (super)powers, which fills up slowly and over time unlocks the abilities for your use - such as a rain of arrows or rocks on a specific place on the map. It also added military outposts - buildings that relatively slowly generate troops for free. This allows all PC adversaries to be stronger than normal - for example the Rat, the weakest adversary, suddenly gets a huge army of swordsmen, pikemen, horse archers and seven catapults - and they're coming for you!Overall, I think that Stronghold: Crusader is an excellent game. Fun and fast paced with minor weak points and bugs, which can be overlooked. 9/10PS: The Steam version doesn't cooperate with Steam firefly fix pls			"

												Be sure to Google the ""Stronghold Crusader Heaven"" website. They have a large number of scenarios and utilities (like scenario unlockers) for this product. The unlocker also allows you to edit existing scenarios, which is almost a must-do for most people to have a chance to win the tough Extreme scenarios.			"

												A fun and nostalgic game. Brings back some fine memories from childhood.There are some bugs however that makes some campaign maps unplayable. After playing some maps for a while the game speed gets locked on the slowest speed and it can't be changed regardless of what game speed i choose. When this happens the game also starts recognizing my clicks very poorly so i often have to press multiple times on something in order for the game to respond. When this happens i also can not attack the enemy lords with meele soldiers as they simply can not walk up the stairs to the enemy citadel. This means that it would take an eternity to take out the enemy lords with arrows on the slowest game speed. This whole thing only happens on certain maps though.Apart from those annoying bugs it is a great game!			"

												Looking for a good RTS? Look no Further.This game is the pinnacle of quality for the Stronghold series. The first game lacks the depth that Crusader has, but is still very good. Problem is that every game after this one, in the Stronghold series, just doesn't measure up. This game has a perfect blend of complexity and simplicity.The game isn't so complicated that its hard to pick up or understand, but not so simple that there is a lack of depth.Likewise the play of the game is balanced between economics/resources management and Military strategy. In some other RTS games it is absolutely true that whoever can rush their economy the fastest is the victor, and I would say that is not the case for this game. Speed is of course an important factor, but unless one player is particularly slow in comparision to the other, speed will not be the deciding factor. The ability you have for using your economy to maximize your military potential through any number of means, as well as your ability to strategically use your troops/resources to take advantage of your opponent's weaknesses are the most important factors.However, understanding your map placement while using this in your overall strategy, and your ability to build/defend your castle are extremely important. A player near less resources with a weaker economy can play more defensively, defeat an opponent's army who lays siege, and then counter attack before the opponent can recover from the losses to pull a victory. Or in the same scenario, the player in a weak spot can harass with the goal to destroy their opponent's economy, thus crippling them, then pressing the advantage. The ways a game can be played and won are vast.Multiplayer is where this depth of gameplay becomes most visible, but due to the direct IP connect multiplayer set up it is easiest to just use a service with lobbies to set up games with randoms. I recommend Game Ranger. The community isn't huge, but is still large enough that it isn't hard to find someone online to play with.From my perspective, this is the greatest RTS of all time.Keeping my personal bias aside, this game is very good, especially for it's time.I believe it is an under appreciated title worth picking up for it's price.TL;DR : Graphics are okay, not confusing or hard to look at, but not stunning due to their age.Gameplay is not without it's flaws, but it is in depth and the application of strategy, awareness, and quick thinking are key. Making use of European and/or Arabic units is also an important element.Multiplayer is fun and much more in depth than playing with bots, but its better to use an external program for matchmakingModes; there are a few to choose from, Multiplayer, custom game mode, there is custom map making which can be shared with other players in multiplayer, Single player has two crusader trails which set you up against bots in specific set ups, and a historical single player mode where you defend real crusader castles like Kerak de Chevaliers.Sounds/Soundtrack nothing I would write home about, but its not hard to listen to either.Should you read this review, and then decide to buy this game and thenwant to get in on multiplayer, feel free to add me.

												Crusader is a classic medieval RTS game and is one of my favprite games ever. I have put endless hours into this game in the original version and the steam HD version. What it lacks in story it makes up for with an amazing skirmish mode and a deep and easy to use map creator. The complexity of the game makes it one of my favorite RTS games of all time.			"

												Stronghold Crusader came out mid 2002 after the succesful Stronghold in 2001. Stronghold Crusader is set in the Middle East during the crusades rather then Europe like the first one, hence the name Crusader. This is a real time stratergy game with the focus of killing the enemy Lord/s. Careful though as he will be very strong and can take over 10000 archer arrows! don't worry it is done on purpose so you can kill him at a range, so best to send 10 plus swords men at him.If you played the Original like I did many moons ago there are changes in this HD edition and NONE! are bad. There are 8 more characters to verus, more resolution sizes and graphics has imporved. Everything else is the same as the original which is amazing!So the Pro's:- Personally the best out of all Strongholds- Unique RTS that requires not only military stratergies but also civil (do you make them drunk and fed or starve and whip them?)- Arabian units are an awesome edition giving alot more unit choice- Fire implementation in the game is great, see random guys on fire turn a city into a flame ball (happens more often then you think), yes this is a pro!!- Large campaign and a few side stories 'missions'- Great to plan with mates (LAN or over the net)- Replayability in custom maps or make your own which is easily shared to other pc's when trying to match make- alot of challanging Lords to play- Fun castle building and designing to fit all military and civil works in and aroundCon's- 400 unit pop count, may sound like alot but it isn't when you are trying to kill 7 Lord's at once- The Large map for 8 Players can seem very small in most instances- If AI Lords placed close together or near iron it is create holes or even block themsleves in starving their kingdom.- No unit or building healing (can repair towers and that's it)- Would be good to make AI even harder, they have Lords to difficulty but it would be good if you can adjust it more- Most of the time units will not attack the enemy until they are either told or the enemy are already bashing their face in- Enemy AI with their army can be very disorganized making them easy preyOverall I love this edition of Stronghold Crusader HD, I will continue to use it and LAN with friends. If you want a LAN game to kill some time this is great for you! (better to vs your friends for more of a challange).any questions don't be afriad to ask.			"

												'Ahhh Running out of tax again, fetch me the tax collector!'-The SherrifI don't have many hours on steam, but besides from steam i probably have hundreds of hours into this game. It doesn't have the flashy graphics from nowadays but the gameplay and the depht is amazing. Every A.I. Character has it's own strenghts and weaknesses. From the Rat being mid game downright anyoing because of his infinite units spams of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ economically devastating units if he breaches your defences somehow, to the mighty Wolf with his almost impenatrable castles and huge armies which will decimate you and your allies if not prepared for them. This game is the living proof you can live on beer and relgion or flowers and graves. If your popularity is down and you don't have food, just build some churches and taverns and lets get drunk with god. It might be a hard game to get at first but after you've played a couple of games and watched some vids you will get it and become better.It doesn't have a main campaign, instead it has several smaller campaign of 5 missions each. next to these missions are the trials in which you must fight every lord with and without allies and with an econimical disadvantage and an ally disadvantage. The game is balanced because everyone has access to the same units. some maps might not be balanced but thats what gives you the challenge.This is downright the best game of the developer. the games following this title aren't as good espacially stronghold 3 which is a turd. If you want hours of gameplay for not to much money, this is your game to play.(tip buy collectors edition from steam in a sale or from a third party site)			"

 Game is on sale, should I buy it?  If you like strategy games or stronghold games atall then yes. Easily worth the sale price. Should you buy this game?  Yes!! This was the strategy game of my childhood and still is. The game plays well and has a good economy and combat which means you will always be fighting or be close to action most of the game. (Obvious some exceptions 1v1 on largest map `-`) The game plays the same as the other Stronghold games but has a different food system where you can only have farms on grass. Take note the game is set in the desert. Skirmish mode is where the game shines since the AI is decent in giving you a challenge especially when you are against the odds. Obvious flaws in the AI play style exist but doesn't affect the game at all. I've had hours before buying the steam version and will probally sink some more in when I can. There is a good map variety and a decent amount of AI characters each with 2-3 different set castles they build and each have their own playstyle and unit variety. There isn't a difficulty slider for the AI apart from gold they start. Is there a campaign? No. There is not a set campaign like other strongholds. The missions are just skirmish battles but pre set. There are roughly 30 of these in base game and 30 in expansion which is included in this. (I havn't played or counted all of these so don't hold me to numbers) These get more challenging and make some interesting battles if you get half way through. Is this worth it over the non HD version? Technically no. All this adds is resolution support which makes it run somewhat more smoothly but doesn't actually change much more. Somewhat random review and will be missing alot of points but just wanted to post.			"

This may not be for people that are playing a game and evaluating it from a graphical side. It is 2002 game, so.. In my opinion it is pretty strategic and fun to play.My first time that I had to play this game was horrible, because I had absolutelly no logic (Yes, you need to have brain to play this game. This is not just building and done). What I was doing back then just building beautiful buildings, such as church and etc. I didn't know what I was doing. So, when I grew up, I got into this game out of nostalgia. I understood what I was doing at that time, and it was lmao to remember what I was doing back there... xDSo, as I said, this game needs logic, because you are not going to survive and win by doing random ♥♥♥♥. You start up in different locations of the map with your opponents and you the point is to build your castle, make troops and protect yourself and slaughter them. But the most logical part of the game, is management of resources. Gold, stone, wood, food, iron. Nothing complicated. The food is the most essential resource for surviving obviously. Without it, people will leave your castle and you have nothing... So after you have dispatched resource income in appriopriate way and value, you have to build up you castle (That's my favourite part, because you can build in any way you want) and protect it, because everything is risky. They can target your resource income building, which can leave you empty and put you at a disadvantage. Thinking through stuff, and protecting everything is the key. After building up stage, some obviously will choose to attack, and some of them will have to defend. Defending is the most fun part, because after you dispatched your troops at appropriate locatons of defense (such as towers) for protection, it is so satisfying to see how strong is your defense, and after that you can find your weakness. Then, it is up to you, you build up your army, you slaughter, you win. That's all. Also there are campaign and other modes which can give a little bit of a challenge against other opponents. Some stages will be hard, and will give you a location with disadvantages, but it is up to you how you will build up, survive, destroy and win.That I think is everything to this game. I recommend it for players that are interested in strategic. (Bu I am guessing there are people who have started their journey from this one and what I mean is that they already tried it).			"

												Dont look at my play time I have played this game for hundreds of hours when i was a kid. This game is...amazing. Truly amazing. There are few words that are able to describe how crazy good this game is. No it does not have the depth of StarCraft, but its not designed to be a competitive game. Its a casual fun strategy, that you can play with you mouse. But dont let that turn you away from the game. There is plenty of challange for hardcore RTS fans like me. You can make the matchups very imbalanced, and there is not just one type of AI, there are 14 diferend adversaries, and no they are not just dificulties, they build their castels diferently, and use diferent types of army. There are historical campaings, but they are very underwhelming IMO.If i have to rate this game it would be a 9/10. If i have to trust the biast nostalgia 17/10 :). But a more realistic verdic would be 9/10. A must own for all self respecting RTS fans.NOW BEGONE FROM HERE GO PLAY THE GAME INFIDELS!			"

												My first stronghold is a minigame that came along with a game magazine that you controls three arrowmen to fight incoming enemies. Your last resort is a engineer pouring down oil that kills most of enemies down stairs.The minigame acts like a trailer to the upcoming game that brought to my attention, the Stronghold game.It was my eight year old I believe. And it has been over twenty years passed, and now I have repurchased this game on steam. What a great childhood memory, and what a game when I could play both as a child and as an adult. xDCannot say too much. Rating 10/10.P.S. Do not play stronghold 3 as it is nothing comparing to the first one. I haven't played the second one so I will not comment. But the third one is nothing, literally nothing comparing to the first one. I have to repeat myself. Overall, enjoy the game guys, and definitely you shall buy it on this week sale. :)			"

Campaigns have missions but the skirmish mode is entirely made of war and killing the kid. Battles are huge and gets entense. Pros+ best ""Stronghold""+ Have a huge building area zone+ one of the best RTS (in my opinion!)+ 16 different enemies with special tactics!+ many maps +Skirmish mode addon+ tons of missions and 2 campaigns+ different modes: the peaceful and war path+ loads of playable options+ create your own maps!+ easy gameplay Cons-sometimes crash and lose all your save progress- HD?

												This was the first game I ever bought for myself way back in 2002 and I've logged hundreds more hours in it than my steam profile would suggest. This game though over a decade old, is truly still relevant within the same castle building rts genre today and for me is more than just nostalgia. It combines a somewhat historically accurate and entertaining historical campaign following the rough lines of the First, Second and Third Crusades and playable from different sides of the conflicts. The AI can be rather easy to beat if exploited and with experience in beating the various AI lords you need to challenge yourself using the map maker and understanding AI play style to make winning the match a true challenge. I love this game and would recommend it to anyone with a historical inclination and an appreciation of rts games from the early 2000's. Hopefully someday they'll make a sequel worth playing.			"

												Timeless classic, now in HD.Crusader has been one of my favourite games since I was a child and it still plays and feels pretty smooth today.It features various campaigns or coop/versus play with or without bots with tons of different maps and playstyles, you can also create custom maps to play on, if you aren't fond of the standard ones.Each unit and technology branch serves a purpose and fits into its own nieche, allowing for multiple ways to defend, build or attack a castle. In the historical campaigns you are usually restricted in what you can build, so you'll have to make do with what the game gives you instead of mindlessly following the same build order every mission.While the AI is certainly the game's weakest point, the atmosphere, amazing soundtrack and entertainment that comes from building a castle from scratch, stabilizing its economy and then later on crushing your enemy with military power more than makes up for it.If you like medieval RTS games, then this is for you.

If played against bots, it's enough to build a valid defense and secure a decent food supply. No need to constantly scout or adapt certain counterattacks for specific enemies.

												I dont always write reviews...But when I do, Its for a fantastic game.[Rating at End of review]When I got this game I placed it in a cart with Far cry 3, a game that I was looking forword to playing. After I purchesed this game, I did not play it and it was idle in my library. Then when my friend came over for airsofting, he downloaded the game because he wanted to play it. It was when I was watching him play it that I realized that this game is amazing! One thing I regret doing was tring to play this game like Age of Empires A game that I played when I was young, where you build an empire. In this game you build a castle/stronghold and attack other castle/strongholds. Right now this game holds its place in my favorites catagory in steam along with Space Engineers, Just Cause 2, Elder scrolls Skyrim and Supreme Commander.This game is in my opinion 10/10 for filling the hole of nostalga that Age of Empires could not fill.

												I was only 5 years old, I loved Stronghold so much. I had all the merchandise and games. I pray to Stronghold everyday thanking it for the life i've been given. ""Stronghold is love"" I say ""Stronghold is life"". My dad hears me and says ""Total War is better"". I knew he was just jealous of my devotion for Stronghold. I called him a filthy peasant. He puts my granary on half rations and sends me to go to sleep. I'm crying now and my peasants are leaving. I lay in bed and its really cold. A warmth is moving towards me. I feel something touch me. Its the scribe, i'm so happy. He whispers in my ear ""A message m'lord"". He grabs me with his powerful scribe hands and puts me on my hands and knees. I'm ready. I open my gates for the scribe and he enters my castle. It hurts so much but I do it for the scribe. I can feel my castle tearing as my eyes start to water. I push against his force, I want to please the scribe. He roars a mighty roar as he fills my stockpile. My dad walks in. The scribe looks him straight in the eye and says ""The stockpile is full m'lord"". The scribe catapults out my window. ""Stronghold is Love, Stronghold is life""			"

												Honestly this game, and the original Stronghold (HD) are some of the best, if not the best RTS games of their decade. There have been a few developers that have tried to replicate the success and capture the magic that these two games had, but none of them have succeeded. A must-play, and an excellent rock-solid RTS. I've spent many, many hours on these games and I still love them to bits. "

												It was great in 2002, it's still great today. I may be slightly bias due to the fact that this game made up my childhood, but I feel all the positive comments are justified. The simplicity of this game is one of its many charms. Don't let this fool you, there is still plenty to do and this game can be adjusted to match your playstyle. Casual gamer? Try out a custom skirmish game where you make the rules. Looking for a challenge? Why not head to the Crusader Trials? Despite its simplicity, the game can surprise you at times. The AI is pretty impressive (unless you ask them to defend you; they aren't the brightest bulb in the bunch when it comes to that respect), the different strategies you can implement to obtain victory never ceases to amaze me. Forgive my bluntless, but I'm willing to say that this game is one of, if not the best, RTS games to date. I know it's my personal favourite (sorry Total War).			"

												This is one of my favorite games from my childhood, and it holds up well. The graphics look pretty good and the music is still perfect. The game is as fun as ever and controls well. A great strategy game.If you are expecting the game to have Steam functionality for multiplayer, don't get your hopes up - in order to play on a non-Lan game, you'll need to download an additional program like Hamachi or GameRanger. This is a tad disappointing but doesn't ruin the experience - it just makes multiplayer less convenient.All in all, a great, classic strategy game.			"

												Exactly like the classic we all know and love.The game remains as the classic once was, the crusader trail and the historical campaigns are all included. Even warchest is included, alltogether making this a purchase worth well worth it.What I would've liked to see in this revision?- Could've used some rebalancing;- Could've used some bugfixing;- Could've used a solid multiplayer component, built in the game (or via steam, for that matter).My verdict?Well worth your time, and double the fun if you have friends that play the game too. Plenty of hours of fun to be had, as you can renew challenges for yourself (and your friends) with the map editor!			"

												Imagine a real-time, fast-paced strategy game where you enter the Holy Lands following an unforgiving trail of fifty crusaders – each more difficult than the last; each with different enemies, different resources, different allies and different economies. You discover and master the art of defending and storming castles – planning your every move carefully while controlling armies of men, horses, portable-shields, catapults and more in the hundreds. Now, realize that the game in question, Stronghold Crusader, was released twelve years ago and that a succeeder is inbound Q4 2014.In comparison to the original Stronghold, Firefly Studios significantly altered the dynamics of Stronghold Crusader in an attempt to increase the game speed – which unforgivably means the first few minutes of each mission are crucial. The changes includes the addition of a range of Arabian mercenary units, where especially assassins, fire throwers and horse archers introduces a range of new opportunities upon both defending your own castle and conquering others. The traditional military units are still more powerful however, but takes significantly longer to recruit due to the extensive production line. The player must thus analyze the enemies and starting resources swiftly – the sooner the production line can be started, the better. Similar, if the enemies appear weak during the early stages, a quick and silent attack gently delivered by assassins might be preferred.One aspect is to defend your castle and attack enemies, a whole other layer of gameplay, which appears subtle at first glance, is the actual castle management. Stronghold Crusader introduces a range of buildings and techniques which allows the player to generate more money, extra powerful men or a harder working population, to name a few. Increasing your population’s happiness through religion or ale allows for higher taxes, crowding and even food shortages. Similar, increasing the amount of bad things (i.e. gallows, dunking tools or cesspits) in your castle makes your population work faster and thus generate a faster and more efficient money flow.Securing a food chain is even more important than it was in the original Stronghold due to the deserted and rocky terrain which greatly limits the amount of fertile areas. These areas are therefore both interesting and important strategic points; take out an enemy’s food supply and you force him out of his castle. The gameplay thus consists of both castle management, fighting and survival throughout 50 crusades, four chapters of historically inspired missions and an extra 30 crusades introduced after the original release – in total well above 40 hours of campaign gameplay, excluding later free- and custom-play.The RTS-genre has undeniably advanced significantly since the release of Stronghold Crusader on several fronts; including, but not limited to, the graphics (though, admittedly, the old graphics are charming), the audio, the interfaces and the AI. Especially the latter is easily noticeable if you have played any modern RTS-game – the AI in Stronghold Crusader is easily tricked, and once a player reaches a certain point in the map, winning ultimately becomes a matter of time due to the superior human player and the seemingly flat difficulty-level of the AIs. Instead, the game relies on quantity and starting perks such as six AIs with 20.000 gold each versus the player with only 3.000 gold. That said then the game unfortunately suffers from a range of bugs and glitches, which unavoidably results in quite some micromanagement of the player’s troops to ensure they indeed are doing the assigned task accordingly. The path-finding system has a tendency to chose some strange routes, and can, on rare occasions, end up getting your men stuck. Though, remembering the age of the game then these issues are minor and certainly not game breaking – merely frustrating due to the higher focus on micromanagement.The freedom in terms of building and designing your castle is intriguing and very unique compared to other RTS-games. Similar, the actual gameplay is extremely simple and straightforward, but due to the many layers of extra options and techniques during both fighting and castle management, the gameplay is yet challenging – and most importantly, fun. Ignoring the minor bugs and glitches, Stronghold Crusader is a solid game for any RTS-fan, and a great option for those who wishes to enter the genre!			"

												Great game, really. It's like turning to old times 12 years ago when I had very slow pc, and only Stronghold runned without any performance issues. Can't say that the storyline is intereting, but the gameplay process is making you completely dive in. Enemies are good, but unfortunately too weak and you easily pick up one strategy and use it throughout entire game, until you complete all the missions. Also in the field did occur several bugs, when AI had been building up a castle, and then struck in place, just trading and doing nothing else. Building proces can be simplified using the change of game speed, which at start may give you great advantage in relation to your enemies / allies. About multiplayer: never played, but going to, I think, then will update review.Conclusion: just great, spent many hours with pleasure.			"

												This review is not intended to address the original Stronghold Crusader, which is absolutely fantastic, but rather the HD version specifically.Also, Steam says I have almost no time on this at all. This is because I had to play it on Game Ranger and Steam did not record that time as playtime. I also put probably hundreds of hours into it before I bought it here.I have owned Stronghold Crusader for my entire adult life, and it was always one of my favorite games. When I saw that there was an HD version out, I immediately put it on my wishlist and eventually wound up owning it. Now, I have not taken seriously the idea that HD games are any better graphically than their original versions. I've played a few HD games and even in side by side pictures I have a hard time telling the difference. The main point to HD games, as far as I can tell, is that they are more playable on modern machines.While this game does technically run, it does so with difficulty. Generally windows behind the game bleed through somehow and cause disruption. Alt tabbing is possible but only with great disruption and it takes a good five to ten seconds to get back into the game. One nice thing about buying an old game on Steam is that you can usually have the Steam overlay and multiplayer with other steam users is quite easy. This game has no Steam overylay and multiplayer is actually extremely difficult. It took probably half an hour for two professional geeks to figure it out. That had a lot to do with us avoiding Game Ranger at all costs, but we couldn't find any other way to play it multiplayer. GameR anger it is.Now, I already owned this game. I have it on a compact disc downstairs. I got this game here because I thought it was something beyond the version from my late teens and would have some sort of advantage over that.Don't get me wrong. If you don't already own this game, do buy it. But not on Steam. Get it on Gog where you won't have all the drm. If you already own Stronghold Crusader, the HD version brings nothing new of any value.Again, I can't speak highly enough of Stronghold Crusader itself, but you don't need the HD version and you get none of the regular Steam advantages by buying it here.

												When it comes to gameplay, this is the best strategy game I have ever played. The economic system is brilliant, it is very realistic but at the same time simple and easy to understand. The castle and warfare mechanics are brilliant. There are numerous ways to build your castle and defend it, and a variety of options to defeat your enemies. While most strategy games tend to require the same tactics with just slight differences, this game takes strategical thinking to a whole new level. In fact, a game of SC is not that different from a game of chess. When it comes to graphics, of course, this is an old game.			"

												I bought game more than 10 years ago in the disc format. I spent countless night playing this with my friends, those were the good ol days. I'm glad they made a HD version of this, but I reall hope they can remake the whole game with just better physics engine, 3d models/textures and stuffs like that (but don't make change to the gameplay, which is the failure of cursader 2). This together with red alert 2 are my favorite RTS games of all time (unlike SC2, RA3 is pretty good though). I definitely recomment this game--it takes some time to get used to its economic and population system, but once you get a hang of it, you're gonna enjoy this game soooo much.Some hints for new players:for every mill you build you should build around 7-10 bakers.for every stone mine you build you need around 5 cows to transport the stones.always build the lumber hut and market first, wood is essential at the beginning.build a LOT of stone mine--easy money.the placement of the buildings are very important to efficiency (e.g. by placing the bakers right next to granaries you reduce the time of a baker's travelling).hope this helps			"

												One of my favourite strategy games of all time. I played every Stronghold game they released and Stronghold Crusader is by far the best. It's an old game I can't deny that, but in my opinion the 2D graphics look more attractive than any other 3D from the other Stronghold Games. The only negative thing I can think of is that it's sometimes a little bit hard to handle, because there is no autosell/ autobuy option on the market. But All in All it is my favourite Stronghold game and maxbe the last good game they made			"

												What's that? No 3D-graphics? Well, guess what... It doesn't need that to be good!Here you are, starting only with some wood, stone and gold. You build - you recruit - you fight - you win (?). It's a simple concept and a lot of strategy games follow this direction. In fact, Stronghold Crusader isn't really complex, so the first sight might give you the impression of a boring city simulator... For me, there's something wonderful about this simplicity.The goal is to be the very best like no one ever was. Kill the enemy's king and get your well-earned peace while you defend your own crown-wearing buddy. Of course they won't invite you into their castle, so you have to invite yourself. In order to blast away their walls and towers, there are different ways, like hammering every single brick off the wall or dig a tunnel underneath it. They won't like you to be that rude, so they put archers on towers to keep your men away and you'll have to get rid of them first somehow! Either you ruin the towers with catapults or invade with own archers and fight back.This isn't what makes Stronghold Crusader so enjoyable. The true entertainment is the possibility to be a rotten ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to them! Every inhabitant of the castle is a free-walking NPC which can be killed too. It is incredibly annoying when your enemy has posted some archers beneath your farms and keeps killing your farmers. Not only is it very time consuming to fight off those archers, but it's also very stressful for the castle's economy. Every killed farmer means a lost delivery of food, and without food your people will get very angry. Your people start to leave your castle when you keep being such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and soon you will only have three peasants left.If this is still too weak for you, you can step it up and use dirty tricks to wreck'em! If you manage to lit an enemy's building on fire, it will spread out drasticly, burning down every house 'n' human. This could lead to a total destruction of the castle, making them to start from the beginning. Fire is a great element of the game, because it can turn a lost-believed battle into a success.Otherwise I'd say it's a classic RTS. Build, fight and succeed. There are  singleplayer campaigns, but the true enjoyment is the multiplayer with friends, because of the nasty actions possible. Sadly you'll have to fiddle around with IPs and networks in order to connect to each other. Because this game doesn't require alot performance, the connection is always stable (at least for me it always was) and free of laggs. All I can say is that I've played this game for whole days years ago and I still enjoy this piece. The graphics may look very old and bad, but I think it only adds to the charisma the game shows.

If you've played an RTS before you will fall in love with this game.I remember playing this game when i was much younger, only about 8-10 years old. It was one of my first videogames i ever played. I got so many hours of enjoyment out of this game that when i saw that it was on steam in HD for only $10 I had to have it.			"

												A game many played when they were younger and brings back memories, an RTS that has deep strategy which this game made even better through the desert setting and scarcer resources, and topped off by the fact that it's an RTS where I dont feel limited by my APM at all, and instead it's how I play the game rather than how fast I play it that merits reward. Truly a gem among RTS's especially for lower skilled players, and also functions as a great castle sim for those not interested in fighting opponents. Stronghold and even more so Stronghold Crusader is a game loved by almost everyone who plays it.			"

												This game is the GREATEST castle sim of all time. I started playing it long before steam was even a thing, and have loved it every minute since. This game offers several gamemodes, which with out just one, or one of them is even slightly altered, this game would be very different. The graphics are not the greatest, being created in the early 2000's, but that is beside the point. Some of the gamemodes include: Castle Building(Very Peaceful), Two Campaign trails(Begins Easy, becomes harder down the trail), Your 'average joe' multiplayer(Play against AI or even Players *Hard to play with other players)  You can create maps for multiplayer. You can 'relive' several great battles of the crusade. Many different types of units. If you buy this game, you receive Stronghold Crusader Extreme, which increases the amount of units, more AI, more campaign trails, and even more replay value. If you have not bought, you SHOULD buy it rightnow. I recommend this game, with a rating of 9.7/10			"

												[10 unique and valuable pro tips for beating crusader extreme below]As someone who was addicted to strategy games around the time the original crusader game came out, I would heavily recommend this to people who either like age of empires, who would like to relive those days and to those people who like challenges. The game includes Crusader Extreme HD, with missions 'so difficult' (the first 14 missions took me 1-3 hours each, excluding some start-over missions because i failed) that you need to resort to a very defensive guerilla/ninja playing style to succeed. there's missions where u have to defeat more than 7 opponents on a single map, all by yourself. And everyone starts with the same resources. After some restarted missions and succeeding (im about halfway now i guess, at mission 14) i found out a strategy that works out for 90% of the missions. If you want to figure this out yourself do not read on, i will not mention anything new. but for those who quit out of frustration heres how you can do it:1. some missions involve defeating multiple opponents of which some are very closeby, even withing arrow range of your castle (you dont want that). use up all you money to build knights and send them in to kill the enemies close to you. in some missions, its possible to kill enemy lords before they have even built their castle.2. NEVER forget to build a market in the beginning. not all maps offer all resource types within range or within castle building range, which means e.g. if theres only quarry near the keep, you will have to put as any quarry miines there as possible and sell some of it to buy stone/wood. 3. always start off building 3 more stockpile spaces (free), a market, 2-4 hovels depending on how much starting resources u have, and a combination of 5, 10 or 15 'good things' and a church (or 2, if u can),  and either a mercenary post or barracks + armory. buying weapons to recruit non-mercenary troops is usually cheaper. mercenary post recommended when u have a lot of starting money.4. build a wall ASAP around your keep with enough space to put in all your buildings needed to recruit ttroops and keep the economy going. set mercenary slaves or regular troops like spearman and archers at work to dig a moat on the inner side of the wall, then build another wall that will actually function as your wall. the first wall is just to protect them from harm while digging. if youre skilled at timing things and monitoring progress, you won't need to but if you have plenty of starting cash in some missions then this is a safe method. 5. do not forget to build stairs at your walls. because it is not possible to build when enemies are close and then your guys wont be able to man the walls/towers you built.6. if you build a keep, always build a bridge at it right away.7. save up the rock volley to slowly kill off enemytroop spawn posts during missions. do not use it up for anything else unless you really really need it because you would lose your lord otherwise or enemy is about to breach walls. 8. enemy knights are the biggest problem when they attack early in the game. therefore, just buy leather armour and crossbows and build crossbow archers or when low on cash u will need sligshot mercs who have strengths in great numbers.9. last but very important tip: if u wanna destroy an enemy castle, bring plenty of archers. like 50+ . and put them in a place where they can hit the enemies campfire where the peasants gather. set attack location instead of directly clicking a peasant cuz they will stop attacking when all peasants are down and hit other targets instead. this prevents them from building new troops while u are attacking, which was often the reason i lost all my troops cuz the enemy started building knights superfast and in the end i didnt have enough troops to get on top of the keep and kill the leader.10. Try to build a perimiter wall ALL AROUND buildings that involve a production chain. if it's not possible, put a big waterpot near valuable locations and station some archers that can easily kill off slaves who want to lit up your mines for example.i could give more tips, but these things i found out and used helped me through the first 14 missions fairly easy. you should figure the rest out for yourself through trial and error			"

												If you have played this game and liked it, you will probably agree that this game is just a ""QUIIIICK MARCH"" away from becomming one of the most celebrated castle builders of the early 2000's.If you haven't tried it: I highly recommend this game for anyone who wants to get into the Stronghold franchise since it's the last game before the unnecessary micromanaging started, making you responsible for your citizens crap being placed in a pile rather than right in front of their door(I'm not kidding).Finally, if you have tried it didn't like it(or hated it), why did you bother reading this review?

												What’s not to love about building your own castle and slaying all who oppose you with Crusaders. The only bad thing that I can say about Stronghold Crusader is that you have to use Game Ranger to play Multiplayer instead of the in game Multiplayer. However playing Skirmish on your own is just as much fun. One of the best RTS’ that I have played, I highly recommend that you add this game to your cart immediately.			"

												Stronghold Crusader is a castle building simulator that combines warfare,economy and siege mecahnics .While original game had more focus on single player experiance this game replaces story telling with skirmish campaign .Overall this is improvment on the Stronghold 1 . It has new units,walls,characters and more responsive gameplay.Despite not having story this game is held up by the charismatic Lords whom you will fight through 50 crusader missions .One really cool thing about this game is the AI players . For artifical players they sure build interesting castles and can be pretty nasty opponents on hard diffeculty .Its near a perfect game which I consider a classic . "

												I had played this years ago and had hit a wall IIRC, where one of the levels I kept losing to and gave up.  So it can be challenging.It can also be a little grindy if you haven't gone through the tutorial (me) and figured out all the different units and maybe some more combined arms strategy.  ==It gets very grindy.==Basically this is Age of Empires or others from that RTS genre and timeframe, but this emphasizes the happiness mechanic by allowing bribing or taxing the people and feeding or starving them, along with other buildings that might affect happiness or fear and productivity.  Of couse once you understand the new mechanic, it's not too interesting - it translates into more buttons to push and wanting some manager to handle all that - but this is an old game.  They hadn't invented managers yet.Note: A key difference from Age of Empires is that in Stronghold, if you have enough resources for <whatever>, purchasing that creates it _instantaneously_.  There's no wait for units to churn out or buildings to build - they are there the moment you click the build button.I'm on the 6th or so level in the campain, and I have yet to build a decent ""castle-looking"" castle.  It all becomes more like a tower defense game in that regard.Voice acting is excellent, though not too varied.  There's some nice cuteness there I really like the archers and the when the knight complains if you ask him to walk all over the continent!  Hahaha :)ALSO nice surprise was the inclusion of a Stronghold Crusader ""Extreme"" add-on, which I'd never heard of until I downloaded the game.  It's apparently a set of new scenarios.			"

												Alright! Much better than the Stronghold HD which I consider totally awful for it's terrible graphics. Despite Crusader HD being not much different at the first look, this one has much nicer graphics which gives a reason enough to stay a little longer and actually learn to play some, a little obscure user interface still being a slight problem. It'd be nice that basic management tools for user interface would be more obvious for those less frequent players of the game, like the management of the game view and the required actions from player would be nice to have in text on screen in the early stages and optionally even later on. SimCity 4 is the best example of a game from this era that guides a novice through the tutorials to give a good head start to the game and keeps palyer in its thight grip further the game continues. Will likely give Crusader a proper chance at some point.Addendum: the Stonghold Crusader Extreme HD side product didn't seem as interesting as I was looking for just a builder game. It too has a building side to it, but the game itself is intended for more action driven multiplayer sessions. Also the map builder had some glitchy graphics to it that I found alienating which I didn't recognise in the main game. Have I bought SCE HD alone would have been much disappointed, but now it just takes a little extra space on my disk unless I decide to doze it. Do you still find active servers for this old game, beats me, but if you're into that kind of stuff you'll probably seek company to make it happen.			"

I have 200+ hours in this one and its not just because im a die-hard fan (though i am), there are 95+ missions in game with a good amount of AI with varying difficulty. Also includes a map editor for you to make your own maps and seige missions. If new to stronghold, it has a realistic economic system for your castle to thrive (ex.- need crossbow men? frist you need a cow farm, then a tanner who takes the cows for the hide armor, then you need the crossbow its self to be made from a flecher and both craftables placed in the armory).

												I have been playing Stronghold Crusader since it´s been released and i am always coming back. This game is brilliant, there is incredible amount of thought in this game, you can play for years and always discover new strategies, new tactics...But for those who are about to decide whether or not to buy it, i say - just do it. Game´s cost is bargain in comparrison to hours of excitement it can bring you with building your own castle and defeating your enemies.			"

												Stronghold Crusader had the best gameplay in the entire series, but the graphics were getting a little bit outdated after a decade. This HD re-release makes it look good enough to last another decade. Don't expect fancy 3D graphics, this is old-school isometric 2.5D.The gameplay is solid. There are tutorials to teach you the basics and there are two ""crusader trails"" with about 50 missions each to give you a lot of different scenarios to play through. There are also campaigns with a story to them. You play as a lord in the time of the crusades. You start with a small manor and a hand full of troops and there are enemies who want you dead. Build farms to grow food to keep your population alive. Gather resources such as wood, stone and metal. Build up a castle wall-by-wall according to your own design. Put down towers of different shapes and sizes: small tall towers to give your archers extra range, and big lower towers on which you can mount siege weapons. Have your population craft weapons to train soldiers or hire mercenaries with gold. Then try to invade your enemies' castles. Build catapults to destroy their walls, or use siege ladders to get your archers on their walls to turn their safe castle into a slaughterhouse. Beware of hidden traps like spike pits and burning oil.Skirmish mode allows you to pick from a few dozen maps, some balanced and some unbalanced. Want to play 4 vs 4 on a balanced map? Want a real challenge, then pick an unbalanced map and stack the odds against you. The AI does not have traditional difficulty levels, but there are a number of AI personalities that have their own strategy. Fighting against the Caliph means you have to be prepared dirty tricks like waves of slaves trying to burn down your farms, and fire arrow archers trying to set the ground on fire when you try to take his castle. King Richard attacks with honor and superior force using siege weapons and heavily armored units. The Sultan is a dreamer who focuses more on building an economy than training a superior army. The Snake thows large numbers of archers and spearmen at you, favoring quantity over quality.			"

												After completing Stronghold Crusader, I purchased Stronghold Crusader 2 but have been quite dissapointed with the gameplay. FireFly studios have tried their best to appeal to the die hard fans of the series as well as use graphics to appeal to new customers... hence why I ended up coming back and Purchasing the HD edition of the original as this way I get an extra 30 missions to play for a small price which I would reccomend for any fan of the series.

												Easily my favorite childhood game and I cannot wait until the second one comes out. You can easily spend 500+ hours in this game as every game is different. There are a ton of maps varrying from 2 to 8 players. There is about 10 enemies that you can change the difficulty of. You can change how the teams work. its possible to make it 7 friendlies verse one baddy or 7 baddies against you.If you love strategy games, this is a must have!			"

												First off, the game is great. There's no denying that. But is this version worth buying? It requires third party software to be played online, it's not compatible with the steam overlay, it's basically the same thing you might get from GOG, except it automatically installs gameranger without even letting you choose any of the options.Both GOG and steam are the same version, except one has to be downloaded through a client, and the other only uses an un-intrusive installer. Get the GOG, or hell, even pirate it, and you'll get the same thing. Basically don't expect anything re-vamped like in other HD remakes, all you get is the possibility of running the same old game at with a higher resolutions.It's your choice if you want to buy it on steam either way, but I'd recommend to try elsewhere.

												If you love this series already, go for it. The HD version makes those old graphics truly enjoyable to play on modern screens, and you already know the rest. My lack of recommendation comes from the perspective of someone who enjoys old RTS games, but had never played anything in this series. Stronghold Crusader has great concepts such as the economy and popularity systems. I'm guessing those features, innovative for their time and still rare in later games, are among the reasons this game garnered such a huge following. However, the UI and combat are stuck in the mid-90s era of clunkiness and extreme simplicity, and I for one simply can't get past those shortcomings.			"

												As much as I want to love this game, especially as someone who used to play the old Stronghold Crusader during my childhood for a long time, I can't ignore the issues I have with this game:- a screen which continously flickers anything else I have openend at the same time that isn't minimized- the old ui, without any upscaling to modern resolutions, making everything super small, the minimap uttterly useless and some really loveless added bar on the side of the buildings menu, which pointlessly obstructs the view and feels utterly pointless- I can NOT tab out. If I try and try to tab back into the game it won't open again and I need to close it and start anewThat being said I still enjoy playing it, but those issues are very annoying and while I bought thise game during the summer sale for 2 € I still feel ripped off.

												Back in its days, it used to be a good game; good fun, smart games - the Stronghold series marked an important step in the evolution of the genre. Take it from someone who is old enough to have played the first Stronghold back when it was published.However, what I'm asked to review here is not the Crusader that came out many years ago; it is instead the HD Steam version.If you already own the original game, this won't offer you anything more.If you have never played it before, you might not appreciate it, because time has not been kind to it, and the HD title is quite misguiding: while it may be true that the game will start on a widescreen and on high resolutions without making your PC explode, it is also true that once you are playing it, the difference in definition from the original is basically non-existant.Considering that it is a milestone and it comes really cheap, especially on sale, it might be worth giving a try; however, history never turns back, and you will never appreciate it as much as you would have back when it was brand new.

This is primarily a problem from the side of developers. They are just lazy to make multiplayer through steam. If you want to play singleplayer definitetly recomended. but when you want to play with friends and have bad internet: well, no.			"

												When I purchased Stronghold HD, Stronghold Crusader HD came bundled with it and since I loved the original (my review of Stronghold HD can be found here), I had high hopes of it. The original was a great and unique combination of a castle/city builder and siege-simulator and this game is no different, basically the same game all over again, except that it's not that great anymore. The game feels like an expansion to the original game and not a sequel, mostly because it uses shamelessly everything from Stronghold HD, which wouldn't necessarily be a problem, but it remains inferior to the original in almost every aspect. The milieu is the (not so) vast deserts of the Middle East in the Holy Land mostly during the Third Crusade. The so called historical campaigns are separated from each other and seem rather inconsistent, so there's hardly a plot which makes the single player game unsatisfying. The skirmish missions are even less entertaining, so those don't help the game either. There's also an expansion called Stronghold Crusader Extreme HD, which is super disappointing and all it does that it allows the player to set custom games (which we can do in the main game as well) under extreme conditions and fight multiple opponents at the same time who tend to start with more resources than us... I managed to beat 2 at the same time, but it was a very poor experience, reminding me of old-school 'real-time strategy' games that functioned like meat grinders, where you train more and more troops and just unleash them on your enemies. Some 'strategy'...The main difference between the original game and this one is mainly the environment: instead of the beautiful English forestry, we get to play in deserts. It makes the game harder because now anything can catch fire and that introduces the only (!) new building (the other new one is basically a tent): the well. Yes, we can only put out the randomly appearing fires using wells (or instead of several small ones just one big well). Of course the wells also require workforce, so it is vital to have a few extra peasants. Naturally wells can't prevent the occurrence of fires, so the building on fire is going to take damage and if it's the armoury full of weapons... well, we're in trouble. The other factor is the oasis, which is the only suitable area we can build food production buildings on and needless to say, their size is quite limited. At least the oasis makes the game harder in a good way (requiring careful planning), as opposed to the random fire occurrences.In a few missions we can play the Muslim side, but these are commando missions (can't train units, have to make do with the given ones) only, so we can forget about larger sieges, the main strength of Stronghold. Of course there is sense in the Muslims having no buildings: they should look different than the ones the crusaders have... By the way the crusaders do have Middle-Eastern looking buildings which is a bit strange, but at this point it's really just one of the smaller problems.There are Arabian soldiers, mercenaries we can hire from the previously mentioned tents, for gold (instead of resources). This is an interesting formula as it can speed up the process of training quite a bit, but again, it can turn the game into grindfests at the expense of sieges. The new soldiers are fun (the slingers are fast and cheap but are weak and can attack at short range, the horse archers have great range and are very fast, but expensive and not as accurate as the normal archers), but they are mostly reused versions of the already existing units with readjusted strengths, except slaves (super cheap and weak units who can set buildings on fire) and the assassins (can climb walls and open castle gates). The assassin does have potential and can make a siege more interesting and a bit easier for the attacker. There's also a new fire ballista, a perfect tool for decimating defending archers on towers and it's also a welcome addtion to the attacking side.Some issues that were in the original are also present here: the transparency of the buildings is still a problem when rotating the map and trying to rebuild certain sections of the castle wall and the lack of hotkeys is fatal in the fast paced matches when trying to vanquish multiple opponents. The voices of the peasants are still provided by the same person, which was fun at frist, in Stronghold HD, but this time it's obviously budget related.Stronghold Crusader HD is obviously a letdown, not mainly because it feels like an expansion, but because it seems like a rather cheap duplicate of the great original. The new setting with all its accessories is a setback and the developer must have also felt the absence of the evil characters of the first game, because in the last mission we can meet them again (don't ask).You might think, ""what is this guy talking about, this game isn't that bad"" and you might be right, but if you played the original (and you really should have) you'll see how bad it is in comparison.Accordingly I can't recommend Stronghold Crusader HD to anyone: not to newcomers and especially not to fans of the original. If you want to experience a good siege just load up Stronghold HD again. PROS+ some useful additions and readjustments to the game+ last mission is challengingCONS- less emphasis on castle sieges- issues from the original are still present- campaign is not as enjoyable as the one in the original- feels like an expansion rather than a sequel- cheap ways to make the game harderRATING3/10			"

												if youre a serious strategy fan this game will ruin youre experience. its like comparing atari to playstation 3 theres way better games out there even knowing i paid 4 dollars i feel i wasted it, quickly this games becomes repetitive and boring, i dont usually say bad things about strategy games but this one did it theres no fun to it, unless your very young, battles are crappy so are the visuals, i wouldnt even call this strategy.  unless you love ATARI  in this day of age dont get this there are games free to play way better then this.... don't be fooled by positive rewievs its the developers and people trying to push sale on you...

												Overall I'm disappointed with this game.I love the idea, build your castle and army, and attack the other one, great concept.Then I started the game, struggled through the first senario, and stuck on the 2nd.The problem is the lack of a tutorial.My people leave, and I don't know why, and I don't know how to get them back.

												One of the games that sparked my love for pc gaming. Stronghold Crusader HD, is a familiar feel from the original Stronghold. Improving on everything, while keeping in tact all the things you loved about the first. The game is fun played online, although more popular still online in Europe, than the US. Great campaign that allows you to travel from foe to foe, increase difficulty as you go. Or if you just enjoy building, castle building to build the perfect castle. I love this game, and it still is one of my favorites.			"

												Ah, Stronghold Crusader. I remember this game when I was maybe......6?This game really brings back memories with the floppy disk games.Anyway lets review!Note: Buying the game will also include Stronghold Crusader Extreme but that is so terrible so I wont review it.THE GAMEStronghold Crusader HD is a castle sim with I think 4 modes.Career/Story: Really just a set of tutorials and starting battles to get you ready to play the all grand skirmish mode(I think thats what its called) but never the less it can be fun but only sometimes.Skirmish/Battle: This is probably what makes this game grand. It puts you in a screen where you decide things like the map, how many players fight, where they fight, difficulty, starting money, etc. Then you start building a castle and an army to help you crush the other players while not getting recked yourself. THIS IS WHAT YOU GET THE GAME FOR. I bet it would be fun in MP but none of my friends have it :(Castle Builder- Just the mode if you want to build a huge castle, no enemies just you, your people, and that annoying flippin guide. (WHY?)Multiplayer- If someone wants to add me to play this mode please do ;_;AUDIOThe game has solid voice acting from every character and they talk to you at the right times sometimes indicating how you should prepare, like telling you ""youre kingdom will get crushed"" could indicating that they're lanuching an assault at you. The fighting audio is good but the people getting hit by arrows sounds like there coughing and screaming. Your castle based on how many people actually work it gets more or less chattery and theres less sounds of nature. The only REALLY bad voice acting is your guide, he doesnt change his accent when you change to like a british guy and his voice is just annoying but funny to abuse sometimes. Audio-8/10GAMEPLAYWell as I explained in the modes section you are usually fighting other players, but most of the time youre trying to get people in your kingdom and keep them in your kingdom by maintaning food, taxes, and atractions for your people (like a dancing bear strapped to a pole wtf). Gameplay 9/10STORYLINEI really dont think i should rate this but I will. The game yes has a story mode but it's mostly a tutorial with basic battles. The games story really comes mostly from the gameplay. Think of games like dota 2, CSGO, and TF2 mostly the story comes out of what you do and see, not whats told. Storyline 7/10GraphicsThe graphics would obvioulsy be outdated for a game as old as this but you can see whats going on and not feel like you cant see what that means or indicates. Pretty solid graphics if you look at its age. Im gonna count the score as if I was rating this in the year this was released. Graphics 10/10AI  Since this is what most people have to play with ill make a section for it. As I stated in audio the AI will give you hints about whats about to happen but it might not always happen, making them pretty clever enemies. Each king has a different tactic. Some  build the castle a lot others go and start buiding an army, and some also try to build up they're economy so they could buy troops late game. But each kind changes his tactic depending on what he sees so the AI is different every time.  It could use polishing sometimes though. AI 9/10REPLAYABILITYAs I just said the AI's tactic always changes so you never have the same game twice. Also there are TONS of different maps. By tons I mean like 30 maps each ranging on how many maximum players there can be and I think you are able to get more maps (IDK though). Replayability 10/10VERDICTStronghold Crusader's 10$ price tag is well worth it for such and old and polished game like this.FINAL RATING: 8.6/10 "

Pros:-Stronghold perfected-In depth economic system-Rebalanced religion and ale mechanics (religion is no longer wildly overpriced for the benefit given)-Multitudes of new units, including arabic units that need only gold, and monks that can be trained at the cathedral-Wide variety of maps and play scenarios-Challenging, fun campaign mode-Computer opponents are widely varied, memorable, and fun to fight-Active online community-Massive replayabilityCons:-No plot; campaign is just premade skirmishes-No fast-forward optionOverall: This is it.  This is the best stronghold game.  Everything after, while sometimes good, failed to measure up.  And Stronghold 1, while perfectly fine, didn't have the added depth this game has.  While this game lacks a proper story mode, it focuses on what there really is to love about this game - the gameplay.  There's a main campaign which consists of 50 skirmish matches against progressively harder scenarios, and another 20 in the ""expansion"" that comes included with the HD version.There are a multitude of different computer opponents to fight as well, and they can range from comically inept to frighteningly capable.  Maps have a wide range of setups, from the vanilla ""everyone starts with the same basic setup and resources"" to the maps which have no farmable land, to the maps that give one player every resource and all the others very few at all.  The game is fun, and there are so many different ways to play that it will continue to challenge and entertain you.One of the only real downsides is that there are still times when you watch and wait as your economy chugs along and your opponent builds his army, and there's just nothing for you to do but wait.  Firefly did a good job of reducing that so it isn't as stark and noticeable as it was in Stronghold 1, but it still happens.  A fast forward option would have been nice.  Even more so if you like using swordsmen in sieges - you will legit wait five to ten minutes for them to get from your stronghold to the other guy's stronghold.  Still, this is a very minor complaint in an otherwise flawless game.There's a strong online community creating more maps and scenarios that can be downloaded and played.  The addition of the arabic units with all their unique traits gives Crusader even more depth than before, and really just rounds out an already fantastic game.  This is one of those games I've kept coming back to over the years, and probably will continue to do so for another decade.Bottom Line: Absolute recommend			"

												Though i have little hours on steam with this game i have played 100 hours of this game outside steam.Stronghold Crusader is a magnificent game as you have probably read from the other reviews. However, there is some key aspects to the game as in some game changing exploits that need to be made clear. Before you buy this game intending to pummel some people online into the ground i have come across a few exploits that unfortunately break the game.EXPLOITS ~~~ The exploits I'm about to talk about refer to the ""sleep"" mode given at every work space that your workers use. This sleep or making your workers redundant mode can be clicked with excessive speed. if you turn it on then off, the redundant mode (which is suppose to make your workers turn into peasants again) will pause your workers for a second then continue working, whilst more peasants turn into more workers which creates two workers for every one work space in stead of just one worker. this is known and duplicating your workers. this basically doubles your production rate which basically doubles your power. GG easy. (this was hard to explain)The second and most destructive (maybe not an exploit) ""way of thinking"" is to do with the redundant mode again. (making your workers turn back into peasants). After vsing someone online that i saw do this to me (and after commending him with his efforts after he butt ♥♥♥♥♥ me like a mad man) you are able to mass create an army using work spaces that require many peasants such as 'mills'. These mills hold 3 boys that take wheat and turn them into flour bags. But if you make 30 mills or so, over time your peasants will turn into these boys until all mills have work. Congratulations now hit the redundant button and gain your self 90 peasants instantaneously +24 peasants max cap at the castle. now i simply create 114 men then simple turn back off the redundant mode and start creating more boys for the mills. This way of working basically is a work around the max cap of 24 peasants at your castle, by simply turning your peasants into workers (for more holding space) then turning them back into peasants for mass production.After seeing my enemy have 500 horse archers and 35 catapults within 20 minutes of the game i could not get even close with anyone as 35 flying rocks also kills an army very fast let alone walls.Depressing as this was this is the reason why mills are so expensive in Stronghold Crusader 2 which is am SO THANKFUL FOR.Stronghold crusader is a great game but there is a glitich or two or a clever way of thinking that over powers the rest.I just want everyone to realise that this game has its issues that wont be fixed as the game is old but b4 you buy try to to cheat plz..... my butt is still sore. (multiplayer uses external program called 'game ranger' that is automatically installed - steam servers are not used)			"

												Look, i know that i have almost no hours played on this game on steam as it says... But, it doesn´t show how many time i´ve played it before buying it on steam... I just can think that it´s about >4k hours... I can really talk about this game, because i´ve played it almost nonstop... It´s the goldest game for me. For me, it´s the best game that i´ve played. No ♥♥♥♥ing dlcs, no graphics ♥♥♥♥, no big requirments for running game, just as before, installing, looking forward for teamwork, setting up LAN and playing with brother and other friends... Sometime back, the one of the best thing for me was installing the game, looking at every character at installing, but now ? <10 seconds and game is installed :D Nevermind, just had to buy it, because it´s fantastic game. Strategy, logic, teamwork... And what about cons ? Pff, no, please... Only one con is for me, that Exit button doesn´t work for me :)			"

												This game offers hours of fun.  I started playing this back in 2005 and haven't stopped since.  There are so many ways to build your castle, economy, and army.  With all this variety, you can play for hours.  I would recommend this game to everyone who loves a good rts/castle sim.			"

Pros:-Stronghold perfected-In depth economic system-Rebalanced religion and ale mechanics (religion is no longer wildly overpriced for the benefit given)-Multitudes of new units, including arabic units that need only gold, and monks that can be trained at the cathedral-Wide variety of maps and play scenarios-Challenging, fun campaign mode-Computer opponents are widely varied, memorable, and fun to fight-Active online community-Massive replayabilityCons:-No plot; campaign is just premade skirmishes-No fast-forward optionOverall: This is it.  This is the best stronghold game.  Everything after, while sometimes good, failed to measure up.  And Stronghold 1, while perfectly fine, didn't have the added depth this game has.  While this game lacks a proper story mode, it focuses on what there really is to love about this game - the gameplay.  There's a main campaign which consists of 50 skirmish matches against progressively harder scenarios, and another 20 in the ""expansion"" that comes included with the HD version.There are a multitude of different computer opponents to fight as well, and they can range from comically inept to frighteningly capable.  Maps have a wide range of setups, from the vanilla ""everyone starts with the same basic setup and resources"" to the maps which have no farmable land, to the maps that give one player every resource and all the others very few at all.  The game is fun, and there are so many different ways to play that it will continue to challenge and entertain you.One of the only real downsides is that there are still times when you watch and wait as your economy chugs along and your opponent builds his army, and there's just nothing for you to do but wait.  Firefly did a good job of reducing that so it isn't as stark and noticeable as it was in Stronghold 1, but it still happens.  A fast forward option would have been nice.  Even more so if you like using swordsmen in sieges - you will legit wait five to ten minutes for them to get from your stronghold to the other guy's stronghold.  Still, this is a very minor complaint in an otherwise flawless game.There's a strong online community creating more maps and scenarios that can be downloaded and played.  The addition of the arabic units with all their unique traits gives Crusader even more depth than before, and really just rounds out an already fantastic game.  This is one of those games I've kept coming back to over the years, and probably will continue to do so for another decade.Bottom Line: Absolute recommend			"

												One of the best RTS games I have ever had the pleasure of playing! I first played this on DVD back in 2005, and It was my favourite game. Now it has been remastered in HD and with new characters! The skirmish mode in Crusader makes gameplay a lot more fast-paced and exciting. There are also lots of enjoyable little details, such as your peasant's dialogue, to communication between your fellow lords. It gives the characters a personality which is hard to find in Stronghold's later installments.Stronghold Crusader Extreme is also very viable, as the troop limits are past 400, not to mention the new abilities that are available to spice up combat.I would rate Stronghold Crusader a 9/10. (This game was released in 2004, but the graphics are still amazing to me.)There are little bugs here and there, but overall, it's a very sound game and if it's ever on sale, be sure to consider it!Pikemen are my favourite unit, not only do they have a sweet accent, but they are very tanky and can dig moats!

												One of the games that sparked my love for pc gaming. Stronghold Crusader HD, is a familiar feel from the original Stronghold. Improving on everything, while keeping in tact all the things you loved about the first. The game is fun played online, although more popular still online in Europe, than the US. Great campaign that allows you to travel from foe to foe, increase difficulty as you go. Or if you just enjoy building, castle building to build the perfect castle. I love this game, and it still is one of my favorites.			"

												Back before Steam I bought this game 4 times. played it so damn much i wore out the disk, every chance i got i would share this game with my friends, either giving them an extra copy, or reccomending they buy it. 250 hours alone on steam doesn't nearly count towards my total time over the past 10 years. the amount of humour put into the dialogue of characters, with the cheesy cgi, and the somewhat sassy match narrator, the incredibly memorable music, the seemingly endless campaign map, the nearly overwhelming odds in the later missions, the great map editor, the variety of Ai designed castles, with various schemes and unit themes set to their playstyle, all of this adds up to one of the most solidly memorable, and always revisitable strategy/building sims ever made. its a joyous ride for someone who enjoys min-maxing, equally as much as someone who enjoys relaxed building. Under 10$, and on sale for $2.50 is an absolute steal.			"

												In my opinion one of the best strategy games of all time. You have normous ways to cripple the foes economy through seige, fire, and disease, ""here comes the cow!."" Numbers do not win in this game, a decent defense can be more powerful than a large offense. One word Market! You will find this build is key to winning a game more so than any RTS youve ever played.One bonus is this game has a very great design where you dont focus on all the micro management, your role is to command the soilders and build a well thought out base that can withstand the many types of seiges. One mistake can end you : )EXTREME MODE: same as above but soley based on war and little defense tactics like buring everyone alive and choke points. Fun with friends but the standard Crusader is more challengeing			"

												The year is 1100 AD, and I'm a noble knight fighting my way across the Holy Lands. Although, I myself can't take on my foes alone, and all I brought with me into the desert are a couple loyal peasents, a handful of bricks, and some coins. What do I do? I build a castle, that's what. Stronghold Crusader HD is an old school RTS that focuses mainly on building and maintaining a thriving castle of your very own, and then using said castle and whoever is inside to crush your opponents. It's pretty much Age of Empires meets Total War, which is a combination that I never though could be possible. If you like strategy games but wish there was more of a creative aspect to your base-building and resource-gathering, then this is well worth your gold pieces.			"

												Essentially a tower defence game and still one of the best tower defence/strategy game you will ever play! Resource management, defence management, offensive tactics got it all rapped in lovely medieval package. AI is quite challenging as well.Upsides: Castles with moats,  gate houses with drawbridges, clever system of building units need a fletcher to make a bow/crossbow but first you need wood then you need cows for the tanner to slaughter to get the leather armour for your crossbow men interlinking economy very clever. (The little things that new strategy games dont do anymore)Did I mention Castles which you build from scratch and a pop cap of 1000 was insanity but 10K COME ON BUY IT!Downsides: If your a flid at Strategy in real life don't bother this game it will tear you a new one.

												 Well,, I am not sure if there is any 'strategy game lover' who does not know anything about this game, if there is... so hear me out because my words are for you. You are probably too young for not knowing this game because all  20's generation strategy gamers  know this game.               Do you know the kind of games that you do not care how old it is and bad the graphics are according to the newest one? This is one of them that you will not care at all. I have been playing this game for about 8 years now and i still love the joy this game gives to me. And i often find myself in desire for playing it time to time. It is the kind of addiction that this game leaves on you.              Stronghold franshice has 4 or 5 games, Sronghold Crusader is the second one and truelly the best one. You may hear that from every Stronghold players. Everything about the game is unique and beautiful, the  way you build your castle is totally up to you which lets you to build strong castles against your enemies. While in this rush for building your castle and fighting against your enemies game's soundtracks will help you to relax. This game has amazing soundtracks that will give you the opportunity to experience the eastern musical instruments fascinating and exotic sound.              If you do not know about this game and love the games like tycoon/strategy please make yourself a favour and get this game. You will like it. Do not let the idea to discouarge you of how old this game looks and how bad the graphics may look "

												Stronghold Crusader, one of my favorite RTS games of my childhood. It has some of the best AI characters, despite their seemingly awful decision making when it comes to trading. It also has a pleasing graphic style that despite its age looks great, and even better in HD. The game's style is not only tied to it graphics, but to its AI and even its UI. The game gives you useful information through an advisor who also displays your favor. The advisor's voice is not annoying and I still remember his voice. The game is a gem and I can't recommend it enough and the HD upgrade looks great. (Note: It is only a resoultion upgrade, not a texture one.)The Good: AI Personalities                  Voice Acting *(The ham adds to the charm)                  Graphical Style                  Music                  UI                  Game Mechanics                  Great SingleplayerThe Meh: AI Difficulty The Bad: No Steam OverlayOverall: 8/10 Would recommend and remember always, Wood Needed.(Update #1 - Steam Overlay)			"

												Of all the stronghold titles I found this to be my favourite and probably the easiest to get into. I could never really bond with the other titles like I do with this one. Its great seeing it in HD. You also have the option of installing the extreme version which will literally let you have thousands of units on the battlefield as opposed to hundreds with the standard edition.There is tons to keep you occupied in this game from historial campaigns to your own customised game setup.It may look a bit dated now but it runs like silk on todays modern computers.

												This has been a long time coming. SC is one game I have loved from day one. For the first time I played a game that was so complicated it took me a few days to master the economy. I had dreamed of a game like this since I played Warcraft as a small child. A game so realistic you actually had to gather raw materials it was a dream come true. Games have come and gone but SC always remained it was the only game that continued to hold my interest through the years. Even my friends got hooked and my wife who is by no means a gamer. The graphics were subpar even for the time but the gameplay was so entertaining it didn't matter. The attention to detail was beyond compare the concept of citizens you could not control was genius. Every building was bustling with people doing work and sounds of every trade rang out in a crowded village square. I developed many working strategies over the years it was as if there really were no rules. You were limited only by what crazy attack you could think up and how well you executed it. But it wasn't just the gameplay that was exceptional the programming was amazing. The 2D drawing of 3D objects made the game tiny and playable on the oldest computers. I used to carry a copy in my mp3 player so I could play anywhere. It worked on any network without any errors ever seriously in 12 years! I swear this game would run over two tin cans on a string. At some LAN parties we didn't even bother setting up a network we just plugged all the computers into a hub and SC would work even when windows didn't show any other network locations. I still play my original copy and have only encountered a few glitches. I wish they would just remake this game with top of the line graphics. I'll be playing this game till the day I die -SEF			"

												Stronghold Crusader mixes castle building, RTS, and resource management. The campaign will teach you most of the things from resource gathering, building and defending your castle, to sieging the enemy and defending your castle. Stronghold Crusader has 16 AI lords, each lord has different strategies and difficulties. They also have a different castle builds and troop choices. You can choose to use Arab or European troops or even all together. The extreme edition is a faster paced version of the game that you can play separately from the original game.Stronghold Crusader is one of my favorite RTS games. It is very similar to its predecessor, Stronghold, but it has more content than Stronghold. I first played it since 2007 and bought the steam version recently. It was one of the best and most addicting game I played back then. The game is quite simple when you get the hang of it. The gameplay is still great till this day, even though the game was from 2001. And I really like the HD addition to the game, the max resolution used to be 1024x768 and after the HD addition you can play with almost any resolution. The AI is also quite challenging. The skirmish mode and custom games will add many hours to the game. The soundtrack for Stronghold Crusader is fantastic. I really like the soundtrack of this game. The voice acting is kinda bad, but it really fits with the game somehow. I really like how Arabian units speak Arabic. The integration with Steam Cloud is one of the reasons I bought the Steam version of the game.However, Stronghold Crusader has a minor flaw. The lack of Steam overlay. You can't chat with friends without alt-tabbing and you can't take screenshots via Steam too.In conclusion, even though the game looks outdated, it truly withstood the test of time. Stronghold Crusader is still a very good game and will give hours of fun. I really recommend this game.			"

												Stronghold crusader will in my mind, always be one of the best games of all time. With its humble,vindicitve, or even annoying AI charecters each match has the chance to present a new challenge. Wether it is the wolf building his fortresses that take 30 minutes to destroy with catapults or the caliph constantly torching your goods.Pros:70+ maps that will take hours to complete. The satisfaction you get when you complete the trail is great.Good simulation - You handle the basic necessities of your people and don't have to do silly redundant stuff.Rememberable and Challengeing AI. On occasion my friends and i will say a quote from them, and all of us still chuckle.Peacefull map modes for those who wish to just watch thier empire strech across the entire map.Easy to use interface that allows you to build your castle, wether it is collapsing the map height to the ground or rotating the screen in just a mouse click.Did i mention CASTLES? Build your castle huge, small or not at all. Be  the lord you want to be.Graphics are really quite good for a dated game.( Over ten years ago) i still tolerate them, and i won't play minecraft because of its graphics. Cons:Kinda meh online multiplayer, it comes with a 3rd party client called game ranger that has a pretty decent sized community. But the games can be laggy/choppy depending on who you're connected to.Can't place that there my lord.Overall, i would recommend this game to any Castle Sim/RTS fanatic. A great game, which in my childhood i probably have over 1000k hours in. Watch your back future knights, don't trust the Caliph. "

												I am so very happy that I rolled the dice and bought this game.  I love stratagy games and this one is a peach.  That it was on sale at the time only makes me all the more happy.  In truth, I'd recommend the game at the current full price of ten bucks.  I think I'll be playing this one for a good long time.There is a steep learning curve and I got pretty frustrated at first.  I'd suggest you watch a play through or two if you don't like getting stomped.  The AI isn't the brightest, at least not on the earliest missions (the ones I'm on as of this review), but that's probably for the best.  I'm sure I'd have given up otherwise.			"

												Used to play this game like 4 years ago on a Dell pc, now I bought it with 70% discount (€2,-) and it feels so great to play this game again! The HD really stands for itsself; the sounds sounds better, the graphics look better and it still feels like you are really the lord of a castle! For me all my childhood memories are comming back to life because of this game.The only this that i could say is: ''Really great game! You start playing and you're day is already over if you stop. The only thing that bothers me is that there are no extra lords/enemies to play against and no extra maps, the only thing that changed are the sounds and graphics.'' But the rest of the game is still as good as it was back in the days!Recommended! 8,9/10ThatSoda "

												This is probably one of my favorite strategy games of all time. It isn't that hard to pick up, but mastering requires planning and flexability, especially when dealing with opponents looking to disrupt the workings of your meticiously crafted castle. Luckily, it isn't too overwhelming unlike later entries in the series. It would be a great game for multiplayer if only I could figure how it works.10/10			"

												This game is perhaps overlooked by most people these days, considering there are others out there, like StarCraft, Age of Empires, Civilization, and plenty of lesser known RTS games.Yet, this game has a certain charm to it that I think can't be found anywhere else. It's set in the Arabic desert, where you must fight for survival by mastering as many factors as you can, including some staple RTS features, like economics, resources, troops, and workers. This game also features two main ways to determine whether you succeed or not. This comes in the form of managing how much gold you have to buy troops, and how much food you have collected. Running out of food will cause your castle to start losing happiness, and people will begin to leave if it gets below halfway.Since the food plays a major role in your economy, lacking it presents a severe problem of unbalanced gameplay; people won't be able to keep your economy going if they leave, which means that, if you don't have enough gold to buy food, you're basically doomed. You can't buy troops since you don't have gold, and if, by some chance, you happen to be out of other supplies, it's best to give up if you don't have any allies. Even then, the allies aren't guaranteed to help you, especially if they're A.I players.This is where the unbalanced issue comes into place, because not everyone is good at managing their economy, and pitting people with little to no sense of economics against people who do know means that the latter are going to win. Every single time.This is still a great game, though.  If you are willing to learn how to manage economics, I recommend this game.			"

												Stronghold Crusader, war damals mit eines der Ersten Spiele, die ich sehr aktiv gespielt habe und heute mag ich das Spiel nach wie vor immer noch sehr gerne. Auch wenn die Grafik ein wenig veraltet scheint ist es einfach ein Klassiker und macht auch mit dieser Grafik viel mehr Spaß als die ganzen viel neueren Teilen mit der angeblich besseren Grafik. Das Spiel bietet für jeden etwas. Man kann zum Beispiel, wenn man nicht so auf die aktiven Schlachten steht seine eigene Burg bauen ohne feindliche Angriffe oder ein eigenes Szenario erstellen, welches man an andere Spieler schicken kann, welche sich dann an Eurem Szenario versuchen können. Selbstverständlich bietet dieses Spiel auch zwei Kampagnen durch welche man sich durch kämpfen kann, wobei der Schwierigkeitsgrad immer wieder auf eine höhere Stufe gestellt wird und man lernen muss beispielsweise nur durch den Steinabbau seine Burg finanzieren kann. Außerdem sind auch vier Szenarien aus der Geschichte eingebaut worden, welche auf mehrere kleine Szenarien aufgeteilt wurden.Für Anfänger wird es wahrscheinlich sehr hilfreich sein erstmal schnelle Spiele zu starten, in denen man entscheiden kann inwiefern man einen Vorteil oder Nachteil gegenüber den anderen Spielern beziehungsweise Computer Gegnern erhalten soll.Das Spiel stellt zusätzlich noch eine Möglichkeit bereit im Multiplayer gegeneinander spielen zu können. Hierbei empfiehlt es sich in einem lokalen Netzwerk zu spielen, da man über Hamachi mit vielen Verzögerungen rechnen muss.Insgesamt aber würde ich dieses Spiel jedem empfehlen, der Interesse am Mittelalter hat und auf Strategie- Spiele steht. Für Jemanden, der sich mehr um die Grafik schert, wird dieses Spiel nicht das Beste sein, weil es nun auch schon ein paar Jahre auf den Buckel hat. Sollte dies der Fall sein empfiehlen sich eher Stronghold Crusader 2 oder auch Stronghold 3 oder vielleicht auch Stronghold 2 und Legends. "

												I spend a lot of time with this game in my childhood. Firstly, I think Stronghold Crusader HD has a deep mechanic. You must check your people's happiness, solve food issues, build good castle against large attacks. They are good sides of the game. But AI is really bad. You can easily win 1v4. Also, sometimes your teammates can occupy your main base with their buildings and this can be very annoying. But with all this bad sides, Stronghold deserves to be bought.			"

												Great addition to the stronghold series!  Smooth running gameplay,Great castle sim whether youre looking to free build or cruise your way through the campain.  Great bang for your buck!  mid range re-playability factor, as the missions stay the same the second time around, but creating custom scenarios and multiplayer are what really make this game shine.  I7 6700 quad core processor, with a radeon r9 360, runs this game like a dream!			"

												Stronghold Crusader, one of my favorite RTS games of my childhood. It has some of the best AI characters, despite their seemingly awful decision making when it comes to trading. It also has a pleasing graphic style that despite its age looks great, and even better in HD. The game's style is not only tied to it graphics, but to its AI and even its UI. The game gives you useful information through an advisor who also displays your favor. The advisor's voice is not annoying and I still remember his voice. The game is a gem and I can't recommend it enough and the HD upgrade looks great. (Note: It is only a resoultion upgrade, not a texture one.)The Good: AI Personalities                  Voice Acting *(The ham adds to the charm)                  Graphical Style                  Music                  UI                  Game Mechanics                  Great SingleplayerThe Meh: AI Difficulty The Bad: No Steam OverlayOverall: 8/10 Would recommend and remember always, Wood Needed.(Update #1 - Steam Overlay)			"

												This is probably one of the best RTS games I've played. Missions are a delicate balance between economy and defensive tactics. Unlimited troop count, castles are essentially free build, have your people love you or hate you. Great game, been playing it for years. Just got it on steam a few months ago.			"

												I am so very happy that I rolled the dice and bought this game.  I love stratagy games and this one is a peach.  That it was on sale at the time only makes me all the more happy.  In truth, I'd recommend the game at the current full price of ten bucks.  I think I'll be playing this one for a good long time.There is a steep learning curve and I got pretty frustrated at first.  I'd suggest you watch a play through or two if you don't like getting stomped.  The AI isn't the brightest, at least not on the earliest missions (the ones I'm on as of this review), but that's probably for the best.  I'm sure I'd have given up otherwise.			"

												The year is 1100 AD, and I'm a noble knight fighting my way across the Holy Lands. Although, I myself can't take on my foes alone, and all I brought with me into the desert are a couple loyal peasents, a handful of bricks, and some coins. What do I do? I build a castle, that's what. Stronghold Crusader HD is an old school RTS that focuses mainly on building and maintaining a thriving castle of your very own, and then using said castle and whoever is inside to crush your opponents. It's pretty much Age of Empires meets Total War, which is a combination that I never though could be possible. If you like strategy games but wish there was more of a creative aspect to your base-building and resource-gathering, then this is well worth your gold pieces.			"

												Essentially a tower defence game and still one of the best tower defence/strategy game you will ever play! Resource management, defence management, offensive tactics got it all rapped in lovely medieval package. AI is quite challenging as well.Upsides: Castles with moats,  gate houses with drawbridges, clever system of building units need a fletcher to make a bow/crossbow but first you need wood then you need cows for the tanner to slaughter to get the leather armour for your crossbow men interlinking economy very clever. (The little things that new strategy games dont do anymore)Did I mention Castles which you build from scratch and a pop cap of 1000 was insanity but 10K COME ON BUY IT!Downsides: If your a flid at Strategy in real life don't bother this game it will tear you a new one.

												Oh, the memories... Lions are attacking,my Liege! Assassins are scaling our walls,Sire! The lions have taken control over our gatehouse,Sire...My friend showed me this gem when we were about 10. Immediately fell in love with the game, cuz medieval stuff. Last year heated this up again to multi-play with friends to celebrate the end of our university years. Still a gem.PRO:+You can build huge castles+You can destroy huge castles (just need a ton of catapults)+Variety in strategy (from destroying castles in seconds with catapults, through picking off defenders one by one with clouds of arrows/darts, to single rushing in with your king because YOLO)+Burn it to the ground! (With flaming arrows and pitch, boiling oil, fire ballistas, torches... and whatever stuff is in those jars Fire Throwers throw.)+Exploit minor bugs against AI+Here comes Bessy!CON:-AI is stupid, games become easy/non-challenging after a while (I may have a few hundred hours of gameplay off-record ;))-no attack move (your units engage enemy only if they run directly into them)-Multiplayer kinda sucks. If you can rush your opponent, it's over too fast, if you can't, it'll never end.-Hidden population limit. I never really figured this out, but it seems to be around a few hundred. I want to conquer the Holy City with my Golden Horde! (gold 'n hoard,eh)...also. Wood needed!			"

												Of all the stronghold titles I found this to be my favourite and probably the easiest to get into. I could never really bond with the other titles like I do with this one. Its great seeing it in HD. You also have the option of installing the extreme version which will literally let you have thousands of units on the battlefield as opposed to hundreds with the standard edition.There is tons to keep you occupied in this game from historial campaigns to your own customised game setup.It may look a bit dated now but it runs like silk on todays modern computers.

A robust skirmish mode with a large variety of opponents and difficulties, this is a very worthy RTS game, in my opinion, despite its two-dimensions and immense age.

So when I saw that it was on sale, I thought maybe it holds up and bought it. Well, my first phrase still holds true - graphics are bad, the game is fun. Who doesn't want to build castles and attack them? Another thing: What I liked more about this game than Stronghold HD are the challenges you have. The give you something to do and force you try something new.			"

												In honor of its memory i bought it again. Still play it from time to time. I recieved this game for Christmas when it first came out, many hours where spent trying to figure out how to win and overcome situations. (Looking at you Mission 6 - with Lionheart against the Wolf..) It was an awesome game and still is.Thank you Firefly Studios for this childhood			"

												Build and siege castles. Controll and massive armies. Run a feudal economy. This is a great game in my opinion. If you enjoy rts games like Age of Empires, you will enjoy this game.			"

												Fun, even after all these years. Stronghold Crusafer might be the best in the series imo. It's well balanced and provides a lot of fun. The Scenario Builder is of particular fun for me. It's strange there haven't been more castle builders as technology has progressed.7.5/10			"

												Stronghold Crusader is a must for strategy gamers and city builders out there.I recommend buying this before you buy all the other titles that came after this particular Stronghold game. This one is the best, in my opinion, in the series. The only problem is the multiplayer. For some reason it has always been very bad. It is lags from time to time, or just stops completely. Playing in singleplayer mode is worth it though, you get so much satisfaction when you finished the campaigns!They have tried to resurrect the feeling the players got and get when playing this game with Stronghold Crusader 2, but they failed horribly. (Again, in my opinion.) This one stays the best.			"

												A legendary strategy game, even after a decade I still find it fun to play once in a while. Fun story: So I was playing this one game, as I am a good king and people loved me, all the castles children was following me around everywhere and I've decided to go for a crusade with them and show those kiddos how it's done. As I've destroyed all the enemy's defences and left only the king alive, I decided just to go 1on1 with him as real men do. So imagine the view - my king walking through all the map with massive army of children on my side and then slashing it out with the khalif. I lost though... Was kinda sad. 10/10 would do again.Wood needed!			"

												A polished up version of the greatest Stronghold game ever made, and one of my favorite RTS games of all time. If you remember this game from your childhood, this is a must buy. If not, it's still a must buy.			"
