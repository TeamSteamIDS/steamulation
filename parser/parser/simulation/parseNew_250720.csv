Starlight InceptionAhhh, The space flight sim, Freelancer, Wing Commander, Elite, classics all. More recently we've had Sol Exodus, Strike Suit Zero and Strike Vector. Now we've got Elite Dangerous and Star Citizen on the horizon. So how does Starlight Inception compare to the pack? Starlight Reception If the majority of reviews already out there are to be believed, Starlight Inception doesn't compare well at all! Following a kick-starter campaign and period of ""Early Access"" Starlight Inception saw a final release in April 2014 to a barrage of negativity. There were complaints about the controls, the graphics, the game mechanics, the campaign, pretty much everything, but was all this criticism valid? The internet is full of haters and it can be all too easy to go along with what the ""cool kids"" are saying, maybe it was just a case of internet ""bandwagoning"". Adopting a philosophy of ""You can't believe everything you read"" Let's fire the game up and take a look for ourselves!Starlight DeceptionI'm a sucker for a future time line and Starlight Inception doesn't disappoint in this regard. Upon hitting the ""play"" button we're treated to a suitably melodramatic narration of events leading from present day through the colonization of space and the rise and fall of various factions.At its end you will find yourself in 2114  stationed onboard the USF Midway and ready to earn your wings. Starlight DirectionFollowing the stirring lesson in future history the screen jumps to a static image of a ""room"" inside the USF Midway, where what I think is supposed to be a character model, sits unmoving on a seat and in his own ham-fisted way, explains his motivations as to why he joined the USF. The quality of the facial model and ""animation"" here is so bad its almost laughable and when I say ""animation"" the only thing moving here are the characters lips as he opens and closes his mouth like a fish gasping for air in a short animated loop which completely ignores the dialogue. Escape Hatch Entertainment obviously believe that lip-synching is unnecessary polish. It's at this moment that a very wooden, very Irish accent echoes through the speakers demanding that I report to the ready room. Starlight Induction I'm filled with relief as the camera drops into a first person view and I no longer have to look at the ""minecraft meets elephant man"" visage gasping at the screen. I stumble blindly around the some grey corridors until I find the ready room, which looks suspiciously like the room where Mr Voxel delivered his opening monologue. Here we're treated to another brief cinematic as we're introduced to another unsurprisingly blocky faced man (I suspect a relation) who seems to be in charge. His mouth opens and closes at random as he delivers his orders (It's like watching an old overdubbed kung-fu movie). Unnervingly I notice that his mouth continues to open and close after he's delivered his instructions and all is silent. (Due to the blocky likeness and similar mouth malfunction to our original chunky faced colleague I'm beginning to suspect there will be some inbreeding in humanities future). Anyway... He wants me to strap on a fighter and earn my wings by way of shooting some stuff, which is fine by me, so I click a button and off we go! Starlight InspectionFinally it's time to get behind the stick of a spaceship, maybe now the game will shine, this is after all what this game is all about. First impressions on launch are actually quite good, following the blocky faced potential inbreds on the Midway, the graphics now look pretty decent. The ship models are polished and the skybox is almost beautiful. I'm starting to feel better as I look out of the window of my little spaceship at the Earth shining below me. Maybe things aren't so bad after all.Starlight CorrectionI fly to some waypoints, I shoot some things. Eat your heart out Mark Hamill, I'm the wing commander now! Unfortunately, the missions themselves quickly start to feel hollow and repetitive. Point the nose of your ship at a way point, fly there, shoot some uninteresting targets that you can't really see until you're on top of them, fly to the next way point. Rinse and Repeat.It all just feels a little flat and uninspired. Starlight ObjectionThe controls can feel a little clunky at times, the physics of flight are questionable at best and the enemy AI is so woeful it brings me back to my theory about inbreeding. Everything here is functional, fly, shoot, fly, shoot. It just doesn't click with me, nothing feels satisfying. The combat is underwhelming, the campaign is mediocre, The voice acting is wooden. Like I said, everything is functional at best.Starlight Reflection... and at its best, when everything is working in its favour, Starlight Inception can reach the dizzying heights of mediocrity for whole minutes at a time. It's such a shame, I love the space combat genre and I really wanted to like this title. Whilst it's not quite as bad as some reviewers would have you believe, It is far, far away from being a good game. Unless you've got some time to kill and money to burn I would suggest that this is one to avoid. Find my full review and others LINKED HERE[www.review-well.com] "

												The awesome thing about this game so far? Due a mouse sensitivity/keyboard compatibility glitch, it's REALLY easy to get into RPing as a perpetually drunk pilot who can't find the briefing room on the ship he's stationed on.			"

												Sorry, in the current state I really can't recommend it.Honestly, I wanted to, I supported this on Kickstarter for a pretty high amount as I love the genre, however, the execution simply leaves too much to be desired.There is no such thing as a manual that even explains the most basic functions or displays.The tutorial is bad and doesn't help much either. All menus are confusing and *extremely* clunky.Total facepalms during the first few hours of gameplay: the bloody keys for rolling left and rolling right are interchanged and there is no way to reassign them; Missiles target acquisition either doesn't work or there's something about it that the tutorial or menus aren't telling me.Moving around the carrier is ship is a nice idea, but so poorly done (the controls, ouch, the controls!) and pointless (there's nothing interactive as far as I've seen) it looks like there's something planned and never implemented here.Mission design on some missions is extremely poor (waypoints keep pointing you through solid objects, pathfinding is extremely hard, waypoint triggers are like a built-in exploit)  and unfair in some, when for instance a required, completely arbitrary waypoint, you need to reach, triggers enemies, that you are then too far away from to stop from destroying your mission goal in time. Just one example. Silly, pointless, frustrating.The space combat itself is not very fun, you can play entire missions without ever seeing an enemy ship, as the enemies basically become large enough to see at 100 meters distance. That might be realistic, but it kills all dogfight feeling when you shoot almost exclusively at the center of a targeting rectangle.Targeting itself is absolutely terrible and clunky (as are most controls), as there's no way to target the nearest enemy, the nearest friendly, the nearest mission objective or your nearest attacker - as has been pretty much standard in such games 15 years ago. No, here you have to click through 37 enemies, while an unseen missile turrets keeps pounding you...Joystick support is terrible, i found no way to reasonably use my Saitek X52, but that's just a minor thing as mouse control is totally superior anyway. makes targeting so easy, it sometimes feels like a cheat in fact.I'll shelve this for now and wait for a patch or three, and may give it another go then.As it's now, extremely disappointing.

												Do not purchase this game under any circumstance.I pledged to Starlight Inception's Kickstarter campaign and deeply regret it.The graphics are underwhelming compared to contemporary entries in the genre, even relative to other indie space sims such as Wings of St. Navarre and Enemy Starfighter. A recent update to the game rendered it unplayable on my PC, killing what had been acceptable performance. I had held off playing through the campaign, believing that updates would improve the quality of the game over time. Now, I may never be able to play it.The default controls on controllers and kb/m are awkward and there is no way to reassign them. Cockpit view is functionally useless in this game. Rather than make the game more immersive, cockpit view detracts from the experience and I recommend any player to use a third person perspective during flight.The voice acting and character animation in the game are of low quality. Human models simply shouldn't have been included in the game. Botched first person controls between missions and in Exploration Mode make walking through the ship a dread.As much as I can tell, the narrative is a generic sci-fi story about conflict between humans living on/from Earth and humans from extraterrestrial colonies. The conflict mainfests as World War IV (World War III playing a role in the game's backstory) and the player fights for Earth's United Star Force. From what I understand of the exposition between missions, a military documentary on World War IV is interviewing service members about their role and lives. The story is a retelling taking place in the future ""present"" and the missions take place in the ""past.""I couldn't believe it was possible to take such a step backwards in the genre in 2014. As a space sim/shooter fan, I am deeply disappointed in Starlight Inception.			"

												Let the Buyer Beware.  I bought this game based on some of the positive reviews posted here, and I had seen that this was a Kickstarter baby.  That gave my high hopes for either something innovative or a true throw-back to Wing Commander.  In truth, this is less WC or X-Wing and more a knock-off of Strike Suit Zero...which SSZ reminded me more of those lousy Wing Commander clones you used to be able to get for the PS1.  I played the game through a Patrol mission and the first Campaign mission.  All i can say is that I really want my $20 back.  For being a game no longer in Early Access and the ""Final"" version, I encountered my first bug a few minutes in when the targeting reticle in cockpit-view mode disappears after firing the gun for a few minutes.  Also, the cockpit graphics themselves are awful, ugly and appear (IMO) to be slapped on as an afterthought.  Reinforcing this opinion is that the starfighter handles better in 3rd person mode than cockpit mode.  The VO sync with the Ready Room animation is like watching bad muppets.  I was so disgusted that by the end of the 1st campaign mission i uninstalled and was compelled to write a review.  Bottomline: lousy graphics, poor space mechanics, derivitative gameplay of shiity knock-offs of a much better game = AVOID, it's not what it claims on the tin.			"

												When i purchased it, it was in early access (didn't pay attention. Never buy early access). It is now not in early Access anymore.Few things:No options menu. Keys are not rebindable. Graphic options are What kind of window you use and dynamic lightning on or off. 1/10Trainings Mission. I didn't get past it. Not because it's hard or anything the like. It's just horrible. First of all, handling, graphics and sounds are as generic as possible. I could get over this. The targets you are supposed to destroy don't show anywhere. They, if you are lucky, pop out right in front of you. 0/10Voice acting is terribad. Nothing else to add. Not that important but i thought i should mention it.There seems to be some kind of mouse acceleration ingame. It's very clunky.Bugs. Bugs bugs bugs. Full release. -5/10Last but not least: The performance is not acceptable. A game that looks like this should never drop below 200 fps on anything. Sadly it does. It flickers, it has horrible draw distance and the graphical fidelity is.. indie. Maybe the only thing to say about it. TL;DR: Don't buy it. Unless it's on sale. Not for full prize. Never.			"

 Save your money!  Click this for a gameplay video with latest patch Watch all of that and you'll quickly get the idea of why people aren't recommending you buy this game.  My more in depth written review/rambly history with the game I had been waiting for this latest patch (which has almost been in the year in the making). To see if the developers had really taken on board the criticisms of the game and tried to tweak things to make a better PC flight sim experience. But it would seem not, the patch only added configurable joystick buttons and fixed a few bugs. Although some that had been reported are still in there.Also to give a little history, I backed this game on Kickstarter for  and have seen the game and given feedback to the devs from beta (which came out August 2013) to full Steam release. The main problems? 1) One big core problem of the game, is that it is simply not fun to shoot other ships in the game. That's a pretty important thing people want out of a space flight sim. The dogfights are soulless, and stupidly easy, the laser cannon fire has this crazy auto aim tracking and the AI is barely there. As I say in my video, it seems that the gameplay was implemented quite late and never really looked at again. Surely the first step is to make sure the main gameplay loop is fun over and over.2) The other problem of the game, and why it just feels so off and not quite for PC, well I'll explain in a second. An example of what I mean it being ""off"" :  When it says ""Enter your profile name"" it loads up a virtual keyboard on the screen, and if you type it on your actual keyboard, you have to type it one letter at a time, if you try to type at a normal speed it can't register your key presses. So why all these little quirks, lack of any real graphics options on PC etc? That is because it was also developed for the PS Vita at the same time. Although I haven't played the Vita version, once you know that about the development, things start to make a lot more sense. Instead of developing a separate but similar Vita game, this very much feels like what must be the Vita game, but poorly implemented for PC. Now don't get me wrong, Vita to PC ports of stuff can work, for example Hotline Miami or Guacamelee are great examples of it being done right. Also I'm not one of those ""I WANT TRACKIR OR NOT BUYING!"" type of people before you think that. All I was expecting was to dust off my joystick and play a fun modern competent single-player campaign, in the style of X-Wing or Wing Commander series. Which is how the Kickstarter was essentially pushed on their campaign and why I backed it. The developer silence and vacuum People had asked this on a Reddit AMA and other places, that making this style of game for PC and Vita was a little odd, but the developers very much felt it could be a good fit for them and the smaller budget they were working with. And to assure us that the PC version wouldn't be crippled for the Vita version etc. Well....When the backer beta came out, I emailed my feedback saying that it wasn't exactly great and I was shocked at just how much of a clumsy Vita style port it felt like and that PC backers probably were not going to think highly of that. I imagine some other people probably also said that during the backer beta period too. I forgot about it for a while in the hopes that when it got released on Steam as a full release, that the feedback would be taken on board and they would really sit down and take a long look to tweak the gameplay and make sure the PC version felt & played like a PC game with a joystick and such. Well go to about a year later with the full release on Steam (April 2014) after a small time of it being on Steam as early access too. I downloaded it again and was very disheartened to find it was pretty much the same game, with some slightly better joystick control added and some bugs cleared up. But the core gameplay still as dull and not engaging, the laser fire still bending a crazy amount auto aim style. The forum messages and Steam reviews were pretty much on the negative side mostly, some people trying to soften the blow when talking about their dissatisfaction. The developers sounded like they would try to fix more stuff about the game. A lot of ""we're sorry, we're trying"" ""we have a patch coming next month!"" from them, but the main developer who would reply on the Steam forums stopped for about 6 months, not a peep. Everyone assuming the game was dead after launch.Then a month ago, the developers popped up on the Steam forums again, saying we have a patch coming! Out of the blue, I thought ok, it's been almost a year since the game came out on Steam. Maybe they've really taken the feedback onboard and this patch will really answer some criticisms customers who bought this game had and make the experience better. Here we are today, tying back to my first paragraph of this review. The patch added very little. And pushed me to write my first Steam review.For the past year, they've been trying to get this game submitted to Sony to go on the PS3, along with making a new game too. This game was very much, released on Steam and then move on, forget about the people who bought it and their complaints. That is not a way to gain fans or treat people correctly.  Final Thoughts I mentioned a vacuum in the title of the last section, I think this game could have been something if the developers listened more, got people in the alpha earlier on and not bothered with the Vita version (or not bother with a PC version depending). Focus on one platform, make it as great as you can and see where to go once it was out and what would be a good fit. We could have told you very early on the flight model and the gameplay loop of shooting ships was not fun at all. Instead it was very much a vacuum, the Kickstarter campaign got funded. Then nothing for ages but a small trailer, then suddenly the backer beta. By which point it was already too late to perhaps make things better it seemed. This review might sound rather harsh, perhaps. I normally understand things from a developers point of view, but not when it comes to releasing a product you know is not good, then run and not listen to paying consumers. I kept giving them the benefit of the doubt, maybe this patch they'll have listened... ok no. Maybe this one? Nope. Ok one more chance to really get this thing feeling good. Here's the patch! Oh barely even tried. I posted on the forums several times and made a few videos, pointing out parts of UI that were bad or clunky or just broken etc. And they're still there to this day. EG Cockpit view, if you blow up an enemy, it still shows on the target HUD. And other such things. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So I shall stop rambling now, again watch the video I made and linked at the top if you're curious. Big thanks if you actually took the time to read all this! :) What should you spend your money on? Easy if you've never played it. X-WING ALLIANCE! People always say oh I loved X-Wing, or X-Wing vs Tie Fighter. A lot of people forget there was a 4th game called X-Wing Alliance. Which fortunately enough recently came out on gog.com all ready to download and play out of the box on Windows 7/8. Download the fantastic, easy to install HD texture pack here http://www.darksaber.xwaupgrade.com/craftspackucp.html and you'll be feeling like a badass pilot in no time. With a interesting story that bounces between helping your Family against a rival business and being a Rebel Alliance pilot. Voice acting and mission designs still hold up today as they did then, and seems to support most joysticks you throw at it. Not bad for a game that came out in 1999.			"

												I bought this game knowing it was early access. First time i tried to play it i couldn't because of a movie loading glitch. As soon as it loaded and you came to the splash screen it crashed. First i asked the devs to take a look into this matter, and they say they had it fixed. Four months later i reinstalled the game and the same thing happened. So i took it upon myself to try to fix the game and found out if you delete all the movies  you can get to the menue and play the game.  The controls are not smooth and if you don't play with an xbox controller, you have no hope in completing the game. Even the contols for the xbox are not smooth and jerky. Trying to aim at a moving target is hopeless if you want to use your guns and you only have limited amount of missles that you have to buy after each mission.    The lighting is so dark on everything. You cant see the ships you are shooting at just the aiming reticles in front of them. Walking around on the ship is like you are in a cave and everybody has a tan. The frame rate jumps up and down like a jack rabbit on crack. The second mission you have to turn the dynamic lighting off to even get a frame rate you can play it at. And then you cant see anything until you are right up on top of it.  The developers say this game is ready for final release. If you buy this game you are in for a big surprise.  If this game was freeware i wouldn't even bother downloading it. There isn't one good thing i can say about the game except the demo movie looked good. The people are talking statues and not very realistic. They talk and you cant listen to them for more than a few seconds before you jump to the mission so you dont have to hear them anymore. The narration is like, give me a break. Hope they didnt pay anybody for the voices. Game is just crap is the final word to describe it.			"

												This was a nice attempt and far better than I could have done.  With so many space combat sim options now there is no reason to buy this.Pros:  Tries fairly hard to be a good Wing Commander / Freespace 2 clone and briefly captures the nostalgia.Cons: - Very outdated graphics.- First person out of cockpit experience poorly implemented.  The actual movement lags behind a reticule causing motion sickness and an overall bad experience.- Shield / Stealth Module / Missiles / Mission contextual special device all tied to the same secondary weapon cycle.- The large amount of ships have been copied and pasted from an online description somewhere without even bothering to change minor things to make it ""spacey"".-  There is no incentive in the campaign to use more than 1 top notch fighter with a single configuration after the training mission despite the impressive number of ships.- Missiles have a description of Air-to-Air and appear to be copied from the same source as the ships.  They should be described as Ship to Ship or Ship-to-Surface.- Taking out satellites is a very boring extra bonus objective that really doesn't seem to affect the overall outcome of the mission or campaign.  The point of secondary & tertiary objectives are to enhance the overall campaign or to be of good effect in case the primary objectives can't be reached or if there were extra ordinance & time/fuel.-  Some ground targets sink below the surface of planets/asteroids making them unreachable by weapons and blocking mission completion at 100%.In summary I love the spirit of the game, and the desire to make a space combat sim again.  When this was greenlit, there was almost nothing new out at the time and it was a gap waiting to be filled.  Now that Elite Dangerous is ""out"" and Star Citizen is maybe about to release something more fun to do than run people over with golf carts this game is relegated to the never to be installed or played again pile with about 100 other games in my library unless it receives some serious changes.

												At the time of this review I seem to have the most hours playing this game. I will recommend this game but there are caveats to this. 1) This game is awkward in play. The eating dinner over your best friend's house, after you have just been caught making out with his sister awkward. I absolutely hate the FPS movement through the ships. It's slow and when your alerted to report to the ready room you just mosey along to get there. The tutorial flight needs to more indepth. I ""accidently"" found out how to allocate power and command wingmen 3 missions in. 2) The flight mechanics are disturbing at times as you find yourself struggling to get the ship to right itself on a trajectory. I like being able to fly near the surface of a planet just not in one. One mission requires you to go underground killing bad guys and finding a scientist. You take damage hitting walls but the enemy ships ping pong ball of the sides making it impossible to hit them and they take NO damage. Loose this mission or change the scientist to a surface station.  3) Voice acting poor. The briefer for the first few missions looks like his is in his fifties but the voice is of a later teens to early twenties young man. Same akwardness with the stories one pilot who liked he was straight out of high school had 10yrs of experience. 4) The credit system isn't consistent. I completed a round and saw all sorts of bonuses flash up and completed bonus missions and recived nothing after the brief. All the work for nothing. Prestige points? Really? I have to earn a certain amount of points to get descent equipment? I would understand completeing some missions and getting extra stuff in mission to have new equipment to be researched then availible after a period of time.   Now after all this I really do like the game, I hate the fact it's VERY Crossfire unfriendly. I had to disable it all together. The game has promise but it needs alot of work. I do recommend this, just be prepared to be annoyed a little bit.			"

												I backed this project on Kickstarter and I would like to be able to recommend it. Unfortunately in its current state I really cannot do so. It lacks depth, challenge and polish.Pros: In the actual ships, the mouse and keyboard controls work pretty well and the game is quite playable as such. There are some narrative beats in the campaign that could be interesting with a bit more substance to them. The autoassist targeting and landing guides are helpful.Cons: There are significant parts of the game that feel vestigial, like the presence of sequences where you can walk around the ship (and have to walk from hangar to ready room at the start of each mission). There's nothing you can actually do in these sequences and they really don't contribute anything that a simple mission briefing cutscene or even text screen wouldn't have. Or being able to control your wingmen - you can give them orders, but there's not really any reason to do so and their presence is barely even noticeable. They never even speak outside of a few brief comments during scripted narrative. Missions consist of little more than moving between waypoints and firing lasers at enemy craft until they explode. The only times I took damage over three full missions were when I accidentally rammed into something, and your ship slowly repairs itself so I was never in danger. The cutscenes are deeply awkward with little animation and rough character models. Objectives are vague and not necessarily well cued (I spent probably fifteen minutes trying to figure out how to scan for one objective until I realized it had been allocated as a secondary weapon.) But it might be kind of fun as a throwaway shooting gallery if it weren't for the fact that it's also broken. Missile lockon stops working after the tutorial. Objectives don't fire or fire at the wrong times. Mission 3 automatically failed on me repeatedly because the script necessary to complete it successfully never triggered. A station that's ""under attack"" remains ""under attack"" even after you kill all of the attackers. Etc.The developers are maintaining an active presence and it does seem like they are still working on it, so maybe one day Starlight Inception will be worth your while. Right now? Not so much.			"

												Great concept. Beautiful graphics. Wonky controls. Unable to change the way the mouse controls in 1st person. 1st person treated like you're still in a fighter. Difficult to center the view. Re-mapping keyboard controls doesn't work -- unable to change controls. Difficult to find objectives after last waypoint. No way to review previous communcations. 1st person controls slow. Exploring the ship is cool, but time consuming and difficult.			"

												After playing X-Wing Alliance on and off for years when I found out a member of the X-Wing team was making a space combat game I quickly joined the Early Access and, I'll admit, I was initially not impressed. The controls were sluggish, the characters were hideous by modern standards and the cockpit was worse than in X-Wing Alliance.But that was then.Unfortunately now most of those issues still remain. The controls have been semi improved as have the characters but the cockpits are still lackluster. Adding insult to injury is the fact that the development team has been absent for an unsettling amount of time. There have been only a few patches since transitioning from Early Access to Full Product. I am extremely disappointed by the lack of professionalism and quality shown by the folks at Escape Hatch Entertainment.			"

												This game still needs alot of work, sadly..the story is bland and sometimes horific to even know what the hell ur doing, walking around the ship awsome cool feature is kinda like taking a trip back to the mid 2000's with textures that kinda reminds you of the old 3dmax software, I would love to actully love this game when it comes to some features but hell the motherships or whatever the fleet looks pasted in space battles and yea i dont know what to say really.Npc interaction with the crew is the worst part for me, remember the first X game with the stiff npc's and odd ways of looking all over the place with no sence of being there?? yepp its here and its worse, first npc i ran into did nothing then to stare right into the wall, mumbeling something I dont even remember cause i laughed to hard.After i played a few missions and so on the game patched out some bugs and the save'd game files got currupted.. I havent even botherted to launch the game again.Im sorry ladies and gentlemen this game is not worth 19€ asking price I would recommend this game if it was like under 5€ but in this state and what looks like(Please by god fix what you started) final version I just whanna say No.And if i had the choice to press a refund button i would have done so.

												The full version of the game, which is the only one I've played, is very, very rough. Walking around inside one of the ships made me sick to my stomach from the weird lag. Once I got in a ship, I thought the flying was okay at best. I used a 360 controller and found targeting to be jumpy with a lot of drift. It also felt like the ship had the of inertia of a boat, which I don't think is a thing in space (I ain't no space science man though). The graphics are acceptable for $20. They certainly won't wow anyone, but clearly some effort went into ship designs.Overall, this game feels like an early alpha. I don't know how much the devs can/will continue to improve it to justify the $20 (Which feels steep, in my opinion), but I have to imagine there are better space games out there for an equal or lesser price at this time.

												A very, very poor man's version of ""Freelancer"" and SWTOR Galactic Starfighter.A good idea, not very well executed.  Space flying and weapons are not convincing or exciting. The internal game physics feels ""dead"" to me.  It doesn't ""feel alive"" which is a bad thing for a space flyer.If you like the American flag, you'll love the names of things in this game.  There's a spaceship called the ""Colin Powell"".If you are dying for a fill-in between Freelancer, SWTOR GSF, and Star Citizen, this might satisfy you for a few days.  It did not satisfy me, however.			"

												This is truly, unbelievably terrible. Do not buy this under any circumstances. The controls flat-out don't work 90% of the time, and when they do they're mushy and unsatisfying. It looks awful. It just plain plays awful.No wall of text here, just avoid avoid avoid.			"

												It has potential. I like that you can wander the ship between missions. If you could jump into the starfighter and launch/land from the flight deck, it would heighten immersion and cool factor. Mouse feels laggy and optimization is poor at this stage. Despite the poor performance, the graphics are not stellar. Feels like a slightly updated wing commander game. Again, this could be awesome by release, but only slightly enjoyable currently. Multiplayer was just added today, but I missed where the steam advertised ""coop"" features were, as I only saw deathmatch/capture the flag type multiplayer modes.I look forward to seeing improvements from future updates.

												Starlight Inception could've been better, it did have the potential to be something else but instead it's a under mediocre ""space-sim"".The AI Is poor - the enemy can't even hit you.The Friendly AI is also poor - They seem to be good at flying into stuff, but in their wish to die they simply fly into whatever that is nearby (not the enemy sadly enough)The campaign is okay, it is passable and can be interesting but the game itself is so badly executed that you simply just wish to crash your own PC in order to stop playing. (You can't shut down the game or return to menu after starting a mission.) I honestly believe that the devs should take their thumbs out of their arses and try to salvage this game, jesus christ just do it it has potential.			"

												Don't buy this game. For the love of god, buy Freespace or Wing Commander or Strike Suit Zero or X3 or even DarkStar One before you buy this. This game is not good. It feels like a game designed by people who only had the faintest idea of how video games worked, and set out to reinvent everything from scratch because they didn't know any better. The first-person walking segments are incredibly slow and the mouse/keyboard controls work like no PC first-person shooter ever. The targeting options are abysmal. Basic functions that Freespace had almost two decades ago, like ""target closest enemy"" or ""target ship under reticule,"" simply do not exist in the game (though there's some loopy auto-targeting system that doesn't work nearly as well as you'd want it to). The game doesn't automatically switch missile bays when you run out of missiles. You often don't know about escort objectives you may have until you fail them for the first time out of the blue (the ships you're escorting never cry for help and you can't see an indicator of how damaged they are unless you target them directly). This causes you to fail the entire mission, throwing you back to the last checkpoint. CHECKPOINTS ARE AWFUL IN THIS GAME. They often throw you back two or three encounters, even when it seems like you should be able to save at a clear waypoint in between. Controls are so screwed up that I can't actually access the Controls menu in game because before I can move the menu cursor down to Controls, I get kicked into the Sound menu and can't find my way out with either the controller or the keyboard. Hitting Shift-F12 to take a screenshot snaps control of the game to the keyboard immediately, requiring you to kick back out to the pause menu to reset back to the controller. Also, I have to resort to a controller because using my joystick is out of the question because the button configuration is hardcoded, meaning basic functions are set on joystick buttons that are harder to reach. And since doing anything with the keyboard immediately locks the joystick out, playing this game like ANY OTHER SPACE SIM OF THE PAST TWENTY YEARS by using both the keyboard and joystick is impossible.I can go on: about the cutscenes with people who don't move at all except for their mouths (they're like bizarre talking statues), about the fact that the bad guys all seem to be random Arab and Asian countries, about the incoherent narrative, about how your guns run out of juice after ten seconds of sustained fire (if that), about how you can't even charge your guns while firing your afterburners, about how locking upgrades behind CPs are a baffling way to run a military (seriously, I have to UNLOCK good fighters?), about how it would take something like twenty or thirty playthroughs to come close to unlocking everything, etc., etc., etc. Just, no. Don't spend your time on this.I do wish Escape Hatch the best; clearly they've got heart and ambition. But it might be better to start with a basic game genre that's easier to iterate on and perfect, rather than dive headlong into a genre known for complexity (even though really it's not that complex) and getting so many things wrong.

It's not too hard and not too easy. The graphics look good, the sound is okay and for 10 bucks you get a very solid game already.			"

												I have only played roughly and hour and a half, but I must say it is definetely the highlight of my day. This game reminds me of all the Wing Commander games from the days of old. When I first heard about this game, they wanted to bring back the dog fighting space days of the past. They succeeded. Hands down, succeeded. The love that went into this game is so visable. Now, ofcourse being an early access game, there are quite a few bugs. Good news, the developers are well aware of the problems and are constantly working to improve and fix gameplay issues. The controls of flight can sometimes be a bit twitchy, but spend a little time with it and they become as familiar as Xwing VS Tie Fighter. Pick up this game, support these guys. This game will definetely keep you busy until Star Citizen is released.....in 2024. lol			"

												Well I got this game. The first looks of it is good. It has a somewhat primitive but to me good enough cockpit view. They actually did a lot of effort in the capital space ships models and you can look around in one of the space carrier ships. Pretty awesome. The music and sound effects are good. What the game lacks is a smooth joystick control. I tested this with my Logitech Extreme 3D pro that I usually use for the fast pace arcade style (space) simulator games. If you use the keyboard then the joystick stops working, but after you shoot it will work again. Also rolling the spacecraft to level you with the spacecraft is difficult with a joustick. A minor few nuisances. So it is a promising game but not finished yet with those bugs mentioned above. Would I recommend it? Yeah if they iron out the bugs go for it. If not just wait a little.			"

												This game has a huge amount of potential, but I still can't recomend it. Why? I mean, yes, walking around the ship so slow (and pointless, really) that it's more of a chore than a perk, and the voice acting is distractingly bad, but I could look past such things.What really grinds my gears is what happens when you try to fly the ship. Just getting the thing pointed in the direction you want it to go is more of a battle than the actual fighting. Not only is the steering about as smooth as Paul Bunyan's beard, it's totally unpredictable. It's like your ship is saying, ""Now, I know you SAID you wanted to pull straight up to put your target right in your crosshairs, buuuuut I think what you really want is for me to pull up, go slightly to the right, then instead of stopping on the target I'll jerk hard left. And up a little. And then left a little more. Soooo, I'm gonna do that instead. Myea.""Even if your ship didn't follow directions with the obedience of a 2 year old or a cat, the ships turn so slow to begin with that even what should be the most maneuverable ones just feel dull and lifeless. I hope they patch some of this stuff up, because if the flight controls felt more like they do in the games SI is trying to emulate (Freespace, X-Wing, Wing Commender, Tachyon) it would be fantastic. Till then, it's no more than a bunch of pretty lights and cool ideas that just aren't any fun.			"

												When I first saw this game, and played it, I ♥♥♥♥ed all over my computer.  I am now washing♥♥♥♥♥off of my keyboad. Not becouse of its average graphics, or its respect for physics in space(maybe in the future they have pumped gass into space that allows for space craft to act like like air craft flying in an atmosphere and SOUND IN SPACE XD), I came every where becouse of the premise of the game and the game play.  This game causes spontanious orgys in the pleasure centers of my brain becouse it is a game like wing commander.  Starlight inception is part of human centipede of games that are the grand children of wing commander,  And this is a good thing.  I like the space sim human centipede.  However one of the ways that this game could be possibly at the front of the space sim human centipede,where it would not have to eat the♥♥♥♥♥♥of outher games, would be to incorporate realistic space physics into space combat.  An exsample of this is Kerbal Space Program.  While ksp is not a combat game it does have realitic space physics when flying space craft..in space.  Although this might make the learning curve a little steap for some people,  It will make the game that much more rewarding, and it will help the game stand out.  Additionally this could have the side effect of making the game so awsome that it would automatically cause any women standing near it to spontaneously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Much like the staturn V rocket, Really look that♥♥♥♥♥♥up  SPACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!BUY THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME!!!!!! ITS BETTER THAN MOST KINDS OF SEX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

Do you have any idea how hard it is to get back to near perfect center so I stop spinning in circles? And full/ partial controller support? Try no support, non what so ever. I tried my X-360, X-One and an only MS Sidewinder FF2 just for giggles. NOTHING WORKED. I am so glad I only paid a couple of dollars for this. I will eventually jerry rig some type of setup to make this playable but I wont even attempt to fly after I ran in to the same wall a dozen times trying to go through a simple doorway.
