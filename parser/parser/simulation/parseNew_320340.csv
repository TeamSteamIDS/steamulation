Early Access Review
								This is one of these where you feel sad to not recommend it. Let me start by stating that I believe the developers can and probably will fix any issues that crop up in the game - I can see the effort they put into it, and hopefully I can explain why I don't recommend it at the moment.This is not a simple YES / NO review. So I advise you to read further before downvoting or thinking the game is bad.For an Early Access title, it's a very well polished product. The graphics are good, the interface is nice, and the audio is great, and there's few bugs.However, even though the game is well made and has good potential if further developed, its current core gameplay is repetitive and not really fun. Which is exactly why I can't recommend it: it's not a matter of specific, isolated issues. The CORE of the game feels pointless at this time.COMBAT: Battles are EXTREMELY slow, repetitive, unsatisfying and not rewarding as one might think. I'm sad to say it's the worst pacing and balancing I've experienced from this sort of FTL-insipired games. It feels like Sid Meyer's Pirates in space (which is good and could be a lot of fun) with a slight touch of FTL.Even after I got the most expensive combat ship, and decent skill on battles, it still felt wrong, and kind of boring. Enemies may surrender and offer you a good amount for their lives, however, which is a great thing to see when it works - very few games I played have such feature.TRADING: The game doesn't provide enough info to make sense of the economy. And even though it follows a basic supply/demand and consumption/production cycle, there's no influence in the game universe beyond that. Trading is a simple mindless grind, which wouldn't be that big of a deal if it could be automated. And once you figure out a good run, you can have everyhing in the game after some mindless hauling that shouldn't take more than a couple of hours.Those are the two core aspects of the game, and both feels shallow - which is weird, because the presentation of the game is amazing. However, all the systems are in place, and both Combat and Trading can be further expanded, balanced or fixed, because the design isn't FUBAR. So there IS hope for Cosmonautica.I did enjoy the research feature and how it's implemented - In my opinion, it's a pretty unique system. And the semi-realistic ""orbital"" flight is a fresh take on space flight in games.Assembling your crew is cool, and watching they develop is great. Building your rooms to tailor your ship to your playstyle feels great, too. Being able to change ship and uniform colors is also a nice touch.The comedy undertone and popular references are fun to have.So it REALLY boils down to the core gameplay - which was an unpleasant surprise after I got used to the whole interface, systems and setting.If you are looking for a very simple trading game that can be played only with the mouse, go ahead. But anything more than that, and I can't guarantee it'll meet your expectations at the moment. I really hope the devs expand and focus on the core gameplay before the actual release. Cosmonautica was on my wishlist for a long while, and just because I don't recommend it RIGHT NOW, doesn't mean I won't change my opinion later.With proper depth, more focus os the core gameplay and a bit more complexity, Cosmonautica can be one of the gems of Steam. Otherwise, it'll definitely fall short, with the only positive point being that ""it only costs 15 USD""..so my final advice is: wait before buying.Thanks for reading!			"

												This game doesn't feel finished.The economy is broken - Markets seem to be static, i.e. things you sell sit there forever which when combined with a max items per station cap make you unable to sell further items to that station. Unfortunately this then leads to items being stuck in your cargohold which you have purchased but then can't find anywhere in the system that will buy them.Levelling up your crew members is iffy. At the point of level up you are granted a skill point to increase that crew members abilities. However there is no cancel button on the level up screen so if you, like me, wonder what the unlock buttons do on the level up screen and click them, you'll find it opens up a new skill set. Again unfortunately, once you've found that out and decide you don't want them to start a new skill set and you just want them to improve in their current job you find you can't, as there is no cancel button and you have to accept.Which leads on to the save system. Apparently it was a ""design decision"" to not allow the player to save their game. Instead there are autosaves only. This would be fine in some types of game, perhaps even in this one if it was polished. There are too many instances in this game where I've lost time and effort through bugs which could be easily avoided by having a save point to return to.I would say this game possibly has potential depending on how much work the developer still plans to put into this product. Though at the moment it's a disappointing experience.			"

												Cosmonautica is... almost the game i've been looking for for many years.  It's very significant that although at this stage, the game does crash about once an hour, I don't seem to mind (and this usually causes me to rant).Cosmonautica is a cute, humourous game where you manage your (at the start, very shoddy) spaceship and crew. There's trading, smugglin, passenger transportation and fighting. You can upgrade your ship's rooms by installing a science module and hiring a scientist.The trading takes a while to get used to, but after a bit of practice it's possible to make a profit margin. However, this wll not be sufficient to amass a fortune: i find that at the start it's best to concentrate on a combination of trading and passenger transportation to make a living. Fighting is best left to a little later, as your starting ship and crew aren't worth much in a fight yet :)All in all, a very very nice game, with the potential to be a great game if the developpers keep adding features, missions and new upgrades for your ship. (Maybe even ground 'away' missions?)PROS:- Nice cartoony graphics- Funny, without ever becoming obnoxious- Good balance between trading/fighting/transportation...- Some learning curve at the start but not too hard after a few hours' practice- Very addictive as you want to keep improving your ship, crew and fortuneCONS:- Occasional 'freeze' crashes (the game litterally just left early access so I imagine they will fix this soon)- The fights do feel a bit 'light'WISHLIST:I feel the game could be really great but just needs to be 'fleshed out' some. So for what it's worth, here's my wishlist :)- FIx the 'freeze' crash issues- Make some more variation for the crew (both graphical and in personality complexity, backstory etc...)- Flesh the fights out some more: these feel a bit 'light', no real sense of danger or damage (some sound changes and a slight speed up of pace perhaps?)- More and more diverse missions available on space stations - possibly even longer missions requiring more steps- 'Away' missions on planetary surfaces.Anyway, I heartily recommend this game to lovers of Sid Meier's Pirates, the Hitch Hiker's Guide or Firefly! FIND A CREW - FIND A JOB - KEEP FLYING  ;)			"

												Update 2 Nov 29, 2015: Started up a new game, made it ~4 hours in and it became crashing simulator. Was looking forward to building my ship and crew up for master smuggling and later try out being combative but unfortunately I have crashed three times in the last hour. It looks like they've put some improvements into the game, but if I can't play it steadily then it's a bit hard to get excited. Update 1 Sept 2015: I have been told by a developer that patches are incoming to address some of these complaints. I will update my review when I play with the fixes in place, but I still recommend holding off purchasing until the big patches have gone through.Original Review: I love the art style and personality of the game, but it's fairly shallow and repetitive. Combat seems pretty broken as even on the easiest combat mission I ran out of ammo far before I could really damage my foe's shields and was able to flee all other encounters easily. This basically removes a third of the missions, a crew member, and a decent amount of ship upgrades. I was excited to see more galaxies to explore but once I got there it was the exact same missions and goods to trade, so I'm not really sure what the point is in exploring and researching deeper into space. Then there's the FTL-comparison part where you can control crew members as they go about their tasks on the ship. I had no real need to do this at any point as I rarely took damage and basically only occasionally told my cleaner to fix up the bathroom. The game definitely needs some more depth and balance before I can recommend it. It's too bad because the visuals are wonderful, but it's really lacking in gameplay variety.			"

												Have played a fair amount of this pre-release and post-release. There are lots of positives here but not enough currently to keep my interest. Here are a few headlines if you're on the fence: PRO'S Decent crossover of SIMS/Space Trader. A reasonable amount of ships to save up for. Lots of star systems to explore, though this isn't really encouraged as much as it could be in the story mode. Graphics are cartoony and bright. Missions are fairly varied. CON'SLots of crashes - even after 'finished' release. As mentioned in other reviews - economy is fairly static and doesn't always make sense. A planet that exports robots only has 10 tons at any given time? How is that an export system? Lots of bugs - trade bugs will regularly put you into a negative balance. Mission text doesn't always reflect mission outcomes, Combat - DULL, DULL, DULL. No speed up option, most fights end up in either a stalemate or are a simple matter of 'Charge all guns blazing'. SIMS element is underplayed - characters don't really interact enough. Trading is incredibly tedious - see above on static economy. So I bought a ship with 80 units of space but the market only has 4 units of what I need? And it only regenerates at 2 units per 2 days? EXCELLENT. Autosave feature means that if something goes badly wrong (see negative cash balance bugs) then you are completely scuppered. Some grammatical errors and generally unpolished text entries. It's a shame - the game tries to shine in two genres but doesn't really take off in either. Hopefully this game will get more patches and content as it goes along - for now I would only pick this up if you want to grab it while its on sale and you don't mind learning the ropes of an unfinished game that has a lot of potential. - DG.

												I was interested in this game when it was in Early Access and because of the review by Splattercat Gaming on Youtube. Sadly the end results of the game when I picked it up on sale did not meet my expectations. Constant bug and game crashes combined with an unbalance in vital game mechanics makes this game an unpleasant experience.Lastly, the game has been abandoned by the developer and no further attempts to fix the issues of the game are being made. There are games in this genre available. Play those instead.			"

												I really wanted to give this game a chance.  It was always ""almost-there.""It was your classic steam-experience of an early access getting pushed too early.While it's most definitely fun for the time I played it, and it has a -massive- amount of potential; it feels overall unrealized.  What is new and exciting at first quickly becomes the norm when you realize all the NPC's are virtually the same with relatively pointless interactions.  You can choose your own dialogue choices for instance, but it makes no measurable effect on the game.  The stations are all the same, minus some commodities and services.  The same could be said for the solar systems and the various AI ships roaming about.They sort of alude to a morality system, (juxtaposing being a trader vs. a pirate) but that doesn't seem to be there.  There's just not much filler here.  This game is a fondant cake, it looks good but it tastes bad.Generally it's okay, I would give it a solid 5/10 or 2/5.  Playable, but definitely passable.			"

												Well first id like to say this game could have some potential.   but after playing for a bit,  the game feels like it needs way more content.   after you figure out how to play (make money) the game just goes downhill from there.  it becomes too easy.  you can easily max out everything the game has to offer, and in just a few hours.  at that point you are left wondering why you should bother even playing anymore?like most of the other reviews say.  this needs a lot of everything.  balance, content.   it feels like we only got half a game.and dont get me started on the bugs.  they happen, frequently.  some even break the game.  as in the AI giving you 45,000 CR for a quit submit.  the most expensive ship in the game only costs about 600,000 CR or so.EDIT:    after giving it some thought, this game is pretty much just a mobile game, ported to the PC.  over priced at that.   thats why it lacks in content, and its super fast pace.  there is a ""cross-platform save"" option.  thats also broken (surprised?).  it cost me all my saved data.anyway.  the game is only good for a few hours. and its hardly worth the price tag.  if you really feel like playing this, get the android or IOS version for half the price.   good way to kill some time while on the toilet?  lol			"

												This is going to sound odd, but this is a good game. It's frustrating, but fun. Kind of like an old Nintendo game in some ways. And in some ways, that's part of the problem, because while its fun and frustrating, it's also lacking in polish in many areas.There's a some big annoyances with this game and the problem is they're never going to be fixed. The team is small, has moved onto other projects, and the worst part is it's not really their fault. This game runs on the Havok ""Project Anarchy"" Engine which had its support cut late 2015. What this means is updating the game is very difficult and many stability issues that might pop up in the future will probably be impossible to fix. That said, its still fun, but it's not $15 dollars fun. It's more $5 dollars fun when you consider what you see is what you get. Should they drop the price, I'll recommend it. But for now, wait for a Steam Sale.			"

Early Access Review
								""FTL"" meets ""Freelancer"" meets ""Redshirt"" came to mind when I first sat down with ""Cosmonautica"".  Like ""FTL"", you can obtain crew members and assign them tasks.  When you're not watching your crew members go about their daily lives, you'll be traveling, trading, and ruining someone's day a-la ""Freelancer"".  The art style and humor reminded me a bit of ""Redshirt"" in that it seemed cartoony and light-hearted.  In addition to a campaign (not yet available), players will be able to procedurally generate a galaxy via a sandbox mode.  My experience was rather limited due to the problems I had with the early build I played, but I'd give it a ""thumbs up"" for the potential alone.  I, of course, reserve the right to change my opinion in the near and immediate future as the game is still under development.  The game will launch at the retail price of $14.99, but you can grab it on Steam's Early Access program for $9.99.

Early Access Review
								The game scratched my itch for an trading and exploration game, but i feel like i reached the bottom to soon.I enjoyed the 9h of gameplay i got out of it so far. The graphics and animation quality is very impressive, and I like the design work very much. Buying resources, travelling and reselling them for a profit feels good. Ontop of that, there are missions on every planet, e.g. to transport people to a certain planet. However, the variety among these missions is extremely limited. It feels like they are always the same ~10 missions, no matter which planet. I also do not quite understand the point of the additional solar systems one can travel to. They have certain shifts in the distribution of resources you can buy and sell, but offer nothing new at all otherwise. The quests are the same, the goods are essentially the same as well. Also, I got through my games - so far - without requiring any weapons what so ever. I think forcing the player to aquire some weapons as defense would be a good idea, i.e. by throwing the player into combat every now and then. This happened for me once, but i could easily flee without any repercussions. This is a shame, because forcing more combat on the player could be a way of disturbing them from the much more efficient strategy of peacefully buying and reselling expensive goods.There are still a good number of bugs, too. From missing planet names in the main scenario mission descriptions to a straight up crash (happened once, and was mitigated by the apparently very regular autosaving). I only had 2 different ships, I never did any hacking, I avoided combat without any problem. And still, I do not feel too much incentive in going those routes either, because I don't expect to find anything new. Sid Meier's Pirates created depth through Diplomatic relationships, progression of the main character (becoming the best pirate, avenging your family), and showed variety through a number of minigames. Both variety and depth are unfortunately lacking in Cosmonautica.In total, I do not regret having spent 10Euros for an enjoyable 9h of gameplay. And maybe, if some variety is added until release or after, I might revisit it for another 10h. So I would still recommend to anyone who likes space adventure and economic games.			"

Early Access Review
								The game is a basic trade simulator. Nothing more (yet?). The art style is wonderful and lured me into buying the game, but the gameplay loop is very boring (to emphazise: it's boring, boring, boring!). So what do you really do in this game?1. You stop at planets and trade a few goods (not that entertaining).2. You watch (mostly) passivly, whilst your crew is in transit between planets. They work and poop and sleep and that's about it. They don't interact with each other, you (the player) can't really do anything but to double the speed while in transit. 3. Go to 1.3.1. Combat. Has to be reworkd in a big way, because right now it's sluggish, unintuitive, slow and really not fun.People who compare COSMONAUTICA to FTL are simply lying to your face. It has NOTHING of FTL, except a crew that flies a spaceship, but the similarities end here. You don't have to manage your crew, you don't have to position them, you don't interact with them. It's like watching an aquarium. An aquarium you don't have control over.The main problem is, that I can't see how the developer want to salvage the gameplay. The graphics are absolutely lovely, but tbh it looks like the graphics were here first and the actual gameplay is an afterthought. TL;DR+Graphics are wonderful.-It is NOT like FTL in any shape.-It's a very simple trading simulator.-Combat is terrible (slow and unintuitive).-It gets boring very, very quickly.First game I bought in 2015. First purchase I deeply regret since about three years.So yeah. Save your money. Maybe it will evolve to an actually interesting game (doubtful), but right now it's not worth your money.			"

Early Access Review
								If you're on the fence about picking up this early access game, let me alleviate some of your concerns. This game is brilliant. You do a couple of things simultaneously in this game. You manage your crew from hiring and firing to promotions and providing for their needs aboard your ship. You manage your ship's layout from recreational rooms to passenger seating to cargo space and even bathrooms. You manage the way you make money from taking missions from space stations to just figuring out profitable trade runs to killing pirates. There's also an overarching story line to follow as well. The nuts and bolts of this early access game in its current state as of 18Oct2014: Gameplay of about 3 hours right now. Researching new ""stuff"" is limited to just expanding the parts of the galaxy you can travel to. You cannot research new rooms or ships yet. The story took me about 3 hours of farting around to get through and that includes purchasing the most expensive ship (all ships were 10k regardless of size or capabilities which is very easy to get right now). Keeping in mind that once more content is added, you will be able to research new ships. The game works flawlessly in its current state and is very fun to play. I'm chomping at the bit now waiting for the rest of the content to land. Keeping to the genre this game falls into I would give it a 5/5 in its genre.			"

Early Access Review
								Cosmonautica for a early release game is suprisingly fairly well poilished.  You will embark as a fledgling trader and slowly build up wealth allowing you to upgrade your ship and hire on new crew;than buy a better ship only to better upgrade it and hire on more crew; all the while attempting to find the best trade routes to make more money. Pros:-  Graphics are well done, having a cartoony look/atmosphere to them.  While at first I was kind of taken back by it but quickly loved it especially as you start finding all the underlaying humor and quips at famous movies, punch lines, and even the dev's add in their own humor with the writing in game.  - The witty humor and comical movie referances really add a refreashing change to present games.  I personally enjoy actually reading the mission briefings and alerts because there is always a light hearted feel to it.  I've found this has actually made me enjoy the ""montonity"" of doing trade runs, transporting passangers, smuggeling goods because there is always some underlaying humor written.-  The music is enjoyable and envelopes you into the atmosphire of the game.-  When you load the game, there is a ticker on the bottom of the screen that the devs update including a ETA as when to the next patch/update can be expected.  This I EXTREAMLY love because this lets you know that this game is being continously worked on and re-enforces that the investment you put into the game is actually valued.-  The tech tree is enjoyable and adds a nice twist to the game.-  You are able to customize your ship from the inside,(and external coloring as well as ship name) allowing you to have a real visual of what the ship looks like inside.        - On the topic of being to see inside of your ship, you are able to actaully see your crew go about doing their duties and performing defferent actions.  Nice touch.-  Crew members will gain exp allowing you to invest points to improve their current specialty, or you can try unlocking two other possiable skills they posses.  They also may have secondary skills, either being good or negative.  Plus crew histories are a wee bit comical to read as well.- You are not limited to just one solor system, there are others out there, how ever, you need to research them first before unlocking them.Now before we continue onto the cons, just remember this is a early access game and it does seem the devs really do care and are striving to produce the best game they can produce.Cons:- No campaign (yet).  Sadly there is only a tutorial mode or sandbox mode atm.  However there is a campaing button but it is greyed out but it states it's coming soon.  Really hope they release it soon but I'll keep playing the sandbox mode for how, still a lot to do.-  The time passing in game seems a bit quirky.  One game play movement was slow and it'd take me a few days in game to get from one planet to another, but later in another game play, it'd be crazy fast.  I really don't know if it was from upgrading to a newer ship and researching the engines to improve them (now that I think about it, that may be the case, but I digress)- NO SAVE FEATURE? Come on.  There ""is"" one, when you quit the game, but I'm not used to that.  I wish there was at least a choice in the options to either be a ""realistic save"" (save only upon quit) or ""normal save"" (allowing you to save when you want.  This being said, there were a few instances where the game had crashed and somehow the game saved before being close, resulting in me being spawned into a space port but the money I made selling goods was in my bank and upgrades to my ship were intact.-With no campaign so there is'nt any end-game content.  HOWEVER, it IS still very fun and I actually do enjoy playing this game so...keep that in mindAll in all, for $10, this game is well worth it's weight in salt.  I whole heartedly recommend this game.  Just keep in mind it's EARLY ACCESS, so be ready for a few bugs and issues.  Other than that, download and enjoy!			"

Early Access Review
								In general when someone says ""if this game is this good in early access think how good it will be on release"" I get the impression that they've bought into an advertising ploy. Cosmonautica is one of the few exceptions to that. This game is most definitely worth the asking price of $10 at this point. And if they just clean it up a bit it will most likely go down as a classic in the light hearted space game genre. All that it is missing is a whimsical narrator and it will be like the spaceship centered counterpart to Startopia.If you do buy the game and play it here are my tips: 1. Make sure to play the tutorial. This game is not the easiest game at first. Like Dwarf Fortress you must balance your rooms and jobs. The first time I jumped into the game I didn't hire a pilot... do hire a pilot, you need them.2. The tutorial glitches at first. Don't just start buying stuff. I think you need to let a little time pass in the game world. I went to the solar system map and hit fast forward and the tutorial kicked in.That's all. After that it was smooth space sailingEverything is not enabled at this point, so I could see myself adjusting this review if the devs truly drop the ball. I just don't see that happening right now. Everything about Cosmonautica tells me it is just the kind of game I like to play and I hope it stays that way as it grows.If you like management type games like Dwarf Fortress, or space adventuring games like Space Rangers, do pick this up. I don't think you will regret it.			"

												TL/DR: Recommended during sale, but not worth more than 10 €I had a tough time deciding if i should recommend Cosmonautica, but in the end I decided against it due to the price tag.For a phone/tablet game Cosmonautica is better than many others. For a PC title i consider it to shallow. There is simply not enough content. - There is no real reason to travel anywhere on the map as there is nothing new to find- Combat: based on a nice idea, but requires no tactics whatsoever- Trade: Extremely boring, basically buy ressource x at producing planet -> sell it at consuming planet- Missions: It feels like there are about 5 missions, which repeat - life sim: way to simple / to easy to fulfill crew needsEven though for the first few hours it had fun :) Because while it is a very shallow game it also is a it is a very well polished shallow game =). The artwork is nice, the soundtrack not bad...  "

								The game has strong potential but at this time it misses a real ''fun factor''Main mission is OKOther missions offered in bars are repetitive and kinda dullThe trade system is really basic and gets boring quickly - bring in price variations, higher quantities, random events that affect price etc etcCombat system could get revamped but is OKThe management of crew and daily routines is fun at start but gets repetitive quicklyThe ''needs'' and affinities of your crew members needs tweeking since their effects can barely be fully ignoredThe happiness does not empty quick enough so you can almost avoid having a cuisine and toilets and wait several days to get to the next station and break (if you have time)Misses random events, a geopolitical system or presence, a real marketsome flaws and crashes here and there but nothing unfixablewhen you start over a new game dialogs cant be skipped and you cant fire the left mouse button quick enough since the icon also moves up and down. +++nice conceptgood humourgreat potential-------------I will be looking at this game as it evolves and it could turn into a nice enjoyable game later on now after a few hours I will shelve it.

												The worst game i've ever bought myself. And for that kinda price!! amazing...Playthrough after you've farmed money looks like this: ""fly to that planet"" (click of a button), ""fly to another planet"" (click a button), ""wait 10 days"" (just sit and fast forward a few minutes), ""now fly back to the first planet"" (click of a button). Also some space fights that make barely any sense and mostly just take a ton of time, since you can't fast forward them (waaaay to ez to win).And i got stuck because the game requires you at some point to make a strategical desicion without giving you any information to base it upon. They say ""prepare for everything"" which is obviously impossible, coz u can't buy everything. I got stuff that wins me fights but the game is unsatisfied with the way i win them, LOL, and it says i have to start over. yeah, right! :Dso1) if you want beautiful space fights, at least some tactics and maybe even strategy - play a different very well known game2) if you want at least a decent economical strategy - this is clearly not a game for you3) if you want to see people living in rooms and interacting with each other - you can easily guess a much better game to play as well4) there's no more components to this game. story line is not any good and it's just represented in a few text messages, barely even exists.

												I have to say that I was disappointed when I first bought this game but the new update (game changer) has done just that.  I am having a blast now with very few crashes and some fun gameplay.  The battles are enjoyable and the interplay between the crew is fun to simply watch and enjoy.  The universe is huge and allows a lot of growth.  I would like to see some new room options and expanded research capabilities but all in all it was well worth the price and the newest version is stable and a lot of fun.  If you are the kind of person who likes to sit back and watch game characters interact and go on with life aboard a ship, this game is for you.  Good graphics and simple to learn but fun gameplay.

												I wanted to like this title more than I did, what with its elements of management, space, trading and designing your own vessel layout in ant farm view, it ticked a lot of boxes to my liking. Even the characters and art style look fine.But its the mechanics that let this game down.Combat is not up to scratch as quite often you run out of ammo before doing to much damage to your opponent. A prolonged fight results in running out of ammo and then paying a ransom for your surrender. Then head to a shipyard for expensive repairs (~20k). Taking into account vessel combat requirements with rooms dedicate to ammo storage, turrets, torpedo bay etc, while also employing 3-4 specialised crew to man these stations costs money. A lot of money. At the end of the day just focus on cargo and passengers and if a fight arises, just call the aggressor and pay a ransom, its much cheaper ($600-$2500) than all the above requirements.Crew members can go on strike if their needs are not met. What are their needs? Whos knows, clicking on the profile of a striker reveals no negative information, though occasionaly before strike you may see some negative effect which, more often than not, is getting a bee in their bonnet due to another crew mate having a different food preference. Seriously! The more they are levelled up the crazier they get.The tutorial is inadequate with the trading section been the end of it and from memory finishes with ""you have 14 days to do some trading"". Thats not a tutorial, and by the time you get up to some combat, your paying for a lot of trial and error.The game crashes quite reguarly, once or twice every hour with a runtime error, thats apparently wide spread.Jobs given out from spacestations quite often require sourcing and delivery of 30x of X resource, however there is very rarely enough of that resource in the whole system to suffice the job.Sometimes smuggling jobs start from A and involve collecting contraband from planets B and C to deliver to D. Quite often you will run out of time or even with sufficient cargo space it just wont get loaded or more gets loaded than the job specified and when you get to location D, it won't unload, resulting, after a time period, a failed job with a large penalty for you.It would be nice if you could go back to an earlier save to prevent the wasting of big $$$ but Cosmo employs an auto save feature that saves over your older save. No going back = lots of time wasted.Pretty soon it becomes a big boring grind.I truly hope developers Chasing Carrots deliver something greater next time, but as it is Cosmonautica feels like its missing some essential pieces and now its 6 months post release it'll probably stay that way.

												A fun, quirky game that offers players the opportunity to trade, smuggle, be a taxi, fight battles, manage a crew, and purchase/upgrade new ships ... IN SPACE! Here's a quick breakdown:PROS-Nice graphics, very polished and cartoonish-Very catchy soundtrack-Plenty of research options and the ability to upgrade your ship, find new solar systems, etc.-Each crew member is unique in their own way in appearance, personality, and attributes-Missions to earn money in a variety of ways-A decent main quest to follow instead of just flying around aimlessly (if that's your thing, there is sandbox mode, too.)-Each planet and solar system is unique in its own way and consumes, produces, and has a ban on different things-Some Sim-like aspects to your crew in that you have to provide for their needs to keep them happy and working-Fast forward time speed option to cut down on long trips for the impatient player in all of us -The game doesn't take itself too seriously and has humor throughout-The devs are active, helpful, and take their players concerns seriously. They want to make the game worthy of praiseCONS-Still pretty buggy and crashes occasionally, but not to the point of making the game unplayable-The missions are very repetitive and predictable-Space battles aren't that exciting-Moderate learning curve SUGGESTIONS-Would be great if there were diplomacy options or the chance to establish your own production/trading stations-The option to create a small fleet or galactical trading empire would be a plus-More weapons and room options -Much larger variety of missionsAll in all, if you like economical sci-fi simulators, this is a pretty sweet game. I'm sure it will develop over time to be even better. It's definitely a good start. If you liked Sid Meier's ""Pirates!"" or Firefly, definitely pick this up!7/10 stars			"

								After playing this for a little while, while it has  a ways to go in terms of being long term fun, the stuff thats in place already shows a lot of promise. essentially you manage a spaceship laying out the vessel through rooms similar to the way sims medieval handles buildings adding in various things like science, shield systems bunks to sleep in etc then you hire a crew. each crew member you hire has skills that corrospond with a part of the ships operation. the solar systems and later the galaxy at large will be proceedurally generated so its never the same game twice. however in its current state theres still a lot that says coming soon in the menus so if your expecting huge things as of this writing, you will be dissappointed.combat is reminisent of sid meiers pirates (specifically the 2004 remake of it) as the ships kind of look like retrofitted ocean liners. you control the ship by giving orders to the crew at their stations depending on what they do on the ship varies the level of interactivity in regards to what you can choose.also the art direction is awesome in this game. it looks great, plays great and aside from the lack of content as of this writing and a few things that can be overlooked as it is in a early release state. this has the makings to be one of the coolest space games around.The developers seem to listen to suggestions and feedback from the community and are active in both the boards on the website and here on steam. this i feel is an early release worth backing and if you like space games, trading sims or the sims, this might be right up your alley.

												Game is pretty awesome. You are captain of a space ship. Hire crew, provide ferry services, fight pirates, deliver cargo.  Your crew have various preferences and will form relationships. If they do not share preferences they will not get along. There is a strategic need to find crew members that are compatible with one enother. There is an RNG factor involved in this. Several different styles of ships with several upgrades - cruisers (speed), fighters (guns), freighters (hull space) - each of these categories have several upgrades. All in all the game is very light weight, quirky, and fun.			"

								This game is basically sims in space, with combat thrown in.you hire your crew - each crew member have different skills and characteristics that can be both good or bad.you trade in stations as with most space sims.there is combat in it and depending on your crew you do get a few options during combat.you can also build rooms within your ship at shipyards and each room has a different purpose.You can also purchase bigger and better ships along the wayand there is actually a research function for discovering new techsAlthough the game is still alittle buggy due to it being early access none of the bugs are game breaking.Personally I am definitely going to recommend this game because it is definitely a game I will spend time playing.Pro'sgood graphicslots of replayabilityinteresting conceptvery fun to actually playa nice paced game that is great to play on those days you just want to chill.Con'strading in the game is way too  easy to make a profit.right now you can play the game without any weapons on your ship at all because you never get attacked except on missions. - put in random encounters.buggy - sometimes goes very slow when alot is happening at one time - isnt my computer as its high spec.dead crew members sometimes stay in your ship and are not removed.right now im giving this a score of 6 out of 10.bottom line - for the price this is a fun space sim that will give you some enjoyment "

												Potential spoilers on gameplay mechanics.Fun little game, goes boring fast. Get it in sale if you like the genre 10 hours of garanteed fun.The good:- Graphics, artstyle: Love it. - Vibe: Gives a good space feeling. A lot of travelling, which is real. Audio is good and helps with this.- Ship management: the minimal space in your ship makes it that you almost always have too few spaces to get everything, which encourages you to apply your best and preferred set up.- Challenging curve in the start to get a new ship.The Bad:-limited interactions, animations: It's the bare minimum. This makes travelling, one of the major parts you will be doing, get boring FAST.-Balance: Two huge flaws:  - Pirate missions reward the most and it's faster to do the low impact missions: less repair costs and you can do more in one time you need to fight a high difficulty enemy, which means you earn more eventually in less time. BREAKS GAME, makes it boring.  - Once you have enough money for a specific level of ship (not spoiling) you will be able to complete the game and progress through. At this point you know you can beat everything, and there will be no need to buy another ship and exploring other worlds does not provide anything.The Ugly: - as mentioned above: many planets and solar systems to explore, but there is no need to find them, except the achievement.- Weird bugs.- fights are limited and sometimes it does not do what you want.So I am mixed, you will have fun but not for long. Buy it if you want 15 hours of play and then change to another type of ship. otherwise NO. Buying in sale is advised.			"

								As of right now, this game crashes. A lot. Let's just get that out of the way. It also auto-saves a lot, too. Sometimes a little annoying on the longer trips, but this is early access folks; not unexpected. If you fall into the niche this game is meant for, you'll love it.I'm still experimenting with this game, but here are some tips:Research the outer rings ASAP. Smuggling slaves is so profitable, you can just throw out max bribes for 80% success and still walk away selling 5 slaves for $25,000 profit. If you don't want to smuggle, you can also trade weapons legally for slightly less profit.Missions are fun, but the rewards need to be rebalanced. Just keep in mind the starter ship is very slow, and you're going to need speed to complete a lot of the more rewarding missions.Space combat doesn't have any appeal right now past destruction missions, so if you're intercepted randomly, just save your ammo and Flee. The restock costs aren't worth it.Room effectiveness depends entirely on placement. Map out your crew's routes hypothetically and place bathrooms, food, and recreational along the way. "

This game is currently still early in development but it's incredibly fun in my opinion. You strat with a bare bones ship. You begin by putting basic rooms in place living cabins, toilets etc. You hire a crew each with their own skills Pilots, cleaners etc. Then you accept missions from job boards be it smuggling illegal items to other planets which you need to try and sneak into the borders, Delivering passengers to other planets to meet their soul mate or simply shipping robot parts. You can also buy items from planets markets that produce items let's say one planet produces art while another planet consumes. You can buy low and sell high. Combine these factors and you can start to make big bucks!If you wish to see some gameplay I have a short gameplay video here where everything goes pretty dreadfully but it gives you an idea :P

Note: This game has been given to me for free for review purposes.OverviewCosmonautica is a space economy simulator in which you take control of a small ship and sail through the galaxies, trading, transporting people, fighting baddies or by doing black market business, and earn money to customize, upgrade and manage your vessel, either by researching rooms and improvements or training your staff (or hiring better ones). Overall, this is a nice game which is what many players wanted to have from a game.The Pros:Humorous - This game has uplifting, groovy music, caricaturized characters, and funny dialogue options. It's clear that this is the kind of loose simulator that doesn't take it too seriously, but surprisingly enough, it is packed with features. I liked that it was able to offer so much versatility while still keeping it fun.The Art Style - One of the first things you notice is the brightly colored, cartoony graphics that the game uses. For some reason it just feels right for what this game is trying to achieve, considering the humorous nature of the game. The game runs very smoothly and has a decent set of graphical options and resolutions.Freedoooom! - The game has two modes: Campaign and Sandbox. Other than that campaign mode has predetermined solar systems and a short questline, whereas sandbox randomises your start and contains no starting questline, they are identical in gameplay and neither restrict you. You are free to do as you please, which is to be expected from a simulation game.Randomised Versatility - There are many missions to undertake, goods to buy and sell, people to hire or fire and galaxies to explore, and the best thing is that this game randomises everything! Proceduraly generated Universe and random missions and crew-for-hire at all space stations.Excellent UI - The user interface is very well made. It manages to remain very organised and intuitive despite the fact that it displays a lot of info. The font is nice, the colors are well used, and it has a hint of Borderlands to it.Steam Integration - Apart from lacking co-op, this game has the basic Steam needs: Achievements, Trading Cards, and most importantly, Steam Cloud.The Cons:Grind Fest! - This game is very fun at first, but then it gets kind of repetitive, especially because everything must be researched!!! And this is an aspect that I really don't get. Ok, you need to research the outer rings of the solar systems in your computer to casually explore it, but why do I need to research an extended bedroom or bathroom or a kitchen, that I won't even install, but the people at the shipyard. It's like passing near Ikea but going to buy raw materials and reverse engineer a piece of furniture, then going to Ikea and have them sell it to you. What?! Also, these researches take time, a lot of time, and during that time you are bound to grind away, trading through space. I wish it was less grindy and a bit... realistic? Also, trading is what you will mostly end up doing throughout the game, so if you like this kind of activity, great! But if you are a more action oriented gamer, this game is not for you.Unsatisfactory Combat - No matter how skilled your crew is, they will somehow find a way to screw battles up. Some of them straight off go to sleep while others fire missiles at the enemy, and sometimes the Pilot will just move in random directions, even fleeing despite the fact that you would clearly win. The combat system needs more polish.You... Don't Exist! - You are a god-like being, almost controling your crew like the Sims, but you don't exist. You don't appear, nor have a room in the space ship. It's like you are telepathically making decisions, which is a little disappointing. I mean, it would have been great to have yourself as a no-fee employee and improve your skills and such over time. But the game and everything in it treats you like you do exist, such as NPCs and mission dialogues.Impossible Perfect Late Game - This game almost tries to tell you that you shouldn't aspire to be the best - because if you do upgrade your ship and your crew to great heights, you will be very sad to find out that your upkeep will be so high, that it's almost impossible to make ends meet.ConclusionSo, is this game worth it? Well, yes and no. I recommend this game to anyone who likes space exploration and trading, and enjoys micromanaging everything, even if you have to do the same things over and over again. People who like trading games will surely like this one. For people who want the complete space experience however, this isn't the game for you. It features lots of great elements from other great games and tries to cram them all in one, but something is still missing. The poorly made battle system and the long wait of pointless research make it enjoyable only for some.If you liked this review or want to see more of my recommended games, you can view all my OCG reviews here, and be sure to follow our curator group:  Original Curator Group "

Early Access Review
								A very interesting and cool game that is similar to FTL.  You can get various people with various skills but you get to buy other crew from other planets but some planets may have better crew than others which is the same for various other things. Travelling to other planets takes a while but you can speed up time and watch your crew do various things and even give them tasks so they don't lose to much morale from being overworked or bored from lack of work. For early access it's very fun and playable with more features to come so I highly reccommend picking it up now as later it will increase in price so if this is your type of game it would be wise not to wait as you also help the development.I give it an 8.5/10 for being unique, fun and full of things to do from missions to just buying some cargo and selling it for more on another planet.YouTube Video:

Posted: February 25, 2015
												EDITED:Released a bit early in my opinion; but it is worth the reasonable pricetag it has. The core is a fancy space trading simulator, with piracy and minimissions tossed in a relatively randomized galaxy. Not completely horrible, but not spectacular either.It still holds some glitches and errors in it - things that should be patched up. But despite that, at its core is a reasonable game for the price.Edit;So you probably want to know more about it - well, its a space sim game. You are a captain of a spaceship and need to decide how to make the most of your ship and crew to get better in the world. And better ships, more monety and all that usual stuff. The tutorial is done well, giving you a purpose and trying to explain how to get further out and explore. But it doesn't hold your hand, you need to at least understand the basics of the ""buy low and sell high"" trading dynamic for the basic profits. Sandbox fits the description with no requirements but your own, and the campaign is not yet done.The gameplay is set very similar to the Sim Tower style of placing rooms inside a ship for the crew needs, then hiring your choice of crew for tasks. You can set the tasks and leisure times of the crew and need to balance it all to run effectively. Don't waste crew overlapping a task when you only need one piloting at a time or cramming the bunk beds cause you didn't realize everyone's off-duty at the same time. So it has some management and planning, but its not quite like the more modern Sims - you don't command the crew directly. Just have them do their tasks and slot the timing. Then watch. The main game is the trading and travel, with the extras on the side.Crew can level up and get better, but the higher levels also mean more needs and demands, and its up to you to supply that for the voyage. You can mitigate some of it by shore leave by staying at stations for a day before a trip, but they may get stressed out on longer trips if you don't have appropriate facilities on board. And that's back to the ship planning and room layout, much like the older Sim Tower as I said. If you ever played that game enough, you'll get this easy. Took me a bitto figure out the staying at a station part, but that was really helpful once I got it - just speed up the ""time"" while docked. You pay the crew for sitting still, but they get relaxed for it better than you usually can on a trip with the ship.Ship travel is selected by you, but the speed is all determined by the pilot skills, if you have a pilot for all 4 shifts, the ship goes faster. But not all skills like that need to be so extensive, and you'll find yourself shuffling the crew roster over time for the right mix of skills as it kind of becomes a test vs the RNG to get the right mix together. Each crewmember also has needs and specials, and you'll find yourself constantly rethinking which crew you have as you may end up with needs you don't want - and overeater can kill your plans for having the cook on board, and a sporty one that needs a fitness room you can't place well can be annoying. But that's back to the shore leave for a solution sometimes, and you'll make do.The primary game is mainly trading, buy low and sell high. You can also become an exclusive transport for passengers or piracy in it, but the game needs some balance between it all for it to work out better. Piracy doesn't pay nearly as well as trading, and passengers can work out but needs some tweaking for the delivery time and rewards to really pay off for the investment. And not all tasks can be done well. Certain crew mixed and ship designes just can't accommodate certain ammounts of passenggers, and the combat is something else...The space travel around the stars are split between 3 rings. The Inner set is the safe zone - no piracy, short trips and easy to get to locations. The Middle has a chance of piracy towards the outter edge, but not frequent. It has longer travels and really requires the ship to start running effectively. The Outer is the hardest. It can have some of the most lucrative trading options out there, but its the hardest to get through with the Piracy almost guarenteed. To gain acess to the rings you need to research it, another crew task, with another room requirement. It can also be used to research other stars to travel to for even more ring research for travel. There is other options for ship and room research, but not implemented as of this writing.Space combat is diferent than you'd expect. You command when the ship fires and activates its short-lived powers availible through certain rooms like hacking or shields. The movement is automatic tho, so its pretty fluid. Damage at this stage in Alpha doesn't mean its a doomed ship when your hull is 0, instead its more work for repair crews and strain for the trip. That and an opposing ship doesn't surrrender to a crippled ship, tho they will run when their health drops low. Perhaps some balance is needed to finish making the danger more real, without it becoming more troublesome. As it is, you need certain rooms that take up space for combat, and each swhip has certain limitations on how many weapon types it can use and where to place them.All and all, its a very promising game. Could use some polish and perhaps more tweaking here and there - but it does the concept well for how it wants to. Definetly one to watch for the future, especially with the intensive dev involvement here.			"

												Well, I was so excited about this game. Bought it (even thought it is early acess) and played and played. Loved the patches and even though the game crashes randomly I played on, saving after big steps. Now I see they have abandoned the game... So because they put out an unplayable, buggy, crashing game I am supposed to just be OK with the ""Oh sorry guys we dont have the ability to fix the game we designed"" Im outraged. BEWARE ANY BUYER TO THIS GAME. This should be a warning to anyone buying early acess games. You will get screwed, the days of helping devs are gone they are just after money and dont give a crap about the craft.			"

												When I saw this game it had a good basic trading system, with a few jobs with the flavor text re-used many times, and acess to basic rooms and ships.  I assumed that the developers would add more ships, rooms, meaningful staff interactions and events to the game.  I was wrong.  The basic rooms were strung along in a research system that, although interesting and fun in concept with better endgame, added nothing but waiting to use basic rooms.  The staff interactions saddened me the most. Passively the only effect here is that everyone spends 40% of their time pooping.  Actively events happen and then you get 2-4 dialogue options which as far as I know don't do a thing.  I was hoping for characters to get in spats or at least make decisions that impacted their lives in some way other than giving them enough pills and bathrooms. Right now you will just fly the same routes doing the same missions over and over, grinding, grinding, grinding.  This game had a lot of potential, but exited early access in the same form as when I started playing it.TLDR: repetative, grindy, does not live up to my expectations.			"

												Started out good but from the devs own mouths ""they are working on a different project now"" - so nothing has been done with this since March 2016. Last few changes they have made have left the game almost unplayable for more than about 15 minutes.I would NOT recommend this game until the dev team starts caring about it again. In its current version its just plain NOT FUN.			"

Early Access Review
								If you played FTL (Faster Than Light) then you'll love Cosmonautica. Its basically a micromanagement space game that allows you to hire your crewmates, explore uncharted planets, and kit out your ship. This is rapidly becoming my most favorite indie game in 2014. I bought it during the Steam Winter Sale, and have already put somewhere along the lines of 25 hours into this game. The music is pretty snazzy too!			"

Early Access Review
								I don't have a lot of hours logged into this game yet, nor have I completed the campaign. Still I have had fun playing this, as well as fustration.Gameplay consists of the player being the captain of a starship with your goal being to amass as much money as you can. Your ship travels through the galaxy with you being able to view it and your crew in an ant farm type view. The missions offered on the different stations provide the most stable source of income, but you can try your hand at playing the trabing game between imports and exports. Or if your ship is set up in the right way you can set out to hunt down pirates or smuggle illegal goods.Here is something that I was disappointed about. You can't capture criminals, there is a bounty-like system but it isn't as gratifying as it should be. Nor do you need to deal with people trying to raid your shipments. Pirates like to pick fights with you but if you bribe them they just leave you alone.While I'm on the topic here are some other things I didn't like:-no character avatar. Sorry capt'n you're just the ghost of the ship-you don't interact with the crew. You are limited to setting the work schedule and the promotions. Can't be having the      pilot and the cook go off for alone time ya' know? -battles don't have much finesse about them. Maybe because you're supposed to be a trading vessel but still.-You can't pick a career. What if I wanted to be a pirate huh?-There isn't much to do when traveling between worlds--(this is the big one) In sandbox mode you can't change any of the settings. Random really means random.I have a small gripe about always pulling into a space station, but I don't think it's that big of a game killer.But it's not all bad. There are some things that were pretty good:+The trading system is pretty diverse and believable +Your crew can be as diverse or inclusive as you want. A greater option of aliens would have been nice.+Humor isn't obnoxious, nor are the pop culture references unlike some other games.+challenge curve gets kind of steep, but never feels unfair.Unless there's a curve ball down the line this game will get rather tedious fast unless you can learn to enjoy the challenge. Even though I listed more negatives than positive I like this game for my own reasons and I recomend this to everyone, even if only to try it out a little. Bottomline: don't think about where it came from, just take the money and run!			"

												No more early access for a while...So this is what happens if somebody takes your money and doesn't finish the thing they set out to do. Thanks for taking the cash though. At least that part of the deal got finished.Apart from that, decent idea, fun for a while, but nowhere near finished. I think, part of the enjoyment was projecting what it *should* (and, of course, soon *would* do). Knowing that this is as it is going to be, stay away. There are still better things even while on sale.			"

												I really tried to like this game, but it really would not let me.Pro: nice conceptcon: pretty much anything elsespace fights are boring as hell (sloooow),  also the rest of the game is quite dull. And when you think it might be okay, the game just crashes. Often. Like very often and just randomly. Also some parts of the game just don't work how they are supposed to. Example: When you are low on money, the game suggests you should make the switch to a smaller space ship. BUT: you can not sell your old ship. Instead you have to pay the smaller ship, lose your bigger old ship but don't get any refund for it. The result would then be, you have a smaller ship and less money then before. I don't really think that's how it's meant to work.Taking all that into consideration, the game seems very unfinished. Also the devs pretty much just told that they won't update the game anymore, because they are busy with their new game. So you get an unfinished game, that will never be more than it is now. Would not buy again. And would not buy any other games from this dev.			"

												Minor good part :+ The idea space ship management is kinda ok, you can be pirate, you can be trader, you can be transporter, you can be smuggler with kinda good gameart.+ The random generated appearance of the crew is good... but need more base model, I found like total 8, 4 for human m&f...or maybe more...Minor bad part :- Sometimes missing UI sound fx.- Crew sometimes gone missing.- Crew sometimes idle too much.Bad part : - Boring at traveling, you almost do nothing here and the thing make it worst is the traveling time is long enough to make me think ""jir, what the hell am I buying this game for?..."" (you know a few seconds different is too long for game with nothing to do).- Confusing travel system. I meant when I go to pretty far planet, the time I need is only like 3 days in-game time, but when I travel to a nearby planet I need like 7 days in-game time... and vice versa... the hell. And I can't decide my ship go left or right, annoying eh, why annoying? cus example if go left of the sun orbit you clearly see that is to far from your target planet but the game tends to take that route .... bam!!! *flying keyboard* DIE YOU STUPID AI! - You can not directly order a crew. So if there is emergency you can't take that being number one priority immediately.Note := No estimated times for multiple docking, no estimated prices, so if you need to deliver a requested good/s can be screwed often by not delivering it on time or the goods you needed are puking expensive than the reward you received, means no profit after the long journey. Dammit!!!= There is 8 different job skills cleaner, repairer, pilot, scientist, medic, shooter, hacker, cook= I think the max crew member is 8.= 10 different ship at the store with each of them had its own slot for Rooms, Turret, Cannon, Torpedo. But some does not at all of specific slot like no Torpedo or no Cannon or both.= More room type need to be researched first before able to use, but after finish it you need to buy it from someone store... okay, buying for the material I guess...= Only 3 type of weapons as the slot of ship described with each of it own ammunition... yeah rather boring with no variant.= If you think there is mining mechanic, then you got wrong game, this game only buy, sell or take by force... pirate... thing...= Each solar system consist 3 rings with each ring contain a number of planets. ring 2 and ring 3 are locked and need to be researched first. = Shield of the ship are not active all the time, kinda like some skill in MMO, need player command to activate it for a few seconds and cooldown. And in order the ship can use shield, player must have a shield room type and a hacker or maybe a other crew, ugh I forgot.= Very often what items/goods production in description of planet is not there when you really need them for completing your delivery mission even after your try to search it to a far away planet, and if your patient meter is not that high, I suggest steer away from this game.  I got more than 20 hours of play-time are because when still in early-access I really support this game development, so every update I always try till I got bored... and now? things are not that great so yeah I'm not bother trying to get a single game achievement yet.Result : just boring traveling, and the battle is not as fun as it look like. The trader job is too, not that fun and rewarding... if you lured by the screenshots in the steam store, better look for friend and ask to borrow from him\her.not recom from me, but I do hope someone else creating this kind of game but with a lot of improvements. But thanks to the dev for trying, I know it's hard making a game for pleasing everyone, except you created it for your own enjoyment huehuhehehehehe.			"

												I got this game in a Humble Bundle, but I still think I payed too much. First of all, most of the things that earn you money in this game are based on RNG. Seriously? There's no strategy involved if I'm just going to lose $15000 after leaving a planet because I was ""speeding,"" something which I had ABSOLUTELY NO CONTROL OVER BECAUSE I DON'T EVEN PILOT THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SHIP. 4/10, like Sid Meyer's Pirates but♥♥♥♥♥♥(and in spaaaaaaace!)

												I like the idea behind Cosmonautica, but it just wasn’t executed very well. The main problem with the game is that everything feels pointless and there is nothing to it. Most of your time is spent flying from station to station, and there isn’t much of anything to do while traveling except for watching your crew walk around the ship. After obtaining the best ship in the game, which takes at most 5 hours, there isn’t much of anything else to do in the game except continuing to fly around and gain money. It is also very easy as your crew never dies, morale is very easy to manage, and combat can be completely avoided.Video showing some gameplay:

												I liked the mechanics of the game except for there's nothing much deeper than the surface which was wildly disappointing, combine that with the fact that a game I spent hours on was ruined by bugs and there's no way to resolve it. I Ignored the bad reviews and bought the game anyway. I completely regret that decision, I could have spent it on a more deserving game.			"

												You start without knowing how to make showers to put in your ship, leaving the beginning of the game a fun time of striking crew members, to include the Research specialist, who leave your ship and drag out the ability to make and install showers in order to meet their needs.I don't recall it being this frustrating when I last played it when it was in Early Release.I can't recommend this for anyone any longer.

								This is one hell of a game already, and I can't wait to see it develop further, but... let's start with the begining.Cosmonautica is a unique combination of many genres. You need to manage the space and modules on your ship, you need to hire/fire/promote (or simply: manage!) your crew, get missions, trade, think, if needed - fight. All the things you do have even visual impact on your ship (which can currently be customised in terms of what facilities it has, where they are placed, but also in terms of visuals, and more features such as customizable crew uniforms are coming!), which isI' great, and reminds me of the games from my childhood in early 90's.As said - it does remind me of the games from my childhood - it combines the traits of sea faring games with the fun factor of management sims such as Airline Tycoon, and all that with a pinch of interstellar adventure.. it's almost as if Privateer met Airline Tycoon, with just a bit of Pirates! for the taste ;).I'm really impressed with this game, and I only started playing it. I believe it's definitely worth 10 Euro to pay for, as it's already very enjoyable.So... don't hesitate, buy it, and have fun!			"

								I absolutely adore this game, it has everything I love about games in it. It has different values for different products made and consumed by different planets (for new players you want to remind yourself ""buy green, sell red""), it has a nice combat system, and a very fun sandbox mode.Now for the negatives, IT IS GLICHY! I crash every 10 minutes, during combat people run in place and teleport across the ship, when going across the galaxy your ship takes the longest route possible, and the looting system lets you take more cargo from a ship then they have.All in all, this game has tons of potential, but still needs some content fixes.

												I played the Game not as much as other here did, but i can understand both camps.The Game is playable at it's current state of development, but there also a lot of Bugs and a Lag of Content. There are 3 Types of Ships only with 3 Different Classes (exclusive the Beginner Ship)You only have a few Rooms and most of time only updates for the Rooms and no UpgradesYou have 3 Different Types of Weapons but no Weapons ChoicesThe Research takes to Short for my Opinion (after 3-5 Hours you have the half of all Rooms and Updates)You can't save by Your-own, the Game saves everytime before a Battle, Landing on a Station or take-offThe grafik seemed not to be made for HDsome of random events are funny, some do nothing, some get on my nerves and some just waste my time.So is it Good? i think no.Is it Bad? and again no.it's an indy-game, nothing to play the whole time, but if you want to skip time, and have fun on Spacecraft-Sims this ist one right choice. If you search for an Full-SpaceCraft-Sim you are wrong here, it's an indy. If you search an economy-sim you are wrong again, yes it have part of economys, huge parts but its not a full-economy-game.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is very similar to a childhood game I really enjoyed playing called Psi-5 Trading Company, so I'm quite excited to see a new spin on an old favorite.  I'm sure there's a few tactics to game play I've still to figure out, but overall I am enjoying the game.  Granted the game is still in early access, but there's a few minor things I'd like to see polished and improved upon.1) The crewman are worse than real life humans, spending more time away from work than actually doing their work.  In the four shifts available, they cannot stay at their station for a single shift.  Even giving them but one shift to work and 3 off, they are late to arrive and must leave early to eat, sleep, or be merry.  I've clustered these rooms together for efficiencies but that doesn't appear to help resolve any issues.  Tighten up the reigns on these slackers a bit, I should at least overwork them before they leave their shifts early.2) Combat needs to slow down time.  Currently entering combat time just keeps flying by, taking 4 or 5 days to complete a single encounter.  Crewman are abandoning posts to eat, dump, and sleep, and rightfully so if you've got to sit at a turret for 5 days.3) Galaxy map needs more tools, mainly to flag if visited and how much research has been done.  Once I left my starting galaxy, I was never able to find it again or the galaxy keeps resetting to unexplored each time I left it.Otherwise, I'm enjoying this managment style of game.			"

												I know there are a lot of negative reviews, but I did enjoy this game for about 45 hours of play.  I feel like one of the benchmarks of a good management / sim game is replay value or just total content in-general (how long does it take before you have the ""I have seen all there is to experience in this game"" feeling).  With that in mind,  I do agree with the positive reviews that state this game could use more content.+Great visuals.  Great concept.  This game is time / crew / ship management.  The different ships you can use and different planets / systems you can visit are nice.-Needs more content.  Combat is much better than EA but could still use some work (IMO).  I had occasional crashes from long play sessions or jumping into other systems (no progress lost).  I wish there were more speed options: normal seems too slow and fast-forward seems too fast.Overall, I thought it was fun but lacked polish.  I'm giving it a thumbs-up because I had fun (isn't that the best deciding factor?), but the short playtime means that serious sim / management players will be disappointed by shallowness.			"

Early Access Review
								I am really enjoying this addictive little space sim.  The atmosphere is relaxing and casual. There are a lot of bugs still as this is in early access and the game crashes every so often (sometimes frequently). That being said I have enjoyed it thoroughly in early access. I recommend it to anyone who gets in the mood to play games like The Sims or Banished as both of these games are addictive, relaxing, and have a respectively low learning curve as compared to some more complicated city builders out there. Right now it is enjoyable enough discovering the best strategy to earn more income to upgrade your ship, give crew members raises, or hire more crew members. As they gain experience they have increasing needs beyond the basic fulfillment of hunger, sleep, hygiene, toileting. If they are unhappy or do not have their needs met they will become sick and unable to work. It oftentimes becomes a balance to build items/rooms that meet their needs vs. items/rooms that can generate more income.  More specific ways to generate income beyond general trading of items from one planet to another include: delivering passengers planet to planet, smuggling of illegal goods/persons, and space combat. These are some of the dynamics you will find as far as gameplay is concerned. I look forward to more content in the future.			"

												I would like to recommend this game as a cute time passer in a genre that hasn't had a really good contender I'm aware of since Space Lanes in the late mid-90s.  It seems to have all the right pieces for making a fun game, but at it's current, no longer early access, stage, I cannot recommend it for 1 reason.It lacks any form of instruction manual, documentation on how to play or tutorial... So, it simply does not tell you how to play it, and though 80% of it is pretty intuitive, that leaves about 20% of the game that leaves even a veteran gamer like myself going WTF?(Added: I keep seeing claims in the forums that there is a tutorial that makes perfect sense, though even some that say that say they needed to read every message from your ship's robo-bird at least twice to catch it... The supposed tutorial is imbedded in the rest of the chatter in the game and I found it hard to follow, and sorely lacking in anything but the most basic instructions.)			"

Not a reason to avoid the game if it is your thing.			"

								Good lord, this game is wonderful. If you enjoyed ""Startopia,"" or the ancient ""Commander Blood,"" then you are going to LOVE Cosmonautica. Long have I searched for a lighthearted life-in-space game which allowed you broad fredom of play choice. Cosmonautica fits the bill deliciously well. Robots, aliens, starships, space-stations, interstellar commerce, space-piracy, ship combat; this game runs right down my wishlist of features. It sates my yearning for immersive high sci-fi, without being dreary. I cannot recommend this game highly enough.			"

								Well here's a fun little space trader. You go around, hire some crew, assign them, and watch them do stuff.You have some pretty basic ship customization here. The interior can be rearranged however you like. There are a pretty good amount of options avaliable already for what type of ship you want to pilot. Will you be a trader or a taxi service? Pirate or bounty hunter? Your ship design will reflect how well your crew perform at the job, so don't place the ammo too far from the guns. Instead of hyperdrives and wormholes, you travel by the gravitation pull of each planet. Pretty nifty concept. Resources aren't such a problem you'll ever get stuck somewhere, and there's lots of ways to make money so you'll always feel like you're moving forward. The music and sound are decent enough, and I like the colorful graphics, though no boundries are getting broken in any of those departments. All in all this is shaping up to be a solid little space sim.			"

												First came The Sims, then Sims Medieval, and now it's...SIMS IN SPACE!Or at least that's what you'll instantly think when you start this game.It's a relaxing, casual space-faring game of trading, building skills, taking care of the needs of your crew and optional combat missions. You don't need to fight at all if you don't want to, but as of the time of this review, the Easy Combat mission, which constantly gets offered at various stations is a veritable quick and easy ATM machine to print money for ships and upgrades.Looking past that one flaw...or feature, depending on how you look at it...the game will easily fill the occassional itch of armchair space captains who just want to wander space completely on their own terms and play style. It has both a storymode and sandbox mode, and all of the ports of call have missions to undertake if you feel so inclined. If not, then just fill you holds with cigarettes and beer and head out.Has a multitude of solar systems to discover, quite a few ship layouts in three basic styles; trader, cruise ship, or warship and many room types and upgrades.All in all, a fun, relaxing, casual space-faring romp for those players who just want to play the way they personally enjoy, and really, what can be better than that?

												I regret buying this game. While I want to love it, there's so many things its bad at, it sucks the enjoyment out of the game.  TL:DR : Bad balence, bad optimisation, and crash ridden. Don't waste your money.Edit: As of the most recent patch (1.1.8) which has taken nearly 2 months since the games launch, none of the crash bugs I've experienced have been fixed. Its still bug ridden and one to avoid.Edit 2: As of patch 1.1.9, which claims to have fixed the crash bugs, i'm still getting crashes every 20 minutes or so of gameplay.The overall concept is good. Get ship, hire crew, travel galaxy, make money, upgrade ship, uncover mystery, repeat. Unfortuantely almost every aspect of that falls flat. If you don't have a crew with matching needs, they will end up fighting and going on strike. Trading is a grind with a pretty much none existant economy. Transport the highest cost goods the planet exports to another and you will make profit. Upgrading your ship? I'd completely finished the research tree before leaving the starter system. And combat? Its either laughably easy or a total grind. There is no in between ground with it.The game promised to be 'Sims in Space' with an upgradable ship and trading. What you get is 'grind while you wait'. Its repetative, overly simplistic and dull with little to no replay value. So your hours in game? My time was spent having to restart or reload nearly every 20 minutes as the game WILL crash at some point no matter what your doing. Buying goods? Game will Crash. Upgrading Ship? Game will crash. Just flying at low speed through space? Game will crash.Its badly optimised, badly balenced and a bad waste of money.			"

								Although I would like to like this game , as of now in development ( Oct. 23 2014), I can not reccomend it. It was fun for a few hours, but after that, I found alot of unfinished items, and was boring.For the sim like experience they don't do or are effected by much, they: eat, sleep, poop (alot), and do their work thing. What buggs me about this, is if they are not doing thier work at the time it is needed for an outcome, such as hacking to reduce the chance of being caught doing illigal stuff it does not matter paying for them to tag along. All you really need is a pilot, a robot cleaner and a robot repair. Simes: Medic: useless, Repair and cleaning: replaced by bots, Shooter: combat broken so uselessCombat: I made a fully equiped combat version of the combat ship, fitted it out and had multiple shooters, hacker, pilot. Results were that it is nearly impossible to hit pirates, by the time you get thier shields low your pilot is done, can't fly and they all have to poop , eat, and sleep, so they are incapasitated so navigation is zero. All I ever do now is flee and sometimes that don't work because the pilot navigation will go down due to over exhaustion. Trade: buy green arrowed items, sell red arrowed items. Other than that there is no real way of determining if something will be very profitable other than the planet arrows. Illigal trade, need a hacker to get you past cops that ""randomly"" check you every time you carry an illigal item.Passengers, make sure you can get to the destination on time before you accept and if you need to go pick them up somewhere else first.Science: researching the only thing availabe in the game which is planet discovery is not very useful. Trade there is the same so the cost of going there in crew costs is not worth it really, and they expect you to deliver mission items in the same period of time as closer planets so alot of them are impossible. All other research is not there and unfinished.Game crashed on me 3 times so far. This is a 1/2 gb game... wtf? I have a new msi 2013 gamming laptop with a dedicated card that can play most anything and should not crash my entire desktop. It works on the intigrated graphics as well when it don't crash. Have had artifacts of other menues when switching from one to another.Last thing I would say is there is not alot of customization really other than filling th room slots, so once your rich , there is nothing to upgrade, and no reason to upgrade. Like I said, boring.  Unless there is a ton more work done to make this more dynamic and make the combat work, I cant see it getting better, even with the patches making the game to it's targeted 100%. I dont think It has alot of replay value. Devs should play some sim titles  / cities to give them an idea or two and eve online.  I would also suggest a turn based combat system since it would mabe work better, feel fair, and mabe suspending the sim toilet, sleep, food, requirements while its going on. GL.			"

												I bought this game when it was on sale because... well lets be honest, it looks good and has some funny aspects to it including the character descriptions. I have put a few hours into it, but only a few for a very good reason. While the game has a lot of potential, at this time, it is still extremely unstable as I have suffered multiple crashes. Highlighting planets can crash it. Entering a space station can crash it. Trying to view your crew menu can crash it. Entering combat can crash it. That said, it runs very well for quite some time, then crashes. Try doing something else and it instantly crashes. It seems extremely random as some times it can run for a couple of hours without issue, while other times it can't go ten minutes without blowing it's own brains out. THAT aside... I still can't say I reccomend the game. I wouldn't say not to play it as it can be fun, but I can't really endorse it either. I have spent 3 times as long playing the campaign as I have in playing sandbox. I have progressed 5 times further in sandbox than the campaign. For whatever reason the campaign while designed to be a tutorial, seems to rather just be an entirely crippling handicap. It's very frustrating because while it entertaining to play and I would love to spend more time on it, but between the irregular crashes and the entire handicap of the campaign I just can't get into it. If they can figure out how to release a more stable version, I might be interested. The campaign though is SOOOO crippling that it isn't even funny.			"

												Good idea. Good enviroment. Good potential.Bad gameplay.First of all, it's mosty about trading. Buying some stuff for cheap and selling high. It does not matter what you buy, trading goods (even illegal weapons) have no use except for selling. Names or types of the goods that you carry are not important. You just buy it from a planet's shop owner and sell to another. Actually, all the planets are the same: same shop and the same salesman. The whole universe, except for the planet icons on the map, all the same. Same dock, same station, same shop, same armory.The campaign and the story is also not complex nor dedicated. It's just some elements from the sandbox mode.So, what you do in this game universe are, also limited:- Buy some goods and sale them.- Carry some passangers to another planet.- Shoot some bad guys and their ships down. (Totally random. The ships and their captains always change. eg, if you're after -let's say- smuggler Xenopod, each time you catch his ship, or her, it's a different ship with a different guy/girl claiming to be Xenopod..Combat scenes are a bit entertaining, but since it has no purpose at all but earning some money and loot, gets boring.There are alien races.

												This game has so much potential, but it gets under my skin at the path finding ability and a few other things. Many times I've lost missions, profits, and time because for some reason this game will chart a path to loop around the ENTIRE solar system before landing on a planet that is RIGHT NEXT TO YOU.  So what should have taken maybe 2 cycles becomes a 7-8 cycle trip. This game is not enjoyable in it's current state. Might visit again later when this whole path finding issue is resolved.			"

												I cannot in good conscience advise this game to anyone. The game runs too well to claim that it is broken ... but barely. Every 1-2 hours of playing you will crash, there is no avoiding it. Reload from the last auto-save, do every action you did before the crash and you will crash again, forcing you to change the way you want to play, resulting in failing missions and losing credits. There is no use for me to go in detail about the game (enough reviewers before me have done that),  just know that this game is as stable as a Reliant Robin.			"

You can be a rich trader or space pirate. The battle aspect is unique and i very like it, like FTL you need to manage your ship while fighting your enemies.			"

												OK so there's plenty of bad and good for this game. Let me lay my opinion on the line here from a couple of hours of initial gameplay (Which I have no doubt will grow to a few more [albeit modest] hours in the future)This is a casual game by far. In that sense I've personally found it rather zen. You've no doubt gotten a fair idea of what the gameplay is. You manage a crew in a basic sense aboard your vessel. You travel around, first, one solar system trading, smuggling and fighting to accrue money. This cash goes towards bigger vessels and more capability to extend your activities further abroad. Beyond that overall premise, you have to manage the crew you use to staff said craft and their relationships and needs. As they become more skilled they require more effort to keep them satisfied (A feature which, thanks to a recent addition of bonuses, you can come close to bypassing to an extent early on if the money is flowing),If you are someone like me that's happy to provide a narrative (Other Dwarf Fortress and Paradox Grand Strategy players will understand) for the game you'll enjoy this, but superficially. There's plenty of capacity to do so but it is provided with a quite limited depth.There's a comedic element to the game which works quite well, but I personally don't take that in too much as (as mentioned above) I enjoy supplying my own narrative to the game. That being said it provides a level of enjoyment to the game even if it can be found to reduce the 'immersion' factor.To give a TL;DR overview though, if you are looking for a relaxing game set around Captaining a ship and crew while jaunting around getting into whatever adventures you see fit, this is a great game to destress to. If you want more complexity in your zero-G adventuring, check out the X series or EVE online.All being said and done, with the above caveats, I will recommend this title as a simple, enjoyable and satisfying experience. Additionally, the devs seem to be taking comments on board and working to adjust gameplay in an ongoing fashion.PS. A couple of things that I think this game requires:- The ability to speed up time to a greater extent- More intricate and involved crew requirements and procedural command events (There are some, I hope there will be more as I go on)Overall, once again, I've found this a relaxing and satisfying game. It will likely get repetative in the future (And I will update my review accordingly) however that's the lot of a ship captain in reality isn't it? Haul cargo, wash rinse and repeat with a dash of combat and smuggling to make it interesting. If the devs continue to update accordingly, it will continue to satisfy unless you're looking for an ultra-deep and complex experience. In that case, look elsewhere.			"

												Update 1.1.8:Pros: -Interesting game art style-Interesting story arcCons:-Frequent crashes through mid campaign (5 times per game restart)-Story is too long and repetitive-Dry humor-Imbalanced game mechanic with combat/trading/stealth (e.g. game will generate missions to planets that are blocked because of failed stealth missions.)-Stealth has a limit that you can only base on one room and one crew-Game length is too long and alot of grinding is required-Money making missions that are not part of the campaign are extremely long and repetitive-Pirates sometimes bug into the fight mode when you dock on a planet (around 1/25 chance per planets docked)-Game is inflexable to player choice, i.e. you will not be able to bring your favorite ship to the final boss, because the boss can run away and fail your game.The worst part I find is that because of the inflexibility of the game; You cannot fight the boss with your favorite ship (freighter-tank build) so you will not be able to finish the campaign part of the game, because the boss can run away, and the game will ""game over"" you.2/10Would never play again.

												A really amazing game.  Build your own crew, customize your own ship. Be a trader, a cruise ship, or a stone cold killer.  Mix and match those roles in your ship's floor plan.  My favorite part is the detail.For example, but your ammo depot close to your turret or it takes the gunner longer to get a box of ammo.Still a bit buggy for sure. Sometimes wrong genders are assigned to dialog, or if you right click an icon it just stays ghosted on the screen until you restart the game.Overall it's addictive fun.			"

When I tried to do a combat mission the game crashed.

								Kinda fun, but far from finished. The music and graphics compliment themselves very well. You can delegate tasks between crew members. You can also fast forward the speed of time during travel which is nice, especially when you have a set-up you can't tinker with until you get more money (or whatever).But since the main goal seems to be to get the most money, the game falls a bit short. It's difficult to get an idea of how trading works as the tutorial (not only crashed on me when I played it) but didn't explain the concept very well. Additionally, I found that the ""most effecient"" way to find out what planet wanted what, was to write down the things for sale on the planet I was on, then click each other planet to see if I could see it there. The missions available at the bars vary, but the difficulty level seems to ramp up pretty quick, if it ramps at all. Some missions (escort) that I've seen were not physically possible. On one occasion I was supposed to pick up someone on Limepine and take them to Chockpern. The mission gave me 5 days to accomplish this. It was only after I stopped at the first planet did I realize it would take me 6 days to make the trip. So I failed the mission with .06 Space Time left. Even more frustrating, I saw the same mission on offer once I got to Chockpern for half the pay with enough time (6 days). There are a few graphical glitches (but if you advance the speed it's hard to notice). In the bottom right-hand corner of the screen are the stats of your crew. It's hard to see how they're getting on, as the color indicating their status is a really REALLY light grey. And you won't notice you're in trouble until they reach the top and turn bright red. I'll keep playing though, I've enjoyed it so far and there's going to be an update 2 days from now (10-28-14). I look forward to giving this game a proper review on my youtube channel once it's done.			"

								I have played a game for over 3 hours now and liked it quite a bit. I can see a great potential and I am very happy with the speed at which development is progressing. Game is already playable and also there is still a lot to do like implement galaxies and more research for a price it is good buy for anyone. Cosmonautica is kept I light relaxing tone and is something you could play with your kids on the Saturday afternoon easily without being worried about any bad influences. I think however that game could benefit from some changes especially how the time is handled. Being able to pause the game and speed it up more than at current level would help a lot in handling times when you are just flying in space doing nothing. Or when you need to plan something carefully but don't want to pay for few days of crew salaries. Other thing I noticed was problems with buying new ships while in full cargo. You have to sometimes travel to 2-3 planets to get rid of cargo before you can buy new ship.I have done first impression video of a gameplay and first 45 min  of tutorial so you can have a look how games look like and decide for yourself if it's worth it.

My biggest problem with the game is that it crashes constantly and for no apparent reason. Another large reason is that there isn't much there gameplay wise and not much to aim for. So it's mostly just grinding for the next ship. As a whole it feels more like a decent tablet game then a pc one. There is a lot of potential here but since from what I can see the developers have pretty much dropped this game then I can't in a good consience recomend this game even if I had a bit of fun with it so save your money there is plenty of better games out there in the same price bracket.

												It has game breaking  mechanic  that if encountered will render your game uncontinuable.SPOILER: Basically if you're a trader and have a cargo type class ship you can't runaway from a specific encounter because you're ship isn't far away enough (even if you flee for 20 minutes.) Worse is that crew will usually go away from post because of sleep mechanic during fight, and you're basically stuck in a forever fight. Event seems to dictate fleeing as the only option; I've tried fighting but no damage is dealt.I mean if it's a forced event, the game shouldn't rely on regular gameplay triggers to continue the campaign.It's too bad, because I did enjoy the simple mechanics of the game, else I wouldn't have logged past 10 hours. I asked for a refund, not sure if/when I get it but I've logged around 18 hours.Bugs I can forgive (if not game shattering) I mean who writes perfect code. Difficulty I won't complain about. Mechanic that breaks the game, that's just bad design.			"

								Hello,I've noticed a few bugs so far:1. When I resumed a saved game, all of my crew were standing on the roof of my ship running in place, I also saw this happen to a youtuber who played this game.2. Whenever I finish combat, my ship no longer has a destination anymore and is just floating in space. I'm not sure if this is a bug, or if you just designed it that way...3. Although this only happened once in 5 hours, one time when I went to a store to sell things, the slider still slid back and forth with my mouse after I stopped clicking, leading to the problem that the accept button is all the way on the right, so i couldn't sell. Accepting the 'sale turned into a purchase' didn't fix it, niether did leaving and coming back, quiting and restarting worked though4. Right after the bug above happened, I experienced an issue where when I clicked on one of my crew members, the portrait suddenly started following my mouse, and I couldn't place it anywhere. Going to the NODE (which was my origional purpose) didn't fix it, niether did going to the orbital map and back, quiting and restarting did fix it however.The music is great, the graphics are great, the gameplay is fun and addicting - although i'm not sure if it's lucrative to be a transport ship in this game: it takes up 2 cargo room for seating and you only get paid very little for the inconvinience it does to your trade. There aren't enough transport missions to be only a transport ship, and being a mix makes it harder to trade with little payoff for transporting. I reccommend just increasing transport mission pay by 1-2000 and having at least 1 guarenteed in every port. Overall this is shaping up to be a fun space game where you can be a Bounty Hunter, Smuggler, Pirate, an honest Space Trader or a Cruiseliner captain, as long as the bugs get fixed and they install the new technology trees :D			"

Unfortuantly this is a work in progress and it crashes, ALOT. I'm hoping the devs get that worked out soon so I can experiance all this game has to offer.			"

								It tool me roughly 5hrs to buy, research and try everything that's possible (I think). That's good for a early access title, because it means it has some content in it and further more, I was motivated to check out everything.Big thanks to the developers! To a prospect buyer: It's early access, the prologue is mediocre, the game mechanics are a bit too simple, but it shows a lot of promise. Hard to say if it's worth $10 at the moment. But if your into Theme Hospital in Space, give it a try!			"

												It's billed as a 'Space Trading Adventure', but this buggy game is a poor port of a poor mobile game, with very little adventure and very little trading.On the surface, it seems interesting. You have to keep your interstellar crew happy while they zip around the galaxy, fighting and trading. So it has a Sims aspect to it. But here, as in so many other areas, the execution is poor. As your 'Sims' level up, they demand more amenities to keep them happy. But once you install the required room on your ship, the problem goes away, forever. There is no tension involved. Crew unhappy, buy room, problem solved. The whole game is like this. At the beginning of the game, you want a shooter who can also clean or repair, so they always have a job. So this is a bit of leveling up strategy, or someone to look for when hiring crew. But later in the game, you can get robots to do the menial work, removing the need to bother with it. Strategy removed.As for the trading, it doesn't make sense. Some planets consume, some produce. But there is no overview of this. What's more, it's not very lucrative, compared to...Combat. Here is where the game is completely broken. Combat involves 'tapping' buttons at the right time. There's not much to it. But compared to trading, it's insanely profitable. There really is no reason to trade. Once you have their hull down to 15%, they will be on the phone to you, offering 40k, 50k, 60k to let them live. Compared to the 7k you can make hauling cigarettes across the map and back. And once you've figured this out, in a matter of hours you'll have the most expensive ship in the game. And then, there is no game anymore.Yes, there's a story, whatever.Finally, it crashes. A lot. There are in game bugs as well.Stay away.			"

								SO FAR SO GOODThe base mechanics of the game are already in place, but certainly need some polish. The visual assets however, are already in a polished state. The game is basically like an ant farm in a spaceship. You can manage your crew by assigning them work shifts and having them make use of their specific traits and skills. The missions and economy still need work, as well as the combat mechanics, but overall this is shaping up to be a solid game. "

												I don't suggest this game. It sounds neat, and some of the concepts are neat, but it simply doesn't come together. It's moderately buggy, with the android version not functioning at all, and the Windows version occasionally exploding into a kalidoscope of rainbow polygons.Space trading with an emphasis on crew management seems pretty neat. However, controls, information and how to play is extremely vague, requiring lots of experimentation, and is about as much fun as sprinting through a room with your eyes shut and your shoes off as a method of finding all the furniture.

												I love the idea of this game, but the implementation leaves a lot to be desired. I can not recommend this game.Cosmonautica does a lot of things right, unfortunately it does several critical things wrong.  The humor, the graphics, the sound, the visuals are all spot on and to be admired. It's a fun game to get into. But once you do, and get a little bit into the game, the flaws begin to show through and severely limit your ability to play.The biggest flaw I came across was a severe lack of balance and difficulty. This is a simple change that could be fixed with the addition of a difficulty slider. See, when you have a game where you trade for credits, that economic model needs to be spot on. Unfortunately even if you do everything 100% correct, the profit margins on trading are razor thin.In two hours of play, making only positive trades, I barely was able to re-attain the amount of capital (20k credits) I started the game with as seed money. Another hour and a half later and I was still only around the 30k. Now on it's own, this might be acceptable for some. A game where you have to micromanage razor thin profit margins and grind out credits might be acceptable. But this was all while I was making perfect trades and always turning profit. If you take a loss, at any time, it's absolutely devastating. After 3.5 hours play I got stopped by a cop and had a 15% chance of getting caught. RNG came up and I got caught. This caused me to fail my current quest, which penalized me credits, lost all my cargo, and was banned from that world for 15 days. The effects of this were absolutely devastating to my game, knocking me down well below the 20k mark just to get to a new planet, refitted, and get a new hold of cargo. IE one random chance event, that could only happen 3 out of 20 times, and I'd lost around two hours of gameplay.The further issue in the game is in the absolutely horrible combat system. You run out of ammo FAR too quickly, far more quickly than you can possibly take out even the weakest of pirates.  Forget about harder difficulty ships, you don't stand a chance. Ramming doesn’t even work, because the AI can avoid you forever.I think Cosmonautica has the potential for a good game, but it feels like an unfinished beta at this point.  I would HIGHLY recommend against buying this game at the current state it's in.  (v1.2)			"

												This game sounded very interesting to me, but I quickly became bored and frustrated with it.  The trading was difficult and was more like gambling than a valid means of progressing in the game.  One might assume that buying a product in a location that was producing a resource, and then selling it at a location that desired the resource would provide at least a minimal profit.  Not so... it is quite easy to lose money.  After 21 hours of trying to make some good progress I found that the game is very time consuming and frustrating.  I usually ran into trouble with my crew long before I made any money, usually because I couldn't afford to provide for their needs.  I even tried illegal trading, smuggling, piracy... none of which worked.I think the game has potential, but is not worth the time right now.			"

								First, the disclaimer. This game isn't done. If they stopped working on it now, I wouldn't be playing for much longer. Three hours in, and i've just completed the prolouge, which is the current completion level of the story, but in order to more than quadrouple that time, all they would have to do is give me bigger ships. The sandbox mode is fun, but it's hard to keep in the black when really you have to pick your type of missions, trading, passenger transport, or raiding. It isn't possible as the game stands to play a little bit of all of them without limiting the crew's level, as this keeps their needs simpler. That said, gameplay is fun, and well worth the current price tag. 6.99 at time of review. For those of you fond of space sims, this one will tickle your fancy. Try it, you won't be dissapointed. (unless you go in expecting it to be finished, but chances are then you didn't get what early access was, and probably haven't bothered reading this)			"

												First time I changed the options it froze.  I checked the forums, the developer says: delete the config file.  Great fix there or maybe you could actually fix the problem?  If you change the audio levels during the game, no confirm button appears, so the levels revert to max.  Do it on the main menu only.Game crashes frequently.  As far as I can see, making money is a painfully slow grind.  Doesn't seem worth the effort of overcoming the CTD to see what else there is.  I feel embarassed that I bought this.Don't make the mistake I did and follow the disengenuous discount link in the forum, since that will make it much harder to return the game for a refund when you quickly realize that is what you want to do.

Also, the game does have some bugs, and seems like it's in beta stage at best, however I haven't experienced crashes like most people have. Also note that the graphics aren't quite there.. a bit off here and there.But why do I rate it with a thumbs up?This game has great atmosphere. Casualwise it has great mechanics. A bit easy (at least at first) but for me personally it's a pleasure to click through and play trading. BOTTOM LINE?It's (personally) a nice casual game. I'll get my money's worth.

												Cosmonautica.Well, I want to keep my review short and precise. This game is probably of the best Indiegames I have played in years. I saw the trailer and I placed it on my wishlist. A nice person gave it to me as a gift and after trying it, I was astonished. While it features basic game mechanics, there are a few aspects where it peeks out of the masses of other games: Humor: I play in my native language, which is german and it is refreshing that this game is filled with puns, tiny jokes and overall a great sense of humour. It feels like playing games like Theme Hospital, LucasArts Adventures, just filled with the lore of space movies, games, modern TV shows and so on. I love the dialogues and the perks and features the crew members have. Its funny. It just is.The writing: As said above, I love the dialogues. But not only them. Every character in the game seems to be ""handcrafted"". N1L the parrot, who might dream of electrical sheep, has is own personality just like the other character you meet. You can feel that alot of love went into this game.Soundtrack: I really love the spacy soundtrack. The sound in general seems to be of high quality and aesthetics.Animations: Looking at your crew making funny faces, going nuts, walking around the interior of the spaceship makes it feel alive. And I began to care for my crew which is always a good sign. Several ways to play the game: When you first start out, you have a basic ship but once you gathered some cash, its up to you which way you want to play. You can become a trader, a bandit or bandit hunter or you can just go for the luxury cruise line that transports partyhoppers and VIPs.Stability: In my 10 hours of gametime, I have encountered one bug. A strike symbol would not vanish even after the character stopped striking. I went to a spacestation, from there to the main menu, clicked on ""continue"" and the bug was gone. No gamebreaks. Solved in 30 seconds.While the game is missing some aspects, especially mod support, I dont regret having it in my library and I really like to play it. New content would be awesome and the possibility to create your own character to get sucked into the game even deeper. Aswell as new areas, space stations, crisises escpecially hitting the traders market and so on. But that could all be added with mod support. I would recommend this game to people who like space simulation games with tycoonish aspects. Grüße aus NRW nach Stuttgart. Das habt ihr toll gemacht. :)			"

You can battle (in space) Trade (in space) And Transport (IN SPACE) as well as illegally smuggle things....((((INSSSSSSPAAAACE!)))).they do regular updates and unlike other games they give you a count down clock in your main menu as well as a Recent update ticker that scrolls at the bottom of the main menu to let you know whats been added or fix ... ((IN SPACE))For nine bucks Early Access you cant go wrong. Its still early Access so it'll only improve. ATM theres a bug that you cant go to the other systems with jobs. (but they let you know when you try) I do wish there where more original crew characters and the ability to add/create your own, (i like adding people i know into games i play, If i can change there looks to id be thrill) Theres really not much bad to this game. BEST early access you could ask for. P.S Im sure the Devs got this covered...but... More ships...=) 5 out of 5 and i will review this game in depth soon @ {LINK REMOVED}www.ehop22utube.Weebly.com =)			"

												In theory it's great fun. In practice it's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥Gameplay is simple enough to get used to, but some aspects are a bit lacking. My biggest problem was getting my crew to stop being a bunch of whining babies, nothing was ever good enough for them, in or out of battle they would always have something to complain about despite the ship being fully out-fitted for everyone's needs. There's also the problem of making anything like a decent profit without simply grinding cargo missions, you could wait for the necessary weapon skills to then become a pirate, but it'll take a while and in the meantime your crew of morons will slowly drain what little income you have.This would've been tolerable and I might bother continuing to play, but the game crashed 10~ times in the 9 hours I played and once I researched a couple more systems to visit it quickly became clear that repetition is deeply embedded in this game.I would say give it a try, I know there are people out there who can't get enough of repetition/grinding in games, but it simply isn't good enough for me.

								This game is a blast.  It reminds me of an ancient game called Gazillionaire but Cosmonautica is a lot more rich and sim like.  This is a game that you can ""just one more turn"" yourself for hours.  I am looking forward to the finished version.  There are a few bugs in prelaunch version and that is to be expected but nothing that spoils the game.  I am really glad I stumbled onto this little gem.			"

												A game with a great deal of potential that really could have been something good if the devs had decided to stick with it. Instead they chose to basically tell thier customers to stick it somewhere else. Myself and many other customers who were ripped off by chasing carrots will never return, a major blunder for relitively unheard of developers.			"

												A great premise, but with an overall limited amount of gameplay.  For a space economy game there is nothing but a basic, static economy.   There is little reason/benefit to travel outside the starting system, and it really makes the game quite light.  The different methods of making money (smuggling/combat/trade) are far from even, with trade being the only actual option unless you want to switch later (and combat is incredibly dull and uneventful.  While smuggling is played exactly like trading, but with a chance of having cargo seized.  There is no way of doing it in any other manner).It looked set to grow into something impressive; however, the developers have had to spend the last two years fixing coding issues and have run into problems trying to expand the game (due to underlying issues with the initial progaming), which prevents them from doing any significant updates without doing a complete overhaul.  They aren't going to do this as they are moving onto a new game.The early access was promising.  But the game is incomplete and now abandoned.			"

												sorry... can't recommend this.Could be GRAT but it's certainly not. Here are the reasons:- It crashes every half an hour. Couldn't figure out why. No matter what.. it just freezes.- I'm a patient person but after seeing my crew striking because of hunger in front of an nice dinner with a 3 Stars Chef was to much.- You have skilled Gunners perating the Turrets and an highly skilled Scientist operating the Shield and they look very busy and cool but none of them did even come up with the Idea fighting back after beeing atacked by a pirate. The Gunner didn't shoot and the Scientist didn't raise the shields... that must be performed by the player... after figuring out what's going on I was just StarDust.There are many more little Features that summoning up... but I really have enough. Lucky as I was I picked it up with a large discount... so let's say:Nice try guys... better next Time.Greeting from SwitzerlandRobert "

												Just kinda drags on. Waited long enough for this game to grab me or just become truly fun,Like the style feels like it should be fun, and some of the writing did make me laugh, but the game quickly becomes like the music. Repetitive, annoying muzak. The core gameplay and progression needs a rethink and an overhaul. ESPECIALLY the combat. It's an absolute grind most of the time, unless you grind your way to a powerful ship which gets boring fast, you end up in a dull stand off which drags on for so long your crew actually fall asleep or die of a cold. Literally.It has an addictive quality which has kept me coming back on and off for about 10 hours, but that's probably because I'm depressed.			"

Started again, same issue... third time, and yet again....There are some ways to save the games by going to the proper directory, etc... but it only works half the time. Also it doesn't seem serious NOT to have save game system in place.The having to wait does't really bother me as I´m sort of multitasking all the time :-), so I´ll flip to another window while I wait. but the having to hack saved games is a real put off for meI'm not recommending this game until they put a proper save game system in place			"

												I hate to not recommend this but now have played it enough to get a decent feel, and reading the reviews of those who have played more, I can only imagine that I would regret putting anymore time into this game at this moment.  It has what I was looking for with trading, leveling up a crew, space battles, but everything seems so meanlingless.  I almost feel like this is a game I should be checking into every once in a while on my phone, not one that I would sit down and enjoy in front of a screen.I believe this game would be more enjoyable if there was a better tutorial system.  Luckily I have played somewhat similar games and was able to figure things out more quickly than a new comer to this game.I don't regret purchasing this game, I feel like for the money I spent, I got enough enjoyment out of it.  As much as I love the overall style of this game, its lack of depth or meaning isnt keeping me around.			"

												On the face of it, it sems right up my alley.  Goofy humor mixed with some random acts of oddities.  Yet even though I've fought to love this game I simply cannot recommend it due to the BUGS.  Fail missions and your stuck with items and the obtuse trading information etc.  Combat appears to be a wasted effort at this point.  It lacks all the charm that FTL had, and brings nothing to the table.			"

Early Access Review
								Could really do with a basic overhaul of the combat system, if i could get my guys to autofire or have fire for certian weapons mapable to the keyboard would be great. still quite fun though. Really needs new weapons as a single torpedo is worth any number of other weapons.....With some minor tweaks the combat could be amazingly fun, right now really needs some workEDIT - The combat system needs a massive overhaul as its really boring to have to micromanage everything. If the developer can manage to automate the firing this could really help as micromanaging 3 different people means i dont get to enjoy the fireworks. More weapons are an absolute must the lack of variation on every ship you run into makes combat a very boring affair. Currently only 3 weapons and only 1 thats actually effective. lAlso there is no feeling of ever being threatened once you have a decent sized ship. A WANTED/bounty system causing you to be tracked by higher level combat ships who wanna rob your ship or arrest you would really spice things up. As it is nobody ever chases or targets you and you feel all your combat and killing the bad guys/transports doesnt have any lasting effect on your ship or character.Good game but deffinitely needs the developer to add a lot of content. He's got the core concept down and with some fairly minor additions could really have a gem of a game here. In its current state its not going to hold your attention for long but come release this could be a great title if the developer ups his game.			"

												Did you ever heard of the game Gazillionaire back in 1996 or so? Well, this is pretty much Gazillionare 2, and I love it!People seem to be pretty negative about this game but I don't see why... It's a real challenge (I keep losing money, a lot..). You have to travel between planets and make profit with either combat, trading, passengers or a combination of those. Meanwhile you have to keep an eye on the status of your ship and crew, things tend to get really messy, broken and nagging! Even when you think you got it all right something random might happen and ♥♥♥♥ up your whole plan, just like real life.The good:- Amazing sense of humor, the developers seemed to be pretty high when making this game XD- Great art style, I love the cartoony touch!- While traveling between planets you can zoom in on your ship and just watch your crew working, it's a nice touch.The bad:- There are some small UI problems. When I was for example in the main menu and want to change my resolution settings I tabbed out back to Windows. When I tabbed back to the game some buttons were unresponsive. Restarted the game and all was fine again.- One time the portraits of crew members stopped showing up. Reloaded my save game and everything was back to normal again.- I would have loved to see some more explanation in tutorials. It took me quite some time before I actually figured out how research worked.I've picked it up at a sale when it was $2,- or so so you won't hear me complaining, got well worth of my money!			"

												SimTower meets PrivateerInteresting combination of game elements in a manner that shouldn't work, but somehow does.  Interesting range of ships (but needs to be bigger and include more classes), the commodity model is reasonable (albeit rather basic), very similar to the Privateer model of base types, except that this game allows for bases to be multiple 'types'.Crew recruitment and requirements can be counter-intuitive and frustrating, especially with limited options at each base and the need to build up a large crew over time.  I would have thought that having a crew that eats different things would lead to better harmony as they're not all competing for the same subset of the food supply (but that's me I guess).Upskilling crew has one SERIOUS limitation; you don't get to choose the additional skill you would like a crew member to learn if you want to multi-skill them.  This to me is a massive flaw and not representative of the real world, where bosses have a large say in what development paths you follow.  Additionally, the random assignment of special attributes is great during upskilling except that it introduces negative traits quite a bit.  I understand that as people become more specialised they can become less adept in other areas, but given that it's an upskill, at least have special attributes balanced; +1 something, -1 something else.Combat (before you're ready for it) is even more frustrating because the flee move doesn't seem to actually allow you to evade combat; it should if the game is to be properly balanced IMHO)Mission choices are extremely limited (like Privateer) but the class of missions seems to be even smaller.  Combat, smuggling, or delivery (cargo or passengers).  That would be fine if there was a larger range of destinations and missions to choose from, but there isn't.Finally, I think the biggest concern I have is that the Devs seem to have moved on to new projects, announcing there is no longer full time support going into this game.  Don't get me wrong; I like the game, but it's incomplete.  There are still some crashes that occur semi-regularly in the game, and there needs to be more content developed for the game to increase choice and range.  I'd like to see more effort put into getting this game right before new games receive focus.Pros:  Reasonably simple trading model, nice touch of ship management with crew, so long as it doesn't impact the flow of the game.Cons: Frustrating crew recruitment and upskilling, poor range of choice generally (ships, missions, new crew, pretty much everything), and no more full time support from the devs.While I recommend this game, I'd love a button for 'undecided'.  It's about a 55/45 split for me at the moment, although I intend to put more time into it to see if familiarity and learning curve change the balance somewhat.  Original fusion of ideas, but needs more polish.			"

												Game has been abandoned by devs. It´s a unfinished game.Despite the game show has great potential, good graphics, good content, unfortunately I can not recommend it now as this buggy in a way that does not allow me to play more than the time I played so far because there is a bug in the displayed interface when playing at 2560x1080, screens overlap and it is not possible to click on the options presented in the game.Even traveling through space, where you should spend most of the time, to set priority repair or cleaning of compartments your ship responsible for the crew, they do not follow it ...by these two factors (most the first) the game is over for me.It may prove to be a good game in the future when all the bugs have been corrected, but not now.THE GAME DOES NOT SUPPORT 21 : 9 screens!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

												TL:DR: Fun game, probably worth about 10 hours of gameplay, pick it up on steam sale.So, ture to my word, they added some more content and I've come back to reconsider my review. They added some more missions and made the game a bit more stable, which is nice, but it could really use some variety in cobat/ship items etc. to add variety to a playthrough and give it some more replay value.If you're a casual gamer like myself and enjoy a quirky sense of humor, this is the game for you. By no means is this game immensly challenging, but it's fun. I'd say most people will get about 10ish hours of gameplay in the current state, value it as you will. I think it's a perfect steam sale pickup. On the other hand if you're the discerning forum troll lobbing digital hate and discontent thorugh the interwebs from the safety of your mother's basement, this game is probably not for you.*Original Review*If they add more content I'd quickley swich this to a reccomend. As is the game has a really enjoyable foundation, but becomes redundant very quickly. I'll have to chime in with some of the other reviewers and say wait for a steam sale and pick it up for 5 bucks.			"

								As a connoisseur of the space gaming genre, I can wholeheartedly say this game is worth your time and shows great promise.  This is very much part of a new generation of gaming where firing weapons doesn’t guarantee long-term victory.  In fact, most of my time has been spent reading, planning and doing a cost-benefit analysis (albeit a very quick 2 minute analysis) as to make the best next move.  Exploration, research, finances, crew comfort, scheduling concerns and weaponry are all in a day’s work as a Captain in Cosmonautica!			"

								To be simple, I love the game in it's current state. Even with all of the issues and the crashes. Iron those puppies out and you have me hooked for a long while. The description and videos you see will give you most of your value in whether to purchase or not. Gameplay lived up to the hype I created for it after finding this gem. Hire your own pilot, janitor, engineer and researcher. Buy and sell goods that can be transported from planet to planet. Manage your ship or the ship will manage you out of a job and into a game over. Take risks with missions in transporting goods that aren't quite listed on the legal side of the law. Don't get caught or you'll pay a hefty fine. Hopefully you have the money to bribe or pay the fine. If not, good luck building it back up again.You can add ""modules"" to the interior of your ship so that it is fitted with the right amount of crew space, cargo holds and necessities to control your space place. Change the name of your ship and the varying color scheme. Change the crews uniform color as well while you are at it.Overall I'm very happy I made this purchase and have supported what seems to be a very well rounded group of indie developers who are doing their best to deliver what was promised. I hope somebody finds this information useful.***UPDATE****After a few updates the game was running much better. Crashes were less often, almost non-existent for me.The problems I began to notice over a longer period of time playing related to the buying and selling of goods from planet/station to planet/station. It was very rare in the first solar system phase that I was able to make a profit on selling goods I purchased at locations that needed that maeterial. This was the biggest disappointment for me. The Contracts were interesting and had some thought put into them. However, managing the location you were headed, how long it would take to get there, how much money you have and whether you can afford to pay your staff, as well as what time limits you have on the contracts you currently have makes it very difficult to plan out a path to make the Contracts truly valuable.I've never had a very successful time during space battles. I haven't played a single save to the point where I am able to get more highly skilled shipmates to see if that makes the space battles less of a chore. Battles don't occur frequently however.Overall this game is interesting but I want to see more contracts made available per station, some login put into the contracts time required to complete, ways to truly build up a profit by buying goods at low cost and selling them at a high payout dependant on needs per location.What I want is a game where I can build my own spaceship, manage my crew, modify the functions of my space ship as to whether it's a space ferry, cargo ship, mercenary, or smuggler. This game has that potential but needs more fine tuning.			"

Early Access Review
								     From what I could glean off of the images, video, and other media available of Cosmonautica, it immiediately appeared as though it was a Spaceship management game of it's own style. Quite fortunately, my interpetation of what I saw was wholly correct.      The designers of the game did an excellant job of not taking themselves, and their creation -too- seriously. the game is quite fun and addictive, but tends to be somewhat easy to burn yourself out on. While there is alot of content in the game already, before long, you'll have an outlook of ""Been there, done that."" at just about every task, oppurtunity, and occurence that comes your way. I've hit that point several times now after a few hours of gameplay each run through, and yet, I can't keep from continuing to play it. The music is groovy, carying a melody and flow to it that's likely nearly unknown to most of this generation's avid gamers, while the graphics are soft enough to run smoothly on even most low-end graphic specs, without looking remotely distasteful.     Speaking as someone who's dumped alot of their personal time into Space-based management games(E.G. FTL, Kerbal Space Program, Mars Expedition, Starbound, Lunar Flight, X3, etc.) , this game is a very refreshing change of pace. If you're into any of the games mentioned above, but still on the fence about getting this one, I say go ahead.     While it isn't done yet, the devs are pretty active on it's improvement, and have thus far shown that they pay attention and respond to the problems/suggestions of their customer base. To me, that's a critical factor for any Early Access Game.      For what I look for in games, I'd give it a 8/10. Consider the two missing points room to grow, haha.			"

Instead got a half-finished bit of abandonware that the developer admits needs a rethink and redesign to live up to its promise, but doesn't want to put in the effort for because they've already moved on to other games.Don't let the tiny bug-fix patch fool you.

												I let the Mixed reviews keep me from buying the game sooner and I wish I hadn't. If you're looking for a game like Freelancer, or Sid Meier's Priates!, you'll find that Cosmonautica scratches that hard to reach itch. The difficulty games is that this is a very specific, niche genre.  A lot of games aim for it but few games hit the mark. Like Cosmonautica, many games let you choose what kind of space captain you'll be: trader, pirate, smuggler, etc. But many of those games (Eve Online or the X series) are too tecnhical as spaceflight simulations and the UI and learning curve is too steep to be fun. They lack the simple fun that more arcadey controls and mechanics give you.  Other games like Rebel Galaxy or Windward are arcadey enough, but they lack depth and immerseive world-building--the sandbox is too shallow and uninteresting. Other games take the economics too far and require either spreadsheet level optimization, or a wiki research project before you fully understand the mechanics (Patrician series, Europa, etc.). Or they keep the economics straightfoward like Tropico but they focus on city- or empire-management (like Civ or Stellaris). They don't have the Firefly sense of adventure that comes from a ship-centric game like Pirates! or Freelancer. Lastly some games make you feel alone in space and lack the human-element: there's no Sims style management of crew needs. No Space Colony style workforce management. Without any RPG-style progression via crew experience or ship upgrades, some games are just a grind without cool mid- and end-game mechanics.Cosmonautica balances all these things pretty well. The art-style is warm like a Blizzard game. The economy and world-building is complex enough to be stimulating but straightforward enough not to require spreadsheets or wiki research. The gameplay centers on the ship's adventure through space rather than being city-and empire-centered. The world is populated with life, a human crew that needs your care and feeding. The ship upgrade system isn't a linear grind of getting the same thing with better numbers; it's specializing your ship for trading, combat, smuggling, hacking, etc. and choosing the best gear to fill your limited space with (ship upgrades use a similar system as Fallout Shelter, or whatever the vault-builder thing is called).It has its flaws. Sometimes a mission or something is game-breakingly good and feels like a cheat because it rewards you much better than anything else. Or the reverse, you may take a mission that is simply unprofitable upon success and feels like a bug for punishing you. Story mode has an instructive mainline quest that plays like a tutorial which is nice. But your inital ship and resources are so lousy that it takes longer than it should to establish yourself and unlock the more interesting gameplay. So you are forced to plow through a more prolonged 'rat-killing' phase before things get richer. Bottom line, it falls short of Pirates! or Freelancer because those games were polished, big-budget classics and Cosmonautica is an indie game with some rough edges. It scratches your itch but it doesn't quite let you relive your nostaliga for those games.			"

												Just another game that had promise but was ""completed"" too early and was left with loads of bugs. MOST of which break your game. I should have trusted my gut when I saw the reviews for other games from the devs of this. They have a history of pumping out buggy half crapped out games. Seriously....dont believe me? look em up. Every game of theirs is either mixed or negative because of all the buggy mess their games are. This game started off good. As it went each update made it worse and worse until the devs decided to FINISH it early and pretty much abandon it.			"

												I can't in good conscience recommend a ""finished"" game that has such a huge stability issue.To be clear, the gameplay itself is enjoyable if a bit repetitive. You sail across different galaxies transporting various goods, passengers, while occasionally (or quite often if you decide to become a pirate/warship) fighting other ships for missions/loot.So, gameplay aside, this Not Recommended is more to do with the fact that you can't play the game for any real length of time. It crashes, A LOT, every half hour or so for me, sometimes more often. Thankfully (or perhaps because of this issue?) the game designers used an auto-save function that saves your game after every major (or minor) interaction, pretty much. It saves it before you enter battle, when you get to, and when you leave a space station. Which is pretty much all you do in this game.The game also has a bad habit of corrupting save files, making them unloadable. This happens rarely, but when you've put 10-12 hours into a game and all of a sudden you can't access it, it's frustrating to say the least.Bacially, unless you have a burning desire to support the developers and their company, I recommend you stay away from this game until such time as they've fixed the game crash issues, or pick the game up at a deep discount. And keep in mind that you only have 2 hours (as per Steams' refund policy) to determine wheather or not you want to keep the game, because chances are you won't get a refund from them past that mark no matter how horrible your game plays. Or doesn't play...			"

												TL;DR: Nice, casual space trading game, not for people seeking challenge or complex economy sims.This is a nice, relaxing casual game which is worth the price if what you are looking for is a moderately entertaining game where you click things and numbers go higher.While it is not as shallow as an actual clicker game, after a few hours of having fun with the game you slowly realize that there isn't really that much that can go wrong, which makes the already dull combat system feel pointless (you can also usually skip combat simply by communicating with your enemy and he will let you go, sometimes for free, sometimes for like 300 credits, which is basically nothing).Your crew never really has any real complaints (and you can completely ignore their needs for a loong time without consequence anyway) and you can easily replace anyone.Random events make no impact as they come unexpectedly but are explained in such a weird way that the player will often not understand what the result means in gameplay terms.The character traits of your crewmates really seems completely cosmetic, you dont see any interaction between NPC's like them talking or doing anything social aboard the ship (I guess autism is a big thing in the future)Trading is ok, since its very relaxing, but there is not enough economy simulation to really make it interesting (You can mostly sell the same things at the same prices and the same places, limited only by the amount of the commodity a planet can store)The graphics are pretty much sufficient for this kind of game, it has a friendly cartoonish look with a few nice details to make it feel more alive but i can imagine people not liking the style.All in all, I would recommend this game to people who are looking for something to pass time without needing much commitment or quick reaction time. If you enjoy casual trading and space exploration games and aren't interested in the mechanics behind what is happening in a game you will probably spend 10 enjoyable hours with this title.			"

												UPDATEBattle still sucks, great trading game though.  You can work your way up to fighting only to have a 3 skull rated opponent whip your butt even though you have 2 turrets, torps and shields!!!  DUMB, as the opponont seems to bounce back and fourth my divert direction button seems to do NOTHING.  Also, I love how often they get shields.  FIGHTING STILL A JOKE!  Not worth the $$ to outfit battleships.  This is only a trading game folks! lolOLD REVIEWFights are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and so unrealistic.  I'm sure my gunner would rather stay in bed sick and get destroyed then sit next to someone in the gun saying point it that way and hit the button!!!!!  So 1 gunner active instead of 2.  Even though the gunners do NOTHING on the ship during flight and should be well rested, towards the end of 1 gunner being sick and letting us die, the other decides to go to sleep.  Game's fighting setup is GARBAGE, nothing about it seems realistic at all regarding natural flow mechinaics.  The ships movements, the crews decisions & effectivness of their skillz, capabilities, etc.  GREAT IDEA of a game.To add to things, I Ctrl Alt Deleted the above battle and got to start from th beginning.  Here was the second outcome, pictures are below.  EVEN WORSE!  PS:  The game crashed A LOT!			"

												If you like the sims and space games with trading this is the game that will satisfy that craving. It's got a cool retro style to it. The planet and system names have a bit of coolness to them. You can hire and fire pilots to your hearts content, upgrade your ships and try out different balances of crew members and fittings. Warning- getting the hang of it beginning of the game is hard. I won't spoil it for you, but there's a trick to keeping your crew from leaving you. I deleted my first game because my pilot ejected and left my ship stranded within the first 25 game days. Tip: Don't give them a raise past level 2 till your ship is ready for them. Expect some game crashes after long battles. Always go to a station after a battle it saves the game. I sat up playing this game all night and found an awesome game to my collection.			"

												Honestly, I would like to say I could recommend Cosmonautica and enjoyed it. I really would, however I can't. The concept is great, with many different integrateable play aspects including being a trading game, care for your crew and your ship, and space combat. The downside is I bought this game, intrigued with the prospects. And then in the first two hours and 44 minutes of play it crashed four times. Every time I renamed my ship it changed it back to the default name within fifteen minutes. For a game that was some two years in early access, it sad to see so many basic bugs still in effect after actual release. As a result, my only recourse was to ask Steam for a refund, even  though I had broken the two hour barrier. Thankfully I was granted that refund, I'm sure in part to my detailing the bugs still in the game. Hopefully these get ironed out in the future, but at this point, this game is just not worth the money for the frustration it delivers.			"

												Too buggy. Not complete despite being out of Early Access. For example upgrading crew skills may not yield the actions tied to said skill, but other actions. E.g. gaining ""Repair"" for a crew member may for some reason give the task ""Cook"". Moreover the game has subtle and not so subtle flaws. For example when viewing your ship travelling through a solar system you can swivel the camera around the ship. If you do this you will realize the background is simply the inside of a sphere rotating around the ship. This means that if you see the ship from one side it looks like it is moving forward. Seen from the front it will look like it is going sideways and from the other side it will look like it is going backwards.Good idea, poor execution. Not worth the asking price.			"

												I love the art style!  The rest....I can see this growing into a decent game, but right now your best bet is flying around and earning a tiny amount each mission.It may be a fine game if you're on a touch-screen device, but the UI is pretty low-tech/LARGE on a PC and there are many things you'll have to try a couple times to learn what they *really* mean by the text and icons.  Shortfalls abound - people say combat ain't worth it, misssions are cheap, the text is confusing, and the buy/sell *won't* do all your quantities at the same price - they aren't fungible, it is a quantity-based economy - something you'll never see in real life.

												Surprisingly, this game is pretty good despites the numerous negative comments. To be fair, most of those comments about bugs probably were written long times ago and the reviewers never bother to correct it. I played this game for over 9 hours and I haven't seen a single bug, nor crash. If you enjoy a space sim flying around making trades, pirating and money management, I would recommend it.  "

												Got this game as part of a charity Humble Bundle.Core mechanics and game play are simple and time tested. This is a space based commodity trading game. You pick up cargo or passengers at one location and drop them at another. Systems are big and there galactic levels beyond them. Fun!However, this game is unstable and crashes from time to time. It lacks polish and that may be unnacceptable to some.			"

												I enjoyed the 10 hours I put into it, but as I progressed I could see the dull grind that this game would become.I only played sandbox mode, a few months ago I tried to play campaign and I couldn't endure the annoying tutorial.There is this robot bird that gives you more dialog than you need for a tutorial. I understand it's an attempt at humor but it wore my patients thin, and now I hate all robot birds.The look and feel is great, a scifi game with silly characters designs reminds me of the classic Space Quest franchise.The gameplay is fun (never tried combat) but as you explore new solar systems to trade in, you realise they all look the same. Each station has the exact same characters and you never feel like you're in a difference part of the galaxy. The world shouldn't feel small in a game like this.Managing your ship, and trying to keep the angry hipster crew happy is also fun. The main drive of playing was to get a better ship with more room, after a buying a few ships I felt no incentive to continue playing.I only gave it 10 hours, maybe there is more to the game that I missed. I'd recommend this game if it's on sale.  It's has a lot of potential to be an amazing game but it fell short.			"

Early Access Review
								Iv only played this game for about 40 mins and iv got a good jist of what this game is like. Im putting this review as positive because it is a game worth buying or waiting for until its completed. However as some other negative reviews say, there are a lot of bugs, menus overlapping and dispearing things is a bit of a problem. Iv also found it quite confusing about the trading part of the game as im never sure what each planet wants and doesnt want.  The tutorial could be improved by being a little clearer with instruction or a first time walk through each menu ect. Having said this negative stuff, it is a really lovely looking game and  has some nice humour in it as well as what looks like some great game play once youv got started and know what your doing. Im looking forward to playing more and learning more about it, and crossing my fingers the bugs are patched soon			"

								The game is neat but the early game means massive balancing.  All it takes is one failed mission and you go into negative balance.  Once you have a negative balance it's next to impossible to climb out of it because you don't have any money to buy any trade goods and many missions even require you to buy something before you can deliver it.  They need to dramatically expand the missions to allow more safe options for building income when you have a negative or low balance.         The missions are so poorly created right now that I literally could only accept about 1 out of 20 missions and most of those were illegal and resulted in just losing even more money.  As it sits... you have to get your start just right or your game is ruined and you have to start over.  That's not a smart method of getting people to play your game...			"

								This is a great little game - essentially it involves trading, simple combat, passenger transport etc with your spaeship. You can research upgrades and buy bigger and better ships, hire a crew and see that they are kept happy and productive. You start off in one solar system but eventually you can open up lots of other areas.For a ""small"" game it contains a lot and is quite addictive. At the moment it's early access but is completely playable. The developers are active and producing regular updates.Hard to fault - recommended.			"

Wish I could rate from 1-5 rather than just recommend vs not, but have to recommend at this point despite the flaws.			"

								This is the first time I play a game of this genre and I find it quite addictive, although the content at this point is scarce: you can resaerch every module and get the top ship in 3 to 4 hours of gameplay and finish the existing campaign (which is to be continued with future updates) in about the same amount of time. I must mention though, that after current campaign ends, you can still roam the seemingly endless star systems and planets in search of profit, epic space battles or shady deals with smugglers.PROS:Great promice for future content and gameplay.Pleasing graphics with more than humble system requirements.Sandbox play mode.Humorous dialogues.A lot of options for achieveing your in-game goals.Excelent music.CONS:Still a lot of crashes.Limited early access content.Short early access campaign.Clunky combat system.

												Looks like it could be a decent game, but it's way too complex, with basically no tutorial.A game like this needs a good tutorial which starts the game out simple, and introduces new features gradually.  Unfortunately, this game just dumps you into a screen without a bunch of tabs.  Each tab has a one-sentence explanation (which you quickly forget), and then you're just left wondering what to do.The UI itself is also not great - I found myself constantly clicking on things which were not clickable.I refunded my purchase.  I'd be willing to give it another shot, if they ever got a decent tutorial in place.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------[Edit] I'm assuming this sudden mass of downvotes is coming from devs and overzealous fanboys.  I'm not trying to insult you, I'm trying to be helpful.If the devs do not implement a good, progressive tutorial, this game will fall into obscurity.  The majority of people will not be nice enough to alert the devs why they're getting a refund; they'll just open the game, realize they have no idea what's going on or what to do, then close it and ask for a refund.

It's casual enough that you can watch a movie / have a conversation whilst playing yet also rewarding and does require a bit of thinking and planning.I love watching the crew / passangers go about their business during flights and the fighting does require strategy.All in all a very enjoyable game even in EA (It's about a month from release at time of posting)			"

												I want to like this game, I really do.  I love the trading, ship customizations, art style, humor.  But, unfortunately, the game is a buggy mess.  I will be revisting this review after a few patches, but here are the issues with it thus far:- Frequent CTDs- Game breaking bugs which halt the campaign and no way to recover  a previous save.- Game occasionally doesn't update a save, which would result in large amount of lost progress.- Sync feature simply doesn't work.  Can't trasfer saves to another device.- The Ipad version is not optimized and bogs down performance if you have too many crew.I realize the ipad knock isn't a steam thing, but I felt it important to note because I bought this game (twice!) so I could pass my saves back and forth and that just doesn't work.

												This is a yes and no game. If you enjoy the space trading and missions etc it'll hold some fun for you, if not you'll just find that the bugs aren't worth it. So, yes it's fun and enjoyable, but should a game that's this basic and now out of early access have this many bugs and crashes? no. I also read you can get this game on google play devices for about half the cost, so you know devs, thanks for rewarding people who spend 5x as much on their platform as someone who can stroll into a high street store with no money and walk out with a contract and a device that can play the game for half the price (sarcasm).edit: if you have spore, just play spore space stage, it's more in depth minus the sims style crew managing.

Yeah it crashed a few times (about 8) but a lot of games do.  The save feature brings you right back.  For about $7 was a great deal.  Spent 3 days with it and really enjoyed it.  Now I can come back and continue my crew's adventure anytime I wish.  Spoiler alert.................. use a shark for last battle.  The racer is what I flew up to and now after it.  Get dedicated pilot, science, hacker and five dedicated shootersby then.  Double up the shooters with 1 each pilot, medic, cook, clean, repair.Those who hated this game really should try it again.

								I am enjoying this game :)The devs seem to know how to put together a pretty good trade/battle/quest cartoony privateer game complete with decent crew and ship management for a semi-casual feeling playstyle. I haven't gotten into the battle system yet, but the trade and task sections are almost perfect (tasks need to be chosen carefully, considering time limits and the random generation of planet resources). Ship design is also everything it should be and I'm liking the new research/tech-tree system.My only complaint so far: the prologue gets you through a few bAby-steps, but immediately thereafter steers you towards picking up contraband which you have to tote around until you can hopefully research the destination these items have to go to...this wouldn't be awful except really early in the prologue, you don't have the research points for either the destination nor the smuggling capacities to help with the customs agents, NOR the type of funds necessary to bribe said agents. If the quest progression remains so poorly designed, people probably won't bother with the prologue and might be turned off from the campaign as well.			"

												Honestly? The game Cosmonautica is quite entertaining for hours of micromanagement fun. I have been REALLY enjoying the replayability of the game, chosing which ship I want to fly for different types of weapons and crew capabilities! Hiring and firing, losing cargo, losing crew, losing patience when they rant and rave about no bathtubs and they stink in zero g inside a spacesuit they haven't changed in a week.Very cute, and quite a bit of fun!!

												The game is really fun, surprisingly tricky at first, but overall a very fun simulation.  The only problem I have with it is that I can't play for very long before it crashes to desktop.  Before it happens, it starts to mess up little things here and there, but it always crashes.  For such a small resource using game, this seems odd to me.  Now that being said, the trading is simple and elegant, space travel and combat seem competent (don't fight until you have either shields or a hacker).  I'm throughly enjoying it.  Just please work the bugs out.			"

												I've been playing this for the last few hours after buying it yesterday. I really enjoy it, it reminds me of Evil Genius a bit and is pretty entertaining, BUT, it honestly crashed about 5x an hour. It saves a lot so it's not really a big deal, but it is pretty bloody annoying. I'd wait a couple of months before you jump for it. Without those, and with a bit more stuff to do it'll be great.			"

Fun but flawedCosmonautica deserves to be recommended, but only in a Steam sale, and here's why.I picked Cosmonautica up after discovering Space Colony, but whilst both offer essentially the same prospect of The Sims meets an RTS in space, they are very different beasts. For those not familiar with Space Colony (in which case you're missing a treat) it's a micro-management city builder with some fairly basic but well-developed Sims dropped in - give them what the need and they'll mostly look after themselves, but you still need to intervene to keep them friendly (and more) towards each other, and occassionally to restore their sanity. The first couple of missions are a bit clunky as the game wants you to know that this is important stuff, but later on you're so pushed for time building your base, and managing resources, plant life and alien incursions, that keeping a happy crew becomes both a challenging and enjoyable element of the game. And as well as the two-pronged (civil / military) split campaign you get a good variety of challenge maps and an editor in the package.Unfortunately this may have set my bar rather high.Cosmonautica is more like the Sims meets Pirates!, but it doesn't quite hit the mark, and now I've played enough of it I'm realising why, and it's fundamental flaw is in pandering too much to casual gaming. The (single) campaign starts out promisingly enough but it falls down in a few key areas. The crew management is essentially limited to picking the right team (tip: make sure they all eat the same food and don't promote them beyond level 2 until they can at least sleep, eat, wash, exercise, play games and take pills and they'll never fall out or complain about anything). The biogs are nice but very short, which wouldn't matter were it not for the fact that the game offers hardly any opportunities for them to stand out individually.   The ship battles are also disappointing, and even more so because it wouldn't take much to fix them. Here Cosmonautica really wants to be Pirates!, but the touch-friendly interface (with no keyboard controls) limits manouvering to basic commands (circle left / right, etc) and Pirates! fans will be bashing their cursor pads in frustration. Without better controls battles basically amount to working out whether to fight or flee, and then slowly getting close enough to begin playing whack-a-mole with command icons until the other ship gives up or blows up. Battles just aren't fun, and all it needed to do was copy Pirates!   And finally there's the downtime when travelling between planets. Even if there was much to the crew management, travelling in normal time would bore you to death, and travelling in fast time doesn't give you a big enough gap to think through and make any decisions. So trips are reduced to the sort of 20-30 second turn times you'd complain about on a turn-based strategy.  In short, Cosmonautica is a missed opportunity. I've not completed it yet so have no idea how far in I am, but I've got myself a nice cruiser and unlocked all the science upgrades except for whatever's left of the galaxy hexes, and I'm going to finish the campaign and probably grind my way to buying a top tier ship, but with only a sandbox as an alternative to the campaign I'm not sure I'll be coming back afterwards.It's still very polished, and as one of the more involving casual games it's fun, but put it up against even an old RTS or trader and you'll soon see its flaws.

								So far, I love Cosmonautica! Fun gameplay! Trade between planets is pretty straightforward. Run missions between planets, easy enough. Research additional rooms/amenities for your ship, check. Balance the relationships between your crew for optimal work from them. Balance your ship for shipping cargo, carrying passengers, or combat. Pretty straightforward stuff and fun enough to keep my interest. Love the art style of the game! Characters are cartoony and the ships have a fun design. Reminiscent of 'Evil Genius' (also a fun game). My only issue is with the Combat. It's okay, but I'd like to see some tweaks to it. Maybe more control for the pilot to make moves? Maybe faster results from when I pick a command? Better responsiveness to the command? Not sure, something though. I do like the idea of negotiating your way out (or negotiating their surrender). There are some bugs but none make the game unplayable or unfun. I'm really excited about the campaign! Keep up the great work!			"

												I want to like this game, I really do.  I love the trading, ship customizations, art style, humor.  But, unfortunately, the game is a buggy mess.  I will be revisting this review after a few patches, but here are the issues with it thus far:- Frequent CTDs- Game breaking bugs which halt the campaign and no way to recover  a previous save.- Game occasionally doesn't update a save, which would result in large amount of lost progress.- Sync feature simply doesn't work.  Can't trasfer saves to another device.- The Ipad version is not optimized and bogs down performance if you have too many crew.I realize the ipad knock isn't a steam thing, but I felt it important to note because I bought this game (twice!) so I could pass my saves back and forth and that just doesn't work.

												This is a yes and no game. If you enjoy the space trading and missions etc it'll hold some fun for you, if not you'll just find that the bugs aren't worth it. So, yes it's fun and enjoyable, but should a game that's this basic and now out of early access have this many bugs and crashes? no. I also read you can get this game on google play devices for about half the cost, so you know devs, thanks for rewarding people who spend 5x as much on their platform as someone who can stroll into a high street store with no money and walk out with a contract and a device that can play the game for half the price (sarcasm).edit: if you have spore, just play spore space stage, it's more in depth minus the sims style crew managing.

You have plenty of choices to make - do you want to be a space pirate or trucker? Which crew will you take with you? How will you fit out your ship? Where is your next paycheck coming from? All of this is presented with a colourful and clear UI and a very fun soundtrack.It's not the perfect game, but if you fancy building a ship and setting off on an adventure, this is definitely worth a look.

I thought about playing it a second time through, don't think I'm going to though, the story was good, it was fun to get the hang of everything.  Once you figure out how it works you can just make unlimited money.  I bought it on sale, and for the 42 hours I can't beat the value.  It was a very enjoyable 42 hours.  I had one question on the forums, the DEV answered it within a few hours.  I'd play another game from this company, and reccomend this for 40 hours of fun!			"

								well i really enjoy the game but the only thing i would recommend the development team should focus on is the combat system. as i was in comabt i watched my pilot stand infront of the door to the cockpit as she didint walk inside to flee the battle (as i had no weapons). After she just slept a little over 5 mins after the bar was empty and then procedded to eat and again kept eating 5 mins after the bar was empty, This is really fustrating as i cant pay the guy to leave or else i cant support my spaceship and make a living. I have also noticed as i bought a nice combat ship and put torpedos on it and filled two slots beside it with ammo and left the station it showed on the view of the ship the ammo slots were empty instead of the symbol of a torpedo so i checked that it had ammo and it said there was no torpedo installment but ammo for it when it clearly showed i had a torpedo instalment on the main screen. i know its in early accses but overall i think its a good game and it was a very nice idea just needs work on it			"

								The game is actually pretty fun. I was a big fan of Privateer back in the day, and while this is definitely a lighter take  it really helped itch that trading aspect that's been missing from a lot of space sims. Full release is a little later this month, and while the game itself is working fairly well thier are some bugs that still need attending to, and I have to ask if it shouldn't have more play options. Such as, it would be nice if they added more ships and more customization and a beter bounty board for those people looking for more combat.  I hope they continue to develop it and perhaps some good DLC in the future. It's well worth the entry price IMHO.			"

												I am very disappointed in this game.  I feel cheated by this game and determined to not be cheated by a game like this again.  I would not recommend buying this game.  I would not recommend buying anything from these developers as they have said they will not be working on this game as they have other projects to work on.  I don't understand this when this game is not finished?  Are they just thinking up new projects to not finish?  I would say that this game has reminded me of caveat emptor.  I buy less games because I don't want to be cosmonautica'd.  We take a chance with early access, but to be so blatently lied to, especially when I lose money because of it crosses a line.  If they made promises and didn't keep them, but still kept the money I gave them, doesn't that bother you?			"

												Not a lot of depth in ships or trading or places to see.  But it has a fun relaxed crew life sim atmosphere.  The graphics suit the style and add to the zany crew feel of the game.  I’ve seen others complain about the only auto-save but I think it works, it stops the temptation to save scum in order to recover from a bad trade or unfortunate event.  Without such events the game would lose a lot of its charm.  Don't recommend if you want depth or a challenge.  Recommended if you want more of a causal meander through space.Fun time waster, maybe not worth the price.			"

												Cosmonautica is a pretty solid game in my opinion, I am a big fan of the Sims and Space Simulation Games and Trading. What you see is what you get, I admire how simplistic the game is - visually and mechanically.What do I like?Early game is challenging, it keeps you constantly on the move and in search of more ways to find income and gives a sense of urgency to keep your ship maintained whilst also being a slow paced gameMid Game is also interesting, it only takes about 3-5 hours to get in to the mid game (at least in my case) and from here there goes 3 different designs that go from being cargo to weaponry and one that is somewhere inbetweenLate Game is somewhat dissapointing but I will come back to that in the final overviewWhat do I not like?I am almost sure that I found an exploit accidentally, one that got me rich very quickly with hardly any effort - I won't explain it but it's pretty available everywhere you gobut what I was most dissapointed about is that - yes the crew do have relationships between each other but you NEVER see any kind of social interaction with any of the crew members unless you build special rooms and tell them to go there. I think late game would have benefited from having the crew being bigger and having interactions with each otherbut overall, I'd really reccomend this to anyone who loves Arcade Style Simulation games.

												Totally worth playing. A quirky little space trading/piracy sim with great art and a whole heap of procedurally-generated content, which is very much in vogue these days.That said, here are three things you should know about Cosmonautica:~Performance will gradually decrease until the game crashes after about 2 hours. Fortunately, in only takes about 10 seconds to re-start, and you'll always come back to a fresh auto-save.~Travelling is a huge time-sink, and you'll be travelling every few minutes. Encouraging the player to get up and walk away from the computer every 3 minutes is a pretty substantial design flaw.~It doesn't have anything like an end-game. You just have to decide that you've beat the game after you have all the money.			"

												I recommend this game loosely based on the hope that they will fix the current logical problems within the game universe. Right now, there are too many convenient losses that stack against your characters in terms of battles and quests.  Literally every single smuggling quest I have taken has resulted in contraband being found by customs, even when my hacking ""camouflage"" is over 80%.  Just by the sheer law of probability I should have skated through undetected at least a couple of times even without hacking skill.  Additionally, when you're carrying illegal goods there is always someone who engages a spacefight, even if there are no enemy ships in the vacinity - no ships of any kind in some instances.  Then, there's the problem with the bargaining system while fighting, which allows you to call the other ship and negotiate your peaceful surrender - you give them dough, they go on their merry. However, when you're carrying illegal goods, they confiscate these even if you pay them.  The pay is implied as being given in exchange for not boarding or attacking your ship, so why or how would they know those goods are there?  This game is infuriating, half because I like it so much and half because it isn't fun to play when there is no reason to take the big risks specifically because you will ALWAYS get caught.  If this is fixed, this might become a great game, but until then I don't think I'll play anymore.			"

												I like this game, despite apparently everyone else hating it. I am really into the economics aspect of it. I travel through space carrying waste from an overpopulated planet to a planet that grows food and bam, money. I sell cigarettes to an outpost planet and swim in credits. Have to figure out what to research and when to keep the crew happy, decide how to make trips cost effective, and I hope to one day get a bigger ship! See boys, size does matter, and any woman who says otherwise is lying.It's also a game I can keep on in the background while I am at work, and game throughout the day. I adore games like that. They don't run hot, they stay windowed in the background, and no sound is needed. Perfecto. There are absolutely cons though. There's no manual save, only an autosave, so if you have one bad run, it can lose you hours worth of money. I read the developers did that on purpose, jerks.  The combat system I have yet to get the hang of. I figure I'll wait until I have a bigger ship and can load it with weapons and then I'll start fighting, so I have no real info there. It does remind me a bit of oldschool space shooters so far though. And why is it, there are times when it will take entire loops around the solar system to get to a planet that is directly next to me? That's one of the worst issues for me. Makes some missions totally worthless and I lose all my profit. I have also had the game crash twice in the 9 hours I've played so far. Apparently, from what I am reading, that makes me one of the lucky ones. And lastly, the missions get old. I feel like I am doing the same things, over and over. I'm just hoping that it will change once I get into the out planets I guess. So, I enjoy it, but I really like making money games. Now, if you don't mind, there's this guy who needs a four-leafed clover, and I have to get it to him, for the 19th time.			"

												I grabbed this while it was 50% off since it looked entertaining despite mixed reviews. And it is entertaining, especially at that price. I'd probably be grinding my teeth a bit if I'd paid full for it though.It does suffer from both bugs and unpolished gameplay, but it is still fun to play. It crashes occasionally, but has so far always reloaded quickly with little loss of progress. It even seems to save more often than advertised ""at every station"". So the crashes are irksome but not serious as far as playing it goes.Some more annoying bits are a mission not completing when it detects the tasks out of order, differences between mission requirements and what you actually need for them, and flight paths suddenly changing and making you miss deadlines (particularly on longer ones). They are at least fairly minor though. Not being able to adjust the window size is also a minor annoyance, having it allways about 5 pixels wider than my screen.Also you can sometimes manage the flightpath issue by selecting other destinations when it goes wrong (usually a huge loop out in front of the planets orbit when half way there) to force a course-change, then change back again. It requires some micro-management.Ship and tech progression don't match well and it's very easy to run on with the storyline then realise you've progressed yourself into an unwinable situation. Ship combat also isn't well explained. It does feel like it's missing its final polish.The way you manage your crew however is very nice and creative with the morale system, and when you do upgrade your ship it is fun kitting it out. Building up a ship is rewarding, especially once you start stacking multiple jobs for destinations.So despite its flaws, it's still a fun game. Get it while it's cheap.			"

Early Access Review
								If you loved the TV series Firefly - or the spin-off movie Serenity - then you'll love this. Like Firefly, the focus is on the crew and their survival. Not just from combat, but from having enough work to live. Whether you trade, ferry passengers, do piracy or all three (which I'm sure many Firefly fans will) you'll turn into Malcolm Reynolds as you try to make money, whilst giving your crew work.It's the lovechild from an orgy of FTL, Freelancer, Redshirt and Firefly. Even though it is Early Access, it offers a lot already to warrent a purchase and your support. With this and the soon to be released, The Mandate, the ""Spaceship Crew Management"" genre is filling the void that we have longed for.			"

								Spelling and grammer errors, aswell as a 80 degree difficulty curve. This game need a very strong tweek. Aim for easy at first and hard later, rather than the other way around. This bay be an odd dtatement but the game play and the interface are a bit uncomfortable, lots of clicks and navigation needed to find out how to issue an order or a duty. This could really be streamlined by a radial redicule where ever you right click. Highlight the character right click a destination and or an object and select a command. less clicks will make this a little more enjoyable, and less of a chore to play. Speaking as a working man, I come home from work and I preffer to play games that a little more straight foreward and simple. Like an RPG or an action game, even the Sims 4 is a little easier to play than this at the moment.			"

It's current build is not stable. That being said the time i did spend playing this game i found it very enjoyable and fun. Don't bash the company for a foundational technical mistake that cost them future development.Link to their apology:

												I wanted to like this game, I really did. But after putting a few hours into the campaign I just can't recommend this.To start with, the research tree is horrible. You have to research the middle and outer rings to get to more planets in the same system. Why? Does my ship not have sensors? Do the stations not have starcharts? The room research is the worst offender though. At some point, your crew is going to want shower. You have to research a bathrrom with a shower. So let me understand, we know how to build spacefaring ships but don't know how to include a shower in the bathroom? Or a kitchen, medbay, gym, etc. In my opinion, this is just stupid. All of the rooms should have been unlocked from the start and research should have been applied to upgrading the efficiency of your existing rooms. Next is travelling between planets. The pathfinding is mediocre at best and will do things that make no sense. I've had it where planets that were in the same wedge (think of the solar system divided into slices, like a pizza) but only 2 orbits apart take 7 days to travel...all because the pathfinding decided that my ship would fly counter-clockwise around the entire system instead of just doing a straight shot to the planet. Oddly enough, exiting the game and then reloading the save made the game recalculate the path to a still inefficient 4.5 days.Combat. I tried it once. On a 1 skull rated difficulty. Which turned into an utter failure. The lack of ability to manually control your flight path is a terrible decision. It would've been ok if there were more choices available to you. Right now, all you can do is close the distance, fly circles around your enemy (doesn't work well enough), and flee. Oh...there's an evade button you can use but all that does is move the ship to the side briefly. Which doesn't work well. The game has potential but in its current state, that's all I can say about it. Wait for demo to try it out or for the price to be slashed during a sale if you're interested.			"

								As of build 1.0.22 (July 2015), the only thing that seems to work is the splash screen.  I was unable to find any screen resolution that would allow the game to function correctly.  This 'game' has a long long way to go before it can be considered playable.  The game mechanics are completely totally broken.  Nothing seems to work.  Nothing seems to display except broken screens.  There is no manual, and the broken mechanics make this game impossible to figure out.  If you choose to buy this game, expect to wait a year or so for the beta version to come out.  Perhaps by then it will function correctly			"

												Hi guys,im gonna be honest about this game. I got this game on torrent which is cr*ck game,and after like 1-2 hours,i was like,hmmm,this game is fun,easy to be in it,So i decided to buy this game on Steam. everything went great until some random crash,i dont know for how long it's gonna happen but,i think hope deverloper can fix this game on those update  in the future. And afte those hours,i found out,this game just  ONLY about trading,which is very simple, deliver some illegal item,take peoples from place to place,and some small fighting,which is REALLY slow battle, and even i went to new galaxy,those mission still the same, nothing change.  So this is what i hope they (deverloper) can put in this game  : put more diffirent missions, items or something, And also,this is what i hope the most : they can put multiplayer on this game too,so me and my girl friend and play together. Otherwise,this game is quite fun,addictive,,and im gonna vote for this game YES as  Positive.			"

Still rough around the edges, but oh so much potential!If the devs for EVE Online stayed up hacking for 3 straight days, wired on Jolt and watching Futurama, Cosmonautica might have been the result. Definitely not for everyone; while it does have a very primitive combat interface it’s essentially a resource management sim.  I love simulation type ""games"" and mini/max micro management, so I was completely addicted immediately.  It actually reminds me somewhat of Galactic Civ.I also like that it is a very focused, solid game. It is an un-abashed, un-apologetic space trading and resource management sim. i.e. a very targeted, niche type game and it doesn't tack on random elements from other types of games trying to appeal to a wider market...all without taking itself too seriously.That said, be warned that its very obvious that Comonautica is still on it initial shake-down cruise, however the autosave is so transparent and well implemented that I've never lost more than 2 or 3 minutes of play.  PROS  Very polished, if quirky, artwork.  Each crew member is an indevidual with personal traits.  Various ""missions"" in addition to pure trading.  Multiple planetary system types and industries.  Very unique, ""orbital"" movement system.  Interesting tech system.  Large number of inter-dependant industries and resources.  Adult, Geek themed humor.  Solid, focused ""game"" play.  Massive potential for greatness.CONS  The ""campaign"" is woefully short and has exactly zero re-play potential.  It's a management sim. If you want a space shooter/world builder you'll hate it.  Version 1.x, it will crash. Have faith that it will improve.  Version 1.x, limited content, no DLC (yet?)  Version 1.x, nearly zero documentation.  Some parts of the interface are awkward and/or non-intuitive.-V			"

								I'm usually not a huge Sim/Space fan, but the funny and whimsical maner in which the team has made this game is really entertaining. It's still in early access so there are some bugs, and features being worked on. The Econnomy this game drives on is also still a work in progress. Having said that I've got 11.7 hours right now on file, which means to me it's entertaining. From a value for money perspective 10$ is a really good deal. Would have expected it to be more expensive to be honest so it's an easy steal and an easy recommendation for price/value.			"

								This is an Early Access review. I don't often pay full price for games not in a bundle or sale, but the early access game price is reduced and liked the look of the graphics and idea of having a simpler space trading game, asnd the graphics are really nice. There is a story mode, which is not yet complete but I found playing the story mode more fun than playing the game sandbox where it started to get a bit repetitive. The game did crash on me several times in the space battle part and graphics also glitched once making it difficult to play (have a high spec PC here with up to date drivers so games rarely crash on me), however still playable with an erection. I found it ammusing the ships could pilot themselves without a pilot at the wheel, and a few other quirks means the game does still need a fair bit of tweaking and balancing. I will probably wait until some more updates or the finished game is released before trying it again, and get a feeling the game will still have limited playability before getting reptitive, but if everything is perfected the limited playability could be really fun which is fine by me.

Its the smallest thing but I love that when you're plotting courses that you are aiming at where the planet will be, it's a small detail that most other space games miss of any genre.  I highly recommend this is you're on the fence.  Also! You can go to their website to pick it up and get a steam key AND a copy to download on to your tablets! They are the only game company to provide mutliple keys for multiple platforms that I've found thats commendable...  And to make that even better you can sync your game to play on the go or at home.Oh and new content good.			"

								The answer to your question is yes, you should buy it. The only poor reveiws I see are morons who think this game is trying to be something they have already played. ie: ""its not FTL"". Well thank god, FTL was good, but if it was another FTL, I wouldnt be interested. So go play bloody FTL then....I rather like that this game has its own identity, its not trying to ripoff anything. One can state some aspects have similarities to other games, but then again the market of games is so broad, you can make a 8 bit pixel game in html and it will have similarities to a great many other games. So if your only frame of reference is other games you have played, and not your own vision and imagination, Then I rate your reveiw as thumbs down.This game is as fun and quirky as you might hope at a glance. I have not seen any crashes at all yet despite what some are saying. The game is open world/sandbox in design, thankfully (something FTL wasn't i might add), you control all the basics of crew assignements, trading, intersteller navigating, and of course your ship. You only control them in broad terms however, so I find the game a more casual, and light hearted approach, and I think that suits this games design and style. You wont find to much micromangement, but enough to satisfy a moderate amount of Compulsive Disorder I think. It feels like they have some good balance at its present stage in development and great vision for its future stages. If you wanna accelerate the pace and go pick a fight, you can. Wanna settle down and have a snack whilst slowly zipping from one trade stop to another, you can. Getting bored watching your ship move around and wanna speed things up ? you can. Dont like the way your medic is eyeballing you during your physical, and wanna fire him ? you can ! (there is no physical exams in the game by the way) *phew*In short what I like most about this game is the open ended/sandbox playstyle. Its a fun and playful game, and you can get an excellent and complete taste of the game even in its early access stage. I found my initial playthrough was surprisingly fun, and i left feeling quite excited for this games future potential.I would emphatically recommend this game for its low price, in fact, once its fleshed out in the future, I would pay even more. Its what 12 bucks or something ? Sheesh stop reading these reveiws and buy it, i think most will be quite positively surprised.			"

												This is unfortunately a bad game that I think stems primarily from a single issue: pacing. Everything takes place so slowly that it becomes super boring to play. Couple this with some of the unforgiving mechanics and it's too much of a chore. It's a shame too because there are fundamentally some fun features so it could be a nice little space trading game. Nothing is too deep (combat is really simple) and that's fine were it not for the pacing. It is a pretty game though, I'll give it that.So the basically: promising game that takes to long to do anything. 2/5 starsTwo other nitpicks:- Really juvenile humor that grates after awhile- Beautiful but clunky interface - there isn't enough information presented in-game about what's going on or how things work			"

												I had high expectations for Cosmonautica because its cartoonish art style and the space exploration gameplay were very attractive. However, after playing the game for 12 hours, I must say that the gameplay mechanics are huge disappointments because they seriously lack tactical depth and variety. This game is mainly composed of 2 gameplay components: 1) space combat and 2) interplanetary trading. The mechanics of these 2 components, unfortunately, are completely broken. First of all, for space combat, I can simply use 2 words to summarize it: Use torpedoes. That's it. I'm not kidding. You just need to equip your space ship with tons of torpedoes and you'll win every space combat in this game. Don't waste your time and money on other types of weapons.For space trading, I can just use 4 words to summarize it: Trade high-priced goods. That's it. The profits from trading expensive goods are so high that there's literally no reason at all to trade mid- and low-priced commodities in this game. So, if you want to be successful in Cosmonautica, it's just very very simple: use torpedoes (in combats) and trade high-priced commodities (in trading). The gameplay mechanics are just overly simplistic and broken. Honestly, after playing this game for about 5 hours, I already got very bored. I kept playing for another 7 hours because I didn't want to waste my $15 spent on the game. I wish the new Steam refund policy had been in effect when I bought this disappointing title.Conclusion: Cosmonautica has beautiful graphics, but its gameplay mechanics fail miserably.My review score: 5/10 (Updated on 7th Sept 2016: The game is officially abandoned by the developer. My negative review was 100% correct: do NOT buy this trash from the irresponsible developer)			"

												Early Access------------------Typical Early Access warning here... It has bugs, deal with it.This game offers what you'd expect from a space trading game, and for the scale of the game it does just about everything well. As a selling point, I found the humor to be a little more subtle than I expected but it avoids topics that would cause concern for parents. The trading aspect provides a balanced build-up and the volumn of ships and trade goods provides more than just a few hours of fun.As I said before, there are bugs. I've had numerous crashes but luckily the auto-save kept me from having to repeat ANY gameplay. I expect the developers will continue updating and enhancing the trading system (which could use a few tweaks), but for what you buy - you get quality.			"

Early Access Review
								Nope.  Unless you enjoy FTL type games where 90% of the gameplay is luck based, you'll just end up frustrated.  I've played 4 games in a row, every single one ending in failure due to some form of bad luck and lack of information.  For example, the last one.  Trying to get some early game money, still trying to fill spots on my crew with very limited cash.  I take a 1 skull mission to kill a pirate.  Right before the fight, one of the many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ random events makes my repairman destroy one of my rooms then leaves them sick with a hangover.  Fight starts and I can't repair anything.  I also find out that my newly installed turret can't even scratch the enemy.  I retreat from the fight, and get docked $1500 for a failed mission.  Take the loss, try to recover.  Get a speeding ticket for $2500.  Try to recover again?  Don't have enough money left to invest in trade to make profit.  Try to sell pieces of ship to start over?  Does matter, crew is tantrum spiraling.  Money goes into negative, impossible to recover.The game is all about having enough money to make money.  But you quickly find out you can't reliably make money in the beginning, as the only forms of trade that can actually make profit (Such as computers) don't restock/empty fast enough to be continually used (at least in the Tutorial campaign).  This forces you into relying on missions for reliable income, which aren't as reliable as you'd think. Almost all item shipping missions seem to be smuggling with 50+/-% failure rates (you actually lose money and waste time each time you fail).  Having a hacker in your crew might help offset this, but I never got the chance to test it due to expenses.  NPC transport missions require you to take up extra room on your already tiny ship with passenger seats, which with the already lack of money and space, may be difficult to aquire/fit.  Pirate killing missions require a good weapons/shield setup (as above mentioned), which is expensive early game and again, takes up lots of ship room.Etc etc, long story short, TL;DR:  My experience was extremely frustrating and I would never recommend this, or any other Luck based game, to anyone.  Any strategy/simulation/eyecandy/humor the game has, feels masked by the potential of bad luck being able to just end your game at any time, wasting hours of grinding.  Not my cup of tea.			"

Mostly you will watch them walk around, and walk around, and walk around...The tutorial is utter crap.  The interface is hopelessly (and needlessly) complex, and many of the control choices are just silly.  Hint to the clueless, tooltips, everything should have them.It's not worth the purchase IMO.

Early Access Review
								Boring.EDIT: Indie/New developers live and die by user reviews so I guess I should try to expand on my already ""extensive feedback"".I purchased this game because it was billed as a cross between FTL and The Sims - both being games I really like (also, I was attracted by the art style, which is nice). Unfortunately it doesn't do either very well. Combat is nothing like FTL; it is very slow paced compared to FTL. At the start of combat, you have to wait for your ship to reach the opponent, and whatever tactical selection you make takes some time to take effect. For example, if you decide to circle your opponent after ramming them, you face an agonising wait while your ship slowly pulls out of range and circles the enemy ship.Outside of combat, there really isn't anything interesting. It's just a simple trading mechanic to get more money to upgrade and unlock new stuff. You can't do anything when your crew is manning the ship. You can't make them talk, you can't make them eat more if they are still hungry. None of your actions have a direct impact on the crew.Oh, and the mouse lag is really really annoying.			"

												Well, it's charming and fun to play, but unfortunately the gameplay still has some kinks in it. This game still needs some love and polish, and iterative playtesting, but since I'm actually enjoying myself playing it I have to recommend it.The good: it's fun to recruit a crew, train them up to be an efficient fighting machine, and travel the cosmos in search of fun and profit. This game gets those basics right. And the presentation is absolutely charming. And the solar systems use simple orbital mechanics! As a Kerbal Space Program player that's pretty damn awesome to see.There are some problems that stop the game short of true greatness. Aside from the storyline missions, the gameplay is rather repetitive. When you've seen one system, you've seen them all, especially if you're a combat vessel rather than a trader. There are only a handful of basic missions, and you see the same ones over and over again.There are also some balance/tuning issues that need to be addressed. For one thing, fighting other vessels produces OUTRAGEOUS profit, far beyond anything else. This is because when you're beating the enemy they hail you to surrender and offer money and cargo to let them live. That money is always much, much higher than any possible mission reward you were getting to fight them. A simple bounty mission might be around 7,500 credits, while the ransom is likely to be 42,000!Trading still doesn't produce much profit unless you go for the higher value goods. That's fine, except that when you sell goods to a station they remain in that station and slowly disappear over time (as the inhabitants use them up, presumably). The problem is that this decay rate is far too slow. You end up stuffing the planet full of goods and unable to sell because everyone is still working their way through the last batch. Basically, you have to sell to planets other than ones that actually have a demand for your goods, and I'm reasonably sure that you could glut a whole system without much trouble.Some of the crew roles simply aren't useful, ditto ship rooms. There's a galley that requires a cook to operate, but the starting food vending machine is more than adequate for a full crew, and by the time you've researched the tech for the galley it's a simple matter to research the upgrade that makes the galley operate without a cook. Since upgrades are done by researching a technology, and that technology is used by different unlocks or upgrades, it's quite easy to inadvertently unlock automating the galley because you unlocked the prereq techs for other benefits they unlock.Same story with medics/medbay - the pill dispenser works just as well, doesn't require training, and the medbay gets automated by upgrades.Crew preferences and interactions is a nice idea in theory but it's simple enough to get crewmates who all like the same food and then you never have to worry about it again.There isn't enough different mission text, so missions will repeat constantly. It's a very minor quibble, but it gets annoying reading the same description over and over and over.Basically, the game isn't balanced. The result is there's no real incentive to do anything other than what is most effective (ie, fight ships for outrageous ransoms). In a way you're punished for taking alternate approaches because they're so dismally ineffective by comparison.It feels like this game has tremendous potential that could be unlocked by gameplay tuning. This would turn it from a ""pretty good"" game to an amazingly fantastic one. That said, it's still a pretty good game, and you should get it.-----------------------------OLD, EARLY ACCESS REVIEW:Charming presentation and shows great promise, but needs more work on gameplay tuning before it's actually fun to play. Cargo trading, for example, produces barely any profit.This has every sign of becoming an excellent game, but it's not there yet, so I can't really recommend it (unless you just want to support them). The issues are easy enough to fix by simple iterative playtesting and balancing, so I don't expect this will stay a problem in the future.			"

												Edit:After coming back to Cosmonautica, the developer has made good on their promise and made a number of updates to improve the PC version. I can recommend the game now in its current state and right now believe it will get better over time. This game has heart and the devs have heart =).- Game play is the still same as before, but I've noticed more quests than the were before. So that means gameplay has been worked on.- Bugs seem to be gone. Performance is improved.- Proper PC resolution that demonstrates the artstyle of this game.- Multiple technical and gameplay updates since launch.Some annoying bits.- UI still needs work. Buttons and labels look exactly like text at times.- When negotiating with an enemy, how do i know if my deal makes sense? I want his cargo of wine e.g. but I'm not going to remember the price of a unit of wine cargo. I don't think the devs want the game to be this hardcore.(Also I noticed there are finally humans of different races. Didn't matter much to me but lol.)Original negative review=====================================-Premise is good, but ultimately fails to deliver. -Terribly bug/crash riddled. -Graphics are straight from mobile port, so they'll appear extermely fuzzy. -Price differential between mobile and PC version too high with seemingly no extra content. -No updates since launch to fix any issues.I believe this PC port is more than a blatant cash grab and I want to change my review. I hope I won't be disappointed in the end.			"

												It looks like the developers have semi-abandoned this game. March 3, They have said:""Right now we're working on a new project and therefore not full time on Cosmonautica.

So for now we will make small changes here and there from time to time and then we'll see how we can improve more in the future. Still, we're not turning our backs and just let this go as you can see. But we hope you can understand our side. ""Yeah well sorry Devs, but this is not the way to go.The game is not finished and some essential core game mechanices have not been implemented, or if they are, they still need a lot of work. We'll see about your promise not to turn your back on this project. I'm sceptical though, as a lot of developers have used this method to get money and bail...My advise to potential buyers: DO NOY BUY or WAIT.			"

I can recommend the game now in its current state and right now believe it will get better over time. This game has heart and the devs have heart =).- Game play is the still same as before, but I've noticed more quests than the were before. So that means gameplay has been worked on.- Bugs seem to be gone. Performance is improved.- Proper PC resolution that demonstrates the artstyle of this game.- Multiple technical and gameplay updates since launch.Some annoying bits.- UI still needs work. Buttons and labels look exactly like text at times.- When negotiating with an enemy, how do i know if my deal makes sense? I want his cargo of wine e.g. but I'm not going to remember the price of a unit of wine cargo. I don't think the devs want the game to be this hardcore.(Also I noticed there are finally humans of different races. Didn't matter much to me but lol.)Original negative review=====================================-Premise is good, but ultimately fails to deliver. -Terribly bug/crash riddled. -Graphics are straight from mobile port, so they'll appear extermely fuzzy. -Price differential between mobile and PC version too high with seemingly no extra content. -No updates since launch to fix any issues.I believe this PC port is more than a blatant cash grab and I want to change my review. I hope I won't be disappointed in the end.			"

												Well, it's charming and fun to play, but unfortunately the gameplay still has some kinks in it. This game still needs some love and polish, and iterative playtesting, but since I'm actually enjoying myself playing it I have to recommend it.The good: it's fun to recruit a crew, train them up to be an efficient fighting machine, and travel the cosmos in search of fun and profit. This game gets those basics right. And the presentation is absolutely charming. And the solar systems use simple orbital mechanics! As a Kerbal Space Program player that's pretty damn awesome to see.There are some problems that stop the game short of true greatness. Aside from the storyline missions, the gameplay is rather repetitive. When you've seen one system, you've seen them all, especially if you're a combat vessel rather than a trader. There are only a handful of basic missions, and you see the same ones over and over again.There are also some balance/tuning issues that need to be addressed. For one thing, fighting other vessels produces OUTRAGEOUS profit, far beyond anything else. This is because when you're beating the enemy they hail you to surrender and offer money and cargo to let them live. That money is always much, much higher than any possible mission reward you were getting to fight them. A simple bounty mission might be around 7,500 credits, while the ransom is likely to be 42,000!Trading still doesn't produce much profit unless you go for the higher value goods. That's fine, except that when you sell goods to a station they remain in that station and slowly disappear over time (as the inhabitants use them up, presumably). The problem is that this decay rate is far too slow. You end up stuffing the planet full of goods and unable to sell because everyone is still working their way through the last batch. Basically, you have to sell to planets other than ones that actually have a demand for your goods, and I'm reasonably sure that you could glut a whole system without much trouble.Some of the crew roles simply aren't useful, ditto ship rooms. There's a galley that requires a cook to operate, but the starting food vending machine is more than adequate for a full crew, and by the time you've researched the tech for the galley it's a simple matter to research the upgrade that makes the galley operate without a cook. Since upgrades are done by researching a technology, and that technology is used by different unlocks or upgrades, it's quite easy to inadvertently unlock automating the galley because you unlocked the prereq techs for other benefits they unlock.Same story with medics/medbay - the pill dispenser works just as well, doesn't require training, and the medbay gets automated by upgrades.Crew preferences and interactions is a nice idea in theory but it's simple enough to get crewmates who all like the same food and then you never have to worry about it again.There isn't enough different mission text, so missions will repeat constantly. It's a very minor quibble, but it gets annoying reading the same description over and over and over.Basically, the game isn't balanced. The result is there's no real incentive to do anything other than what is most effective (ie, fight ships for outrageous ransoms). In a way you're punished for taking alternate approaches because they're so dismally ineffective by comparison.It feels like this game has tremendous potential that could be unlocked by gameplay tuning. This would turn it from a ""pretty good"" game to an amazingly fantastic one. That said, it's still a pretty good game, and you should get it.-----------------------------OLD, EARLY ACCESS REVIEW:Charming presentation and shows great promise, but needs more work on gameplay tuning before it's actually fun to play. Cargo trading, for example, produces barely any profit.This has every sign of becoming an excellent game, but it's not there yet, so I can't really recommend it (unless you just want to support them). The issues are easy enough to fix by simple iterative playtesting and balancing, so I don't expect this will stay a problem in the future.			"

Early Access Review
								Was loving the game. Had this game since early access. However, the main issue with this game is, the crashing, which is still happening.I was confident, that this would be fixed. Because the Devs were communicating, and very vocal and helpful. Having said that, they still are, however, the crashing is still an issue, especially when i play games for long periods of time, crashing is not welcome from me.			"

												I almost quit this game a couple times, but kept coming back!  I've not played a game quite like this, and really hope they make a sequel.It's a mixture of The Sims (managing your space crew of pilots, shooters, scientists, hackers, cleaners, repairers, cooks, sorta like Fallout Shelter), spaceship customization (semi-grid based with tons of different options), space exploration, researching, trading, and cooldown based space combat (with shooting, shields, hacking, and maneuvers).  I liked the art style, the music, and especially customizing my ship.  It just needs a bit more polish and they will have a fantastic sequel!  Luckily their sequel should be much easier to polish, it turns out the engine (and dependencies) they locked themselves into had a lot of limitations that they couldn't escape in the end (I saw their post about it).  That makes me even more keen-eyed for a sequel!Polish you say?  These are some of the things I mean about polish.  They're not game-breaking in and of themselves, but for many people, this would have possibly been a death by a thousand cuts.  I kept with it because I hadn't played a game before that has quite this mixture of elements, and I really hope they make a sequel, so I am listing these things in hopes of seeing it for ""Cosmonautica 2"":1) Those gosh darn repairing and cleaning robots are so insanely loud and annoying (especially in speed-up mode) when you are trying to look at your ship (so loud and annoying that I don't really look at my ship that much when they are cleaning and repairing).  This wouldn't be so bad, but when assembling a team, you pretty much have to have them while you are searching for a crew that compliments your ships.2) We should be able to more easily customize our crew's talents.  Currently, when you level up a crew, you can either increase their current abilities OR choose to add a new ability.  VERY frustatingly, the new ability is RANDOM.  This makes it extremely tedious to find a good combination of people.  For instance, I would never want a hacker/shooter, nor a repairer/cleaning, nor a pilot/cleaner, the list goes on.  There are so many bad combinations.  This forces the player to hire a level 1 character until level 2, add the new ability, hope it's the right one, and then immediately fire them until they get the right combo.  2) Mods:  there could be so many cool new rooms, crews, ships, weapons, systems, materials, and whatnot for people to easily make and plop into the game.4) Trading and other items become tedious (there should be upgrades that improve the management flow as you go along), because there’s not any built-in way to catalog a list of materials that are created and/or needed in various systems.  You can’t even look at a different solar system without taking two days to travel there.  There should be a fun system of tracking and logging or something, so that way we don’t have to go and click on each planet, over, and over, and over.  Maybe a key that shows an overlay on the solar system if you have a certain skill, or have researched.  There just seems to be a lot of menu clicking and searching that could be done in a more central location (like on the entire solar system).  Another example would be trying to find out the condition of your ship (cleaness and repairedness) you have to click in every single room to get an idea, over-compensate with cleaning/repair, or just waste time and money repairing and cleaning by being tethered to shipyards (because that's the only other way to do it).  There should just be an option for an overlay.  Lots of simulation games use them, and I think it'd be a great addition.  Socialization is another tedious item, where you have to select the room, select the two people, and hit social and babysit it, or else they'll go on strike (you really have to wait until they've socialized enough over a long time sped up, which is silly, and then tell them manually to stop, this should be an automatic thing, and there should be other ways to fix this, like they should quit as soon as they've hit max relationship, which would make sense).  It just seems like a clunky system where almost no other need is manually or tedious (it needs at least SOME automation, again, like stopping when max AND a notification, the system for notifications is there, after all).5) Better save system, which would also have lessened the problems with crashing.  Other people have mentioned it, but you really have to restart the game every 45mins to an hour if you don’t want to crash.  It does save your game at every station stop (which is pretty often) BUT it is sad that it happens so much.  It should let you load one of the last 5 or so autosaves, autosave after battles, and allow for quick saves and manual saves.  This allows for experiementation and confidence in the system.  I'm not saying that this would make crashing okay, but if it had a better save system, I think it wouldn't have had as much backlash.  For instance, you could finish an awesome fight, grab loot/money and then crash on the way back and have to repeat the (sometimes tedious) battle all over again.6) Combat is very tedious at the beginning and didn't get semi-interesting until I had two shields, two hackers, 3 shooters, and a bigger ship.  Before this, you had to hit a couple gun buttons over, and over, and over, and over with the mouse waiting for cooldowns.  It's still not that interesting with all those things, but it's definitely good enough as just another aspect of the game, though.  However, it was tedious enough that I avoided it for the longest time.  One of the most annoying aspects of this is that there are no hotkeys for combat.  You have upwards of 8-10 different buttons to press all with the mouse bouncing around the screen (instead of being able to hotkey some or all of them).7) Better portraits:  yes, they start to look the same after a while, but I'm mostly talking about how these huge portraits at the bottom of the screen are fuzzy with no anti-aliasing (badly upscaled smaller portraits).8) Some little mechanical things still aren't clear, for instance, should I put a good shooter on my torpedo since it's so powerful and expensive?  It says that it's guided, but it also misses sometimes.  Why is one of my crew sleeping in a bunk, but the portrait says ""taking a dump"" and it seems to be confused about what it needs to do first?  Another example, I didn't know I could attempt to flee combat until waaay into the game.9)  There should be an option to tell characters to quickly go satisfy a need (and temporarily ignore their given tasks) if they're really in need, because they don't seem to use their time well.  I have everything fully upgraded, I don't have very high level characters, and I only give them 2/4 assignment slots per day, yet they still can't find enough time to feed, bathroom, and whatnot.10) More tutorial-like elements better spaced.  It would be nice if all elements were introduced in a safe environment in the first system (combat, smuggling, trading, scanning, person transport, socializing, etc), even if that means that you have to makeup some crazy reason that you get a temporarily powerful ship.  There's a lot of cool things in this game that don't show up (or you have no idea quite how they function) for a long time into the game.11) I'm not sure the leveling system is increasing XP logically all the time.  It only seems like crew get XP over time, and only when traveling.  This is weird, because then you shooters don't get any increased XP for fighing, hackers for hacking, etc.I may add some other things that come to mind, but keep in mind, I DO still recommend playing the game, because it’s a nifty idea that I hope they make a polished sequel for!!!  I am only listing these things because I think they should be some of the focuses on the next in the series.			"

												i really like the game, but as many people say: its abandoned by the devs. Which is a real shame as it is a fun game, but its a bit buggy. The game is not in development anymore, you may decide yourself if its worth your money.			"

												Cosmonautica is a great game and it is a shame that the developers are no longer working on the game as it has a lot of potential and could have grown a massive audience, you have an unlimited amount of opportunities while playing Cosmonautica as you can become a ferry service through space or a space trader, a space smuggler or a mercenary slaughtering pirates on the outer rings of the universe. Fantastic game would recommend to anyone.			"

												Like everyone else said, the game is abondoned, so what you get now is what you get forever.Cosmonautica seemed like a fun, little space-tradeing game, but it will lose its appeal very fast. Littered with bugs and a extremely lacking tourtorial systems, makes it so that you have the hardest time trying to figure what where to go or what to do.Honestly, if I wanted to play a confuseing game about space-tradeing, I would perfer to go back to EVE.
