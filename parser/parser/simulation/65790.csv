												First things first: This game was originally called Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, it was ranamed Arma due to legal problems between publishers and developers.Now to the review:I came across Operation Flashpoint way back on 2001. It was just mind blowing, at that point there simply were no game with such an broad scope and such a powerful imersion.The story takes place in the good´n old 80´s, when there were real intenational tension and warfare wasn´t a matter of eletronics, laser targeting and remote vehicles.A crazy russian general takes a nuke, a division of the red army and a lot of tanks and takes over some islands in the north atlantic, but those islands are under NATO protection, so the war begins.During the game you take the role of 4 soldier with distinct roles in the army. A foot soldier, a tank pilot, a chopper pilot and a black ops expert. With all 4 you climb up in the ranks, starting as a grunt and ending up in commanding large groups of units on the battlefield. It also ends in delivering a very diverse experience, as you play on several unique missions and control an interesting variety of ground and air vehicles.The gameplay is rather chunky, the movement is very limited, it all seems weird at first, but it is actually very immersive. There is one of the great virtues of the game, its realistic aproach to combined arms warfare. If you imagine that a soldier is carrying over 20kgs of equipment and ammo, it would be really hard to run and jump as you do in Call of Duty.Without planning and the right resources, there´s nothing a squad of soldiers can do agains an armored vehicle, and the importance of air support is acurately shown.The game is very unforgiving, the damage system works like this: Shot in the legs, and you can´t stand. Shot in the arms, you cant aim. Shot twice and you die. Shot in the head, game over.This actually works out very well, as this system forces the player to play cautiously, and adopt real world strategies to stay alive. You are forced to take cover, to look around for enemies before moving, to pay attention to orders and intel in order to not fall in a trap or get flanked.Another strong point from this game is the support developers gave to the community. The game was designed to be easily modded, and the developers were very active in the community, patching the game and implementing features that the players asked for.The game also featured an mission editor mode, wich was the same used by the developers to create the main campaign, allowing players to create their own missions at will, sharing with other players or even creating awesome co-op or PvP missions.It was a very new thing at the time, and the community was very solid. This philosophy is still kind of rare, but it was always part of the Arma series, and Arma 3 specifically targets for a relevant community participation in game developing and content creation.Operation Flashpoint was improved in nearly every aspect along the Arma series, but still stands as the game that started it all.Its vast open terrain, flexible and diverse gameplay, realistic aproach and some trully memorable events changed the landscape of the military games and still survives as an enjoiable game.In it´s time it deserved a 10/10.Today, we can see that it aged well, and still attracts attention as milestone in millitary simulation. 8/10			"

												""TARGET! RIFLEMAN, 200 METRES! SOUTH-EAST!""My childhood, rests right here. Don't let the title fool you, this is Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis. One of the first milsims of it's time. A decently groundbreaking game back in it's day, with a strong cult following.It has been renamed as such after the scummy devs from Codemasters fully acquired the rights to the title from Bohemia Interactive, and ruined the franchise to hell and back realising they don't have the ""Czech touch"" to games like this, spawning awful games such as Dragon Rising and Red River, which weren't QUITE generic cawadooty CQB shooters, but were basically casualised versions of the former games.Naturally this game got later rebranded after Bohemia released ARMA, the spiritual successor to OpFlashpoint. It lacks one of the expansions, Red Hammer, due to it's partial ownership to Codemasters, but it's easily downloadable and works fine.My childhood of dicking about in the world editor, spawning in yourself with jets and jeeps to roam the huge islands, and slavic inspired villages, brings a tear to my eye to this day. Naturally this game is even better on LAN or with something like Evolve w/ friends.Sure, you could buy Arma 3 and tack on hundreds of mods and play in Zeus (which is pretty great by the way), but this is where it all began. Good for a laugh at the primitive graphics or if you want to take a trip down memory lane, and take it for granted.10/10 buy it now, it's not even that expensive. Buy on sale, or you can buy a certain package with Arma 3 that gives you this game for free. (as a giftable copy, too!)			"

												What can I say, one of the most complex (for it's day, in fact some pre-release news articles said what they promised was not possible!) and exceptionally deep FPS / WAR SIMS ever created. Ok the graphics where slated from the start, but at the time NOBODY had whole island you could drive arround for hours, CS maps are stamp sized compared to the almost limitless world found in this game. Hence something had to be reduced, and that was the bitmap and model quality. However, the game play, quirky AI (some times they do funny things them AI), and a great story. It's got a steep (not CS player friendly) VERRY steep learning curv, but once you have it mastered, you will love this game. You can only save once per mission, is a master piece, which forces you to re-appraise your tactics. Brutally hard in places, epic in others. I actually think the views down a valley, with tanks (oh and the sound is ace too) rolling in with smoking engines and dust... was just beautiful. It for me, is the defining open world game too. Here's an example, there's a mission to take out a scud launcher. Time is limited, you have a load of men, some trucks and I think an APC and Jeep. I spent a couple of days trying to complete this mission, and then I thought about what happens in the mission. At a certain point, an enemy chopper attacks (a hind I think), so that made me think, where did that come from... so I worked out it's arrival vector (seriously) and then the next mission I send the guys to 'distract' most of the enemy forces, whilst I took the Jeep and raced in the direction the chopper would later arrive from... sure enough several KM away, there was a field with the Hind and several pilots, some support vehicles and a landing pad. So what? Well this is an open world, so I shot the pilots and soldiers, stole the Hind, flew to the SCUD launcher, blew it to pieces and was home in time for supper. Another time, I dumped in the middle of nowhere, in the dark and must head to a specific direction... it's didn't take me that long to work out to use the Pole Star to get a bearing... priceless gaming at it's absolute best. TBH most all of the new 'versions' of ARMA (which follwed this game), where not as good, no or little story, but better (and slower) graphics sure. But I think like chess (which I've played a great game with bits of tissue with letters on as the pieces at an Airport..), it's not really how it looks, it's not how slick the controls are (they are a little clunky), it just every little thing else. That is why, this is probably STILL the best gaming experience of my entire life, and I'm not sure (like a first love!), I'll ever quite get that feeling again, no matter how good anything new looks.... At this price, it's a gift and should be in everyones collection. :o)			"

												Bought and played when it originally came out, both single and multiplayer. Got it on steam on a sale recently and tried it again.  Single player campaign is awesome (really!) and got me hooked again. Pretty hard though. Atm I'm lost in enemy land where you can try to be bold and get to primary pickup point quickly, or go alternate routes with more time and patience involved.Many vehicles and helicopters can be driven/flown and houses entered for cover. Missions have countless ways to be executed. On one I remember veering completely off the logical path and ran out into the countryside where I after some time found an enemy team guarding a Mi-28 Havoc. I managed to overcome them and steal the chopper which resulted in a very interesting and different end to that part of the campaign. This is single player I'm talking about still. ;)Only one save per mission even on standard difficulty so no run and gun in this military simulator. Needless to say, you have to be very patient, constantly on the move and very tactical or it's a quick game over.Be prepared for pathing problems and the occasional AI getting stuck needing reload to continue. Trigger points to end the mission can also be troublesome sometimes.Other than that, I still think it's one of the finest games ever released. Highly entertaining but also very challenging, as it should be.			"

												This game shows its age. The graphics are dated. The controls are clunky and sometimes illogical. Flight is difficult, as you can barely render in the ground without crashing. The AI is infuriatingly good at some times. Its freaking brilliant.As you can see by the ammount of hours i've sunk into this game, its a damn good game that, if treated correctly, can be played for a long, long time. The AI makes the game an actual challange (something many modern mainstream shooters lack theese days) and, when you fall to the ground in a hail of AK-47 bullets, you know its probably because you did something wrong. The mission editor is one of the best features - it has allowed me and a small group based around this game to access hunderends of user-created mission for our multiplayer sessions, preventing us from getting bored of the same-old, same-old.Modding is another great factor; its very simple to install mods (and, admittidly, break your game) which can range from a few extra units to a total conversion. I'm currently running with the WGL5 mod, which adds much improved animations, models, weapons and a rudimentry medical system.Definatly worth a play. If you get bored, add a modpack or two.			"

												It had been 12 years since first time that i play this game. And now i'm still playing this game.If you look for a combat simulator game then you must have this game(and of course ARMA, ARMA2, ARMA3), and if you prefer an arcade shooter game you should go for COD or BF.This game offer you a realistic combat : when you heard a shot you MUST go prone or crawl to make your safe. A heroic action such as run towards the enemy while you shooting at them is not a smart idea. You will die in a second if you do that.This game will takes your time as much as you wanted to survive on the battlefield. A great plan may takes your time to wait for the right time at the right place. You may move on a longer path to the enemy position to make a safe approach.And don't forget, this game come from 2000's and graphic is suck(compare to 2014's) but gameplay is great!I give this game 10/101 : 3, Driver get in that Abrams.3 : Roger!KABOOOMMMMM1 : Oh no! 3 is down!.

												This is one of the best games ever made! Although it came out in 2001, it is still not outdated, and I regularly play it in 2013. The reason why is because it has so much potential. First, there are two official campaigns, that take place in a possible Cold War conflict, which escalates into armed confrontation. You play either as a infantryman or a squad leader, but can also access any unoccupied land/sea/air vehicle should you need or want to. Every mission in this game in non-linear, so it offers unique experience each time you play it. Story is believable and takes a realistic approach towards waging a war (you are not always on the offensive - sometimes retreat can be regarded as a strategic success). In addition to that, there are many separate single missions that offer a new perspective on the original story. But the real benefit comes with tons of free addons, created by modders. That way, you can expand the game with countless new units, weapons, vehicles, missions and even campaigns if you want. Some are even total conversions, which improve graphics and gameplay mechanics too.Speaking of wich, I have to mention that default gameplay mechanics appeal to me very much, especially looking around and aiming. In my opinion this game feels better and easier to play than its successors in the game series.The only area that lacks a bit is AI driving. It can sometimes miss the road and break immersion, but otherwise it's ok.But my favourite feature (that you should absolutely try) is mission editor. It is easy to use and combined with the previously mentioned addons, you can design and play in your own playground of destruction. You can instantly play your missions as you design them, so you can test different approaches and decide whether to actively participate in them or just be a mere observer. You can create massive battles with air, land and sea units or just small skirmishes to try different tactics. The only barrier is your imagination and I still haven't reached it in more than 10 years of experience.I definitely recommend this game - its value far exceeds its price.			"

												Cool game. I actually played through it a month or so ago off Steam and it's a lot of fun. Originally released as Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, this is a tactical Cold War shooter. It hasn't aged that well and the voice acting is quite wonky but it has an excellent campaign which is the main reason why I picked it up. It's more of a thinking man's shooter, and after a few missions you'll be put in charge of a squad which you can order around. I was really surprised at how well the squad mechanics worked, it's not just a worthless gimmick. It was quite fun playing this game in contrast to ArmA 3 and seeing how the series got started and has evolved. Unlike the ArmA 3 campaign this one featured a greater variety of missions, there's stealth missions, tank missions, heli missions, even one where you fly the A-10. While the outdated graphics place a lot of limits on how large scale the battles are, the game still has pretty good draw distance for its time which makes tank battles really feel like tank missions (after the first tank mission I hated them, by the last tank mission I loved them). If you're a fan of Cold War stuff there is a lot in here, you'll be running from BMPs loaded with Soviet troops, supported by HINDs and T80s rolling around destroying everything while the SHILKA denies friendly air support. This is all accompanied by a great original soundtrack which I feel was a little hampered by the poorly chosen licensed music. The difficulty picked up significantly during the last few missions (I actually had to resort GameFaqs, something I haven't done in a while) but overall the game is very playable aside from a couple crashes and bugs. So in conclusion it's not perfect, but still a great tactical Cold War shooter that's worth picking up for free.Favorite quote (something you should get used to hearing):""Fall back into formation."". . .""WHERE ARE YOU?!?""

												This is the classic.To this day, Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis (Now labled ARMA Cold War Assault) is still a fantastic tacticool shooter and soldier sim. The visuals have aged badly, but it's got it where it counts: the fun factor.If you have a low-end system, this is a great game to pick up. It includes the Cold War Crisis and Resistance campaigns.This is not a game where you can rely on your twitch abilities, regenerating health, and hit markers. One shot can mean death. There is bullet drop. There is armor to contend with. You have to think to win.A brilliant game, full stop.			"

												Walks around for a while *Hear a gunshots Lie downstand and start cowering all squad got owned by T72run for my life to objective Win ?!!!BTW this game is really unforgiving if anyone thinks it is a game like COD or BF think again because this game does cost us time a LOT for a 1 mission (no wonder because of its topography was HUGE) and the realism offered here was outstanding if we are expecting M16A2 to fire full auto well sadly no it only offer semi and burst althought it makes the gun really accurate. You are rambo type player ? well go on try your luck a gunshot wound to the leg will render you crippled and can only crawl your way to nearest medic (provided if the Med are alive). more interesting thing are there is feature of gunshot wound to your hand which will reduce your accuracy greatly, if you asking for gunshot to the head effect thats obvious you'r dead as dead as you can be. rocket launcher here is nearly like to BF and it does arcs when it traveled too far. and experience as Tank commander will be a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ since commanding a tank isnt that easy like in BF because the tank was controlled by more crews instead of 1 player fills all crew. first time i played this game i thought that this game is very awkward but it's actualy offering us a realism. Got body bagged everytime i engaged bunch of soviet squad just because i aim so badly earlier on. I almost quit but i did'nt quit since i have found a true value of this game: Commanding (Obey or Disobey one choice will bring your death or survival)Overall this is a nice game even for an old game 10/10			"

												The original operation flashpoint from codemasters remade into this, now I didnt play the original game to know the diffferences but this one is really amazing for an army simulator.Ignoring the old graphics this game has everything, there is two campaigns, the main one is really long and challenging, you are USA throughout it you'll do missions on foot, in tanks, in helis, in jets, in boats, stealth missions, assault, defend, everything, you will go under the command of someone at first and then you will be in charge of units, whether ground troops or tanks and you have all the controls you need under your disposal to execute any plan you have in mind because in each mission after you get your briefing you can actually choose your loadout from a wide variety of weapons and the route that suits you to do it, same mission might end as smoothly as possible or it might end up messy, totally up to you and your efficiency carries to the next level so you need to plan right, and the story is really really good. Now the second campaign happens in coordination with the first you play as the resistance, it is not short but you will start with less resources than the other campaign and depending on your gameplay and how well you execute the mission you can get more, it develops in gameplay as good as the first one. I personally preferred the story of the main campaign but this wasn't bad either. The game campaign could be finished as multiplayer but I didn't try it myself and after gamespy shutdown the devs posted a fix in the discussions. If you are into army simulators this is definitely worth checking despite the old graphics and gameplay it is truly very rich on contents.			"

												Since I don't really know how to review a game properly, I'll just do it my own way.Be advised, there are a lot of better reviews than mine so you might aswell go check them out first.This is one of the first games I've ever played, and it is awesome. To give you a little background, the main campaign sets you on a belic war between the USA and what seems to be Russia. You have to fight the hostile forces, drive your allies from point A to point B, recon the surrounding areas of your camp, and many more things.The graphics are okay for it's time, the game puts you into an open, inmense world all for you. The music is pretty good too, you'll be hearing it a lot during the battle. But what his game has that others don't (I'm looking at you COD and BF) is actual tacticool warfare, you follow or give orders, play smart as a group, and a lot of other cool stuff. This is the first Arma, so if you want to get into the series I'd recommend you go for Arma 3 instead, a much better version.			"

												""I have played this for hours and hours when it was released in 2001, called Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, almost 2 years before Steam was released""An old classic military simulator, actually the first one.Have had many hours in this game, building Zombie missions, getting chased by robots and just pure and fun deathmatch with friends!If you want an improvemwnt to this awesome game try the FFUR 1985 2008 Mod, which keeps some things from the original ARMA: http://operationflashpoint.filefront.com/file/FFUR_1985_2008_Edition;92092Or the FFUR SLX 2007 mod, which improves everything: http://operationflashpoint.filefront.com/file/FFURSLX_2007;82613It'll improve the AI and also the graphics/gameplay!There's also plenty of addons and mods out there that you can mess around with in the built in mission editor.

												This game made a very big part of my war loving childhood, and a love for tactical gameplay with a lot of realism, this is a godsent for all the people that want a challenge and a bit of fun with the game's setting of the good ol' 2001, yet it doesn't even take away from the realism one bit. The only downside is that its missing a working multiplayer (it has MP support, but there aren't any active servers sadly), which would really make the game a lot more cooler just like the other games in the Arma series.And yes, the graphics aren't as good as they are today, but it does give a bit of a nostalgic feeling to it, I mean, just look at those face textures, put a bullet in them, now look at them again! And yes, there are a few bugs and glitches which aren't exactly sorted out, but it doesn't matter, nor does it take away from the game, yes, even the flying bodies after explosions don't take it away, despite how funny it looks to see a body flying across the landscape.Storyline is, meh, not really a stretch, but there are some moments the game will really give you with it. I will even mention, the outdated dialogue alongside the radio transmissions are always fun to hear, really, it is, just listen to Kowalski arguing!The game also comes with the amazing mission editor, just like in the rest of the Arma games, make your own missions and such, it's pretty fun when boredom is not an option, while it doesn't give as much as the other Arma games do, it suffices enough to keep you screwing around with for more.Is it worth buying? YES. Especially since it's only 4€, it's a perfect price worth taking, especially since its rather old, but nevertheless, gold. While of course I still wish it had a few servers around that I could play in with some other people, and perhaps a bit of workshop avilability (this game CAN be modded, though its really hard to find any good mods around the internet lately, either that, or I'm just bad at searching) to make the game more fun to play with, in any case, this is still one of my games that made my war loving childhood, and I wish for it to get into the hearts of many people of today, to give them the taste of what amazing masterpieces games like these were back in the days.Oh, and remember to use cover and prone a lot, those AI might have a dumb coding which makes them go into crawl mode from simply hearing a single gunshot, and run-stop-run around, but they aren't exactly forgiving if they see you running around an open area in the distance, not to mention aimbot you at mid ranges if you aren't smart enough to duck behind cover in time, just a friendly advice, is all.

												Right about the time this game was released, I was playing Deadly Dozen and knee deep in Tomb Raider titles on the Playstation. This game absolutely blew my mind with it's open world playing field. Unlike any other games that were out there, the only boundary that existed was the water, unless you were in an air or water vehicle, then you could essentially drive that boat or plane for infinity with no land in sight and the water and sky would continue to regenerate. I played this game for 2 years before I ever opened the editor. When I did that, I was hooked for life. It was the first game that introduced me to player mods and I must have downloaded every free addon and mission I could find. I also learned about scripting while using the editor and expanding the fun that much more. It still survives today among a limited community on the BIStudio Forums[forums.bistudio.com] and you can find those free player made addons here at http://ofp.gamepark.cz/ as well as years of editing discussion at OFPEC[www.ofpec.com] The Editing Center. These sites contain a ton of free user made missions/campaigns/islands as well. This title may contain outdated graphics, but the game play is still better than many modern day titles of this current period. Definitely worth paying the current price to play through the well made campaigns as well as some of the user made missions. You'd be surprised at how free you are to adopt your own tactical approaches. Have fun!!!			"

												This game isn't all that bad. Certainly not as bad as negative reviews say. It's extremely outdated, but it's still fun. In this game, don't expect to go around taking names and kicking asses on the battlefield acting like a bullet sponge. Don't expect to go prone immediatly after hitting the button.  One shot and you're dead most of the time. And just like in real life itself, you'll get killed by enemies that you can't even see a lot. This is about teamwork, about cover, about not going out there in the open just to get killed. Sure, modern Arma games are better when it comes to that, but this one is still...Pretty good.			"

Product received for free
It is the last mission... We've beaten the Russians off to the end of the island, and now it's time to apprehend the mastermind behind it all... General Guba.Me and my spec ops team of eight finish our briefing: to find and capture General Guba alive before he makes his escape off the island. As we make for Guba's headquarters in our M113 Armored Personnel Carrier, we see a friendly machine gun jeep, probably forming into the friendly assault that will schedule a little while later. As we drive further to our objective, I spot a dirt trail along the mountain path. We follow it to find two ruskies guarding an abandoned outpost with a Mil Mi-24 ""Hind"" attack chopper hiding in the back. The gunner of the M113 takes out the two in quick bursts and I tell my men to board the Hind. ""Out of fuel"" 3 in my squad tells me. I find a fuel truck hiding behind a wall and refuel the Hind. As we start the chopper me and my men get ready for what comes next...As we fly our way to Guba's base, we evade enemy anti aircraft vehicles, namely the  ZSU-23-4 ""Shilka"". A little while later, we spot a friendly assault on the frontlines. An M113 supported by a group of infantry heads for Guba's base. A few yards beyond them, we see the diabolical ruskie tank, the T-80. I tell my gunner to engage the T-80 before our friendlies get slaughtered. I hover the chopper for my gunner to lock on and we destroy the T-80 just in time before it fires a shot at the M113. As we see the friendly assault push forward, we return to our main objective.We hover over Guba's base and spot him in a UAZ, getting ready to leave for good. Luckily we catch him before even sets a good distance into the Shilka infested lands. My gunner guns down any infantry and spetsnaz units guarding Guba and we land to apprehend him. As we finally apprehend the mastermind, he speaks in Russian of how the island will be nuked with his SCUD launchers that is set up somewhere on the opposite side of the island. Lucky for me, I can translate what he was saying and report it to command. Command replies that our new objective is to take out the SCUD launchers ASAP. As we board into the Hind once again along with our whimpering captive, we search for the SCUD launchers...I hover around the coast and spot a group of Shilka AA vehicles firing at me. A little beyond, I spot the SCUD launchers... Ready to launch. I tell my gunner to fire at will at the Shilkas but we take too many hits. My gunner and a few others in my squad are dead... I tell my remaining men to ditch as our helicopter moves closer to the ground... crash landing...Me and a few others, including the captive ditch the chopper just before we hit the ground. I find my legs bleeding and look at the crash site. I call all my units to report their positions to me. Only three of my men were left, along with our captive. I tell them to stay put and look after the captive. As I look infront of me, I see the SCUD launcher's nuclear warhead. I'm lucky to be so close to the nuke... but not so lucky to have my legs broken. As I crawl my way to the SCUD launcher, I spot the same ruskie Shilkas that shot down our chopper. Luckily they seem to be too trained to the skies in search of more prey. I was suprised at how there was not much infantry guarding the SCUD launchers. I crawl my way under the SCUD launchers and plant a satchel charge for each. I crawl my way back to the Hind crash site and tell command the job is done. I take a look back to the nuclear warheads. I set off the charges and watch the explosion. ""Mission Complete"".My Personal RatingI picked this game up a few years back when it was on some type of free weekend where you could pick up a copy for free. Since I had no other choice and was limited to gaming because of my terrible 2007~ish computer, I happily took the chance and launched it. I was so amazed at this game. Even though the graphics may be dated, the gameplay and the detail that goes with the missions make up for it. The mission above is the second to last mission in the game and there were so many routes you could take to achieve it. I was VERY suprised to how I survived the crash and landed right next to the SCUD launchers, allowing me to be able to complete the mission without any saves (there is only one save per mission). This game has to be the best classical military sim. I'd pick it up for the $5 it is now if you are one for nostalgiac feel or just looking for a not so graphic/system intensive game. If you want to enhance the game or are having problems launching/graphic wise, I'd pick up some mods, addons, and support at the official BIS studios: https://forums.bistudio.com/forum/9-arma-cold-war-assault-operation-flashpoint/Overall this game deserves a solid10/10 "

												Here is my review for Arma : Cold War Assualt (renamed in 2011). Previously named Operation flash point : Cold War Crisis.Released back in 2001 a military simulation of might have happend if Cold war actually happend.First off if you are into Call of duty (COD) and/or into scripted corridor shooter's then let me tell you right of the bat that this game is not for you.Shall we beganStoryWhile not going to spoil it for you but let me tell you it's very well done. Most people may think that it has no story or what so over but before you make that judgment let me tell you it's there and it's amazing just progress over the missions and you will see. And your character also talks here yes in cutscenes as well.SoundtrackOver a big total of  track's in total. All macthing the game in various way's and mostly just Epic.Gameplay  The main part. Does it live up to rest of the game?Surely it does let me tell you why. Realistic in a big way and in many aspects. First of all teamwork,strategy,proper planning is the key here or else you wont survive for long. Item pick up system. Crouching and going prone required for proper gun handling. Hud doesn't tell you your health nor your clips remaining bullets, leaving on you to precisely reload or you might just waste up your ammo. And the gun play well certainly the recoil here is pretty low compared to real guns but still gun play is fleunt. And very un scripted you also dont get screemed at for leaving the scripted area because of course  we cant let you do that or else ""sigh"" you will destory the special scripted part ""sigh"". Well guess what? Theres non of that ♥♥♥♥ here.ControlsWhile overly complicated for many people but just right once you fully adopt them. I would say most new people would get frustrated but just a word of advice take your time and try to adopt to them and you will be doing just fine.Ai One of best here while buggy at times but still best for it's time till now. Responsive. Do team work. And can even track you if a explosion near occured or from lights of flare. And let me tell you a little story and you will see how cool is that. I was playing one of the missions in this one a head or whatever comes to check you at night after after checking he leaves back in is whatever vehicle but you can shoot down its tyres and then he will go back on feet but on then on theway he will also help you shoot down some soldiers at night. Now how cool is that? You see they actually do have a mind.GraphicsWhile the textures are mostly pretty bad but overall still pretty good here and worth watchable different types of options as well in all still a pass here.Amount of play timeMore than 40 hours with a total off 43 campaign mission's.ConclusionFully worth the price only 10 dollars for a gem like this. Id say get it if you can deal with some of the problems and odd controls.Good story,combat, entertaining. While some clunky controls and a little rough around the edges but overall a classic.===================================================================Click me and follow us as Curator "

												I played this when it was Operation Flashpoint.    Back then the fact that it was open world with every random vehicle being drive-able, and being able to switch between ground, vehicle, and air gameplay was unprecedented.The game was interesting and challenging.   However, the thing I remember most about it was the final mission.  After you've completed the game, you fly back in on a personal aircraft.   You then get into a civilian vehicle and drive around the island.   You pick up some of your buddies (characters you played as during the campaign) and you tour through the various battlefields that you just got done fighting in.It was surprisingly cathartic and I started to get choked up.  ""I remember that place!!""    It's rare that a game evokes that deep of emotions.			"

												A classic to be sure, this game started the MilSim genre. The AI is a little buggy but this is to be expected from a 1st generation game.Since its release in 2001 ArmA (Better known as Operation Flashpoint), has become increasingly popular due to its heavy modability and huge open world. A lot of this hype, however was generated by a mod we all know today as DayZ. Bohemia Interactive nearly shut ArmA down at ArmA 2 because of the l\ack of sales until DayZ was released as a overhaul mod. "

												So, I've realized how retardeed my review for this game was....Time to change it..So, this game was my first shooter I have ever played. I guess I was 10 when I played it first time. Old days.... haha... I remember this game used to be called Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis.Ok, I have admit one thing and that is me being unable to finish the campaing as I was an absolute nooooooooob. Well... how the hell did you enjoy this shet when you were so bad you ask ? Ha.. Custom missions is your answer. The editor ? The best thing ever. I created hundreds of my own missions. From s1mple: couple of units againts each other, to complex missions with units, vehicles moving all over the map and doing multiple tasks (with a background story somewhere in my head). Example? I would start with SpetzNatz parachuting into US military base during the night. There were in a disadvantage (usually 5 units) but still managed to weaken the enemies who then would face attack from the Russian army early in the morning. In a while Chinooks would drop out backup while the Russian were on their way in their tanks for a second attack.... all of this happening while both side's jets fight in the sky.I would spent days (with 3 hours per day) to edit all the timing and make sure it all goes in the right order I want it. Sometimes I played as a civilian just to watch the whole thing. Not impressed ? Well, whatever you say but I think it's pretty cool..... as I was 10 years old ;)Oh and....Also it was one of the fewest games I could've ran on my 512MB RAM PC....also with (for me still unknown) shet CPU and GPU. (Well....after all it had ""Windows XP Home"" installed which kinda gives me a hint that it was far from ""gaming PC"")I don't care if there is something wrong, bad in this game. This game means alot to me. Awesome nostalgia while playing it nowadays.My childhood was 10/10, this game was part of it and so... 10/10 for this masterpiece.And hey, putting this here just in case....... English is not easy, ok ?			"

												Pretty much the first true war simulator out there. It's not about pulling the trigger. It's about working with your squad, managing your ammo, completing orders and finally - surviving. You'll be out in a huge landscape, wondering where on earth is enemy engaging from. Your commanders may die, and you'll have to make decisions yourself. Few bullets and you're dead. Sometimes you'll be on a boring patrol, sometimes you'll drive a truck, sometimes you'll be forced to retreat, one day you'll fly a helicopter, drive a tank and become a commander yourself.However age leaves a mark in graphics. Also aiming feels quite unsensitive at some point, mainly because you'll engage the enemy at 100+ metres and even with low senitivity it will feel odd.9/10 if you like it hardcore and don't mind the age of this game.

												I'm defending a coastal town from an enemy assault, wielding an assault rifle at a defensive position. I see enemies far away at the beach. They look so small, like ants. I hear a bullet whizzing just past me, then screams of death somewhere near. Then it happens - I get shot in the leg. There's a flash in my eyeview as I scream in pain. Unable to walk anymore, I start crawling. At the same time, the unspeakable happens: There's a radio command, explaining that the assault is too strong and that our forces are to retreat from the town to a rendezvous point at least 500 meters away. I cannot believe what is happening. While others retreat running for their life, I do so crawling.

This is the game that got me into PC gaming over a decade ago.I still remember the very first time I played it. This masterpiece felt like a true war simulator back then, since there were not many games like this. It was really realistic in terms of difficulty.● Really immersive campaign. Multiple characters, each having their set of skills on the battlefield. The cutscenes in this game are so good and long. It actually feels like watching a movie of Cold War.Campaign is also quite lenghty, variety of missions, never a mission indentical to another.● Realism is top notch in this game. You'll die within 1-2 shots depending where you got hit.It really hit me back then and still does, when I get 3 shots to my leg and my whole squad gets mown down...crawling 3km through woods without having a chance to stand up and fight...● Graphics...now this game unfortunately has aged pretty badly. BUT when it was first released in 2001, it was a big thing! I imagine for a person who haven't played this game and decides to test it out Now, big chance is he/she ain't gonna like it due outdated graphics. For me nothing beats nostalgia.● Mission Editor makes this 10/10 masterpiece into a 11/10, no jokes.It's so fun, endless amount of variety!I remember creating hundreds of different missions, stealth assasinations, all-out war, destroying convoys and even a whole new campaign. It really offers you to create any kind of mission you'd like and it's super easy aswell!● Expansion packs - God damn these expansions felt like a standalone game on it's own! Offered bunch of new content, a huge new island to turn it into your playground. Red Hammer had such a good storyline with a twist at the middle!Resistance also had a great campaign with a whole new island and missions.Now that's what you can call a expansion pack/DLCThese were probably the most important things to bring out in a review. I just grabbed this game for 0.79c and I am once again playing this game for about 20th time I think. I still have the game boxes so one day I can pass that legendary game to my children etc...

												Great battlefield simulator. It plays as if it was part of a movie that took place during the Cold Wat. The gameplay takes you through training as if you were in the military and a few in-game simulations. The actual battlefield on the other hand is very difficult, very life-like. Once I got the controllers down right I was able to go in better and then got shot down. I did find it odd that I couldn't jump but then again I didn't seem to need to jump in-game. Here are the first few minutes of gameplay all the way to my death:

												Old game that I have spent more hours than I dare to count. This was total blast as a multiplayer and single player campaign was interesting enough to keep my engaged until I finihsed it (multiple times even). Some of the missions are quite tricky and may require multiple tries, which coupled with the limited saves per mission can get very frustrating.Infantry operations are the most fun part of the game. Messing with tanks is tolerable and flying vehicles are annoying. I especially enjoyed that not all missions were about running into a village and gunning everyone down, but required stealth or simply survival.Game is pretty old and graphics reflects this. Good part is that it should run on a lower end machine as well.			"

												One of the best war simulators ever created. The first time you play it the game is a pain in the ♥♥♥♥, but once you learn how to move, shoot and stop it's super efective and easier. The vehicles are a strong part: Jeeps, Tanks, Helicopters and Trucks. Command your own squad makes it amazing and interesting too. I repeat, you could hate it, but you just need patience to get into the heart of this game. Instead of the Armed Assault franchise, I prefer this game (originally called Operation Flashpoint).PS: THE EDITOR! CREATE YOUR OWN MISSIONS! YAY!<3			"

												I played this game way back in the day and it really shook me how non-linear a game can be. You have to realize that at its release, most games had you storybording through the game on one single linear path. It became quite obvious that OFP was the game for me. People think this game doesn't hold up well today but that is false. The game has multiplayer still, me and a couple of guys frequent coop missions and th ey are a blast. If you want to play multiplayer with us, look up a program named Operation Monitor on the BI studios forums. Thats all you need. Cheers to a great game.			"

												When I got this game as a gift from my friend I seriously was not interested in playing it. However after opening the game I ended up trying out its missions. I remember being somehow impressed by the way how an old game was able to satisfy me, so I got more and more into it and now I'm pretty much playing Arma CWA daily. I would recommend finding friends to play the game with you. Of course messing around with planes, weapons n' other ♥♥♥♥ in the mission editor is loads of fun (at least for me), but nothing beats doing a Spec Op mission with 4 mates. A lot of people take criticizing the game for granted because of its age and bad graphics, but try the game out! I'd recommend checking out http://ofp.gamepark.cz/index.php?showthis=2692 as it's probably the most popular/well-known community website there is. Over there you will be able to find lots of single missions, mp missions, addons, skins... Pretty much everything!Just because it's not the newest of videogames, it doesn't mean that it's bad or unplayable. It's annoying how people just toss this awesome game away after just looking at screenshots of the game. "

												Still one of my most favourite games. Once in a while I start it up with ECP and some graphics mods to play a round of MFCTI versus bots. The feeling of trying to take the first town on insane resistance difficulty, gathering all the guns and ammo you find in the trabant you stole from a civillian a while earlier and then just going from town to town is awesome. Best LAN game ever! The feeling if one of your buddies is designated driver in the early game on MFCTI maps, just ferrying people from the base to the battlefield - everyone just doing his job to capture more villages until one can finally unleash the full armoured might of the soviet union - PRICELESS!I've been playing this game since it originally was released!

												this game is way ahead of it's time compared to other game that was released in 2001. the fine attention to detail is what staggers me the most, time cycle between day and night depends on the time of day,month and year, randomly generated number plates and the lot.. At that time no game could even come close to this revolutionary to open world game.when i was a child my dad borrow this game from his friend and me being a 6 year old boy who really love to play army men, i saw my dad played this game and i asked ""can i try it?"" and he let me tried it and instantly fell in love with this game. after fiddling around in the single player mission and failed horribly i accidently stumbled across the Mission Editor, i completely baffled by the UI because i couldn't understand a thing (let alone english) and what it does at the time, then i tried to mess around with it and slowly figured out how to place soldiers and vehicles then starting to put waypoints to a unit and create my very first mission. even though the mission itself didn't have any objective i imagined the soldier have their own quest and conversations between each other and having a blast on making it as well as playing it.since i grow old enough to understand this game i can really felt the struggle, the emotion and fear that the soldier have through out the campaign and made a lot of single player missions by the time i was 13. eventually i finished the game and boy i never felt as close to a real war playing any games other than this ( little bit of exaggeration but you get the point.)thank you Bohemia and Codemaster for this incredible game, but mostly a huge thanks to Bohemia Interactive Studio to made a sequel to this we all know today as the ARMA series			"

 ArmA: Cold War Assault REVIEW Many years ago in a time called 2001 came a legend called Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis and it gained many rewards along with a expansion pack called Resistance and even got Game Of The Year. But then around a ayear before ArmA: Armed Assault came out Codemasters and Bohemia had some troubles and split and Codemasters took the rights to the name Operation  Flashpoint and got re-released in 2011 under the name ArmA: Cold War Assault.ArmA: CWA is a military shooter/military simulator that is set during 1985 at the height of the Cold War. Soviet forces invade a bunch of islands and thats where you come in as apart of the U.S. army which is all I know.The graphics haven't aged well over the years and don't live up to todays standards. Textures being quite blurry and models are low-poly don't look nice but I guess computers weren't power beasts back in 2001 to be able to render some very large maps like Everon, Malden or Nogova which is the largest there.Sounds aren't to bad, ambient sounds being the best and the weapon sounds are lacking but do deliver a nice feeling of power. There is little ambient combat sounds which makes it hard to detect how far and where the fire is coming from but you do have a direction of where it might be coming from.You have the basics of shooter elements W,A,S,D move you around the map as a infantrymen. Z prones and Q goes crouch Q stands you up which is odd but you get used to it. Many more controls in-game but I'll explain vehicle controls. The basics when in any ground vehicle Q is slow speed, W is medium speed, E is fast speed, A turns left, D turns right and S goes backwards. Aircraft is a different story which would be best to learn in-game.There is selection of weapons and vehicles on each side and they have equal power to their opposing side. Sometimes even having a strong point and a weak point like the West side's Jeep is weakly protected but is faster than the more armoured East side's UAZ which is slower but can fit more people. Tanks have equal strength and power like the M60 is equal to the T-72 (unsure about the Resistance T-55.) Its missions can get buggy and glitchy but thats only the missions.The multiplayer servers are no longer online but you can download programs to see servers so it isn't fully dead yet.Overall I think its a decent game worth the money, it may be old but it still lives up as a good game and is GREAT when modded to utter-♥♥♥♥!I would give the game a 8/10 but with the community sitting behind it with thousands of mods to improve and add to the game I give it a 9 out of 10 and if theres anything I shoudl add to this review you can tell them in the comments and have a great day.

												Yes I recievd as a Gift. After Purchasing Arma 2 and all DLC, most likely or Arma 3.But I played Original trilogy back when it was still new.A few Features that really Impressed me.First and foremost: The AI did not seem to Differentiate you from other AI's.But if you Fire too many shots w/o changing positions, especially shooting 1, then 2 enemies and posibly 3, by then you have 3 or more all shooting at you.You could injure hand(s), arms, or legs, the one I hate most. I thought it was a bug at first I'd get up and then go prone again.It deserved Every Reward it got, and possibly more.I will Always remember, Definitley top 10 Ever, as far as How mcuh I enjoyed the game then, and considering it vs other games. Also I would gladly give the Game to anyone who would Enjoy it.After Playing Arma 3 I will not play this game again as Arma is over a decade Ahead, and still getting better.I was dissapointed the other OP Fp were not same maker's and worse, I did not Discover Arma till #3, but knew right away it was the same makers, and realized why the other OP FP's sucked.I assumed they owned the game name, but I guess not.

												Okay, I felt I had to do this... hem, THE GAME CAME OUT IN 2001 GUYS! Seriously how many negative revews are there whinning about this game having ""bad graphics"" and that for a game in 2011 it looks really bad...""Arma: Cold War Assault"" is the retitled game by Bohemia interactive known as ""Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis"" and it was made in 2001. Yes a full 10 ♥♥♥♥ing years older than these idiots are claming it to be. It was renamed in 2011 by Bohemia (the original developers and creators of the ""Arma"" series) in order to draw a gap between it and the Horrible ""game"" by codmasters  Operation Flashpoint: Dragon rising"". Because Codemasters kept the rights to the name, bohemia couldn't carry on their series under that said name so they created ArmA, but only in 2011 did they actually rename their original game Operation Flashpoint to mark it more as their property which it is. Soooooooo. Oh a 13 year old game? not 3 years? OOOOOoooooooWhat AMAYZING GraphicsWhat AMAYZING ControlsWhat AMAYZING PossibilitiesSeriously this game let's you do what you want, you can be a soldier, a tank commander, a helicopter pilot, a truck driver... Be anything, Do anything, make your own missions, or just play the extensive and challenging campaing. Calling this masterpiece and cornerstone of war simulation a ""piece of ♥♥♥♥"" is sickening at best and comes from a crowd of 13 year old COD players who wern't even born when this titan of a game was released. So please all you idiots who can't tell a 13 year old game from a 3 year old one, just refrain from posting your poisonous oppinions and atemting to tarnish the imaculate reputation of the greatest war simulation franchize of all time and one of the best game series out there. Also if as most of these kids you truly believe that COD is a better game... just keep your oppinions to yourself, because this just isn't the game for you. I don't go around throwing punches at Final Fantasy because I know I'm not the target audience and such an exercise would simply be... Pointless.Thank you, and I hope someday a lot of you will do a little research before ""revewing"" a game, let alone actually play the game.			"

												This is quite the interesting game. I got it, seeing how I've shown some interest in ArmA, I have a low-end PC and the game itself was pretty cheap. Needless to say, I was far from disappointed.But to prevent others from being disappointed, let me make one thing clear:  This game, in terms of realism and style, is nothing, and I mean nothing like Call of Duty or Battlefield. Those games try to be cinematic and intense, leaning on explosoins and special effects that almost trump Michael Bay in terms of how ridiculous and frequent they are. ArmA, at least this one, tries to approach genuine military simulation, and it shows.For example, let's look at the damage model:  A shot to the legs, you can't walk, a shot to either arm, and you can't shoulder-fire your weapon, a shot to the head? Well, unless you're a courier stuck in a desert, let's just say you won't be stumblign back up. For most, it's two pops and you, your allies, or your targets are dead; none of this life bar that slowly regenerates which the newer Battlefield and CoD games do for whatever reason. If you're hurt, you need to call a medic, no easy way out.Also, vehicles. You can't just hop into a tank by yourself and go and wreak havoc. You must get into a vehicle, and depending on the circumstances, you must crew it (If it's a multi-person vehicle), rearm it, repair it and refuel it, call it your Three R's. Like with a tank, while there *is* a manual fire option, I suggest not using it, as it only aims in the direction that the weapon is last fixed in. So you must have a commander tell the driver where to go, and the gunner where to shoot. Operating on a team is absolutely vital to winning. Which means team participation and roles are imperative to the gameplay.My only qualms lay in the graphics and the voice acting. I've seen some pretty impressive titles come out of the year 2001, (Does the name ""Halo"" ring a bell?) and the graphics are blocky, choppy and overall unpleasant to look at. I like that they tried to make character models more organic; not just a bunch of cardboard stiffs, but for some reason the design of their faces make them look perpetually stoned out of their minds. The environments can look a little dull at times, and I can't help but look at trees and bushes that behave almost like cardboard cutouts--like pieces of paper being flattened as you run over them. However, building and vehicle models are rather well done, and guns look pretty good too. The voice acting sounds a little...odd. The way some of the folks in campaign talk in ways that almost seem hammy, Koslowski being the most poignant display of this in my humble opinion. However, I don't mind this too much. Even if the graphics are lackluster, at least it can run on my PC, which has a rather outdated GPU (Has 256MB VRAM, substantially less than the norm)So, if you're looking for a good first-person shooter you can hop into, maybe this shouldn't be your first choice. However, if you want a game that gives you a realistic simulation of the different theaters of combat, and you want to live out what it must've been like in 1985 to see everyone's hate of the USSR before the Iron Curtain fell, and just to overall enjoy yourself in a good first-person shooter that you don't need a top-notch PC to run, then ArmA:  Cold War Assault's your game.

												Excellent game for people who are very casual, but not for people who enjoy graphics. Not many players, but still some people, and it's not too angering when you die, since you expect it to happen really. The game's a bit slow and the weapons aren't completely balanced, but it's still decent to play while waiting for something or if you're just bored.			"

PROS:+ great single player campaign+ single missions & Resistance mini-campaign+ freedom of choice+ cool battle simulation mechanics+ mission editor+ huge mapsCONS:- graphical glitches- weird AI behavior sometimes- multiplayer lag (even with good connection)- LAN multiplayer only- cardboard graphicsComment:What a game! I played this over 10 years ago and the gameplay is just as good today. Back then it was called Operation Flashpoint - Cold War Crisis, from 2001 but due to copyright issues it has been renamed under the ARMA brand in 2011. This game is a war/army simulator and as such it is bound under certain simulation rules. For example everything is hard as balls to operate. Tanks, helicopters, boats ... and planes, holy hell is it difficult to fly planes! But once you learn it, it is fantastic! Flying around in an Apache helicopter and raining hell down on all those shiny tanks is AWESOME! All this is present in the single missions but mainly the campaign. The campaign does give you missions and an outline on how to do them. But you can just ignore all that and do a lot of the stuff your own way! Place C4 to destroy 4 tanks? Nah, get in one of the tanks and wreck everything (including low flying choppers). Carefully use stealth to get to the extraction point while avoiding BMPs and patroling soldiers? Nope, just steal a Skoda 120 car and zig zag between the tank and soldier fire.  Examples like these is what made the game great for me. What extends the experience even more is the missions you do yourself in the editor. However there are downsides too - graphical glitches, stupid AI sometimes and carboard graphics. Multiplayer is pretty much dead except for LAN. But if you manage to hook up a MP game with some friend(s) you will not regret it. Yes, it is a bit laggy because the network code is rubbish, but it still is loads of fun. I recommend this retro game that despite the flaws is just so much fun!			"

Learn how it worked.What I found was a technical masterpiece that was absolutely amazing for its time.Although the graphics can pass of as something from the ""PS1 Era"" its controls are far complex from what any console can handle.Its not as complex as its successor ARMA II & III, its a heck of a lot of fun.And if you're like me, and your computer isn't the strongest, this game is definitely something to check out.8/10			"

Well if you've ever pondered this horrible thought then ARMA Cold War Assualt is the game for you. It has practically all the same game mechanics of ARMA III but none of the spectacular PTSD inducing graphical upgrades.

												""OH NO! FOOUR IS DOWNN!"" The horrendous radio chatter is all I need to make me reminisce about a time when open world/sandbox games were few and far between. I spent many hours  of my youth playing in the evenings with a bunch of friends, trying out new mods and missions each time. I fondly remember running away from zombies and failing to deploy my parachute on many occasion. It was great a laugh and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  The great thing about this game is the amount of freedom it gives you.  Don't want to be executed by a Russian firing squad? Steal their Hind that they just transported you in. Or you can run off in any direction and hope they don't shoot you in the back. Recently due to the multiplayer side of things being down, I've gone through the campaign again and it was definitely  worth revisiting. I spent the early parts of the campaign recording the various ways my squad leader managed to get himself killed and trying my hardest to organise formations and be an effective team leader. If you have yet to give this a go, I would highly recommend it. In my opinion the campaign is far better than ARMA and its subsequent sequels and if you manage to get a LAN going or end up playing multiplayer through another option, you'll have a great time.

												I like the ARMA series, so I went for it when I was offered ARMA: Cold War Assault. If I am completely honest the game is (or at least for me was) a frustrating bug filled mess. I spent hours just trying to get the game to work right on my computer. I am guessing most of these issues were simply because the game was so very old. It is forgivable however because the game provides an adequate view into ARMA's roots. When you do get the game running you will be happy to find a decent game and you will finally see how far ARMA has come when comparing ARMA: Cold War Assault (Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis)  to the newest release ARMA 3.  Overall I was glad to have picked this up while it was free, and think many of you, if you have taken the time to read this review might also enjoy the game. I hope you take the time to learn a little about the ARMA series as well.			"

												The graphics are terrible, yes you can't deny that, but its still a classic. Gameplay itself is frustratingly hard, unlike CoD, Battlefield, and many other FPS shooters you can't charge around a corner and hope to still live. You can't rush head on into a group of soldiers and expect a victorious outcome. You will die, over and over and over again. It's very hard - but it's also much more realistic because of it. I got this game so that I may give it a good review based off past playthroughs, I'm hoping I can do the same again on Steam.			"

												If you are spoiled by modern games that takes your hand to guide you, heal you in middle of firefight etc. etc..Skip this game.This games is the origin of arma series, one merciless motherload of tactical epicness and best game investment i ever made.  (actually bought this game 2x, i've played it so much when it came out i ruined my discs) No game ever have satisfied me like this one and thats why i'm always coming back to it.Recommendations: - CSLA mod, another 20 hours of mission/campaign and lots of weapons and vehicles- when you get used to the game try setting dificulty to veteran, full simulation not even the little help thats in game will be provided (e.g: enemy tracking on map)Pros n Cons+ graphics (i'm serious)+ tactical control over everything (you decide when to do anything or when to call backups if available, absolute squad control etc...)+ satisfying campaigns & missions ( huge variety of mission types )+ soundso Some people might not like the controls, but i think they were pretty good imhoSince i'm fanboi- no real cons[My steam might say i didnt played the game much but off-steam i've hundred hours on this game]			"

												Behold! The life of a solider, one shot can kill a him, or save him from death. This is the game that even after a decade still holds up the standart for Cold War era games. The fictional conflict between the USA and USSR gives us an idea of how WW3 would turn out with the vast arsenal at the disposal of both sides.It's impossible to describe the feeling of satisfaction when you complete a hard mission after dying over and over again.In short: This is a classic worthy of everyone's attention.

Not like in ArmA and ArmA 2, where they are just a vulgar crap. The best thing however is, that the download content for this game is huge and alot more interesting. Oather Arma series games just can not compete with OFP in this way.			"

												A blast from the past, this was my most played game on the original Xbox. The graphics aren't fantastic but don't let that lead you away. The gameplay is by far more than worth the money, there's 2 campaigns ""Cold war assault"" and ""Resistance"". Ontop of that there's a bunch of scenario's you can try. This isn't a run and gun game! You have to plan things out and sometimes things won't go according to plan, you're a squishy human being who will die in one or two shots. But this makes victory all the more satisfying and fortunately your enemies share this same weakness, making it way more realistic than any other shooter released at the time. And there's the editor.... oh boi, this made me feel like i was playing with plastic toy soldiers again, you have the ability to create your own scenario's giving you the abilitiy to make your own fun.  Unfortunetly for those who have played ArmA 2 and ArmA 3 you won't find the editor that great. It's easy to notice what features weren't around when Operation flashpoint came out. Init fields, special fields, Elevation, name field, Moduels and many more features aren't present here. But that just comes to show how far the series has come and if it wasn't for this starting point we wouldn't have the impressive Editor we have in ArmA 3 currently.With Gamespy being no more you can't connect to online games easily, APPRENTLY there are ways around it but i am unable to figure it out. I didn't play Online back on Xbox so i didn't expect to play online in the first place.			"

												A very good game. I never played Operation Flash Point when it originallty came out and I have only played a little so far since getting this in a free promotion last year. Though I'm using the Cold War Rearmmed mod in Arma 1 so I can play the campaigns and missions of CWA/Operation Flash Point in that. This works very well as my machine can't run Arma 2 very well. But there are mods that can improve the graphics in Cold War Assault/Operation Flash Point. Also mods, addons, user made missions and campaigns will add extra content to the base game. Yes it is a very good game that is more  in keeping with a millitary simulation than a run and gun shooter.  It shares the same technology that is used in virtual reality simulations to train the millitary.I've just scratched the surface of what it can do.			"

												This is my review for ARMA: Cold War Assault a.k.a Operation FlashpointI didn't manage to pick this up when it was free a few months ago but did when it was on sale for a buck, and all I can say, is that this game is very ADDICTING! I managed to put many hours into the first few days playing this non stop.The age of this game hasn't age all that well for some people if they judge by graphics, but if you are like me and focus on gameplay alone, then this is an excellent game. In my opinion this has just been the copy for the newer Arma games because I played them all and I can say for sure that they all were just a copy and paste from this one with just a newer engine and updated graphics.But with that beside us, let me get down to the pros/consPros:Very realistic and our own military uses the newer arma games for some training programs and demonstrationsNice mods that implement many more campaigns, WW2, Vietnam, ectGreat teamwork online(yes people still play)With mods, improvement in graphics and soundsOverhaul, excellent and get this if your hardware can't handle the newer arma gamesCons:Without mods, not so great graphics/soundsSome hiccups for an older engineUI for editor is ok, make sure to have it on advance,Thats it, I highly recomment it, thanks!

												Back when it was called Operation Flashpoint and Arma didn't exist, I probably put more tme into this game (obviously outside of Steam) than anything else I've ever played. As far as military sims available to the public went, this was the be all and end all, Ghost Recon x 50. I couldn't believe such a game could exist when I first picked it up. I must have spent thousands of hours in the editor. Of course the Arma games have surpassed this title greatly, but they never matched the feel I got from playing this when I was young, there was always just something about it, it felt completely real. For the price, you can't go wrong.			"

												Best in the series and the greatest simulator ever made.  Been playing on and off since 2001.  I've owned 3 cd copies, the GOG, and now this one.Awesome campaigns.  The most responsive combat without anywhere near as many buttons as later games.  Can run on a potato.  Millions of mods.  Easy to use mission maker.			"

												This game is also too graphics intensive. I had trouble running it on my GTX 750 Ti, and was only getting 20-30 FPS on the lowest graphics settings. The textures are absolutely beautiful, though. For a few minutes, I felt like I was looking at pictures from real life, not a video game. The voice acting is brilliant. No pause between words whatsoever, it makes you really feel like you are there. Only get this game if you've got a 3-way SLI GTX 780 with at least 5GB GDDR5 RAM per card. That might get you medium graphics settings. A very revolutionary game, but I'm wondering how Battlefield 4 got more attention than this? This game has better gameplay, better graphics, better voice acting, and a GREAT singleplayer campaign. If you are thinking of wasting money on Battlefield 4, just get this game instead. It is free, afterall. Seriously though, this game sucks lol.			"

												I didnt know what to expect when i first saw this game when it went free for a few days on Steam. I downloaded the game and hopped in. Boy this game surprised me.This game is an open world squad based military shooter. Sounds awesome right? Beacuse it is! Fighting across massive islands in tense firefights struggling to survive to see the next tense firefight is a lot of fun. This game is also NOT I repeat NOT for you that like casual shooters. 1-3 bullets can kill you. 1 from a headshot if you get unlucky. This game is NOT for casuals. When I first started playing I got frustated at the amount of times I was dying, which was an absurd amount. You HAVE TO play smart, and make every bullet count. There is very little room for error. The combat for me took getting used to, there is a learning curve. The NPCS are also surprisingly smart when it comes to combat. They take cover, launch grenades, take out veichles like its a priority, and are scarily accurate. Perhaps the greatest thing about the game is the level editor. You can select from 5 massive islands to create your own battles. You can place different factions down, set patrols, waypoints, objectives, ranks, behaviour, etc. Making massive battles to take place in is very fun. I have been screwing around for hours just making large battles, its fun to see so many tanks fight at once :) . The level editor does take learning and the internet to know how to use. There is no tutorial for it. And when it comes to waypoints its gets a little tricky.. And NEVER try to make a tank or any veichle cross a bridge via a waypoint. Its painful to watch.Pros-Tense, stressful, rewarding combat.-Large, fun battles-Level editor is a beast-Massive maps to fight on- As long as you keep coming up with new ideas, Level editor will keep you entertained for a long time.- Impressive NPC to fight against. Definetly gives you a challenge.- Lots of variety in combat. Foot soldiers alone have lots of different classes.Cons- The NPCS dont have the best pathfinding- Learning curve- Dated graphics (Graphics to me personaly dont matter though)- Boring campaign in my opinionOverall I would give this game a 9.5/10. This game is very impressive and fun. You may experience some annoying glitches with pathfinding and such and it is a bit dated, but it hardly subtracts from the overall experience. Definetly a fantastic game for you that like a challenge in a military game. "

												Man, when I play this game, all I can think is quality. Textures? Flawless. Gun mechanics? Flawless? There isn't a single thing I would have changed if I made this game. It is simply that amazing. In fact, I took a screenshot while looking at the sky in-game and compared it to a high-resolution image of the atmosphere taken by NASA and could spot no differences between them. In fact, I sent a side by side comparison of the two to NASA and they couldn't tell which was the fake and which was real! I mean, for a game made in 2001, that is impressive. I'm pretty sure this goes without saying, but this game runs twice as well as newer games such as Batllefield 4 and Call of Duty: Ghosts, while including twice the content. Again, the degree to which the developers went with this game to reach this gem of a first-person-shooter is simply mind-boggling. Never before has the gaming industry seen a game with audio and models in game that are nearly indistinguishable from people and noises in real life. Truly, if you have been searching for a game where you hunt communism through the western frontier all your life, search no more. ARMA: Cold War Assault is the game for you.			"

												Picked this up for free back during the Bohemia Anniversary a few years ago when they were giving free copies.No regrets at all. Not only was it a no brainer since it was free, it's still fun and plays great for a game originally released 15 years ago. And even if you do buy it, it's cheap. As of writing this on November 23, 2016, it's 80% off, at $1.19. Original price: $6.It's worth the small amount of money it costs. Great story, good gunplay, enough realism to make your teammates scream after getting shot, and decent graphics.And don't forget to nominate it for the ""Test of Time"" Award.			"

												This game is too intense for me.  Putting Battlefiend 4 to shame with its realistic gameplay, this game almost gave me a heart attack.  I could barely play for 5 minutes before being rushed to the hosiptal.  Frustrated, I killed some teammates, but in good old Arma fashion they retaliated.  The graphics also imposed a threat.  Even the mission!  It is crazy that you can die in 3 seconds, Multiplayer or not.  All in all... 10/10 for people who can handle it.			"

												Imagine if Ukraine was a Socialist Island with NATO Units stationed there. And the Socialist government dissolves and Russia has to throw their dice into the fire ASAP, with NATO troops stationed there. No, not the Ukraine on the news, a tiny one, and it's the 1980s. Then Russia magically wins against NATO because the U.S. carrier group sent out to aide it's NATO counterparts never shows up. Ever. And there's also a resistance campaign, because everyone wants to resist Russian takeover Even Taco Bell.			"

												Cool game. I actually played through it a month or so ago off Steam and it's a lot of fun. Originally released as Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, this is a tactical Cold War shooter. It hasn't aged that well and the voice acting is quite wonky but it has an excellent campaign which is the main reason why I picked it up. It's more of a thinking man's shooter, and after a few missions you'll be put in charge of a squad which you can order around. I was really surprised at how well the squad mechanics worked, it's not just a worthless gimmick. It was quite fun playing this game in contrast to ArmA 3 and seeing how the series got started and has evolved. Unlike the ArmA 3 campaign this one featured a greater variety of missions, there's stealth missions, tank missions, heli missions, even one where you fly the A-10. While the outdated graphics place a lot of limits on how large scale the battles are, the game still has pretty good draw distance for its time which makes tank battles really feel like tank missions (after the first tank mission I hated them, by the last tank mission I loved them). If you're a fan of Cold War stuff there is a lot in here, you'll be running from BMPs loaded with Soviet troops, supported by HINDs and T80s rolling around destroying everything while the SHILKA denies friendly air support. This is all accompanied by a great original soundtrack which I feel was a little hampered by the poorly chosen licensed music. The difficulty picked up significantly during the last few missions (I actually had to resort GameFaqs, something I haven't done in a while) but overall the game is very playable aside from a couple crashes and bugs. So in conclusion it's not perfect, but still a great tactical Cold War shooter that's worth picking up for free.Favorite quote (something you should get used to hearing):""Fall back into formation."". . .""WHERE ARE YOU?!?""

												The game that begun it all, Originally Operation Flashpoint: Coldwar Crisis, is set in the malden islands where a hostile soviet force invades, you play several characters in the campaign, where you start off as a basic soldier where you get promoted to commanding a platoon, you can fly jets, drive tanks and other vehicles, but dont think you can jsut run and gun like a shooter because you die in a few hits and if you arent careful you squad will be decimated...

I hear everybody everyday complain about ""Oh, this game is not realistic, I do not want to play this crap!"", but they don't understand that gaming is not about the graphics. With ARMA: Cold War Assault, you have all the realism of war with nostalgic graphics. A true first-person shooter classic. I suggest this over any of the Call of Duty games.			"

												Many of us like ArmA because there is no other milsim game like it. But with ArmA 2 being simply unplayable due to many bugs and poor optimization, and ArmA 3 being too expensive for what it is, many of us have a problem. That's where this game comes in.With all seriousness, I found this game, which is the first ArmA game, to be more playable than ArmA 2. It looks terrible, but it is playable and I found it more enjoyable than ArmA 2. To make things better, this game is also much cheaper than ArmA 2. In fact, Steam gave it for free back when I got the game.So give this game a chance, you might enjoy it.			"

												I originally got this when it was Operation Flashpoint back in 2001, and dear god if there was any game that put the fear of war into me it was this one. Although it has dated badly, I still install it almost every year to give it a play through. Never before have I been in such distraught confusion and scared ♥♥♥♥-less as when I played a mission where my whole team got whipped-out and I had to retreat to a LZ to wait for a helicopter. On my retreat, I was shot in the legs and could no longer run; the LZ was almost 3 miles away (and that's just a fraction of the island you are on). I had to crawl, hiding in bushes for what seemed like 3 real hours playing this tense game of hide-and-seek with Russian troops moving all around me. Screw Call of Duty and Battlefield. If you want a military experience in video game form, Go ARMA/Operation Flashpoint (but not the new Flashpoint games, those suck. Only ARMA brand is good now).			"

												This Game...what can I say about this game? Well first its cheap (I actually even bought it on a sale for 0.79, perfect!). This game has the basic Arma formula, Campaign, Single Player, Multiplayer and even Editing Mode which I love to death and wasted most of my time there. This game has pretty low graphics but considering this game is from 2001 well it doesn't matter. Note* I don't have a full blown out gaming PC as my previous one died so I'm using this 16 year old Laptop which needs a USB Wireless Stick to connect to the Internet, and plays this game just fine. In short this is a very cheap full game, that will play on nearly every computer you pit it against (unless the PC practically has no graphics card or is from '95), not to mention its not even a Gigabyte in size, you don't require GB's of memory and RAM, so its relatively small as well! All in all I think its a good deal for quick fun, especially if you don't have an up-to-date PC and have to rely on older hardware! I gurantee you hours and hours of fun (don't be fooled by my playtime, I've been playing it for much much longer in Offline Mode because of my crappy Laptop). So yes I recommend this if you don't have a good PC.			"

												One of the fathers of all modern Army Simulation games. Operation Flashpoint as it was known before.Where do I begin with this old beast ? It's that kind of game that can entertain you for hours, with its long campaigns (although there are only 2 campaigns here : Cold War Crisis and Resistance. The Russian campaign, Red Hammer, was removed for some reason), its many SP Missions, and the Editor, oh boy, the Editor.Even if you don't like the campaigns, the Editor will entertain you for days. You can build your own missions, with scripts, even build full campaigns, or just place some soldiers and armored, and start a little battle. It's a lot of fun, and with the possibility to add custom units (well, most of the websites dedicated to that are dead now), you can have a lot of variety !The father of military sim, and one of the old gems that the gaming industry has made !

												The only real game bohemia ever released, Operation Flashpoint was awesome, is awesome, and will be awesome. Unlike some other products bohemia later started to poop out, OPFP was released with full single-player campaign and multiplayer and did not require million user-made mods to give 100 hours worth of gameplay. However, this package ALSO has the excellent resistance expansion pack which adds yet another very good quality campaign of 10-12 hour range and as you can guess, there still exists a ton of user-made awesomeness into this game.

												This title was seminal in producing a large number of modern combined arms/battlefield type games.  Right now, I consider this title utterly dataed, and I would not really recomend it to anyone, but back in the day it was very enjoyable.  Play it for nostalgia reasons.  If you like the concept purchase ARMA III its sequel.  I recall spending countless hours modding for this title and it honstly was one of the best experiences of my life.			"

												This hyper-realistic first-person tactical shooter is one of the best ever, hands down! Yes, it's hard. No, it's not CoD, where you can get shot ten times and come out smiling. You will die a lot in this game. But what do you expect, when it's made by people who build military simulators? The difficulty of this game as compared to other first-person shooters only makes the success of a mission that much sweeter. Or, you could be like me and, after completing the objectives for a mission, go off and annihilate everything that moves on the island. Either way, victory is sweet. There is a great variety of weapons and ""classes"". The mission editor, once you learn how to use it, ensures that all content in the game is at your fingertips. Dogfights between A-10 and SU-25? Done. Tank battles between Shilkas and Vulcans? Easy. The possibilities are limitless! Last but not least, the vehicular warfare is the best I have ever seen in a video game. Nothing beats the thrill of laying down heavy fire on helpless tank/infantry columns in an Mi-24 Hind. 10/10			"

												Well what to say.. The Singleplayer is fun, lots of missions and much to do in LS. If you like to hunt achievements it is just great. There are so many collectables. If you like mods, the game should offer actually everything you can imagine. I personally don't like mods. It's up to you.Story is great. 9/10.Characters are just awesome. 10/10.Gameplay feels good. 9/10.GTA V is one of the best games, if not the best, with free DLC's and updates. GTA Online became so fun with all its DLC's. And since many modders + cheaters got banned, the game is even better! I hope they won't come back that soon with new accounts and such.I loved the Stunt DLC and still love it, also the Bikers DLC. Can't wait for new DLC's. Rockstar Games is doing such great work with that game. It's always fun when you play it, either for game it 24/7 or just an hour. I prefer to play it with friends! I'm used to play it with my Dad :D "

												Pros:Extremely large believable world to relive your military fantasies of World War III. ArmA: CWA delivers in breadth and really astounds. There is quite a lot to see and experience in the game that you'd probably be wanting to replay the campaigns long after you've completed them.Mission objectives are varied and usually fun to complete.Campaigns are long and come with interesting movie cutscenes to watch.The AI is quite good (but also unforgiving).You have the ability to toggle between first person and third person views.You essentially get Cold War Crisis and the Resistance expansion updated to run on modern systems.The mission editor continues the life of the game indefinitely.Cons:You character will die very often, so make sure you save. This brings me to the next point...Unfortunately you can only save once for every mission in the campaign.Missions usually take more than 15 minutes to complete. Make sure you have catered time to play them.The missions are scripted to the point that if you deviate from your objectives too much, you may find yourself not able to complete the mission.Vehicle physics is very simplified... don't come away from reading this review expecting realistic vehicular simulations. The base 3D models for humans is unimpressive.There is that irritating shouting of instructions by your squad leader where nothing can be done about it.The game still has the rare crash to desktop problem; make sure you save your missions.It's truly a godsend that Bohemia Interactive has given us Armed Assault: Cold War Assault. This game allows us to re-live some exciting battles from the Cold War Crisis and Resistance campaigns. I will never forget the fun times I had with the game series. I got to storm a beach with a lighthouse in Red Hammer, then there was the time when I had to escape by foot to an extraction point all by myself in Cold War Crisis, and the time when I made the wrong choice and got an innocent resistance soldier captured in Resistance.

												Its a fun tactical game that was originally released as Operation Flashpoint:Cold War Crisis but due to copyrights  (Codemasters own the Operation Flashpoint name) they renamed it to Arma for this release. Not really a mil sim (atleast not these days) as its not quite that realistic in my eyes. And in terms of single player stuff its way better than Arma 2 and 3. 3 dousn't even have a campaign, just DLC.Regardless you see alot of Bohemia here. Up until Arma 2 they just recycled the same buildings and plants over and over essentially. They used new models and textures but weirdly enough alot of the buildings are basically the same sorta stuff. Thats fine to me. What isn't fine is Bohemias long term inability to optimize their games. Try playing this game on high maxed or on very high settings. You won't be getting a good framerate. The game runs like ♥♥♥♥ for as old as it is even on newer hardware. Bohemia didn't do anything to this game besides whitewash the old name out from what I can see.  Bohemia isn't the worst in how they treat their niche fans (tripwire takes that cake) but they sure don't seem to care about giving the customers what they want anymore atleast. Arma 3 was just as unoptimized as 2 and still runs terribly and they didn't even try to optimize this game for modern hardware. Atleats it works and has 1080 resolution which is more than alot of steam games these days.Regardless its a cozy albeit quirky tactical FPS from a bygone era and possibly the best Arma/Bohemia game single player wise.  I remember getting a copy of this game under the OPF name like 6 years ago and playing it in high school. I think it was a GOG copy but I don't remember. I would get that version if I were you. But regardless it ran very well on WinXP Pentium 4 with probably 512mb of ram or maybe a 1gb and intel integrated GPU. Possibly better than it does on my FX 8350, R9 270x, with 8gb of RAM. Time is a ♥♥♥♥♥ so that might be not completely true but this game dousn't really like new hardware. Thanks Bohemia on shafting me once again.Arma TacticsArma 3 Arma:Cold War AssaultHave all been pretty terrible releases with the last being on GOG at some point. Just go find the GOG release as anything GOG is way better than steam anyway. They might be selling it on GOG again but idk. Cold War is the only game really worth playing though. Arma 3 is just a huge dissappointment and seems like alot less community than 2 had plus it still runs like utter garbage for no reason. Bohemia isn't a good developer is what I'm trying to say. They occasionally make something thats pretty okay now and then.			"

												A game from my childhood, Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis (as it was known back then) is THE ACTUAL FIRST ARMA (the original ARMA: Armed Assault is a spiritual successor to this game), and one of those games where you don't have any handholding. The game has two difficulties, Cadet and Veteran, or, as I like to call them, ♥♥♥♥ You and ♥♥♥♥ You Harder (Which you can tweak. God, old games are awesome). There is even an extra choice to make the AI even harder in the options menu, called Super AI, that you can apply to the other difficulties. I haven't tried it yet (since I'm still gitting gud) but I'm betting it turns the difficulties into You're So ♥♥♥♥ed, and Oh Look, You Just Got One Shot No Scoped By A Pistol From The Other Town 10km Over. Expect Dark Souls of shooters. If you aren't careful, you WILL be shot, and if you are shot, you are either dead, forced to crawl, or were extremely lucky and can take an extra shot. Overall, I really like the game, and the nostalgia factor that it has for me allows me to completely ignore it's visibly aging graphics and mechanics.			"

												Hi all;Once a great game, now, is dead, I did not even find famous mods anymore. Most links and sites are dead, un-updated and left to rot. You have to be very lucky to find good mods and mods' patches on internet for this great game and best campaigns(offical and resistance) I ever played.So, I decided to let her rest in peace and let OPF live in my dreams. Good bye beloved one.It has been a long time but, Thanks: BohemiaFFUR teamGRAA temaLiberation 41 teamInvasion 44 teamand many more smaller mod and mission creators -please forgive me, because of my age, I can't remember your names anymore- who turn OFP to even greater game.(Please warn me if my sentences are not understandable or misunderstandable)Edit_1:Thanks,CSLA 2 team			"

												It's good and runs smooth, but it's also old. A classic, I got it for free, but I can see it being worth it for the diehard fans of arma to see how it all started (Me). Keeping that in mind the controls are WAY different, so there will be a learning curve. Overall worth what little money you'll pay.			"

Barry, I told you,stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam.- Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel?- A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school,three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I tooka day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry.- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie?- Yeah. - You going to the funeral?- No, I'm not going. Everybody knows,sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel.Such a hothead. I guess he could havejust gotten out of the way. I love this incorporatingan amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations.

Here we go. Keep your hands and antennasinside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like?- A little scary. Welcome to Honex,a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee,have worked your whole life to get to the point where youcan work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant PollenJocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected,scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctivegolden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot.- She's my cousin! - She is?- Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right.- At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspectof bee existence. These bees are stress-testinga new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes?- Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement,the Krelman. - What does that do?- Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs aresmall ones. But bees know that every small job,if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the jobyou pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life?I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees,as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?""How can you say that? One job forever?That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only haveto make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could theynever have told us that? Why would you question anything?We're bees. We're the most perfectlyfunctioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe thingswork a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you knowwhat I'm talking about. Please clear the gate.Royal Nectar Force on approach.

You guys did great! You're monsters!You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were.- I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knowswhere, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a PollenJock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollenthan you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol.Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing itand the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies?Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys.- Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerousbeing a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned meagainst a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat,and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my!- I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today,wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patchsix miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh?- Barry! A puddle jump for us,but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am.- You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy?Are you bee enough? I might be. It all dependson what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices.- But you only get one. Do you ever get boreddoing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you justmove it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm.It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad,the more I think about it, maybe the honey fieldjust isn't right for me. You were thinking of what,making balloon animals? That's a bad jobfor a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not surehe wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes.- I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're goinginto honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer?- No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now.I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Geta gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!

I am reviewing this game to modern standards. While not exactly fair to the game, I am showing why I find it a bad purchase.This game is amazing considering it was made in 2001, but it certainly does NOT hold up to modern day standards (which is no suprise). It is clunky, has fairly bad controls (but can be rebinded), and on top of that the graphics are flat out ugly.However what I do love about it is that there is so much variety compaired to ARMA 3. But sadly this does not make up for the clunky, outdated gameplay.Purchase if your looking for a ""novelty"" or nostalgic type of game, but I can't say you should buy it if your looking to actually play the game. If you are purchasing a realisitc/ARMA game, I'd suggest the upgraded (but still buggy) ARMA 3, or the cheaper alternative (but with more content), ARMA 2. A2 has a lot of quality DLCs too, would be a good deal to get it on sale with all the DLC.But do know that the review of the reviews are very biased on this game, and I'm not saying that because I'm getting bad reviews. If you look at the all time negative reviews you will see all are majorly downvoted.			"

												When an old game like this is still broken (or f***ed up, depends you're mood), it just deserve to be forgotten into the abyss of gaming. Deceived by the devs's work, by the impossibility to end a mission with a cheat code ("" Oh nice, I'm stuck in campaign SOLO mode ! ""). You earned wrong your money, and I canno't do anything to fix it, but pledging that I will never buy your game, and will only play it unlegit, just to say how much you p*** me off at the face...    No Multiplayer working, no solo mod working, just hacking it and dling onto the net seems appropriate before wanting to buy this piece of ****, even for  1 buck ! "

Playtime at time of review:45 minutesDate at time of review:6/2/14First mission:Killed all of team unit before first rendezvous (getting out of helicopter), yet still heard characters talking at mission point. (Dead bodies surrounding me - I lol'd)Graphics/Video: [3/10]They are pretty impressive for being from 2001. Today, they are sub-par. But that's to be expected. Voice/Sound: [1/10]It was PROBABLY ok in 2001, but... It's not so great by todays standards, at all. I think this was the most unattractive part of the game for me.Game Mechanics: [5/10]The gameplay was pretty good, I really liked the aiming, and body mechanics (Except you could NOT sprint without a weapon in your hand? Confusing).Overall Score:[3/10]The game was ok, but the sound/voice acting killed it for me, nice game mechanics.Would recommend buying 75%-90% off if you're wanting to play this game.			"

												After playing Arma 2, OA and 3 I figured that the game that kick started the series must've been at least of decent quality considering the others had massive success. So the game is free for a while and I download, sitting in my chair I slap my scrotum as the download lurks to 99% complete. I boot the game, my hand shakes faster than when I got in a gunfight on a rainy day in new york when i tried to buy a kilo of crack. but the guy set me up so i shot him. but wait some dude ran around the corner and i pistol whipped him. anyway as i was saying it launched i screamed i clicked play... then I cried. this game is one the most try hard games i've ever seen. it is about as realistic as gothom city imposters and thats a stretch considering the graphics are worse than an army man game i played once that was made in like 2001. you could except the vehicles to handle a bit like saints row and ai are about equivalent to that of the ghosts in pacman. please save your how much this game costs for something better like ice cream or hispanic hookers ps they're the cheapest pss might have aids though			"

												TL;DR Rating: 1/10I'm being completely honest when I say I couldn't even play this game. Despite the graphics looking like they where created on Windows 95, I decided that I should give this game a whirl since I got it on a free weekend. I launched it today for the first time, and used the fullscreen mode. I was using Steam Big Picture Mode to launch it, and it broke my gaming rig where it tried to draw windows over the screen and wouldn't accept cursor clicks in the game, but instead on my other windows. Thinking I hit a bug, I tried again in Windowed Mode. BIG MISTAKE. I tried this 3 times, as the cursor wouldn't sync, but instead have 1 cursor outside of the window, which sat upon the top left of my screen with no border to move it, and another cursor in game that was flying around like it was on a ton of sugar. I finally got full screen mode to work after numerus tries, and the cursor flew like I have never seen before. It was extreamly hard to get the the mouse sensitivity page like this, and when I finally did and set it lower, the cursor would lock in place constantly, only going on 1 axis (Mostly the x-axis). By this point I had reached my limit trying to play this crap. This isn't something that should be paid for, or even free. Honestly, I am disappointed that something like this would come out of a company such as this one.

												Crappy game. It runs like ♥♥♥♥♥ on a quite decent rig, it skips a whole second of gameplay every 10 seconds or so.. The game is a bloody dinosaur, and even back then , I don't think it took any prizes for anything. But I guess if you're into oldies maybe it could grow on you. On the technical side, it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nightmare. It suffers from HORRIBLE mouse accel and the sensitivity itself is a nightmare to set. It has 10 notches. On notch 4 is INSANELY HIGH, on notch 3 it's INSANELY LOW... So be prepared to pull your hairs while trying to get a fix for that... I couldn't even get into it because it has so many technical faults. Bad experience. Do not recommend.			"

												TL;DR Rating: 1/10I'm being completely honest when I say I couldn't even play this game. Despite the graphics looking like they where created on Windows 95, I decided that I should give this game a whirl since I got it on a free weekend. I launched it today for the first time, and used the fullscreen mode. I was using Steam Big Picture Mode to launch it, and it broke my gaming rig where it tried to draw windows over the screen and wouldn't accept cursor clicks in the game, but instead on my other windows. Thinking I hit a bug, I tried again in Windowed Mode. BIG MISTAKE. I tried this 3 times, as the cursor wouldn't sync, but instead have 1 cursor outside of the window, which sat upon the top left of my screen with no border to move it, and another cursor in game that was flying around like it was on a ton of sugar. I finally got full screen mode to work after numerus tries, and the cursor flew like I have never seen before. It was extreamly hard to get the the mouse sensitivity page like this, and when I finally did and set it lower, the cursor would lock in place constantly, only going on 1 axis (Mostly the x-axis). By this point I had reached my limit trying to play this crap. This isn't something that should be paid for, or even free. Honestly, I am disappointed that something like this would come out of a company such as this one. For anyone wondering, here are my specs just to be clear that it was not me:OS (Operating System): Windows 7 Ultimate EditionRAM (Random Access Memory): 6 GigabytesProcessor: Intel i7Mouse: Razor NagaKeyboard: Logitech EliteIn summery, I would not reccomend this game for anyone, and I think it would be better if it where completely removed from Steam altogether, as it's more trouble then it's worth. 1/10			"

												To put it frankly, this game is far too old and atiquated to enjoy. Being a 2001 game, you'd be surprised by how advanced this game makes Halo: CE seem and feel. As someone who is so used to playing games made within this decade, ARMA: Cold War Assault is a game that's graphics, mechanics, concept, and overall feel do nothing for me. I'm glad I got this game for free, because I would have absolutely regretted paying any amount of money for it. Perhaps if I played this game 13 years ago I could have enjoyed it, but with no sentimental value placed on this title, there is no reason for a gamer like me to play this game.			"

This game is unfair and unbalanced bullspit. I died ingame after getting shot only once, in real life if you get shot in the head 5 times you still live. The only good thing about this game is that you can kill your own teammates. I give this absolute sh*t game a sickening 1/10.			"

												I happened to get this for free during Bohemia Interactive's anniversary so I got a little curious to try it out. Basically what I'm going to say is that this will be based on my first impressions on this title and to me being exposed to the ARMA franchise in general. After playing the campaign mode for a few hours, I got bored and had more fun team killing my own AI squad members than actually playing the game simply because of how restrictive I felt performing these missions and add the fact that I was walking around 90% of the time with nothing to shoot at. I'm pretty sure you can run off from your squad and do something else, but even if that was possible, the level still feels barren with very little encounters. Of course, what else am I expecting off of this, it's a modern military shooter so of course the entire point of the game is to do objectives while trying to avoid firefights as much as possible. Story-wise, it's not very interesting with the game being set in during the Cold War with the main objective is, you guessed it, kill the Russians, simple as that. The controls at first feels very awkward, but that can always be fixed by rebinding your keys to something you would feel comfortable playing with. Personally the other modes like multiplayer and custom missions are more fun to play because you obviously have more freedom for you to play around. If I were to come back to this, I would just play around with the custom missions, but thats about it. I simply cannot recommend this game just for my own disliking of modern military shooters, but if you are a hardcore ARMA fan, then go right ahead and buy this. It has everything you would expect from an ARMA game.			"

												I bought this game because i'm a 48 year old unemployed war simulation veteran and to be frank this game is far from what I define ""Realistic"" for starters there is no bullet drop and precipitation, the models are very low quality so I cant even mod in my online avatar that I call ""John ""Cannonball"" Billy"" a 23 year old strapping lad who had recently joined the army and then he got shot in the eye with a big gun that goes pow pow.Me and my pals in our leisure time like to go to the local park and reenact some old war scenes like the DDAY landings but in this case we use the swingsets as machine gun nests and when you are hit with the nerf dart you have to act like you're dead otherwise you would be instantly expelled from the war roleplay/larping club.Arma ruins my war immersion as soon as I launch the game, MAIN MENUS IN REAL LIFE?

												This game is a great example of how the future versions of Arma are so successful. By taking the flaws from Arma: Cold War Assault, future games like Arma 2 and Arma 3 improve upon its past mistakes and push out a product that is enjoyable to the players. Would I recommend this? No, but Bohemia Interactive has expanded and provided massive improvements in its other games. For an enjoyable and modern experience, I suggest looking at Arma 2 and Arma 3.Rating: 0.2/10 (2%)No Achievements.Game Done. "

So I,  President Barack Hussain Obama/OpticObAmA will give this game a 2/10 because it simply lacks the most essential part that I need: MY ♥♥♥♥ING DRONE STRIKE BUTTON!!!			"

												I got it for free and I would rather have it removed from my library because I didn't even ask for it, it just appeared in my library . Dated in just about every aspect including realism and mostly due to its outdated controls (MoD:Allied Assault came out months after this game and featured controls that made sense, like selecting different weapons, and not picking up items like a sloth and is a game which I'd recommend over this game as the ideal early 2000's shooter) and boring this game should not have been given out for free. I'm only giving it a negitive because I got it for free, its nothing special other than an old FPS, controls not even good by early 2000's standards and can't remove it from my library also its super niche. ARMA is part of ther bygone era of war shooters and the series died for a reason.If you got this game for free, don't play it.			"

												I'm sure the game was fine in 2000, but now, this game is seriously outdated with just a huge lack of features, detail, and a realistic simulation of combat that just makes it feel like other 2000's fps. The best thing about this game was the plot and story, as it's really well done compared to Arma 2, but that can't be made up for flat-out dated gameplay. Don't get, and don't play, unless you're like me who got it on the day it was free.			"

												This game is clearly not meant for everyone. I would only recommend it if you enjoy shooters that try so hard to be realistic that they stop being fun. I prefer classic Ghost Recon over this, that game had a lot of realism but it was still enjoyable as it had a very forgiving save system. As far as I can tell this game allows one save per mission and getting shot at once means death, or maybe not as I couldn't really figure out what was going on.			"

												ARMA: Cold War Assult is a game that at one time was pretty cool. But because of it's lack of multiplayer servers and outdated graphics, it seems impractical to purchase this specific game. I recomend you try the original ARMA or ARMA II. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad game. But it just doesn't bring anything new or worthwhile to the table except for the Cold War theme. If you're in to pre-made scenarios and mediocre single player military simulations, go for it. But like I said, I would go for one of the newer games, or at least one that is multiplayer.			"

												The game doesnt even work propperly, i am unable to set terrain to very high as it crashes the game yet my pc can clearly handle it. The mouse is subject to alot of acceleration and locks to the vertical and horizontal axis. I am also unable to launch the advanced options and must manualy go into the game directory and launch the .exe to do so.annother issue is that many menu options actually lag and put strain on the performance as they are changed (of corse the high they are set the more lag so you have to do so gradually). In game the assets are slow to load and unload when the player has their back turned to them, this causes your performance to drop when turning around as it needs to reload every last asset and unload what was previously infront. This game also lacks any sort of tutorial which normally, would not be a problem is the mouse intergation on the menus wasn't so bad.I stongly suggest never touching this even though at the current moment of writing this it is free, it would be a massive waste of data.

												Call of Duty is a 2003 first-person shooter video game developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision. It is the first of many installments in the Call of Duty franchise. The game simulates infantry and combined arms warfare of World War II using a modified version of the id Tech 3 engine built for Quake III: Team Arena. Much of its theme and gameplay is similar to the Medal of Honor series; however, Call of Duty showcases multiple viewpoints staged in the British, American, and Soviet theaters of World War II.The game introduced a new take on AI-controlled allies who support the player during missions and react to situational changes during gameplay. This led to a greater emphasis on squad-based play as opposed to the ""lone wolf"" approach often portrayed in earlier first-person shooter games. Much of Infinity Ward's development team consisted of members who helped develop Medal of Honor: Allied Assault.In September 2004, an expansion pack called Call of Duty: United Offensive, which was produced by Activision and developed by Gray Matter Interactive and Pi Studios, was released. On November 10, 2009, the ""Hardened"" and ""Prestige"" editions of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 debuted, including redemption codes for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions under the title, Call of Duty Classic.

												Pure crap.  The 1980s called and want their graphics back.  I'm running a 4.0 ghz processor with a Nvidia 745 GeForce card, and Arma3 and DayZ SA look awesome...this POS made PacMan look good.  I won't even mention how oversensitive the mouse settings are -- even turned all the way down, aiming was next-to-impossible.  Add to the the fact that it couldn't detect my ACTUAL monitor settings, and screwed up the resolution so that I had to re-install the damn monitor, and even at the price I paid (free) it was WAY too much -- they shoulda paid me for my time.  I uninstalled that crap and am not gonna look back...only question I have is, why the hell would Bohemia put the ""Arma"" name on it?  It just makes that brand look bad...			"

												My first venture into the ""Arma"" series and not looking good unfortunately, I applaud the game for being so vast for it's publish date but it seems as if they tried to do WAY too much with it for technical limitations. We all love intricate games that let you control various things, but it is more time spent looking for the right button and trying to figure out how to perform the simplest of tasks that are compounded by going through 4 different mini-menus on the screen.  I really don't care about graphics, but the game plays smooth, I will give it that.As for the single player, I'm stuck following a yellow square for the objective, but it feels as if the game drags me around on a leash instead of the clear plan they present at the beginning of the mission. For one that is go south, then go north-west... it turns into go south, then make 50 course-corrections only to be told to turn around and follow the leader and wherever he decides to turn while still fumbling at controls to tell each person what direction to properly stand it seems.I really was hoping for a great experience as I hear so much hype about Arma, but this just seems like a game where they tried to cram too many interaction controls into too many menus, for concept I give it an 8/10.... but overall layout and execution sorry but it's dropped way down to a 2/10.

												Should have posted after I finished the game. Instead of doing a review in progress.Early stage of the game, lots of pointless moving from point A to B. Can't tell friend from foe and can't see where the enemy is, especially near night time, but somehow your AI can tell where they are and their AI can tell where you are. Daytime, I actually seeing and killing the enemy, but my squad is still able to kill them before I see them or they get themselves wipeout and I just run to an objective point. To elaborate why I consider how the missions are setup to be a waste of time. One mission defend installation. Could be a glitch but only one enemy showed up. Waste of time. Some mission in one form or another. Go from point A to point B. Die at point B. Waste time moving to point B again. Die. Repeat a few times before decide to use up my only save slightly before point B. Skirmish from point B to C. Waste time moving to point D. Seems like people equate repeating the same tedious moventment as the price of failure somehow makes this a good game. Half way through the campaign you get to choose your gear and control your squad. If I had the sniper rifle at the beginning of the game, i'm pretty sure i could of Ramboed my way across the map. Really the AI isn't that good, the only thing is you have to kill them before they notice your presence since they are very accurate once they know you're there. Otherwise they are very clueless. Either I could be prone in plain sight about 50m away and they don't react or I kill a bunch of their comrades but they don't seem to notice. Really only 2 or 3 missions were hard fun. A good chunk were just tedious. Since some of the positive reviews haven't put much game time in recently, I'm thinking nostalgia is factoring into their opinion, though I can see why it was GOTY in 2001. Of course, the graphics sucks but it's a 2001 game not a 2011 game. Wish steam would put when the game was originally released not digitally released. Playing on a xp computer game works fine.			"

												Got this game for free, still disappointed even though I certainly do like old classic games.I like tactical shooters, but ARMA: CWA has bad performance on my modern PC - it lags. Plus it looks bad and it feels bad.Developers tried to make ""cool"" cut scenes on the game engine that can't handle such stuff (it's good for open areas, but not for cut scenes).Weapon animations... do they even exist? Weapons look worse than in Half-Life or Battlefield 1942.All the animations in the game are too bad for beginning of 2000th.There are some cool elements in the game though, but you better skip this game and get ArmA 2 or 3 which do have all of the neat stuff.

												Operation Flashpoint (I'm not calling it ArmA, it's Operation Flashpoint) is one of the best military games ever and this one, the very first one, is my personal favorite because it has the best campaign and atmosphere (nothing can beat the Cold War)However, all of that excitement and excellent gameplay goes out the window the minute you start the missions, because 80% of the time the scripts controlling the missions DO NOT WORK CORRECTLYExample: I failed the tutorial just because I completed it too fast2nd example: I spent at least 1 hour on a Rescue mission that takes 5 minutes tops, because the Friendly AI would not move faster even though I clearly secured the village, and they would NOT ♥♥♥♥ING DRIVE THE TRUCK BECAUSE THE COMMANDER KEPT TELLING TWO SOLDIERS TO DISEMBARK EVEN THOUGH THEY SHOULD BE IN THE VEHICLE AND BY THE TIME THEY DID GET OUT AND GOT BACK IN, A ♥♥♥♥ING TANK COMES IN AND KILLS US ALLI'm sorry, this franchise is fun and I love it but I can never enjoy it most of the time due to the broken mission scripts that plague every single game (OFP, ArmA: Armed Assault, ArmA2 + OA) and if ArmA3 continues this game breaking issue, it will be a huge disappointment			"

												Arma: Cold War Assault was probably a great game for its time. That being said, it completely sucks now. It has way too many commands that are never clearly explained. It is brutally difficult. It is slow paced and anticlimactic. Worst of all, you have to wait like 25 minutes just to join a multiplayer game. I highly recommend that you don't waste your time on this disappointing, slow paced wreck with clunky gameplay.			"

												Graphics for Arma: Cold War Assault are either just plain bad or really dated.Movement controls are OK (WASD), but the mouse pointer for aiming is twitchy and not smooth.This game is total rubbish and a waste of time.Delta Force and Delta Force 2 had way better controls and responsiveness and are infinately more playable (and fun) than this amateurish piece of rubbish.The Tom Clancy games also have better graphics and controls and are way more polished.

												If there was a Dark Souls for military shooter sims, you're looking at the comment review section for it. Her unforgivable shooting mechanics, brutally low player hp and sneaky AI makes for a frustrating playthrough. It's just that with the low price of Arma 2, and the success of Arma 3 you'll realize that the game is not in its best form here. Multiplayer is non-existent, graphics are putrid, and the weapon diversity or action options can get pretty stale. If you're desperately looking for a free game title, this might be worth the pain and agony. Do not pay for this. Battlefield 2 would be a better cure for your old school FPS nostalgia.			"

												This is Operation Flashpoint. Great game but it runs poorly on todays hardware. Maybe it has been fixed by now but when I bought this hoping for som nostalgic military sim action I found the game to be broken and unplayable. Mouse controll felt especially bad. Otherwhise this was a great game, much more fun than later games including Arma series if you ask me. it even has a good single player story.			"

												This game is like if Minecraft met Joseph Stalin, this game is like if Fried Chicken met Big Smoke, like if Adolf Hitler met the Holocaust. Following the story of a disgruntled US Marine called Tim Davies. As he goes on a spiritual journey throughout the beautiful rice fields of China.

												ArmA Cold War Assault is the rerelease of the original Operation Flashpoint Cold War Crisis. As such, it's not going to have the amazing graphics of ArmA 2, and the interface isn't as complex, but that doesn't necessarily mean you shouldn't buy it. With this game, you get a great campaign, and the editor is just as fun as ever, this time featuring a lot more land areas than ArmA 2. I always reccomend this game to people who want to get into ArmA, because it's cheap and it's pretty much the same type of experience. For this price, this game is more than worth picking up. Arma Cold War Assault is among my favorite milisims.			"

												Most games try to make you feel like a superman, with regenerating health and enough ammunition to subdue a third world dictatorship. This is not  one of those games. No, instead you're made to feel like a thick, slow, myopic sack of fragile meat and bone, where half a second's inattention can kill you dead, dead, dead.Murphy's First Law of Combat is this: YOU ARE NOT A SUPERMAN.Remember this, and it's difficult to find a more immersive or rewarding game.

												Got the game as a bonus content in ArmA III Deluxe Edition. This is the only military simulator where I could spawn a few thousand units (armor and infantry) on a massive battlefield without getting any graphical hiccups and lags. Apart from that, I find this game a ""mess of graphics"", simply because the game itself is too old and the gameplay is kinda bad, compared to modern titles (obviously). As I said, I you want to have massive battles without breaking a sweat on your hardware, this game is the top choice to go for.			"

												Although I didn't play this game much, I think it's a great game for the ones who care about the game experiece and not the quality, the experience itself is good, aiming unlike other FPS games is that crosshair moves, which may sound abit annoying but its actually fun, tho on iron sight crosshair not moves (iunno), it got for 100% the bad voice quality from all of these communication devices xD, overall, nice game, but i would recommend to buy it only on 25%-50% discount since the quality may REALLY kill it, even the first Half-Life, which came out in 1998 got better quality  :/			"

												This game still is a bit fun , though it has a bit of rust on it. But its has a more better story than COD:Ghosts and Arma 2. I would play this game for single player, but for multiplayer it take a YEAR to find a ♥♥♥♥ING LOBBY. So it gets a rating of 7/10.			"

												i remember playng this when i was 7 - i was addicted to it. this game was literally my childhood. every day id hope my dad came home from his IT college course with some form of addon, as he did occassionally. this game has plenty of mods for you to choose from, ranging from full conversion mods to small little addons such as just a simple vehicle or gun. the singleplayer campaign is great because of how diverse it is. the game is truely open world, you can go where ever you want in what ever mission. the mission editor is your chance to create your own mission to share with the world, or just to have a bit of fun. this is the mode i played the most, and you can do everything in it. the multiplayer in the game works the same as the multiplayer in arma 2.all in all, this game is a must and im so glad that it is free now, because the original discs i have are.. ""aged""this also includes the ""gold upgrade"" pack, and the ""resistance"" expansion, filefront is also a very good site for getting mods and addons for this game			"

												This game is one of my favorite games of all time.  Alot of people may hate on this game saying ""These graphics are ♥♥♥♥"" or ""It's too hard"" and such, but the graphics don't matter at all, I mean for Christ sake, it was made in 2001!  I still play alot of older games especially PS2 games, which had some really good games, but compared to now the graphics are ♥♥♥♥; WHO THE ♥♥♥♥ CARES?!?!?!  Arma Cold War Assault is a realistic war simulator.  You are put into a scenario, in which you choose how you are to finish.  You can go stealthily through on some levels, or come in guns a blazin'.  While the aim may be a bit weird at first, you'll get used to it and see that if that it's actually in some cases better than just a crossheir stuck in the middle of the screen.  This game also happens to be as hard as my ♥♥♥♥, and can get frustrating at times, but the challenge is fun (At least in my opinion).  Side note: I am not a hardcore Arma fan or anything, I just got into the Arma series like 6 months ago, and saw this one over the weekend was free, so I downloaded it.  Even though this is the oldest of the Armas, this one is probably my favorite.  As long as you can get past the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ N64 like graphics, DEFINETLY download this.			"

Espetialy the radio chatter of your fellow soliders :D-Awsome cutscenes and soundtrackCons:-The graphics are extremely dated (I'm not quite sure If there are any graphical enhacment mods because I haven't looked for them)-Wery awkward aiming-Animations			"

												I could not recommend this game to yonger players as they wont be able to get pass the graphics.  Game was Gold back when it came out and while not the first game to offer aiming down the sights, it was one of the first well known games to have such.  When i first played the demo back in the early 2000 time frame, concluding a mission with a Blackhawk that flew to you and landed in real time, climbing on board and watching the landscape slip away below you = Mind Blown!   The only game that could touch it was the original Ghost Recon which i also loved very much, but OFP had no invisible walls and drivable vehicles that allowed for freedom of movement that had'nt really been done before in a FPS.  Games such as Far Cry, Crysis, Call of Duty, Halo, and many more owe this game homage in some aspect.  Its too bad Ghost Recon went in the reverse direction and became more linear.With so many Addons and missions it was easy to waste away weeks worth of hours away.			"

												This game is old. Super old. Don't expect its graphics to make and impression or its gameplay to wow. But for a classic, hands down it was my favorite game and still is easily in my top 20 of all time. This was the beginning of the Operation Flashpoint / Arma franchise and is well worth a fire-up as the game still retains its rustic charm. Plus you can still do CRAZY stuff with the editor.			"

												I would have enjoyed this game as a kid. It’s got decent cinematics for its time, but the voice-acting is abysmal. The game is also really hard. The pace and difficulty remind me of the original Rainbow Six: you can’t just run-and-gun. You’ll get killed like that.			"

												Something is wrong with the mouse sensitivity settings which makes it almost impossible to navigate the options screen. It appears to be hyper sensitive even when set to the lowest sensitivity iin the options. However, when in game the mouse acts almost normally (there is some unwanted acceleration).What little of the game play I could manage was quite interesting, which makes this more frustrating.I will retry after a full reinstall of Arma. Other steam games (Starbound, Deus Ex) as well as other non-Steam games work with normal mouse control behaviour on my laptop, except Alpha Protocol which also has excessive and unchangeable mouse sensitivity.Tested on an Acer Aspire V3-571G laptop on its own display with no external monitor attached. No difference seen when 1680x 1050 external monitor attached.Windows 8 OEMIntel i7nVidia 710M "

												It's an old game, so it isn't fair to compare it to anything new really... But its actually really fun. Store says singleplayer but there is actually a ton of co-op if you use tunngle. Realistic bullet damage means you don't empty an entire mag into someone to kill them. However, you die just as easily. A lot of tactical potential. Seems to discourage the ""run-and-gun"" of most modern FPS games. One complaint I had was the controls. Once you rebind them, they're great, but they start off terrible. Overall I recommend it. (Current price should also be taken into account. Worth no more than $10.)			"

												Sure, Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis (changed to ArmA: Cold War Assault due to problems between developers and publishers) has aged,it's obvious in the gameplay,but it's still pretty similar to most of the other Armed Assault's that you're used too. If you're familiar with the other Armed A's, then this shouldn't be too hard for you.(Yes,it's VERY unforgiving,if you get shot or surrounded by zombies,of course)For those that don't understand what I said there-Operation Flashpoint was renamed ArmA: Cold War Crisis because of a argument. It's very old but is like ArmA 2 and ArmA 3. If you get shot too many times,you will die. All you need to do is hide behind something and shoot the bad bad man. THE END!			"

Not really appealing to play on my desktop but when I can only use my sister's laptop its great.Has sandbox mode, for example, spawning 20 vs 20 tanks from either russia, NATO, or resistance. Tank gameplay is great, individual parts can be damaged such as barrel, turret and hull. Crew members can be also killed, leaving your tank immobilized or defenseless. I give 7 waterbottles out of 3 coconuts for this game. "

												The thing that really blew me away about Operation Flashpoint was the deadly realism. The game came out when Quake was popular and other makers of shooters tried to copy its manic play style. But, Operation Flashpoint was different. If you run down the main road of a town, you will get shot and you will die. I swear, I spent half the game crawling on my belly, since I knew peeking my head up over the grass could mean instant death. Playing the game again, I was impressed by how it was still fun the play. Sure, the graphics are dated, but it didn't matter after a while. Modern Warfare immerses you in the setting with beautiful graphics, but breaks the illusion with magical ""healing behind cover"". Cold War Assault doesn't catch you at first, but the stunning realism makes you feel more like you're actually there than pretty graphics. Modern Warfare fans will have to adjust to a more realistic way of playing...and I think you'll like it.			"
