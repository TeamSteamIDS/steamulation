												As someone who has done a lot of mechanical work on their cars over the years, I am happy to say that Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is accurate in many ways.  However, it does lack a number of key components of any wrenching session, such as...-The ""This Bolt is so Badly Rusted and Seized That No Amount of Breaker Bars, Impact Wrenches or Penetrating Oil Can Help You Now"" puzzle;-The ""DO YOU FEEL LUCKY, PUNK?!"" EZ-Out Bolt Extractor Mini-Game;-The ""Dropped a Nut in the Engine Bay and it Didn't Hit the Floor"" experience;-The ""Broke a Thousand-Dollar Part While Attempting to Fix a Ten-Dollar Part and Now I'm Inventing New Swear Words"" vocabulary game and its companion, ""Throw the Wrench Across the Garage in a Fit of Rage""; and-The ""Desperate Run to the Parts Store Five Minutes Before Close"" racing game.Oh, I almost forgot about the ever-popular ""Roll to Hit Your Head on Everything Between the Floor and Ceiling"" skill check.  Come to think of it, that's exactly why this game is pretty enjoyable - all of the wrenching without any of the frustrations that come along with it.  In all seriousness, it could use a couple things (for example, removing an engine whole instead of piece-by-piece, then tearing down the engine on a stand outside the car), a bit of polish here and there and, of course, more cars and more customisation (performance parts, tuning and engine swaps would be great!), but overall, CMS 2015 stands well on its own as it is.

												I come from Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 and found that it (CM Sim 2014) was enjoyable but once I beat the game for the first time and played some of the DLC I felt like I didn't have a reason to pick the game up. When I heard about Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 being in crowdfund mode I was hesitant to put more money down as I felt like it'd be the same thing. A decent time waster until you beat the game. After looking at what they had so far I started to get excited for the title and immediately pledged enough to get the game when it was released. I received my code earlier today and began playing it. The menu is completely different and I found it to be fluid and well designed. It immediately gave me a good vibe. I quickly and eagerly created a profile and began playing. As soon as I started working on the car I automatically fell in love with how it felt. In the previous title it felt like the menus were slow and sluggish. It felt like a burden just to check my inventory. In CMS 2015, that's not the case. The keys are simple and understandable yet pay homage to the original title. Taking off and putting parts on was a breeze. I found myself immerse and even at times swearing like I was working on a real car. Not even kidding. At one point when it told me I had to replace a Piston I was like ""Man forget this game!"" yet I quickly dove into the top end and just started taring down and enjoying it. It's immersive and easy at the same time. I played for 4 hours before I could even test drive a car, but it was worth the wait. I've messed around with the Auction house and that's a great perk. I gave myself a budget and immediately surpassed it because, well 'because I can'. This game feels endless and fun. Fluid, good looking and immersive.I was how ever, disappointed in the fact that when you purchase a car on the auction house, you're required to put back what was on it. For example, I couldn't put a dual carb intake when I took off a single carb intake. It was disappointing as I am a big mechanic head, I love to be able to upgrade rather than replace. I was equally disappointed at the lack of aftermarket body parts. I was hoping for a hood scoop or two, but unfortunately nothing. These aren't game breakers though. I will still enjoy this game daily. Hopefully, they will update the game with either a DLC or a base patch that will allow you to do a motor swap in the auction cars. TL:DR version: Game is fun, fluid and immersive. Way better than 2014 and in my opinion, should be in any gear heads library, or just anyone who wants to play a good car game. Looks great as well!If you enjoyed this review please consider going to www.frostythegamer.com and following the website. We're still setting it up but I'll be posting new reviews soon!			"

												I almost gave thumbs down... but the game is well-made and it's very relaxing to play it.I learned a bit about car parts, but this game could have more information about parts:-what they are for-if they break what are the consequence and symptoms-how can we damage those parts (so we don't do it IRL)The game is nice, but If we learn more about mechanic this game it would be much cooler.

												This is among the few simulator games such as Euro Truck Simulator and farming simulator that actually does a good job. Game runs smoothly, has minimal bugs, well designed and is fun.Pros:+Manage your own car garage+Nice textures and models+Test driving+Garage customization+Minimal bugs and glitches+Runs at 60 fps+Developers are actively working on improving and adding features to gameNeutral:~Needs more cars (coming soon in dlc)~Would like to see more cables and parts under engine hood (bit empty atm)~Different engine types would be interesting (diesel, hybrid, older style engines, vans)Cons:(Remember the developers are actively working on this game)-Career mode could use a few more features (ranking, economy, business decisions)-Some UI improvements can be made (selling and buying multiple parts in tedious)-Main car parts are in cars however fuel lines, brake lines, radiator pipes, electrical cables etc are absent			"

												I own an American muscle car custom garage... so the content in this game is something I'm familiar with.  I'll say that, yes this is a game... and a good one.  But, it is a casual sim and not so much like a Falcon flightsim.  For example, changing the brakes on a car is one thing, but in this game you don't have to spend time bleeding brake lines or... running brake lines or electrical lines.  In real life, gremlins in the electrical systems (wiring harness, fuses, etc) are what takes up so much of my time.  In this game... they're not even there... really (unless you count ignition wiring).  That could be a blessing or a curse because I hate testing 2 miles of insulated copper wire with a multimeter just to figure out why a car has a mysterious parasitic power drain.  In this game... you're either blessed to not have that tedium or let down without having that real sim experience.Overall, it is a fun GAME.  Little to no bugs.  I only wish the market allowed me to reference my parts list from the build order so I didn't have to go run under the car every time I forgot what suspension part I needed.Overall, I rate it an 8/10			"

												I would really recommend Car Mechanic Simulator for everyone who is interested in cars and how they work. If you have the previous version of this game (Car Mechanic Simulator 2014) and you like it, I still recommend buying the new version since there is a significant update over last version: cars now have much more parts, engines and car bodies can be disassembled and repaired. Now in later stages of game you can buy cars, repair them and sell for profit. The game today also got a FREE content update in form of a new car to repair, the developers said there will be more free content updates. I as a car fan find this game really enjoyable and recommend this to everyone who is interested in cars.			"

												A view from one who both enjoys driving and also swings spanners for a living.TLDR version - A very basic introduction into light vehicle components that feels like it needed another 3 months before release. CMS 2014 is more realistic in many ways - sideways evolution not revolution.Graphics are decent, sounds are reasonably realistic if simple. Music is passable for the first half hour, then gets turned off. An ingame jukebox with your own mp3 folder linked would be great.Into the reason why we play games - gameplay. The main suspension types (live axle and independant) are well represented along with engine choices. What is lacking is any customisation. Once you've put together 20 or so cars the excitement fails and you feel like you're grinding toward a goal you can't see. You cannot change parts from one car to another to improve horsepower or weight like Redline Racer 2 or similar (incidently a very good car modification game but very buggy).In my case, I was grinding for 9k experience, the point in which you can buy parling spaces to get cars from the auctions.I hit 9k, spent my 50g then went shopping at the auctions. Bought an absolute beater for far more then it was worth and took it home. Stripped, rebuilt every component I could, replaced everything else and then looked for a place to market my rebuilt ride.That's strange, I have no auction option...that's right. You can only sell the cars you buy for a set sum dependant on condition and model, not feed it back to the auction where you bought it. You get paid a minor 'restoration bonus' and actually end up almost even steven from where you started, which considering you've just spent the better part of 30-45mins rebuilding this thing is.....disappointing to say the least.This seems to underutilise the potentially exciting platform of the auction. Why couldn't we walk the lot before the auction, checking out the cars beforehand or even meet other bidders?Also on bidding, it seems a very simple but random process - you're not sure why one model car sells for more then the same model in similar condition because you're literally given no information on each unit. Zero. Can't even pan around to see how many panels are missing.Another lost oppurtunity is the test track - this could have been much larger and give the player a challenge or at least a reason not to on-sell a car but alas no. Mods are enabled so the community will probably come to the rescue but they shouldn't have to. The pan speed is excellent however not being able to do anything while draining oil or lowering/raising a car on the hoist is immensely frustrating, can't even check the job sheet.This game is worth money. How much though? To someone like me who already has a sound knowledge base on car mechanics, maybe $5-10. The content there is well done with no bugs I can see which is a pat on the back. I understand it uses DLC and I've bought a couple already, but misses clear oppurtunities to shine using platforms already existing in the game and offers little direction or encouragement to continue either doing customer jobs or rebuilding auction cars. You will get bored at less then 20 hours.If you want a better understanding of cars, this is a good start at least in names of components and different types of suspension. Some little AVIs on how the different suspensions compare to one another in practise would be great to better educate those who wish to play this game as a learning tool.A good crack at a title, but over far too quickly with little replay value.EDIT   -    After playing the 2014 complete version I must say there appears to be more tangible goals at least on the Tuning and 4WD addons, in addition to 2014 having more realistic graphics and engine components (actually has intake from filter housings to throttle bodies unlike 2015). Unfortunately 2014 has slow component removal speed and slow mouse speed and still has limited content..  The best CMS would be an amalgam of the best attributes of both with casual/hardcore mods with more complex components and tuning/mix match options			"

tl;dr pros & cons list:I recommend you buy this game if you love cars, or want to learn more about cars!Pros:Awesome leap in graphics, game function, and quality from its sequelEasy learning curve, it guides you through what to doA good educational game for learning car partsIt's a learning experience for newbies to cars in general, like myselfA fantastic developer that keeps up with its communityNew content and updates are still coming out since it's a relatively new gameThere's a large variety of vehicles with several different engines and/or arrangements, but variety isn't introduced much until you get more XP which makes senseI'm going to list a lot of cons to balance with the pros, but don't misinterpret it, it's a fantastic game.Cons:Dubstep music on the radio, can easily be turned off howeverThe game holds your hand almost too much once you become proficient and want a challenge, since it doesn't let you mess up assembling the vehicleThere's no tutorial about how to play the game really, but it always shows you the controls and is really easy to figure out for the most partIt isn't a challenge if you're a mechanic, surprise surpriseIt doesn't show you how the parts actually work in the vehicle, if you're looking to learn about thatNow for the non-tl;dr review:It's an incredible leap in quality from Car Mechanic Simulator 2014, and I'm pleased to say it's a full fledged sequel! Everything is vastly improved, especially the graphics and game mechanics (pun intended). They've also added the ability to buy auctioned vehicles, allowing you to fix them and sell them for profit, among some other big new things. The developers are actively updating the game and listen to the requests of its fanbase which is always a great thing to see. I love a dedicated developer that keeps up to speed with its community. Also, there's a growing multitude of cars available to work on, engines have variation most of the time, and while the game has no tutorial, the learning curve is easy to get over once you figure the parts of a car out. It gives you a very easy start, then slowly gets more and more intricate as you become more proficient in your tasks. It actually gets pretty challenging sometimes.A lot of people wonder about how realistic it is, so I will go over that in the next paragraph:I'm no mechanic, so I have no real-life depiction of how realistic the game actually is, but I got an opinion from a friend of mine who really is a mechanic.The original Car Mechanic Simulator is what initially sparked my interest in how cars work, and now this sequel helps me expand on that. Hell, it got me so intrigued I went out to my car to see if I could take the air filter out! I even watched some YouTube videos on mechanics principles. I really didn't care for cars prior. In fact I knew nothing of cars. Thank this game for inspiring my love in vehicles! After talking to a mechanic friend, he does say the game lacks realistic difficulty because in reality, knowing which tools to use and finding out what is broken is only half the battle, and it holds your hand through putting things back together, as well as taking things apart in the right order. In real life, it's far more possible to forget to put something in the car, or to lose a bolt inside the engine which apparently sounds painful to a mechanic. He said you can't simply pull out some parts like the game does, too, such as a gearbox. Also, the engines it has you work on aren't as wildly varying as real life cars. My car engine has many of the parts the game has, and thanks to the game I could identify a few of the things which felt very satisfying since I had literally no knowledge of it prior. Everything was arranged differently than in the game, though. It's possibly true that the game isn't quite spot-on realistic, however there's nothing I know of that's better at teaching you the parts of a car and how cars work. With the incredible leap in game quality in just one year, I wouldn't be surprised if it'll be marginally closer to real life in the next sequel. I'm not IGN and I give this a 10/10, so that should say something! It was well worth the 16 dollars I spent, as you can't put a price on education and inspiration. "

												I played this game for a night, a while ago. As a mechanic in real life, I enjoyed the game and figured I'd check back in on it eventualy. Such a great base for a game but a couple small things would really bring it forward and keep the game play fresh. I guess I need more on the management side of it.Fun way to learn some things about cars, although perhaps the game would be harder for people who don't already understand vehicles.I'd change my vote if they had addressed some of the player's complaints to simplify and complicate various parts of the game.As you level up, it would be nice if you have someone who brought the car to a lift and took the wheels off. Or you could provide orders to someone to keep a job moving or put a job back together after you finished the difficult part of it. Or have a rookie who can do the oil change for you. An experience mechanic RARELY finds himself performing basic services.Parts ordering: 2 years and not a single improvement has been made. With experience, I should be able to get parts on the way or make a check list as to what I need and then go to the computer to have it ordered. I thought the tablet would do this and it doesn't.Typically a mechanic has a list he hands off to someone, and they get the stuff on the way. Would love to see this.I'd also enjoy the challenges of delayed payments, as in the vehicle does just magically fly off the lift and cash goes into the account. You could have your assistant call to inform the customer the car is done, bring it to the parking lot and let you know your ETA on their pick up.Perhaps I just want a little bit more logistics challenge and less repetitive motions on♥♥♥♥♥♥like wheel removal and waiting on long vehicle load times every time I take a customer. Again the game is an awesome concept but could be tweeked for slightly less pointless repetition.			"

												So I loved 2014 - Thought it was great but a bit limited.2015 brings a lot more to the game and it's great!... However...The Title credits say its from Poland - I've never been there but working on cars for 30+ years, rebuilding, repairing and modifying, this game is a first for me - I've never had to remove the ENTIRE SUPSENSION to change a block. If that's the way a mechanic in Poland has to do it, they'd never make a profitable business down under. Just saying.Other than that I love it. Well.. The music is a bit not my scene - Radio needs a Metal station.			"

												The whole process of repairing a car consists of apparently flying around a transparent car, clicking on rusty parts to make them disappear, and then clicking on their location again to make the shiny replacements appear. After reading its many positive reviews, I expected so much more from this game, especially in terms of realism and educational value.I expected part descriptions, detailing what they do and how they work, not just what they're called.Maybe it's my own fault for once again letting ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" convince me to buy a game I had some interest in, without researching the game's contents more thoroughly before placing my order, but here's what I imagined (apart from what was already mentioned): - Seeing the required tools in action, and maybe being able to upgrade those tools.- Part damage models. Apparently, rust is the only danger to any part, even rubber ones.- A garage management aspect, complete with running costs and equipment purchase/maintenance.- Timers on accepting contracts.- (Generous) Timers on completing accepted contracts.- Cars actually moving and not teleporting between positions.- Fewer loading screens. Way fewer.- Customer satisfaction, raised by completing repairs on time and without performing and billing unnecessary work, leading to repeat business and word of mouth advertising.- Some purpose to money (examples above)These are just off the top of my head. I was also disappointed by the poorly designed interface (e.g. not being able to close a menu with the same key that opens it) and overall extremely slow progression with no other goal than to click on the same parts on different cars and save more money, for... cars in the parking lot?I'm glad a lot of people enjoy this game, but it's not for me and probably not for people with similar preferences, which is why I wrote this review.

												If you like cars and working on them, this game is crazy addictive. Very well done. However, some quality of life improvements need implemented.-Load times are atrocious. On a modern machine, simply ridiculous in length. This needs adressed.-The newest DLC is excellent, however, the 1/4 mile needs an option to toggle between manual or automatic, or even a launch control(I realize the older cars don't have this). If you are simply keyboarding, launching a 600+HP vehicle is a terrible chore of finesse. 1/4 mile times will even drop(versus stock, slightly tuned, max tune) until you can find that sweet spot of gear manipulation just to end tire spin. Even then, times are foolishly off what they should be.-No option to toggle KPH to MPH. Small complaint, but important.-When tearing a car down, a lot of the screen is wasted space. They need to implement a menu of items and % you already have in your inventory for each part removed. Maybe something as simple as a top 3 % listing to cut down on menu swapping time. This would fit nicely into some of the empty voids on screen. Whether it shows on part removal or part replacement mode. It would improve gameplay ten folds...-Repairing items at a 90% cap is nice, but when an item is above a certain percentage, say 90-99%, breaking it shouldn't be so simple. Sometimes randomness can cause 100% of these items to break for a LONG stretch. Not a huge deal, but could be improved. Again not huge, but can be very annoying.-New DLC issue, Superchargers/intake can block distributor cap clip on the back side. Real pain even zoomed in to remove or replace.-Load times.-More variety would make it more consuming. Parking lot for customers cars waiting to be fixed(similar to a real shop). More bays. Perhaps even a staff at a certain XP level to allow more projects with less hands on; your staff does basic jobs for you(such as simple exhaust repairs/brakes/etc..) More money sinks. Custom build jobs(This may or may not be in newest DLC,if so disregard), not just repairs. Not everything needing worked on is broke. A lot of customers want a built/modified/improved car out of a perfect performing car.Overall this is an amazing game despite my minor annoyances. Amazingly fun if cars are your thing.  Would recommend to any wrench turner who plays games.			"

												Who doesn't like cars? From a beautiful Ford Mustang, to a luxury Bentley or even an eco-friendly model. Everyone likes cars, unless they don't. And being part of that gang, I thought it would be a good idea to try out this new game, and share my experience with the world.It's a never ending battle of making your cars better and also trying to be better yourself.Dale EarnhardtWithout any further delay, I present to you my review of Car Mechanic Simulator 2015.GameplayFirst of all, let me tell you something. This game will screw you with the amount of screws you'll have to unscrew and rescrew during your mechanic career.As a garage owner, your objective is, as in any other game, to make money, which will be used to upgrade that same garage, as well as to buy parts for other cars, and even to buy cars.After accepting the first job, there's a list that tells the player what's wrong with said car, and, obviously, it's up to the player to open up that car and find those parts, and replace or repair them. If you choose to replace, you can just order the piece you need online, however, if you choose to repair the piece, you'll save money, or you’ll end up breaking it.As the game goes on, and the player gains experience, which can be used to get some scanners and faster tools, those lists indicating the problem will cease to exist, and it will be up to the player to use everything available to find the problem and fix it. Plan B, which let me tell you, always works, is simply to dismantle the entire car and check every single piece, but that does take quite a while, as you can imagine.I didn't know the difference between a spark plug and a crankshaft, but now I do! So fear not if you don't know anything about the mechanical side of cars, or even anything related to cars, because you'll learn it all.Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 will bring out the mechanic in you that you never knew existed. Trust me, I'm (now) a mechanic.Pros Incredible details; Plenty of pieces, from rubber bushings to spark plugs, CMS2015 has it all; The difficulty ladder is really well designed, and the player won't feel a difference when the harder repairs come by, if anything, it will feel easier with all the practice; Some interesting tools available to help discover what needs to be fixed, from testing paths, to electronic meters, there's a nice variety to use and abuse; Intuitive job objectives that help the player to find out where the problem is, without having to dismantle the entire car (even though that's the fun part!); Nice variety of cars, with more being added in the future; No game has as many screws as CMS2015; The auction house allows the player to buy a (almost) ruined car and resell it, after it has been worked a bit, for profit.I wouldn't be surprised to see some of the ""Cons"" listed below improved in future patches/updates, but I do feel the need to point them out as they're somewhat disappointing.Cons Long loading screens, even if you're only going to visit the auction or the parking lot; The ""damaged"" details are feel very poor, since there's no broken or bent, just rust (the more rust, the more damaged the piece is!); The shadows are a bit off, especially around the lifter (I'd also like to point out the lifter doesn't appear to actually be holding the car, it's just sort of floating there).VerdictI'd give it a 8.5/10, which could easily be a 10 if the graphic quality and effects were a bit better. Nonetheless, it's a fantastic game and undoubtedly a must for any fan of the genre. Do note that the team is still active, and I'm sure the quality of the game will increase even further.Note: Despite looking quite similar to real cars, the vehicles available in game aren't actually the real ones, and it would be sweet to actually be able to work on a Ford Mustang and such, but I do understand it being extremely difficult to apply due to licensing issues.

												Decent for what it is, but marred by poor interface choices and odd limitations.  If you're a huge fan of this type of simulation, ignore everything after this and buy it anyway.  Interface awkwardness seems to be common in this sort of game.  I don't know if it's lack of playtesting or what.  ""I"" opens your inventory, but doesn't close it; that's the Escape key.  All the menus are like that.  After you buy cars at the auction, they are sent to your garage's parking lot.  Naturally, you can't go directly there from the auction.  You have to go to the main workshop (loading screen), then to the garage (loading screen), send the car to the workshop, then go back to the workshop (you guessed it! more loading screen).  I still can't think of a reason not to let me just summon the car to the lift like I'm a wizard since that's effectively what's happening anyway.  Even if it takes a single loading screen, one is better than three.The decision on what parts are seems pretty arbitrary.  Things that are just one part: Rear differential, starter motor, the entire transmission.  On the other hand the distributor cap has: ignition wires, clips to hold the cap on, the cap, the rotor, and the housing.  I'd love it if I could work on the bigger complicated parts at the workbench, or use an engine lift to pull the blessed thing out whole instead of raising and lowering the car over and over.I think the biggest disappointment for me is that it only feels like half a game.  You fix cars, but there really isn't any point to it.  Sure you get XP and money to fix *different* things on *different* cars.  It's all without any goal to it.  This game would be much improved if it were mated to a racing game.  Then I'm making money to fix up my car, buying auctioned cars for parts to my car, and using the garage to improve my car.  But nope. I'm just pulling bad parts off of a car, hitting them with a hammer until they are fixed or ruined, buying replacements for the ruined ones, and putting it all back together.

												First and foremost: I LOVE THIS GAME. I also loved Gearhead Garage back in the 90's, and I have a background in auto repair, so I maaaaay be biased.Having played Car Mechanic Simulator 2014, I realized that this team was putting together something very special - something that rekindled a love I haven't experienced since my Gearhead Garage CD stopped working. CMS2014 (last year's game) reminds me of the CD-level release of Gearhead Garage - no auctions, limited cars, and somewhat... unfinished, I suppose. CM2015 (this year's game) is the entry that I think the developers wanted to make. It feels alive, very much so, and it feels like it has this wealth of potential just waiting to be tapped. I am honestly excited for this game in a way I'm not often excited about games.The ProsDevs are highly active in the community. Seriously, check the Steam Forums for this game, and they're engaged with players. They are actually keeping a community-created list of wanted features (and are honest about what they can't/won't include, too). VERY cool to see this from a dev team!Gorgeous graphics. The details in the textures are really nice, and the individual parts shine here. It may not break any monitors or redefine any genres, but it definitely is something my graphics card makes veeeery pretty.Customizable ""home base"" (garage). Maybe it's just a ""me thing"", but I like making it my own place.VERY detailed (and, from a parts sales guy's perspective, accurate) parts - assembly and ""fit"".Smooth Gameplay. There's definitely a rhythm you can get into, and it makes this game easy to lose hours in.The ConsSoundtrack. While I do enjoy the genre, I turned the in-game music volume down to 20 (instead of 50). This made it much easier to bear, even enjoyable. Customizable music has been suggested to the devs, and is definitely something they should pick up.Learning curve. It's a bit steep to get into the game, though if you have some background in cars it's easier. A piece of advice? Switch between the view types, particularly View 3, which shows you the condition of parts. You can take a test drive to find the condition of suspension parts.Clarity of Gameplay Direction. It's honestly more exploratory than explained to you. Poke things. Explore your environment. Open doors, play with objects... Honestly, a lot of learning is done by experience here, which either lends to the idea of a garage mechanic or breaks the game for you entirely, depending on how you look at it (I don't mind it, but I have a background in this area, so...)Honestly, it's a standard initial release as of April 24 (2-3 days after release), so the content isn't massive. There's 17 cars now, one more definitely happening, and a menu entry for ""community content"" that isn't active just yet. If this opens itself to modding... this game could easily end up being 800+ hours on my account. I absolutely love it!			"

												This game has ruined simulator games for me, forever. Not in a bad way, mind you. This game is the absolute epitome of what a simulator game could be. It is dynamic, engaging, has a super-supportive dev community, and has a list of stuff they are patching in that lists nearly 100 user submitted ideas.  It's a puzzle game that is varied, and not super-difficult, yet it's not easy either. It's dead easy to get into, but engaging enough to let you spend hours and hours on. The DLC is more like nifty add-ons, and not core pieces of gameplay, and you could enjoy the whole game perfectly well, even if you didn't buy them. I really can't give this game anything else but a solid, and well-deserved, 10/10. As far as simulator games go, devs of other games better sit up straight, and start taking notes. This could potentially be the game that blows the whole market open, and bring in a new world of simulation sub-genres to whole new audiences. And on top of all this, it is hugely informative. I have learned the internal workings of a car, through component parts of small engines, from 4-cylinder junkers, all the way to supercharged V8 Overhead Valve muscle cars.Get this game. It's a steal, at $20. It's totally worth every single cent. This is the game, for which, I will forever compare other simulator games to. And yes, all of the others pale in comparison.			"

												I'm going to college to become a technician at a Subaru dealer in Colorado. I'm starting school with a very minimal range of knowledge when it comes to repairing cars. Don't get me wrong, cars have been apart of more than 50% of my daily life. My life revolves around cars, but if I wanted to be a Subaru tech, I needed the knowledge. Now I don't have the money to purchase broken cars, and fix them, but I've had to do a few things on my Subaru that really upped my knowledge (Timing belt + Water pump, Serpetine belts, Oil changes, etc...).I began searching for ways to further my knowledge; I found this game on the automechanics subreddit and it has actually been very helpful. The game itself isn't realistic in the sense that it could be a training tool for a mechanic (The bolts are incredibly unrealistic. 3/4 of the cars you work on are rusted to hell, rusted bolts should not come out that fast without penetrating sprays); but it's a fantastic tool for figuring out where certain parts of the car are. Don't know how to access, or find the pistons? Now you do. Do you not know how to diagnose certain problems with the car, without a scan tool? Now you do.I'm gonna make a pros/cons list of this game.Pros:- Very great tool for gaining knowledge of part locations- Gives you a general idea on how the car works- Graphics are amazing- Game is actually pretty fun, even if you don't want to be a mechanic- Wide selection of partsCons:- Not realistic in terms of truly repairing a car- Not a lot of variety in cars. I'd love to see semi trucks, busses, wider selection in Wagons, Sedans, SUVs, etc... "

												It’s a decent game, but it’s not a real sim and its very repetitive.Why it’s not a sim (at least to me).  When I think of a simulator, i think everything should be how it actually is irl (or relatively close to it).  This game is just that, a game. Parts of the mechanic part they got right, but read on for what they didn’t...There are other reviews saying its repetitive, but I though hey, it’s a game about fixing cars... you are going to repair the same issues many times.  But it goes far beyond that. Every modern v8 - exactly the same engine.  So if you are working on the challenger knockoff or the bmw knockoff, they are identical motors.*edit* even though modern v8's in all vechicles are identical, you can't supercharge (swap) them when they are in a truck.My other gripes;Parts are invented, the 'press in' splined hub 'bearing' that is in every car... it’s actually part of the hub (the part you bolt your wheels to) and cannot be removed.Part names are made up.  in game; rear suspension arm 'x'y'z', = irl; trailing arm, rear upper/lower control arm.I really bought the game because when I played the demo there was a 'mods' section on the title screen, making me think, hey user mods for this game should be awesome!... yea... there's 1 mod... and it’s a track...Auction- no cars go unbid on.  There is always ai to bid you up on everything, and not just a few times.  The ai bids you up 20-30k in some cases.  Example; wanting to buy a GTR (not the Nissan version, some made up GTR) go to a few auctions to see what the sell for when im not bidding.  30k-42k. seems like a decent price.  go to a fresh auction and start trying to buy one.  Lowest I have gotten one is 53k highest was 62k, where is my 30k GTR?Rex, when I’m not bidding 32k.  When I’m bidding 50-60k.Overall, then game has a lot of potential but it’s not at all what I had hoped for.I would still recommend the game if you know nothing about cars, as this will teach you a lot (just don’t pay attention to the names of the suspension parts).

												While fun at first, the game gets very repetitive and, frankly, boring after some time. I believe this game will only be fun to someone who doesn't know much about cars and their maintenance.First, I played on normal difficulty - dropped it quickly, too easy.Then expert difficulty - still too easy. Incidentally, removing parts of the user interface is just annoying, and not difficult (e.g. money and xp).The devs would need to do something about it to make the game more challenging. Call it master difficulty:  Re-assembly is way too easy with assisted ordering and highlighting. I mean, if you forgot to put something in - it should stay forgotten. And if you're finishing an order, game shouldn't kindly tell you that you've forgotten some crucial part somewhere. A true mechanic should face the consequences! Be it money or warranty work.  Damage/wear model is too simple, just rust or certain belt marks. And there should some kind of 'fog of war' for rust, otherwise it's too easy to spot rusty parts.  Want to get really technical? Lay out OBD in full: fault codes, oxygen sensor data, fuel trims, air data! And graphs too!  Out of all different engine liquids, there's only oil now. Well, should be more, with level checks, certain type of damange (leaking), etc.  Greases? A good portion of car mechanics is about greases. Of course, this one is hard to implement in a game reasonably.  Car problems are a bit random. IRL physical problems are often localized: i.e. you struck a wheel on something - a wheel and local suspension parts would be affected. And IRL engine problems are often conceptually connected: for example, a low level of engine coolant would lead to overheating, worsening oil state and inducing piston wear, etc.  Payment should reflect the work required. My impression is that in CMS 2015 your bonus (i.e. profit) depends on the part costs, and not on work required to get to those parts.Also, I've seen CMS 2014 having repair order comments like ""I lent the car to my wife, and now my suspension is ruined!"" That was a nice touch, pity there's nothing like this in CMS 2015.			"

												This is one of the greatest kickstarter games I've ever seen. I played CMS 2014 to remind myself great times when I was ""wasting"" my life in Gearhead Garage but unfortunately it was only like demo version of it. CMS 2015 is completely different - whatever was good in 2014 is still here but many features were developed further. There is more cars, more parts - more of everything. And finally we can go to auction and pimp wrecks to collect them or for sale. Graphics are brilliant for such low budget product. You can do OBD scanner tests, test drive or measure electrical performance of various components. It's a perfect sim for all moto-fans. Recommended and Kudos to polish developer.			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 has become one of my favorite games to play, I just can't quit playing it. The main thing that makes this game fantastic is that it is extremely educational. I began mechanically ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and actually learned a whole lot about the functions of a vehicle.Pros: - Beautiful graphics.- Good car selection. (clearly knockoffs, but you can take a good stab at what they represent)- Plenty of parts to disassemble and reassemble.- Doesn't just hold your hand and tell you every move to make. (Some may not consider that a pro)- Is definitely realistic, and now I can trust myself to change sparkplugs. :pCons:- I learned from this game that the key way to identify a messed up car part is to find the absolutely rusted-over part, and remove it. I believe that if the creator(s) were to create cracked, dented, crushed, and other affects to try to identify, that it would be a little less cheesy, and a lot more challenging.- No trucks. I will live until this issue is fixed though. :)- No transmission repair. I feel as if the game has very in-depth repair abilities, such as being able to gut out an engine and lift the whole thing out, but as far as gearbox operations, you don't get to jack with the transmission at all, you only have to replace or repair the gearbox as a whole without messing with the transmission or the overall mechanism inside of the gearbox itself. (I STRONGLY DESIRE THE ABILITY TO DO THIS)9/10 Absolutely recommended, would be 10/10 if it weren't for a few minor things like what I mentioned above.			"

												I highly recommend this game, particularly for the educational element.  I got this game in a Humble Bundle, and after recent adventures with doing a bit of DIY with replacing my IRL car's fuel pump, I wanted to try out this sim game.  I'm now 31 hours in across 4 days.  This game is very, very addicting (at first), but extremely grindy.  Each part installed counts as 1 experience, and it's not until 9000 experience do you get to start building/selling customs.But there's a specific reason why, this game is very newbie friendly, and as you gain the in-game experience, you become more and more familiar with parts, ""feel"", damage appearance, what tests to use to identify what, what part is likely damaged when a customer reports an issue with X, and what is most ""cost efficient"" when repairing a car.You have very few diagnostic tools in the beginning (these have to be leveled up for, 1000 exp gets you 1 upgrade point, or one tool), so you are forced to do the diagnostics with visual identification and on a test track.This game is not for advanced mechanics, or people looking to build/race customs.  It is very much for people who don't really know much about cars to learn (at a basic level) how a car is put together.Prior to this game, I had a very rudimentary knowledge of how a car works, the most advanced thing I've done IRL is install a new fuel sending unit in an old Sentra.  From playing this game, I've learned names of a lot of different parts (you do the same repairs enough that you end up remembering them), and learned how to identify when a car is suffering from issues at different parts across the board.Once you reach around 5000 exp though you may get bored, I stuck it out and went to 9K to see what building a custom was like, and while it's fun, you can't do too much with them except compare performance with other players in the Steam forums, or sell them back to the shop for extra money.I will likely buy the DLC when it goes on sale, but for now it's a bit too much $ for what is offered.Also, get the car name mod from one of the guides, it converts the in-game names to their IRL counterparts.

I spent 45 minutes removing piece by piece of the engine block until I had reduced the thing to just a chassis and its suspension, and still I couldn't figure out what part was causing the issue. I started taking the entire truck apart, and about an hour in, I discovered that the air filter compartment's lid was busted.I made $20.Surely, this is the most realistic car mechanic simulator in the world.

												I won't claim to know everything about cars, I would struggle to fix a car if someone gave me a step by step 'Fixing a car for dummies' book. That said, this is a good start for anyone remotely interested in fixing/repairing/replacing parts. While there are some things I could criticize, like the 'instructions not clear enough - private parts stuck in engine block' tutorial, it's quite easy to get into and play with little hand-holding. The part repair system could use a little work imho, the paint shop seems a bit redundant at times, the auction camera needs a bit of fixing, and some other small things.Overall for a game of this style, having that balance between a gearhead's game and a general indie style game is hard to get right. This game gets it right. It has enough depth and detail to actually make me stop and think about what I'm doing and what steps I should take to complete the repair, but not too much that I have to call my mechanic friends/family and ask them what I need to do.The game is easy to get into and very fun to play, again balancing gameplay and detail/realism. The number of times I've had to replace a crankshaft after I've already taken apart the clutch housing and reassembled it......There are a few things that needed work, but mostly just quality of life improvements that could be changed/added in a patch. No major problems to speak of.I wish some of the 2014 features were there, like the sense of progression from a garage to a multi-car shop, or the 'replace the missing parts from my new used car purchase'.Yes you will replace brakes a thousand times, yes you will change thousands of filters, yes you will find the same problems coming up time after time. This is the life of a mechanic. Cars need brakes, cars need new filters, mechanical things break, and often times it's the same things that break. I would recommend that you see the 'monotony' as a more realistic representation of how it is to fix cars in a shop. Your car will need new oil, it will need a new timing belt at least once in its life, it's just a fact to live with.The thing I personally like, having recently gotten to that point, is once you can purchase a parking garage and go to the auto auction to purchase broken down piles of scrap, and turn them into like-new beauties to sell. The trailer/intro video shows this, starting with a car that may be missing half of the body, trying to repair as many parts as possible to save money, and buying what you can't fix. By the end you can decide whether to just replace the really bad parts, or completely renovate the body, engine, and suspension to brand new quality. It adds a sense of accomplishment to the end game (which some may say is desperately needed after changing 1000 brake pads), and keeps you playing.TL;DR: It can be boring, but it's worth it to anyone even remotely interested in cars. Just buy it. (Though if still in doubt - wait for a sale, $20 USD may be a bit steep for some)			"

												This game is a wonderful mix of an intro to car components and a D&D dystopia.Instead of making different parts show that they are worn and broken using a variety of techniques, the game uses only one. RUST.So imagine we are handed a relatively new car that has some suspension problems. We pop the car on a lift, take a look at the undercarriage, and we find pristine parts, right next to others that look like they've been randomly touched by a rust monster. This makes the game into quite the amusing ""find the rust"" quest.Added hilarity comes from antique muscle cars. I've opened the hood just to find an engine that must have been submerged in the ocean for 100 years. You want me to fix your engine? The engine block is made out of rust! There are a whole 5 push rods and two spark plugs that are in sensible shape! But the customer is the customer, and we get to disassemble the entire engine, but 40+ new parts, and somehow put them together, with new pristine parts next to others that somehow, despite being quite rusty, do not need a change. Yes sir, I'll only change 5 pistons, even though the other 3 are at 30%. I am sure you want to pay for another mechanic to rebuild your engine again in a year when those old parts fail, right?The game's biggest issues today are the fact that the game refuses to list the defective parts when I am in front of the computer, ordering replacements, so I either have to use paper, or just make multiple trips to the in-game parts store (Just imagine how long that would take IRL if a mechanic did something like that). The second issue is that the game wants you to replace the broken parts with newer ones that meet specs, but it has to be in the exact same position. So, say that we have an 8 cylinder engine, with its 16 pull rods. 5 of them are broken and need replacement. the rest do not, but they are so used they are not good as replacements. We also have to change the crankshaft, which involves removing the engine heads where the pull rods fit. So after we disassemble everything, and put on the new crankshaft, and put the engine heads back, then comes the game of trying to figure out which location to put the new pull rods, as we've already taken all of them out. So I end up pushing O a lot, and seeing if, after placing a new part, the game actually thinks it counts as a repair. if it doesn't, I have to take the part out again, and then put an old one, Repeat until you find all the new replacements, or just give up, and purchase all the parts new.Overall, it's a fun game, as long as you don't take it too seriously. Highly recommended.			"

												Probably the best sim game there is in fixing cars. I work as a mechanic in real lif and this game is a good way to learn the parts, how they work and kind of shows you how to fix them. My friends have played this and said they feel they've learnt more about cars. Plus being able restore cars and turn a profit and also having the ability if you buy the DLC to tune the cars and do drag runs. Probably one of the best car mechanic sims i've played and i recommend buying this game.			"

												Playway has really done a great job with this one. I enjoyed CMS2014 but they managed to build on that and improve it in almost every way. And all with Kickstarter and a low pledge goal. As the name implies you run an auto shop repair business. But new and improved for 2015 are the cars have many more parts now and the repairs are a good deal more involved. You also earn XP now as you work and complete jobs which can be used to unlock more advanced diagnostic tools like the test path, OBD scanner, compression tester etc and other repair abilities. There is also an unlockable paint shop now as well so you can do body and paint work and an auction house where you can buy junk cars for parts or fix them up and sell them for profit. Once you earn enough to get the extra parking lot, you can store your cars for service or just collect them. Customers call in on the phone with jobs you can take or decline. An all new better organized parts shop and tablet access eliminates running back and forth to the computer to buy parts.Test driving the vehicle now and using your diagnostic tools generates a parts list condition report for certain systems saving you time poking around and disassembling the vehicle looking for bad parts.All in all there's quite a bit to do and highly recommended if you like puzzle games, working on cars, or are a simulator fan.

												I've played this game a little bit, and don't get me wrong, the premise of the game is great. It's a barebones, basic simulator of what it can be like to work on cars. As a schooling technician, this game is a fun time waster and it has just enough vagueness to keep it from feeling like actual work.However, this game is a DLC generator. There has not been any actual progress on the game in a very, very long time. They will add one or two cars with very little variation between the previous vehicles in the game. A new engine model but that's kind of useless when it's all visuals. In the early days, they talked about adding all sorts of features, only to later tell they were limited by the game engine in what they can do. It really bums me out because this game had SO much potential to be ""more than your average simulator"", it had potential to be something great enough to be raved about, but I do not see the effort being put forward to improve the game anymore. It's just a DLC of a couple cars every few months. Because of that, I find myself playing other games more often than this one these days.This game is a good game to play and zone out while doing so (if you really understand the cars) or an interesting abstract puzzle game, however I can only recommend it to someone so long as they know that actual improvements or content is pretty much gone with the wind at this point.

												I love this game. Period.I don't know much about cars, and even though I always enjoyed car tycoon games, I never really got into any ""mechanic simulator"". Until now. This is pretty much a 3D puzzle connected with company (car garage in this case) management.You get to repair the cars, earn money, and then improve the garage. On top of this you can purchase old, ruined cars on atucion, and bring them back to life to either sell them, or... have your own collection. And yes - you can test drive the cars (which is sometimes necessary in order to know what's wrong with a car).I really enjoy this game, and can absolutely recommend it.			"

												I recieved CMS 2015 in a Humble Bundle, frankly I was pondering not even activating it on my account since I have zero interest in cars in real life. However, I figured ""hey why not?"".I was pleased to find a very addictive experience that I hadn't expected. Though the flaws began to show themselves soon enough. After enough ours patching up the same cars over and over again I wondered why there wasn't more to the game. That's when I discovered the DLC page. Basically all the fun mechanics in the game are tucked away as DLC addons, such as being able to buy your own cars, clean them up and then either store them or sell them for a huge profit. Even the (in my view) BASIC feature of being able to swap out engines was unavailable unless you purchased a DLC pack.Not sure why all of these Simulators feel like they have to cut out vital components in their games or not add them at all until a later date so they can release them as DLC is a must. Frankly it's kinda annoying getting a game only to find that you have to buy 5+ packs of additional content to get the full experience.Even so the options in CMS 2015 are limited, I bought nearly all of their DLC because I found the game far more engaging that I thought it would be. However, I must be honest and say that I've got quite a bit of buyers remorse after that.At first I would've given CMS 2015 an 8/10 but after noticing the chopped-up nature of the game, the lack of features to keep you engaged... I'd say this game isn't worth more than a 5/10 at most.			"

												This game is basicly a open free play at game start. Your abilty in the game is outstanding, you gain experince points, having thoses points makes it possable to get things, you can take jobs or reject jobs, you can not only do auto repair, but go to the auction and get cars to restore. The game is not a auto training simulator, there are no software training simulators for auto mechanics, you would need to see a tech school for that because it is hands on training. How ever the diganostics on the car for a failing part is on the mark for the most part of what got broken and needs to be replaced. If you never worked on a car ever, here you will get to see what the parts names are and were they go, so yeah it could be said you will learn the very basic bases of auto mechanics.If your a mechnic who likes to play around with car repair games, a person who is into cars, anyone who is adicted to cars, I would recomend this game. Check out the guides section in the fourm and look for ""Auto Repair Manual Class for Car Mechanic Simulator 2015"" Why this guide? Because at the very end of the guide at the bottom it has Tutorial Videos of the in's and out's of what is expected in the game and maybe of intresst to you to see what is going on in the game! They are sectioned off with titles on each video making it possable for you to choose what you want to see. Some vids may have more than one part, there was alot to cover.. Hope this helps..			"

Somewhere along the history of video games, a beautiful little too-weird-to-live yet too-rare-to-die niche genre was born. Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is smack-dab in the middle of this genre, and can be described as a zen-like puzzler that is an incredibly slow burner. This game will require many hours from you, and will satisfy and reward you the whole way.Essentially, you manage a mechanics garage. The whole thing. You answer calls, take jobs, and fix cars (among other things). You can repair parts, or order new. You can let jobs pile up, or solve one at a time. Each job is very much a puzzle. The better you are, the quicker you advance. The more you advance, the better swag/tools/speed/etc. you get. It has RPG elements like that. The music is great, too.Pros:+Utterly addicting, in all the right ways.+Beautiful graphics, and great music to fit.+Metric tons of gameplay in here. +If you are familiar with automotive anatomy, it will help some, but don't let that scare away people that are unfamiliar: its easy to learn.+Controls are smooth and intuitive after the first 20 minutes or so.Cons:-This is the kind of game (I think) that is best chipped away at an hour a day or so (probably like EuroTruck Simulator). Its a slow burner. You need to invest alot of time to really get somewhere. Not necessarily a 'con', but you should be aware. It isn't instant gratification.I got it on sale, but I think its worth full price for most people (if you are looking into it, its probably for you). Its amazing and beautiful how video games can be brilliantly built out of mundane and simple ideas.Peace,			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2015:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Every one of us knows about cars to a certain degree. Well, we know which brands of car we like, what shape we like, what features they have and mostly we love to drive them (must be a minimum of 16 years old to do so). That is probably the extent most of us really know about automobiles. Well, Thanks to Car Mechanic Simulator 2015, you will expand your knowledge of one of the biggest inventions of the nineteen century!Car Mechanic simulator 2015 is a car simulation/ racing / puzzle game. In this game, you are going to take control of a very busy garage. Your phone is going to ring constantly and you will receive a lot jobs to repair cars (mechanics and body work); engine, brakes, suspensions, gearbox, axles or the body of the car. After you accept the job (you will have a full description of the job), you will have to get your hands dirty and reach the part to be replaced. You can’t really miss it, it will be rusty (red). One of the interesting aspects of the job description is that you have to make sure that all parts you replace are of a certain condition (eg above 70%). Well, if you buy the part it would fine but sometimes you might decide to use the repair table to save some money. Let’s say you decide to replace the faulty part with a brand new one and decide to order the part using your desktop. You will have five suppliers and one bank. Each supplier will be a specialist and the bank will be here if you need a loan. At the end of each job, you will earn money (thank god for that, you see the price of some parts. . . pretty steep) and experience points. As you gain experience, you will be able to accept bigger jobs and each time you reach 1,000 XP you will be given an upgrade point which you can use to get better tools or customize your garage. Xp will also give you access to upgrade you garage with very important features; such as a paint shop. If you feel the urge to take a break from the chaotic work, why don’t you take a car for a spin or go to the auction (you must upgrade your garage with a carpark before you can go to the auction). The layout of the garage is well designed and you can see everything a garage has to offer – car lifter, tools, garage doors - but no calendar (you know those calendars that have picture of a woman without much on sitting on a car bonnet looking rather suggestive).The graphics are really good and the controls are a combination of keyboard / mouse and are easy to use and understand. The soundtrack is absolutely stunning, too.This game is really impressive to be honest with you. Whether you are a petrol head or not, it is really enjoyable to play. It might be a bit repetitive, but it’s fun! Positives:~~~~~~~ -	Good graphics-	Garage is very well laid out and can be customized-	Easy to follow jobs in hand-	Plenty of content and DLC-	Great soundtrackNegatives:~~~~~~~~-	No achievement or trading cards-	A bit repetitiveCar Mechanic Simulator 2015 is a well thought-out game.8/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

												Have to give this one a cautious thumbs up. There aren't enough customization options in the base game, and the game is a bit over-monetized. That said, it still plays pretty well and has a fairly good feel to it. It does have a couple of issues that I'll correct right now... 1. the radio is under the window cill behind the Right Lift. 2. The unlockable diagonistic tools can be activated using F1-F3 when in examine mode when looking at the engine. I didn't discover this until 100+ hours into the game. So except for those usability fails, it's a pretty interesting game... Has an issue with part identification in expert mode tho, ie there's no manual to refer to to figure out which part to put on a car if you sold the old ones too soon.			"

												First of all, this game, although basic in some situations, is a pretty good game if you like working with cars or want to know a little bit more about how a car is put together. There are a few problems with this game though, some major and some minor problems.For example: The time it takes to load a car into your workshop after you accepted a job, bought one from the auction or made a test drive in it is long, and sometimes longer than I like.The second major problem is that there isn't much of a story with each job. I've played CMS 2014 and in that game you get to see a little story about why the car is in the garage in the first place. In CMS 2015 you just get a list of parts that need to be fixed (in the beginning, later that list of parts is mostly gone and you just have to look for the broken parts) and that's it. This makes the game a little less personal in my opinion.The third  major problem involves the dlc's available. For some reason, the delevopers thought it'd be a good idea to put the content from the dlc's in the game before said dlc is purchased. This way, the delevopers look like a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that just want to make as much money as the can.And now some of the minor problems:- The engine sounds aren't very... uhm... realistic...- even if you buy a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ car from the auction, the only parts that can be missing are the body panels. I'd like to see something like various parts missing from a car whilst it's still able to be put in the shop.- you can only give your car one color if you paint it. It'd be nice if you can put stripes or things like that on a car and give them another color.- you have to buy every part you need individually. If there'd be an option to select how many parts you want that will make it both easier and more realistic.So the game's pretty good as far as basics are concerned, but there's just a couple of things that make the game less realistic. Still, wheter you like realism or not, this game is pretty fun.			"

												""CMS 2015"" is like ""CMS 2014"", only it's shinier and has more stuff to do.  I'm admittedly not very good with cars but yet still enjoyed my time with it.  ""CMS 2014"" featured static levels whereas this one seems to throw random jobs at you, which you can either take or reject on a whim (which is great).  I would have liked some sort of difficulty gauge on how hard jobs are before you accept them, that is...something to tell you that you have to take 15 parts off the car as opposed to 2 before getting to the part you need to replace.  Some may be able to say, ""oh, that's just a catalytic capacitor radiator thingy...an easy fix""...I can't do that.  A color palette box in the showroom would have been nice too (instead you have to toggle through colors), but this is minor.  There's lots of play time to be had here, especially if you don't know what you're doing.  An easy recommend!

												CMS 2015. This game in my opinion is a major step forward and up from what CMS 2014 was. Yes there is no drag racing or doing 4X4..yet. I have thouroghly enjoyed several new aspects of the game. The fact that the camera is easier to control and doesn't snap or go to awkward angles like it did in CMS 14 is a huge plus for me. I also love that you can take a motor alll the way down to the block and rebuild it. Heck you can strip the whole car down and rebuid, I'm loving how in depth they have gone with this new release. I only see the game getting better as they update and release DLC. If you love getting your hands dirty, at least virtually. This game is for you.			"

												This game is a big improvement over the 2014 version, it only has one big flaw, IMO it gets boring after awhile, i can't blame the devs, being a mechanic kinda is like that, you do the same jobs 1k times during the carreer... sometimes something more challenging comes and thats it, dlcs are a great way to have some action but i find them expensive for what they offer.The game can teach you some stuff but nothing out of the basics... this can be great for starters so they dont get too confused but for someone like me that has will to go deeper, it can disapoint a little.I recomend this game, it could be better but atm it is the only good option if you want a car mechanic sim, so it's this or nothing.

It can get repetitive after about 16h (I played more than 30 already and still have lots of fun), but it is actively developed and almost every week (and sometimes even more often) there is something new to see in the game and also after you explore all the content available at the moment game is still relaxing and fun so I find myself running it just to play for about half an hour, fix a car of two, and relax a little. I highly recommend this game. It is very well done technologically, constantly improved in terms of gameplay and replayability and has very good support and contact with the developer. Almost every thread on steam forums has a developer answer, and some of the suggestions were implemented in the game in literally few days from being first posted.

												Learned to appreciate my personal vehicle and other vehicles' designs. I played this game for a while and I looked under the hood of my car and I recognize the parts and their functions because of this game. Load times are sometimes long especially when the garage is full of cars but understandable since there are probably many parts the game is keeping track of. It would be great if there are more real auto manufacturers that would add their vehicles.This game can be played for a few minutes and even while I watch movies. No time pressure. 250 hours game time as of this review and will continue to play it.			"

That said, here's a summary of what I think are the strong and weak points of this game:Pros:Unique idea (to me anyway), running your own garageNicely rendered cars and mechanically logical design/engineeringFun upgrades to your workshop can be added (e.g. custom colors from your spray booth)Cons:Greater role-playing elements would make this good game greatDon't really see the purpose of the ""test track""Limited toolbox upgrades -- I have so many upgrade points and can't do anything with themMinor grouse -- slow loading times, especially to auction, parking, garage, etc. surely this can be improved?Music was driving me batty after a while, but you can shut it offGets repetitive after a while, especially without new cars, challenges, etc., which meansLimited replay value, unless you find taking cars apart relaxing, like meI know there are more cons than pros, but the weight of the pros is higher than the cons. I had fun. Worth getting -- even more so if on sale.7.5/10 "

												I'm on the fence about this one. I think Car Mechanic Simulator is a tremendous first step, however it ultimately fell short of what I was hoping for.The game boils down to an interactive set of 3d car models. These models allow you to disassemble and reassemble engines, drive trains, and so on. This is definitely neat, but in itself only has so much enjoyment before things get repetitive. The illusion of running a repair shop almost works but the finer points of running a business are completely lost. There are always more customers waiting, no matter how long you take, or how poorly you did. Diagnosing problems seems almost trivial, just look for rusty components as you wrench things apart. I want to like this, but I ran out of challenges a while ago. All that remains is the grind of XP and money.This game needs more of something. I would personally love to see engine tuning and performance simulated to some degree. Other options would be expanding the business model of running a repair shop, or perhaps adding more realism to the repairs themselves. A broken part isn't just a rust texture after all.			"

												I owe a lot to this game. I grew up not knowing a thing about cars. I picked this game up on a whim, and it got me over my fear of messing around with my semi-broken car. I learned where things typically are, and what they do in a car. I have saved myself and my friends and family probably hundreds, if not thousands of dollars in vehicular repair. I even managed to fix a broken lawnmower by extrapolating from what I learned here! Using this as a general guide and supplementing knowledge with YouTube channels has, in my mind, made me somewhat competent when dealing with these things. I am by no means a mechanic or an engineer, and this game will not give you the didactic knowledge that is required of those professions, but it has taught me fundamentals. Fundamentals that are worth far, far beyond the asking price of this game/virtual tutorial. Words cannot describe how much  I appreciate the experience that Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 has given me. I can't say it is particularly ""fun"". I could see how you would have fun with it, but the overall management experience of it is, in my humble opinion, a little weak. That isn't the point, though. If you have any interest in working on cars, you owe it to yourself to get this game.			"

												This game is truly what every gear-head has been waiting for. Virtually running your own shop - with a few things missing. I would LOVE to make a few suggestions for the next release so that it would suite not only my own preferences as a Diesel Mechanic, but those as a gamer. Pros:Smooth, flawless gameplay. No bugs worth remembering.BEAUTIFUL textures. The ability to diagnose with different tools. Decent car variety (for what the game is)Auctions!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Build for profit!!!!!!!!!!!!!Pick what jobs you want to do!Immersive gameplay.Cons:Some things that should need bolts or nuts, don't have them. Making removal easy.Random pulleys.... (really urks me that the belt is being bent in a way for no purpose other than aesthetics)No A/C Systems in any cars (would be a fun thing to troubleshoot)What happened to intake hoses/tubing?Driveshaft removal in something that is rear-wheel drive is WONKY.ignition coils can only be seen if you hover over them (possible bug)Body work system is weird, sometimes get a work order for replacing panels for a vehicle with no paint job, but panels are same color as car. (wtf?)Music........ oh my god the ♥♥♥♥ing music. Suggestions:Advertise this product more for a bigger budget on the next version (you guys are onto something)More varieties of things to diagnose and troubleshoot (like oil/coolant/fuel leaks)Add nuts/bolts to things that would typically be bolted down to an engine (like an intake on the older V8)Employees?Don't let this series die.... please........ pretty please..... 2016?!?!

												This game is absolutely relaxing. If you played and liked CMS2014, you will DEFINITELY love this game.Pros:= More parts! this means more detail in the disassembly and repair of cars= BEAUTIFUL! The graphics may not be GTA V, but they are certainly delightful!= OWNING cars! This is a feature that pretty much everyone wished was in the last game.= Active devs! The devs are on pretty  much EVERY DAY to help diagnose bugs and help players have a better experience.Cons:= It's a simulator. This may not be your type of game= Very detailed. While this may be a pro to some, it can quickly become a con to those who don't know cars.= Slow. Not in performance, but gameplay. It may take some time to diagnose a car, and then even more time to fix it!Overall, I would definitely recommend this game. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it certainly is mine!8/10 from me!~ WireBound			"

												i loved cms 14 and this blows my mind. my father is a fanominal technician and i want to be just as good but better. im 16 and this has taught me a lot. if someone is talking about a part i now know what that part is. in my opinion they should add more customization towards parts on cars. i would love to be able to take out a old crappy engine and put in a higher performance engine. same with other parts. i think that would be amazing. they should also add the 1/4 mile mode again. i loved tuning the cars just right so i can complete the order.these are just suggestions so if anyone agrees with me please like my review10/10			"

Product received for free
Fixing cars without a messDo you like cars? Or are you interested in knowing more about car parts? Or are you just looking for a relaxing game where you dismantle stuff and build them again? Whatever your reason is Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 let's you do it wihout a mess.Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is a fun, relaxing game where you fix and tune different kind of cars for you to earn money by fixing them or by selling them. As the name of the game may suggest it's quite realistic in terms of being a video game. You can fix cars, test drive them, use different kinds of equipement to look for problems in the car. Do not expect any kind of sick street racing with this game because it's pretty much just fixing cars. But a fun game at that.There are some things I have to criticize though about the gameplay and the game itself. The loading times are absolutely horrendous. No matter how powerful computer you got the loading times will be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ The other things that I had problem with the early-game gmaeplay. It takes quite a long time to reach even remotely interesting jobs. The first cars you'll be fixing in the first 4 hours or so will be very easy and won't earn you enough EXP or money to make them worthwhile doing. But you are stuck with them. But fortunately after a couple of hours the gameplay gets more interesting in terms of getting longer and more difficult jobs that actually make you think what you need to fix first. Unfortunately I can see people stepping away from the game in the first couple of hours because of the boring fixing jobs it offers.Overall, Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is a very fun game. It may not be the most difficult one but it certainly is a change of pace compared to other games on the market. Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 actually taught me more about car parts than anything else to this point. Certainly I'm no master mechanic just by playing this game but it certainly gives a bit more clear image of how cars work and what parts there are inside them. Fun and relaxing experience suitable for everyone.For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here! "

												You don't have to be a car enthusiast to enjoy this game.  If a 3D puzzle/forensic/tycoon game hybrid appeals to you, you might like CMS 2015. I call AAA to jump my battery, and my eyes glaze over when people talk bout cars, but I was surprised how much joy I got from buying a rusty junker, taking it apart, and either repairing or replacing all of its parts to make it practically brand new.------PROS____+ Gentle learning curve. I felt like an idiot for the first couple minutes, but even after just the second repair job, I felt a rewarding sense of growth in my abilities.  I don't like working too hard for a game (there's real life for that!), but I get bored when games are too easy, and CMS 2015 hits that sweet spot between boredom and frustration.+3D puzzle/forensic/tycoon game hybrid.+ Great music. If you end up buying this game, make sure to walk over to the radio, turn it on, and flip the stations.  I'd pay for at least one of the tracks they play on the game's radio.+ Active developers as of 4/2015. They seem to respond pretty fast to reported bugs, patch minor gameplay updates that significantly improve the gaming experience, and actually post upcoming plans for future updates.-------CONS-------+ Longer loading screens than I would've expected, but nothing too frustrating+ Getting enough experience points and money to get to the more fun parts of the game (going to auctions to buy a junker and build your own car/s, upgrades for work efficiency, etc) might take a bit too long for impatient gamers.

												Ok, this is not going to be a pleasant read, nor will it be flattering for the developer.To begin with, I'd like to point at the interface. It is, simply put, horrible. No consistency between key mappings to open and close any given window. There is no way to reconfigure keybindings. And, before I forget, there is the horrible way of trying to unmount car parts by precision rightclicking or else you're screwed.Adding to the frustrations of having to deal with the interface, comes the marathon running you have to do between computer, car, and/or other things. The oil collector can is always placed as far as possible away from the cars (in the customer lounge area (!!!)), and you cannot run. Yes, I'll redact my statement about marathon runs, this is like walking a marathon.The level of detail on the car parts is pretty much in the middle. Not bad, but not good either. Completely mediocre, in other words. Trust me when I say this, I've spent countless hours rebuilding my first car from a wreck to a car that was safe to drive. This is a game, and I acknowledge the need to simplify some things, but the interesting parts of a car is completely left out, such as the magnificient gearbox. The gearbox is an entire minigame in itself (or as Haynes' manuals say: Please don't do this, you'll regret it!), and to see the gearbox being an atomic (that is undividable) part, I find myself grossly disappointed. Furthermore, the joy of the differential is also left alone. Then there is the joys of timing belts and chains, timing gear adjustments, the wonders of camshaft misrotation, valve clearance measurement and trimming, valve seal gasket changing, cylinder head gasket changing, piston ring changing, oil pump maintenance, PCV (positive crankcase ventilation) box changing and overhauling, flametrap changing, etc.. The list goes on forever, and all these fun activities to be had under the bonnet are missing. The game itself gives you a chance to experience how it is to unscrew/fasten some components and that's it! The joy of badly fitting replacement parts (such as the timing belt cover) is nowhere to be seen.But I digress. Let's move on. Music, or should I say the complete lack of it. Yes, they have some sounds in sequence that some call music present, but it is annoying at best. Having to listen to it non stop gives me a bloody migraine. On top of that, after researching a little, I find the developer chose to use Creative Commons music, i.e. royalty free music, and that explains a lot. Especially one song is really abrasive to the ears, and I find myself screaming to the computer whenever it comes on, mostly because the girl is atonal and can't sing without missing 7/10 tones. Even my neighbor rang my doorbell and wondered when I was going to shoot that cat. When I buy a game for 20 dollars, I feel ripped off when I discover the game developer was too much of a frugal git to include proper music, and went for the royalty free♥♥♥♥♥♥Get this game as a gift for someone you hate. Do not buy it for yourself.Good grief, I thought this was a mean reddit/3+1 chan (steam censors their name, wow) joke, but it seems to be meant as a commercial game.			"

												I got the game with all DLC on the sale. I liked the business idea in the gamedescription and as it was on sale, I was like, lets try this!However, now I reached a point where there isnt really much to do and some features that dissapoint me:Managed to unluck all shop options (paint, testing, parking etc.). Once I got the parking, I bought some cars and only just fixing the body could get me some good profits, if I got the car at the right price. Bought 2 cars I totally rebuild with new parts, one with tuner and performance parts, which I kept. Took it to the dragracing and found out I be racing just myself. So exciting! Also modding the looks of your car is pretty dissapointing. GTA V, which has this not as a core part of their game, offers more paint, rims and other options to change the looks of your vehicle than this game.So now, I dont need money as I got everything, modding a car isnt interesting as I can choose one or two different bumpers and painting a car kinda sucks (no preview and can only paint a car in 1 color, no decals).Buy this game if:- You like replacing carparts over and over againDo not buy this game if:- You like business sims- You like to pimp cars "

I understand there are legal reasons and expenses. That is literally the only flaw I have on this game.Awesome game. 9/10			"

												821 HP Tempest Magnum cuts a 10.390 with best launch achieved using a keyboard. 10.440 if I start in 2nd.Also after building the thing to hell I noticed in the loading art a DOHC V8 is being dropped into the magnum (but I can't do that, only OHV swaps).Tips from a beginner:- 9000xp is a grind, but the game gets a lot more fun once you have a garage and can hit the auction up- Buying a 1/5 star auction score and restoring to 100% perfect seems to rack up faster profits than answering the phone (or at least it is more interesting)- Save your cash for 9000xp+- Repair upgrades will save you quite a bit of cash, max asap- Carb and EFI tuning: get 2-3 bars lined up then work the last one to 18% while incrementing the 2-3 together9/10 will be doing more (haven't even began working the DOHC V8's yet, 50 hours in, 400k~ cash as of this comment).For the devs: the 10/10 would come if I could swap nearly any engine into any thing without having to modify the game files (with some sensibility, but a V8 maluch sounds like a blast). Also more modding and tuning options would help (11/10 if I can turbo or twin turbo anything). Most under carriage do not seem to collide the exhaust in any way with the drive train, so customized exhaust could be possibility too? 12/10 for addict DLC that includes all of this.			"

												I'll recommend this game because I had fun playing it and it's a better game than I could ever make, but just beware this is far from reality (more of a game than simulator). After a while I got annoyed with some minor things: The loading times in this game are absolutely terrible, as others have already mentioned. The sound effects get old pretty quick (sounds like breaking glass every time you remove a bolt or part), can be fixed by turning your sound off but I'd rather have more variety. The jobs get repetitive, but this happens in real life too (90% of the jobs I received were brake and timing related) The automatic mouse centering is pretty annoying every time you open a menu It lacks a lot of realistic parts to be a simulator (transmission gears, more body options, missing almost every electronic part besides the ignition and battery, torque specs, etc) but I suppose someone could fix this with a mod or something. No Steam achievements (could be some for fully restoring a car, completing certain number of jobs etc) Everything ""damaged"" is rusted so it's pretty obvious to find the problems without running any diagnosticsI didn't do much with the 1/4 mile strip since each time I went there it was terrible on keyboard and the loading times just weren't worth it. The only thing I ever left the garage for was the auctions and even those just ticked me off. Who would want to pay $50,000 for a rusted piece of garbage that they're only going to get $70,000 after fully restoring it? They should make the bidding system a bit more realistic too..Other than that I liked the game, the DLC make it much more enjoyable once you run out of things to do. "

												The game itself isn't going to really teach you much about cars or trucks that you can take and apply to the real world. You will learn some basic names and functions that are pretty basic so I wouldn't really call it much of a sim. It doesn't take long to reach the maximum level and money isn't a real obstacle once you can afford to buy, repair/upgrade, and sell your first vehicle.Where this game becomes a gem though is how relaxing it is. It has good music and decent graphics that you don't get tired of looking at. Everything is straight forward and not hard to figure out. More and more options and car varieties come out to keep you entertained. Where the game is now (May 15, 2016) is pretty great. You have a drag strip (super cars struggle a bit here) and a Dyno setup to help ""tune"" your car to maximum performance. You have a small but nice variety of cosmetic options to make your car more valuable and unique. This plus all of the original features gives you a game you can sink a couple of hours into here and there to build up your personal collection and your bank account.All in all, I would give this an 8/10 atm. The game is great, don't get me wrong. Hardly any bugs and plenty of fun. But it could always use more. More cosmetics, more cars, garage expansions, and possibly some sort of multiplayer whether that be in the form of racing or a collection showcase. Either way it is definitely worth the money, and getting all of the DLC when it goes on sale is a must!			"

												CMS 15 was the first title I played in the series and so far It's incredible fun. At first I was skeptical because I'm not all for simulators but to put it in short, I called in to work to play this non stop for 14 hours. Evidence enough?The huge plus for this is that the developers actually listen to the feedback and it's astounding. For instance, they released an update on Monday 4/27/15 that introduced tablets but unfortunately that followed a few bugs that altered the quality of the new features and within 8 hours of reporting the bug they had already released a hotfix.Overall, it's a great game and is worth every penny!

Only played the classic mode thus far and it's still brilliant. It's nice to get a list of items that you'll need to replace given to you. I also appreciate that far more parts are now removable and will need to be replaced.I do not recommend this game to anyone that can't appreciate a decent ""mong out"" style game. Anyone that found EuroTruck Simulator 2 enjoyable should find this to be a blast. If you couldn't appreciate the simple beauty of that game, this one will lose your interest quickly.			"

												Fun game, it teaches you the basics in car mecanics without having a ""proper"" tutorial. Being such a visual game you get to understand different engine types, transmissions, suspensions, drawbacks and advantages to these and how they can affect the design of each car.There is no end objective but after about 25-30 hours you'll have all the upgrades , 10 more hours and you should have all the parking spots and finally another 10 to fill them up with the cars of your dreams... so if you end up buying this game at a steam sale with all the dlc at about 25 euros for 50 hours of fun+learning something that'll be a bargain.edited: sports =/= spots			"

												Wow, finally a developer that looks at all of the weak points of a previous title and improves upon them - this game has exceeded my expectations so far (only 1.8 hours played at time of posting).I was so excited for this game when I saw it announced on Kickstarter. I didn't even think twice, of course I backed it, 2014 was such a great game. The idea of Car Mechanic Simulator is a very easy one to understand - I absolutely love tinkering with my real life car so naturally you would think this game is made for someone like me who is looking for a cheaper alternative to modding real cars, I would actually disagree with that. I find that this game has a wider market than people first think - the hunt for that last broken part and the race to get the funds for a bigger garage or that new part for the car you picked up at auction last week adds both puzzle and RPG elements that a lot of gamers will be familiar with and will enjoy.The game itself plays incredibly well and the new menus are gorgeous, very simple and straightforward, the controls have also been fine-tuned leaving the finished product feeling much better and in turn even more fun to play.Anyone that has played 2014 and liked it, even just a little bit, should definitely pick this up - let's keep supporting the creators and hopefully we will see another new game with some more incredible new features in 2016!The only thing that slightly holds this game back is the lack of customisation that you can put into the cars you pick up at auction. I would love to be able to fit my 20 year old rusty hatchback with a 5.0 litre V8, upgrade to a twin exhaust (or even quad!?), a wide body kit, slam the suspension, tint the windows, even possibly convert it to 4WD! Oh, the possibilities... Perhaps I'm just expecting too much, or maybe I've just been playing too much Need for Speed... Who knows, either way, I would bet money that we will see improvements like these in either future DLC or the next release.Verdict - As much as I really want to give this game a perfect score, it has to be 9/10 based on the lack of customisation for your auction bangers. Still a fantastic game that I will play until my eyes bleed.			"

												The game gives sweet old feel of Street Rod series. The level of detalisation is enough to get you tired of repairs.Pros:- lots of parts;- there are at least three generations of car design in the game, each with own features;- there is some good music;- it's not complicated and plays easy.Cons:- some processes are not very intuitive, e.g. engine swaps (it works onoly with Performance DLC although there are parts for engine tuning in the core game, and there isn't any explanation or warning about that);- it has some skillpoint grind to do for upgrading the garage;- instruments on the dashboard are just textures;- driving physics is simplified, it doesn't give a real feel of the vehicle.

												OK Red Dot Games, you finally made me write my first negative steam review. That´s something you should be proud of and I guess that you´ll get a steam achievement for being the most arrogant and ignorant developer 2015-2017.You´ve advertised that game with steam achievements and even had an example achiev on display when I bought it 2 years ago. Achievs have been listed in your ""work in progress"" list until you´ve recently erased that entry. You fraudulently mislead me and others and even started making fun of the guys still asking for achievs in the game forums.While developing and releasing a zillion DLC you completely ignored another big fraction in the community and didn´t find the time to add keybinds.The question wether those features are important is besides the point: You´ve promised the one thing and didn´t deliver and you could have easily helped players struggling with the UI with the other. You didn´t. Shame on you!			"

												This is a great step forward for the game compared to CMS2014. Massive improvements to graphics, tons more vehicle parts to work with, and a whole new approach to issuing missions makes this a major overhaul to what was already a pretty good game. Despite some worries about hardware, I've been running the game at 2560 x 1600 with maxed out settings and see a solid 60fps.The idea of having jobs issued by telephone, with the ability to pick and choose your workload, really works well for me. My son and I picked out a couple of interesting looking jobs, loaded them up on the lifts and started plugging away at the pile of problems. The whole process felt very smooth and intuitive. A nicely structured tutorial at the start (very simple, just a few text popups and some easy initial missions) helped greatly.It's still not as easy as I'd like to navigate around the inside of the vehicle, but since the real thing is even harder I can't complain.These guys have put out a great game, and they even managed to do it on-schedule. If they hit their published targets for DLC I'll be even more impressed.Right now their software is massively underpriced in the Steam store, there is no way this game should be priced so low, so jump onto it asap.

												This is really fun, a massive step forward from the previous game. I'd really recommend it to anyone who had gotten the older version of this game, and anyone else who is interested in a semi-realistic mechanic simulator like game. You can repair other peoples cars, you can go out and buy your own car and fix it up and then sell it, and the DLC (disclaimer: I don't know how many will be) is Free! How could anyone complain about that? Would i recommend it? Yes! Would i play it for days on end? Definitely.Does it have a lot of replayability? Not really, its very repetitive, but then again - so is the job itself in the real world, so i'd have to say that's just another level of realism. Lol.			"

												Firstly let me just say that I have been wrenching on actual cars, motorcycles and marine engines for many years and I truly enjoy it. I also have really enjoyed mechanic simulators in the past, Street Rod was a staple of my childhood.Secondly, If you're *really* into car mechanic simulation, buy this, when its on sale. This is better than Car Mechanic Simulator 2014, but still not a great game. If I had to use one word to describe this game, it would be Tedious. It takes a very, very long time to unlock the more enjoyable parts of the game (9000xp for the garage, are you kidding me??) You'll find yourself repeating the same monotonous, mind numbing jobs to build your xp before you can unlock things like the ""test track"" and the Garage, where you can store your own cars bought at auction. Speaking of which, the XP system leaves much to be desired and appears to have been thought up in 5 seconds with no play testing whatsoever. Remove a part? +1 XP. Install a part? +1 XP. Finish a job? 100XP. That's pretty much it. I guess you could get 9000XP by removing and installing the same spark plug 4500 times. Replacing a piston should generate orders of magnitude more xp than replacing an oil filter. You select the job you wish to take by clicking on your desk phone. It lists 4 jobs, 2 of which always require vastly more XP than you have. The interface can be painful to operate - Press I to open inventory.. but press Escape to close it? How about the parts catalog, which is listed in alphabetical order and does not have nearly enough subcategories. An alphabetical list for engine parts with photos is ridiculous. The repair bench is a button press. That's it. Remove part, attempt to repair, you'll either make it better or make it worse. Boring mechanic. There are definitely lots of parts in the engines, which is great, but the selection of which parts are 'wrenchable' and which are not seems completely arbitrary. Why are there 4 clips holding the airbox together, and like 4 bolts to the entire gearbox? Also please don't force the player to lift and drop the car a bunch of times to work on the engine... some parts are removable from the top, some from the bottom. Why can't I just remove the engine and put it on a test stand?I realize this review is a bit discombobulated, but then again so is this game. It just seems like a lot of values were randomly selected, and not much thought was put into vital gameplay mechanics and interface design. 5/10.Better games in this genre from years past:* Street Rod 1 / 2* Redline Legal Street Racing * Gearhead Garage			"

												I watched a gameplay video on Youtube for this game and it grabbed my attention instantly. I am a forty something nerd and geek and I enjoy anything to do with mechanics and technology and this simulator looked like the perfect thing for me, to the point that I even updated my desktop pc to handle the graphics.The game has not dissapointed, I am hooked. I haven't modded the game to increase my XP or money, I have worked through all the telephone jobs I needed so I could unlock everything and start my own car collection. Playing the game this way has shown a great balance of having to earn the money in order to collect the cars from the auction house and renovate them just as you would in real life.The future potential for this game is exciting, hopefully with a few more DLC licenced cars and maybe other vehicles, a track or two to drive around or being able to upgrade your vehicles with a full engine swap and tune, drive conversion, suspension upgrades, also adding bucket seats and a roll cage to create a perfect race or drift car.If a new kickstarter campaign was initiated for these additions I would certainly invest.......

												Far above and beyond CMS 2014.Still lacking a little in some areas but is constantly being improved by the Dev's.I could go into detail but I think plenty of other reviews have done a good job of that already.The game reminds me sort of like being a puzzle game in a sense.You're given a problem, such as 'there is a rattling noise in the engine;'And must find out the cause and remedy it.Which usually entails replacing a defective part, in my case with the rattling, it was the clutch bearing.The game starts off easing you in, allowing you to know which parts are needing replacement/repair and givingyou the option to highlight them as well.Later on however you won't know which parts are wrong but are giving hints. (""Steering is wobbly"")And you can put the car through various tests which can help you discover what's wrong.Drive the car on the Test Course and you might find out the suspension is bad.Use the OBD Scanner on the car and find out about any electrical problems.Etc.Later you can get into auctions and re-selling cars and stuff; but I won't go into detail there.(mostly cause I haven't reached that far myself yet lol)The bottom line, if you liked 2014, or somewhat liked it, get this game it's so much better.If you like the idea of mechanics but are on the fence.. I would recommend the game still however if youwant to be certain maybe watch some LP's on Youtube or something.			"

												I'm going to start off with that this isn't the best game in the world, nor should you ever expect it to be. That's not what this is about. However, my friend and I found that we absolutely could not stop playing this game for hours at a time. It may seem like it could get very repetitive but, giving both my friend and I are are car fanatics, it just seems like we could have enough hours under our belt by the time we get bored of the game, if that ever happens. It's your chance to build a shop at your own pace so you can customize your cars. Also, it's worth getting the gold edition, the DLC cars are great!			"

												the improvement from this game from the last game is quite honestly astounding, in the last game you could pretty much just do the basic stuff, this game you can quite literally strip the car down till it is just the body shell and rebuild it from the ground upthough if you buy a game for the ""story"" you wont get much here But this does indeed feel like a sequel to the last game first game you could only work on one car at a time, while this game you start the game and immediately have the ability to work on 3 cars at once using 2 car lifts, and juggle the cars around so you can have it on the lift if you need to replace running gear or have it on the floor when replacing or repairing the body panelsthe game at the moment is very stable and in my 30+hours playing at the point of this review i have not had it crash on me yetthough that being said the bar for entry is pretty high it is recommended that you have at least a basic idea of where the parts are as there is no real tutorial that for instance shows you where the wheel hubs goand once you get to the later part in the game when you can go to auctions and buy and repair cars then resell them is the time you really appreciate the amount of parts that are needed... especially if you plan on restoring a vintage V8 (there are two versions, one with overhead cams, and one with overhead valves) where you need to buy 16 push rods and 16 rocker arms all makes a pretty big dent into your bank accountalso in this game there is the customisation options, that you can ""purchase"" when you have got enough experience (you get experience for everything thing you remove and put back) and this can unlock diagnostics tools in addition to the OBD scanner of the last game, but also a multimeter and a compression tester, or ""efficiencies"" like the faster unbolting, faster removal or faster manual checking or options to customise your shop, also repairing makes a return, but unlike the last game repairing doesn't cost anything but it does have a percentage of success (you start at 40% chance and can upgrade it to a max of 90% chance) and you can if your lucky repair it to like new condition but run the risk of completely failing and ruining the part making it irreparablethen you look at the game and see with the amount of detail that they put into this game, the improvements to gameplay and a game that takes up just over 2GB  on the disk (probably be more when the DLC is released) well you wonder why some other games can't make this level of improvement as well, when you think about that 2014 was released the beginning of last year plus 3 DLC's for the game this game probably tool them 6 months to make, which like I said at the start is astounding "

												CMS 2015 is a fun game! It sports better graphics, a slicker interface, improved controls, a deeper career mode, and a better gameplay experience over 2014. In order to unlock additional content (i.e. slicker vehicles, shop improvements, and abilities) you'll have to turn the wrenches a lot longer in order to gain XP. This isn’t entirely a bad thing, as I feel it keeps you coming back for more. The jobs seem to be more varied in both, substance and tasks in order to get you through. However, you’ll see a lot of the same types of vehicles, early on, just in different colors. Despite that, I honestly can’t find much more to complain about. I think the devs did a pretty good job with this outing, and I look forward to seeing what they’ll add to it.			"

												Not the kind of thing I thought I'd enjoy but I picked it up anyway after seeing all the positive reviews. Then it took over my life for a few days. I've never been a big car person, but this game has me wanting to go take apart my actual car. The process of disassembling and reassembling vehicles feels really good and the game is pretty relaxing once you get past the learning curve.The music may not be for everyone but you can mute it and play something in the background. The gameplay does get repetitive after a few hours and isn't particularly deep once you figure it all out, but I got ~20 hours out of it so I'm happy with this purchase. Your mileage may vary.			"

												Have to say that Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is one of the few simulator games that actually does a good job, the graphics are great and runs smoothly even on high settings, have not encountered any bugs yet and is great fun to play.Pros:- Not encountered any bugs.- Active Developers.- Can customize Garage.- Can manage your own garage.- Great new test driving track.- Nice models and textures.- Nice background music while you tinker away with your cars.Cons:- Missing some key components from the cars such as fuel lines, brake lines, water hoses.- Small UI upgrade would be nice, selling/buying multiple parts can get a bit tedious.- Career mode could do with a couple more features such as business decisions, ranking and economy).Suggestions:- Could do with more cars, vans, pickups etc (Bikes?).- A bit more detail under the hood would be great wire, cables etc.- A bigger variety of engine types would be a huge bonus (petrol, diesel, hybrid).- The ability to upgrade your garage, as in starting from scratch and buying bigger property and equipment.- Being able to buy and add fuel lines, brake cables and water hoses to vehicles.- More customization options for vehicles such as:	- Size of alloy wheel	- Tyre sizes	- Full range of aftermarket exhaust systems/backboxes (varying shapes and sizes)	- Aftermarket air filters/ Induction kits.	- The ability to add turbo chargers and superchargers to cars.	- Adjustable ride height on suspension.	- Different paint types (metallic, matt, pastel, pearlescent).	- The ability to have engine parts chromed.	 - and finally different body styling modifications:		- Spoilers.		- Sideskirts.		- Hoods (carbon fibre, scoops, transparent etc)		- Window Tints.		- LED Lights.		- Variety of wing mirrors.		- Vented front fenders.- A couple of extra test tracks would be great also.Just some suggestions as food for thought though what you guys decide to do is obviously your choice along.

												TL;DR: All in all, a very enjoyable game for anyone, but especially for petrolheads. :-)I would recommend this game to any petrolhead/car fanatic out there. This is a very refreshing game, since it's the only one of it's kind that I know and it's very casual. For me, it's also a nice way to learn a bit more about the anatomy of cars  on top of the knowledge that I already have (and the fact that the game is translated to my native language also helps a lot, since I'm not too familiar with the English names for various parts). That's probably the downside, you'll need some basic car mechanics knowledge to get going. The tutorial isn't really all that explanatory, so if you're not familiar with the basics, it could take you quite some time to figure out what parts you actually need to replace and that can be frustrating.But, if you have some basic knowledge you should be fine. You can pretty much pull apart anything until there's just a skeleton standing. That's what makes the game so cool, there are no limits in what you can and cannot do. There are no set time limits for repairs, so if you feel like completely disecting a car, go ahead and do it!The XP points system keeps the game challenging. You need to unlock certain features to make your life as a mechanic easier like an OBD scanner to read the on board computer for any errors or better tools to be able to take out screws more quickly. The more XP you get, the more challenging jobs you can accept. And with more XP also come sweeter cars, since when you've built up a name for yourself, people with luxury cars also start finding their way to your garage.			"

												read reviews first thinking it was worse than gearhead garage and the people don't know what the hell they talk about. It's better and could use refining like more parts but I will wait and see the next cm17. Get game if you like gearhead garage and grind and work your way up to 9000xp I am still working and look at how many hours I got into game. Devs do need to keep fanbase and I would love to see cm17 and play it before it comes out!!! I am getting my diesel degree and got this since the truck mechanic was off about everything that a diesel comes with. So I will steer clear of that.			"

												TL;DR: All in all, a very enjoyable game for anyone, but especially for petrolheads. :-)I would recommend this game to any petrolhead/car fanatic out there. This is a very refreshing game, since it's the only one of it's kind that I know and it's very casual. For me, it's also a nice way to learn a bit more about the anatomy of cars  on top of the knowledge that I already have (and the fact that the game is translated to my native language also helps a lot, since I'm not too familiar with the English names for various parts). That's probably the downside, you'll need some basic car mechanics knowledge to get going. The tutorial isn't really all that explanatory, so if you're not familiar with the basics, it could take you quite some time to figure out what parts you actually need to replace and that can be frustrating.But, if you have some basic knowledge you should be fine. You can pretty much pull apart anything until there's just a skeleton standing. That's what makes the game so cool, there are no limits in what you can and cannot do. There are no set time limits for repairs, so if you feel like completely disecting a car, go ahead and do it!The XP points system keeps the game challenging. You need to unlock certain features to make your life as a mechanic easier like an OBD scanner to read the on board computer for any errors or better tools to be able to take out screws more quickly. The more XP you get, the more challenging jobs you can accept. And with more XP also come sweeter cars, since when you've built up a name for yourself, people with luxury cars also start finding their way to your garage.			"

												If you're a person who loves spending time fixing♥♥♥♥♥♥that has a million pieces and slowly learning the easiest way to said♥♥♥♥♥♥with each job through experience, then buy this♥♥♥♥♥♥right now. Easily among the best games I've ever played. Hard grind, decent sense of pacing as well as the ability to set your own goals instead of a clearly defined ""end game."" Great♥♥♥♥♥♥ although the DLC pricing and whatnot is a bit weird, so I suggest getting the Gold edition for a better experience at a cheaper price. Normally I wouldn't suggest paying for DLC but I feel as if the devs deserve it this time around.One more thing: the game is perfect for people who don't know♥♥♥♥♥♥about cars such as myself, but I couldn't suggest it for people who don't find repairing♥♥♥♥♥♥and learning about a machine enjoyable. This is a certain type of game for a certain type of people. But if you have any sort of interest when it comes to anything involving cars, then I fully suggest getting this game.Easy 9/10, only thing that would put it over the top is simply adding more content. There's a ♥♥♥♥ton of places you can take this concept and I feel as if the devs adding as much as humanly possible would in the end make it a perfect game, and I don't think I could say that about any other game.

												Very good game. Probably the only game in which i have a higher FPS in the game than i do in the menu. Very good game, simple and easy to learn. As a real life training mechanic it is fairly realistic but obviously its been made a lot easier and appealing than in reality (and a lot less painful lol). Very good game, would reccomend.			"

												Hours Logged - 44Okay so I promised myself that'd write an honest review of this game, but only after logging a fair few number hours in order to sure what I was writing is accurate.The game is a vast improvement on the 2014, more polished, more complicated (Love stripping an engine to find a mystery fault), and a lot more room for potential.I've logged 44 hours for this game and I'm not even bored, in fact I'm actually finding myself getting more enthralled due to the auction system, and the refurb jobs I currently have in the parking garage.So in summary:Pros:-- The game will always keep you guessing, even after you have got all the add on's for the garage.- The auction is brilliant, nothing more satisfying than buying a wreck and doing it up.- The cars you work on well rendered and have actual real world issues.- The test track is worth its weight in gold.Cons:-- The game needs more depth in regards to cars available.- I've got an over abundance of XP points and nothing to spend them on.- More DLC as the Youngtimer pack introduced what seems to be a Fiat 500.- The garage itself needs to be open to change, maybe allowing us to move stuff around.So in conclusion, this game is good but needs a little more refinement to make it great.4 out of 5JB			"

												Good step up from 2014, some nice featers like 2 car lifts, better test track and an auction house where you can bid on cars you restore, even has a parking garage for I think 12 cars, I have six waiting to restore then sell on.  The missions are better, seems to make you work more.  Overall good fun.The only down side is the cars, well lack of cars.  There are 14 and they are not great, never even heard of them until now, think they all polish.  Guess Ford, Nissan and the rest did not want us gamers mucking around with there cars.  Also it seems to many items fit all rhe cars like only a single type of park plug, brake pad, brake calipar, clutch parts, even the drive axle is the same for all rear wheel drive cars.Another little bug bear of mine is hardly any cables or tubes, a few but even large tubes that would join the air filter to carbs are missing, this lets things like the air box, battery seem they are just floating in mid air being not joined to anything.  Was hoping this version of the game would have had more detail at all levels.  Its just odd that clips hold the air filter box on yet the exhaust parts just plop on and off with a mouse click, nothing to unbolt.  Just seems things have been left out as they did not have time to do them and you can see this with some items, as an example, there are three types of oil filters then on the other hand only one type of fuel filter and only one type of battery, the list goes on.Overall I am happy with this version for the cost, I just hope they spend less time in the pub and more time rendering 3d models to add to this game, even if they just changed the colour of similar items (they did with the oil filters) to make it seem there is a lot more to choose from would go a long way.

												I liked the first car mechanic simulator (2014) but mostly gave up on it pretty early due to not being comfortable with both the interface and how the camera worked in-game. I'm happy to say this years version is just so much better. I've been playing for hours now (ignore the low hours played stat - Steam was down earlier so I played in offline mode) and it's a very entertaining game. Improvements such as the multiple bays, car auctions, upgrade paths - among many others - just make it a more complete game and I am very happy that I backed it on Kickstarter from the start.I'm only around 15 jobs in and the difficulty has been going up steadily in terms of type of repairs that I'm now being tasked with but - and this is a big but (ahem) - you're left to play the game at your own pace which is perfectly suited for this type of game. I'm having a blast playing this and can't wait to see the later parts of the game once I unlock them.For the price of £14.99 this game is a steal if you have any kind of interest at all in the basic workings of motor vehicles but I wouldn't expect to become a fully-fledged mechanic after putting a few hours into this. Although, having said that,  it's very likely your basic car knowledge of what parts go where will improve dramatically. I used to work in the automotive industry but in the administration side so this game appealed to me for that reason as well.As a comparison the nearest thing I can compare CM2015 to is the ancient Gearhead Garage that Snap-on bought out many, many years ago that was a fun, albeit simple, game repairing and doing up cars to flip at auction and make money. I'm hoping this game further in will vastly improve on that little gem from way back.Highly recommended. Well done to the developers.			"

			What was the owner doing?!? An interesting job replacing 2 pistons and a turbocharger! Steam Store Link for Car Mechanic Simulator 2015: http://store.steampowered.com/app/320300/		

Farming Simulator, Bus Simulator, Construction Simulator, Grass Simulator, Goat SimulatorThere has been a lot of crappy simulator titles filling the steam store page over the last couple of years, but I was quite surprised last year with coming across Car Mechanic Simulator 2014.The Development Team at Play Way and Red Dot Games were really interested in a lot of the community feedback on the forums and wanted to implement a lot of their ideas by working on either DLC or an update to the game for the fansDue to funding requirements, they reached out to the community on kickstarter, where they did finally get funding to complete Car Mechanic Simulator 2015I was one of those backers and am very happy with how it has turned out!The production value is definately a large increase on the previous 2014 title witha lot of polish put into the game.Each car part is lovingly crafted with a beautiful attention to detail.Even without switching into the Part Examine Mode, you can tell which parts are severely warn by the amount of wear or rust tarnish on the part.In examine mode, most parts can be visually inspected without requiring the advanced tools needed, but in the case of Electrical Parts, you will need to purchase the diagnostic tool to be able to check or repair the parts.Later on in the game, you can also purchase a paint bake house and perform panel work as well as a testing line to assist in finding where that annoying little rattle is coming from.It starts you off in your Garage with the phone ringing to inform that a new job is available Selecting the phone gives you a list of availalble jobs, being able to accept or decline as you see fit.So Grab your Imperial Shifter Spanners, Left Handed Screwdrivers and attach your silencer to your rattle gun! It's time to get busy!Most of the initial starting jobs are simple tasks with parts lists or problem information attached. Like replacing filters, brake pads, Suspension Bushes, wheels and oil. Moving up to the more advanced areas like replacing Turbochargers, Pistons, Muffler Bearings, Crankshafts, Bottles of Boost and Timing Gear.The workshop is fitted with 2 Hoists and a central area, giving you the room to work on a couple of cars at the same time. This also allows access to other areas of the car as there is only so much you are able to do from the top of the engine bay.Repairing Cars are the main focus of making money, but you can also sell the old parts that were replaced for a little extra money. Once progressed far enough in the game, you have the ability to go to market and buy cars for your own overhauls and sell them at auction. A fantastic distraction on the side of increasingly difficult fault finding and part replacement.If you have ever been interested in cars, mechanics or even wonder how they all fit together this is a fantastic sim to get you into and learning all about the ins and outs of engines and suspension.And Maybe, Just Maybe, you might also realise that a few parts I mentioned don't really exist.

												It's fun for the first hours, then it gets very repetitive and there is no challenge here, besides finding the rusted parts and replacing by shiny ones. Your money has no purpose, you almost can't assemble the parts out of order by mistake (at least on normal difficulty), if you know how to fix one car, you know how to fix them all, you can't expand your business nor your garage AFAIK...Oh, so much potential. Such a disappointment. It gets pretty boring after sometime. It's a puzzle game with cars, but very limited and all looks more of the same. I'm glad I got this in a cheap bundle.			"

												This game is way more fun than it deserves to be. That is a good thing.Will you learn how to repair a real car? No. But it will give you a rough approximation of where certain parts are located in a car and a general idea of what they could look like. It's essentially a puzzle game. You are told the car has a noise in the engine, you need to find and repair the specific part. As you play you gain access to more testing tools so you can check the current durability of items without needing to fully disassemble the vehicle. But let's face it, eventually you will fully disassemble a vehicle for the fun of it, because you can.			"

I was on the fence about this game since it seems like a lot of new content is DLC, but here's hoping they can provide some nice free stuff in future updates (here's looking at you devs!)Couple of thoughts in just about an hour of play.  Wish I could re-bind keys.  Also, the camera angles while in (dis)assemble mode are a bit rough to get used to.  I wouldn't mind maybe a 'free roam' while in those modes instead of clicking a part to get closer to the view you actualy want!			"

It's not so true to life that you would be able to do major work on your own car with only this game as education, but you would learn which parts are which and generally where to find them.There are many other reviews that do this game more justice than mine, but I wanted to record my ""yes"" vote anyway.

For someone who enjoys working/learning about cars or enjoys simulators in general, this game is great for you; It's addictive, educational and fun. Totally work the price tag.			"

												This is a huge improvement over Car Mechanic Simulator 2014.  I've owned it for only one week and have 32 hours on the game already (work full time, long commute, activities on the weekends).If you like to take things apart and build things, or like cars in general, you should check this game out.  It's not so true to life that you would be able to do major work on your own car with only this game as education, but you would learn which parts are which and generally where to find them.There are many other reviews that do this game more justice than mine, but I wanted to record my ""yes"" vote anyway.

Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 ReviewCar Mechanic Simulator 2015 gives those unfamiliar with cars to familiarise themselves with the subject, but quickly runs out of fun.GameplayCar Mechanic Simulator is an immersive experience for the player, taking in account many important details to fixing cars.  Going into this game, I was expecting to be able to fix some sports cars or exotic vehicles, perhaps tuned ones.  Unfortunately, the game has a major issue with pacing.  I've fixed several cars already and still I've been limited to not only fictional, but very mundane and ""nomal, uninteresting"" cars.  I do have the maserati DLC but it took forever to unlock and from what I know, the Masterati's are the only true-to-life brand available to the player.  Despite my complaints towards the game's pacing, I have great respect for the amount of content and detail that the developer has been able to jam into this little game.  The player is able to take each vehicle out for a test drive, before and after mending them.  Each problematic or faulty component is conveniently highlighted in red and are usually very easy to spot.  Although CMS'15 lacks a rich tutorial, it makes up for it as the game is easy to pick up but difficult to master.  The goal of the player is not to simply complete each contract, but also to master the game and learn the car's components and their connection to performance.All in all, though CMS'15 isn't too much fun, it's definitely a rich learning experience and as a motorhead, I enjoyed learning more about the design of cars through the use of a car mechanic simulator.Pros+Immersive+Extraordinary detail+Enjoyable and forgiving learning curve+Very educational+Great visualsCons-Incredibly slow pacing-Fictional vehicles (understandable)-Tedious at timesRating: 7/10This review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games.

												Purchased this game just out of the blue & because I had left over money in my steam wallet & I haven't stopped playing it ever since. It's truly and addictive and great game; Attending school to become an automotive technician (mechanic), this game goes somewhat deep into the components of an engine (Engine parts, assembling/disassembling) and components of a vehicle as a whole. For someone who enjoys working/learning about cars or enjoys simulators in general, this game is great for you; It's addictive, educational and fun. Totally work the price tag.			"

												As an automotive engineer, I wanted to expand my knowledge to knowing how to repair all parts of a car. While Car Mechanic Simulator is a nice tool for learning part locations, that's kind of where it stops. There's really nothing more than just replacing rusty parts with new parts. 90% of the game is screwing and unscrewing. Nonetheless a nice relaxing game that's good for remembering part names and locations and seeing in a nice 3D world how parts all fit together.			"

												Good but a bit repetitive - Another relaxing game if you like to have something else to do while you watch TV or listen to the radio/podcasts in the background. Essentially, you're given a few different 3D jigsaw puzzles which have to take apart, find out which parts are broken (which appear corroded for some reason), replace/repair said parts, and put them back together again (the game shows you where they go). Optionally, you can perform diagnostic tests on vehicles to make finding broken parts easier, rather than find out for yourself by removing them from vehicles - But I think that also takes away the tiny ammount of challenge that this game has to offer.It also has XP and Levels to lengthen the content. Earn XP by completing repair jobs on vehicles, and unlock different cars, perks (more diagonstic tools, faster unbolting) and more complex jobs.There's not a lot to this game and it doesn't demand much of your attention once you've learned the basics, although it's nicely animated and does a good job at showing the very basics of car anatomy. You probably won't learn more than that from playing it, though. It's not an educational tool, if you're expecting it to be one.			"

												Learn something and have fun at the same timeNot really as detailed as the real thing, but it will give you a general idea what it means to be a mechanic and how various basic things in and around the car work and what they names are and later you will learn from this game how to make basic diagnostic, these things can be useful now or in the future for you if you have no clue about cars and parts.Very well made learning game and its fun, as a former car mechanic I really enjoy this game and can only recommend it, its very relaxingI wish the game would go into more detail, but that would be very complicated for many peopleI have all DLCs and even tho most are not really worth the full price, but thanks to the support from players the game is improving and adding new features			"

												""Simulation"" is perhaps a misnomer, but this game is still a lot of fun.  The vehicles are varied, but there isn't much variance in the engines, suspensions, or braking systems.  There are what I would call ""factual errors""; i.e., cars apparently built in the 60s or even 50s having front disc brakes and electric fuel pumps located in the fuel tank.  A nice addition would be the inclusion of a ""Hard"" mode, where the player must use a specific bolt pattern to remove and replace cylinder heads, remove leftover gasket material, and deal with fluids like coolant and oil when changing timing chains.  7/10			"

												There's something like mindfulness about taking apart a piece of engineering and putting it back together.A full-bodied simulator true to the name, very engaging. In some orders you don't get a list of what needs fixing and you need to run diagnostics, test drive the car, or just take it apart and look, to find what you need to replace.Recommended to anyone who's mechanically inclined, and even if you're not, you will probably find enjoyment in its presentation and gameplay.

I came accross CMS 2014 in a Steam Sale, and they were having a crowdfunding campaign at the time, so I chipped in, and I think it's defintley worth the price on Steam.  If you like the kinds of games that I've mentioned, CMS 2015 will be a great addition to your library...especially if you have any ounce of oil in your blood!			"

												For the asking price, the game has quite a bit to offer. Also once modding is in place, it will be even more worth it as you'll be able to just download new cars for your shop. It's a bit slow paced at first, but once you get your upgrades it's not too bad. If you ever played a game called ""Gearhead Garage"" and you're hoping this is something like it, it's that and then some.I also contacted the developer on twitter and they stated they're interested in adding more tracks to the game for driving your cars on, as well as race modes like drag racing through DLC. If they keep to that promise, this game will have no issues selling tons of copies.Hopefully for 2016 they bring in co-op and even more content, considering you can't really work on 3 cars at once, it would help a lot.

												After playing Gearhead Garage for years and years (the mods really added to the replay value) this game came up on my radar. Of course I was sold at the very moment I saw it. When I got it and played it for a couple of hours I already noticed that I missed certain thing in comparison with Gearhead. After giving it more time, it quickly lost it's ""magic"". With Gearhead released so many years earlier and it being an example where the developers could (and should) have looked at, Car mechanic Simulator comes over as a watered-down version (in every aspect) of gearhead. All the DLC is not helping.I often find myself booting up gearhead garage where it should/could have been Car Mechanic Simulator; this says enough in my opinion.Don't get me wrong: it was fun for a bit, but it just didn't last.I'd like to rate it neutral instead of positive or negative, but when I have to choose, I'm afraid I'll have to rate it a thumbs down.

												This game DOES go on sale quite a bit, so definitely pick up while that's going on if you're thinking about getting it. For under $10, it's a decent buy. I definitely would not buy for $20 though. At the same time that this game improves upon a lot of the downfalls of CMS 2014, it still lacks a way to stop the mind-numbing process involved in getting to the good content of the game.  After playing for two hours, I'm still grinding through basic jobs in hopes of eventually getting to actually work on my own cars.I'd say the music has improved but still is an extremely repetitive playlist. They can't be more than 20 minutes long, if not less. **UPDATE** One new song was added since I wrote this. Probably a 25 minute playlist now. You're better off muting the game music and playing your own.If you haven't played CMS 2014, then it will be more likely that you enjoy this game since you won't notice how little it has really changed. It has definitely gotten better since then, but I think that maybe some more time developing should have been used.Basically, I really think that this game still needs work; but it looks like the developers are really looking for support from the community to do so gradually. That's fine. While it definitely is a finished product, some aspects of it just look very cheap. Don't get me wrong, I think this is a very good game. Not to mention it's pretty much the only mechanic sim out there right now. It's just that I feel like it still falls short of being a great game. It's almost feels like I bought an early access game without the label on it.I don't want to say this about the game because I know that the developers have worked very hard for this, but I really wouldn't be able to pass off pretending to fix virtual cars as a fun activity to anyone.  You're really better off watching informational videos on YouTube on how to perform the tasks you'd be doing in the game and maybe practicing on a real car than playing this game. Although it may feel like it has some educational value, you don't really need more than basic car knowledge to get these jobs done. Let's be real.I really don't agree with how little experience points you get from jobs that require you to diagnose several different systems and repair them. To even be able to access all of the new features of the game, you need to get a parking garage which costs 9000 XP. Over 20 jobs later, I'm only at 4000 XP. At least there's a bigger variety of problems to fix, unlike CMS 2014, but it's still just wayyyy too much. Why isn't the garage paid with money instead of experience anyway?All this aside, the game gets good support and still has updates and DLC coming, so there's hope all of this gets fixed eventually.

												I'm not a car person at all. I've never owned a car. I've no interest in repairing them. So when I picked up Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 as part of a Humble Bundle, I wasn't sure I was ever going to play it at all.Turns out, the game is rather fabulously meditative. It's relaxing in that at no point in the game did I feel I had to make hard decisions or was in crisis. Cars may look different under the hood, but you know with removing and inspecting enough parts you'll find the problem. When I want something I can pick up and put down, and which is going to let me unwind, Car Mechanic Sim 2015 turns out to be pretty darn good.I'm playing under Linux, and the game works flawlessly under wine. Platinum status, everything works, 60fps, no effort to get set up. Plus the developer is very responsive in answering questions, and updates seem to be frequent.My biggest tip for new and existing players alike is that when ordering parts on your in-game computer or tablet, don't ignore the ""search"" bar. It's a huge timesaver and save oodles of scrolling.			"

												So far, this is my favorite game of 2015. It expands on everything it did in the first installment, while also not deviating too far from its original style. For the hardcore car mechanics out there, this game is more for you than CMS 2014. It legitimately has the level of detail that can be beneficial to guys who already know what they're doing. To those who don't know a lot about cars, get this game and read some guides about what you're looking at and CMS could legitimatly teach you some things. This developer has it together and I am looking forward to even greater levels of depth in the future with the already amazing build system they have in place.			"

												This game is super cool. First auto simulator for me. I own a broken down cool car of yesteryear. I have done some work on it and found it to be very satisfying. To get more into cars and increase my knowhow, I have been watching Youtube car repair channels. In one of the channels, the presenter mentioned this game so I gave it a shot. This game is awesome! Granted I like cars to start with, but I think that anyone with even slight mechanical inclinations would enjoy this game. Pros: figure out where all the parts are; learn how to do a brake job; learn spark plug replacement; get to see how different cars are built (worked on I4 SOHC, I4 DOHC, and then a two cylinder air-cooled rear engined buggy clone) attractive graphics; realistic without getting your hands dirty; good gameplay. Cons: music tracks are good but are few in number; only two hours in but I haven't yet dealt with electrical items; may get repetitive if you do not like cars. I am two hours into this game and I love it. Worth every last cent of the twenty buck price.			"

												I have a love-hate relationship with this game.I like taking cars apart and putting them back together. That by itself is quite addictive and has resulted in me spending many hours in this game. The graphics for the most part are also nice, if a bit dated.Unfortunately I dislike pretty much everything else about this game.First off, the tutorial and controls are awful. There are a lot of little details to playing the game that are not communicated to the player, and I had to resort to searching online to find out some very basic information on how to play.Next, once you get past the different exteriors, you'll find that there are only really four types of cars. I4 FWD, I4 RWD, old V8 RWD, and new V8 RWD. The parts are extremely generic and many of them are interchangeable between all of the cars.Buying replacement parts is quite annoying. You have to remember exactly which part you need, and many of the parts have very similar nondescript names (clip a , clip b, timing belt (V8), etc) so it's relatively easy to buy the wrong part and waste money. Until you spend your XP on the tablet upgrade, you have to run back and forth between the car and the desk PC to get parts.Game progression is tedious and annoying. You get 1 XP for taking a part off, putting it back on, or fixing it. This is true whether the part is an air filter clip or a gearbox. Fixing parts is annoying since you have an arbitrary chance to break it. Once a part is broken, regardless of its initial condition, it is now useless junk. Extremely annoying when said part is an expensive engine block in good condition that just needs a little polishing.Every 1000XP you earn an upgrade point. The game provides no guidance on what's actually useful. There are two upgrade categories: time saving tools and useless, disappointing cosmetic upgrades for the shop. Don't waste your points on the appearance upgrades, all they are is a handful of different colors for the indicated item. There are two critical shop upgrades you'll need to progress in the game: the paint shop and the top level of repair tools to repaint cars and fix car bodies respectively. Everything else is just a timesaver.Once you do get to the endgame of buying and restoring cars, you'll have to endure the supremely annoying car auction. This game managed to capture the annoyance of buying cars at an auction where there's always someone bidding you up so you end up paying 2 or 3 times (or more!) the starting bid for a car. After restoring a car, there's really not much you can do with it. You can put it in your garage and look at it, or take it to the underwhelming drag strip. All you can really do at the strip is endlessly race yourself. It doesn't help that the driving mechanics feel like an afterthought and the graphics on the drag strip are significantly worse than the rest of the game.This game has ridiculous loading times even on a fast PC with a SSD. I don't know what the devs did wrong, but it takes over a minute to load the shop and scene changes are equally slow.The DLC is the thing I hate most about this game. It appears that the devs removed some core features from the game to sell later as DLC. If you own all the DLC it would likely address the endgame and variety issues and add some much needed part swapping mechanics, but the fact that it is being sold as DLC and not included in the base game is unforgiveable. The base game is rough and unfinished and needs some TLC, but the devs are more interested in churning out more DLC packs. I get that they need money, but finish the base game first before tacking on DLC.Overall, while the core gameplay is addictive, when you take a step back and look at game as a whole, there's really nothing worthwhile here there other than that core sandbox.

												This game is way better than I thought it was going to be. It actually feels like your running your own little shop. Doing small jobs that pay good money. Eventually getting harder and harder but the money paid out is well worth it. I was blown away on how pretty this game is. The graphics are amazing! I'm 15 hours in, and enjoying every minute of it. Very cool game with a very upbeat soundtrack. The only flaws are the camera can get a little annoying at times and the music loops a lot. I give this awesomely made game a 9/10 and would highly recommend buying it.			"

Right now I would give this game 8/10, however it has the potential to be a 9.			"

												I have played both of the car mechanic simulators, and I have to say, this one is better in every single way. And you can't ever complete this one, because jobs are unlimited and randomly generated. This game is very addictive, and it feels a lot like euro truck simulator 2 but with fixing cars instead of delivering cargo. This is not one of those crappy simulators you usually see on steam, this is amazing like euro truck simulator 2. Also, you can modify the colors of your workshop, buy attachments like a paint shop, a test area and a parking garage where you can store your car collection. You gain exp from working on cars, and with it, you unlock more cars with more problems to work on, more attachments to buy for your workshop, and you get upgrade points to upgrade your character, and to get tools to help you identify problems with cars. There's a lot more cars in this one than in 2014, and they are much more detailed with much more parts. This time you can work on the cooling system, open up the engine block and replace pistons or the crankshaft and the crankshaft bearings and everything. This game has insane amounts of detail, and the graphics and textures are mind blowing. The reflections are also really nice. The game also runs really smooth, and you don't even need the recommended graphics card if you want to run the game on Ultra graphics settings. I run it on Ultra very smoothly with my GTX 560 TI 2GB Phantom graphics card, so yeah. I honestly have never seen such gorgeous textures and reflections in a game before.  Well, Gta V has nice reflections, but still, this game is gorgeous too. In this game you can not only work on the parts of your car, but also on the panels, like doors, fenders, bumpers, lights, etc. Also, this game has tons of free DLC coming out, and they look like they will be amazing! The game's soundtrack is pretty cool too, even though I'm not really a fan of dubstep, I enjoy the game's dubstep soundtrack. It gets repetitive after a while though, because there's not a lot of songs in the game. I would like it a lot if they add more songs, and perhaps also a custom radio thing where you use your own music for the game's playlist. At the moment when I feel like using my own music, I turn off the game's soundtrack in the options menu, and run my playlist in the background, but I think it would be awesome if they added an in-game feature to use your own music, so you don't have to turn off music in the options each time you want to listen to something else. This game is also well worth the $20, and I highly recommend you buy it!			"

												If every now and then, you like to get your hands dirty mechanically, but just don't have the opportunity. Then this can work as a quick fix (though not always). Mechanically pretty accurate, though obviously simplified in some aspects. If you don't know anything about cars, this will definitely help you understand suspension and engines a bit better. Being an Electrical Engineer, I think it would be great if they did an electrical and electronic expansion or something.			"

												Usually when I see Simulator in the title of game I avoid the game like the plague!  More often than not, the classification of ""Simulator"" is abused and misused by developers hoping to cash in on a weak Genre with very few good games. I am very pleased to say there's actually a game in here! This does not play like an early access game. It feel more like a finished game they keep adding stuff to, and I personally love it. However would I title it a ""Simulator""? That's a bit of a stretch. But overall, it's still a nice game. I have very few complaints about the game, mostly with some of the odd steps you must take to complete a job, like completly removing the exhaust manifold to remove the front exhaust pipe for example or your HAVE to remove the Starter from the top, not the bottom (on some cars). Also the total lack of gaskets in the game is perplexing, this is a simulator - where are the gaskets? But overall I would recommend this game to car lovers, mechanics, and simulator players. There's game to be had here!!Things I would like to see added before final release:Ability to fix body partsAir wrench upgrade option.GasketsOption on/off for auto mouse movement (game moves mouse at certain stages and get confusing)Customization items for car parts - UPDATE - Feature added to game but as a freaking pre-release DLC, thanks for showing your love for your supporters (sarcasm). It's a sad sad day when Alphas get Alpha DLCs. Pickups (there are no pickups in game) - UPDATE DLC ADDONTire options - UPDATE DLC ADDON UPDATE: 6/26/16Came back to check up on this title.. looks like they added a few of my wishes to the game.. but.. yep, as ♥♥♥♥ing DLC. Come on guys! ♥♥♥♥.			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 isn't an expensive DLC for the previous game. It's a big, standalone product with lots of interesting changes that diversify the gameplay and eliminate the feeling of being shown what to do at specific times. We get many new parts and cars, and a sensible experience system smoothly introduces the player to new things. And even if there's still some boredom here and there, the sequel looks just fine.			"

The Gameplay makes lot of fun and its easy get in fast and upgrade your garage until you are able to buy and sell your own cars. The only thing i am missing quite strong is the possibility to upgrade / pimp the engine of course or body parts.As future addons i wish i can have a bigger test circuit or race track  and some more custom options.The amount of different cars is quite okay but can improve over time. The Price for this Game is very  okay as long the addons dont cost extra.			"

												Not as good as it should have been. The game is super grindy and has no real end-game. CMS14 had persistant customers and tuning that wasn't behind a paywall. My customers would wreck their cars or come back for additional work. In CMS15 all of the jobs are randomized. None of them make any sense. No one comes in for a set of front brakes, just one caliper, one set of pads, and a rear drum. Broken crankshaft, but everything else in the engine is fine. For some reason oil is simulated (like in CMS14), but coolant and gear oil are (still) not. The grind to unlock the parking lot to start buying auction cars is real, and you can't make real money with the auction cars until you have all 9 ranks of tool upgrades. At that point, the only thing to earn more money for is more spots to park cars that you can't tune or upgrade without shelling out more real $$ money.The models are a lot nicer than in CMS14, but the gameplay has gotten worse, and the DLC Simulator is real. Avoid this one and future titles.			"

Now if only they could bring us back to that feeling,the auction mode,the fun it gave us.Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 has already done just that for me.I have only played for about 2 hours and what took about 5 minutes to fix a engine repair now can take upto 15 minutes becuase of the more realistic detail.I haven't got to the auction section yet because I haven't leveled up enough yet.Yep,you have xp for your mechanic to level up and unlock different tools and perks for your mechanic and it feels very balanced in the way that you have actually earned it.I would gladly pay more than $20 for this game since thre is already 5 dlcs planned and modding ability.This game is a must buy if you liked CMS 2014 or a Gearhead Garage fan,you don't want to miss this game:)			"

												Honestly the only way I can think to make this game any better is to add realistic sound effects and mechanic actions. I want to hear the painful shattering of knuckles hitting steel by accident and the curses spewing from my tobacco filled mouth out of pure anger and agony. Another thing that I think needs to be added in conjunction with the afore mentioned agony is having the option to throw your tools in anger damaging the vehicle in the process only adding to the pain. Also there should be a frustration meter that runs all the time that rises from things like your wife calling to talk about something you don’t care about at the time, or ever. With these features missing I would have to give this game a, 9 out of 10. Just needs a little touch of true mechanic life.			"

												I'm going to start off with that this isn't the best game in the world, nor should you ever expect it to be. That's not what this is about. However, my friend and I found that we absolutely could not stop playing this game for hours at a time. It may seem like it could get very repetitive but, giving both my friend and I are are car fanatics, it just seems like we could have enough hours under our belt by the time we get bored of the game, if that ever happens. It's your chance to build a shop at your own pace so you can customize your cars. Also, it's worth getting the gold edition, the DLC cars are great!			"

												Some major points.I can say for certain the core gameplay is pretty decent. Informative for someone like me who only knows a few part names and has made few repairs on their car. There are a number of additions that i feel should defintely be included though. More fluids, electronics repair, part descriptions, better damage indicators rather than generic rust, and just listening to engine sounds to diagnose problems quicker - to name a few. This isnt a simulator, rather a collection of minigames based on the reality of auto mechanics.The progression and experience earning rate is dreadfully slow, though. It does feel like hours before i got to my first 1000 Xp and chose my first measly upgrade. Load times are pretty merciless. I really wish they would focus on smoothing it out rather than other features.Most importantly though; the DLC. Why on Earth would you release a ""Gold""/complete version of this game that collects all of the downloadable content if you're gonna release another new dlc pack after, separately?? That's total lack of respect for your customers. I cant see why they wouldnt include it in an update, at least for those have the Gold version like me.This is an ethics issue that i cant forgive them for. I can praise the simple repair aspect of the game but i wouldnt recommend this on a account of poor professionalism from the developer.			"

												Would not recommend for the following reasons:- Totally lacking in challenge. You cannot assemble parts in the wrong order, you cannot return an incomplete car to a customer and money was never a constraint.- Very simplistic. Engine components are absent for simplicities sake. Once you've played the game a bit even the most complicated tasks take under 15 minutes. Broken components are identified by their heavy amount of rust (even on brand new vehicles).- After a few hours of gameplay the game becomes very repetitive.- Way too much part crossover. SUV, sports car, sedan all share 80%+ the same parts.I continued to play after I stopped enjoying it as I was hoping that buying cars in auction & restoring them to build a garage would be fun. I turned out to be even more tedious than the early game as EVERYTHING is damaged on every car. Why not just sell the body then if you have to strip everything every time anyways?The best way to fix this game would be to add some proper variety. Working on the ""youngtimer"" DLC that comes with the game shows what good DLC could do. The parts are entirely unique and vehicle assembly is different from every other car.The problem is the cost of DLC, it would be another $35 to add content that needs to already be in this game to recommend. I would suggest waiting until an ""ultimate/complete edition"" packages the game with all DLC for a reasonable price.			"

												Simply put... no, I do not recommend this game.The game itself is not bad. Let's talk about the developers instead.The developers are pretty terrible. The game is lacking in substance, and instead forces the player to be fairly repetitive, and the developers arent... developing the game. The game gets updated maybe every 2 months, but nothing seriously important is ever added. These developers would rather spend these two months pumping out DLC than adding to their own game. Features they have even promised months ago have yet to appear. The game isnt bad, and in the hands of a developer that would rather create a functioning game than DLC riddled trash, it would be a good game. "

												Previously being a mechanic this game is highly accurate to a degree, a big step up from 2014 was the ability to completely rebuild an engine, while building the engine in car is more of an easy approach I recommend they have a system for the next game where you can pre build the engine before installing it, it would be much easier and save you all the hassle of constantly going up and down, to pull the heads off, main caps and then finally getting the pistons out. While the systems and jobs are quite accurate and in depth I think they could have implemented more diagnostic tools, the scan tool is a cool tool but if they could implement a fully functioning scan tool where you can look up and clear DTCS I think that would produce a whole new level of experience in the game for experienced players. After pretty much going through the whole game in expert mode its a fun challenge that keeps you glued to the screen. Overall a great game for what it is, and has a lot of potential.			"

												After the first few cars that come into your shop for repair, you've got the concept down. After you unlock a few of the basic skill unlocks, there's nothing you can't really solve. After you're able to buy cars at auction, that's it. You've reached the end game. By that point you're stripping cars down to bare metal and replacing them piece by piece, car after car, making unneeded profit on a hugely routine exercise. There's no real change except for which cars you choose to restore, and sell. The money will never go towards anything but buying and restoring more cars. After you've done one or two, you've even unlocked all the points you need for the garage visual updates, and will have points to spare that you don't need. Buy car, fix, sell, repeat forever.And so, I recommend this game. Which feels weird to me.It's super repetetive. The DLC is kinda nice and not stupid-expensive, but doesn't add enough to be a game changer. Even the recent addition of Expert Mode hasn't really changed anything, as I've done enough of this to not need the non-expert prompts as to what to do next. But I keep going back and doing that repetition.I guess in a way it's soothing, or at least I find it so. It's not like you're accomplishing much, but after a lot of (clicking only) effort, you've finished a nice rebuild of the car and can sell it and get it out of your workshop. Why does that seem good? I don't know. I can't say.My biggest wish is that it went a few layers deeper. Like if I had to fix it all down to a new level of detail: not just replacing the headers, but how about all the gaskets too? Or the interior needs fixing (all cars, no matter how jacked at the auction, have perfect interiors). Or if I want to get a small, cheap car, and throw a turbo and lowered springs on it and sell it that way. It's weird. I can't make myself hit the ""No I don't recommend this"" button because I enjoy it, but there's so many caveats and missed opportunities I feel I should hit it. I guess, in the end, it's a 3 out of 5 stars that I somehow can't stop playing.			"

												I definitely love this game. Even with not as many possibilities as I want to have.I would like to see in the future for example boxer engines (like Subaru or Porsche have).Some things are not as detailed as they should be. For example hooses from air filter to throttle or air filter to turbo, then into cooler and ended at throttle again. Something like that. There are a lot of things to improve, but still... Its fun to play this game. Maybe in the future we will have some user mods that can add those features.There might be some showroom as well for restored cars from auctions.Resume? Definitely worth to buy this game and spend some hours to play. After few hours there is some kind of stereotype, but there are some DLCs that can extend a time to play.Thanks for nice game			"

Hints for the devs->How about web radio support like in euro truck simulator 2? Also trucks and motorcycles, more music.More ingame joke stuff like in the first game the clients' description of the damage. More test drives.Game crashes often with Nvidia when trying to minimize/maximize. Faster loading. THX.			"

But after you`ve figured out all these, this game will definitely make you spend some time on it. I usually play 4-5 hours every time...Besides, when you have enough money and experience to play with the auction system, congrats, you have reached the top level of the game, and watching the car that was utterly rubbish when you bought it turning into brand new shiny one, you would have the sense of achievement.Recommend it~			"

												For those who know close to nothing about cars, and what goes into them, what minor but vital components are needed to make a vehicle run, this simulation CMS '15, would be great for many people. Now, the only part(s) I'm disappointed about, is the lack of vehicle modifications that can be performed. Unlike real life, you can't turbocharge, supercharge, procharge any of the vehicles in this game. Another part I'm not so pleased with about this simulation, is there are no pickup trucks whatsoever. I hope that in the near future there will be DLC containing pickup trucks, vans, and other miscilaneous vehicles. One other Disappointment I have is the amount of driving, or lack of driving ability there is. It would have been nice to have freerome, a race track other than the Factory Test Track, and a Dyno in the Garage. But overall this simulation is pefect for beginners that want to go into the automotive trade.			"

												A great, very simple game. It takes a short bit to get used to how it works and what issues go to which part of the car. If you're very car savy then this will be a walk in the park for you and it'll just serve as a fun simulation to work on some sweet rides. Others, like me, who just know how to change the oil in our cars...if that, will actually find this educational as well as fun. A game like this could have easily been too complicated for people to enjoy, but they hit it right on the button. The graphics are nothing to complain about either! The only complaint I have is that after awhile you start to see that a lot of the jobs are quite repetitve. It would be nice to have more variety of issues to solve with the cars.

												The title says it all: this is a simulation of being a car mechanic. Well, that's actually not true. As a ""simulation"" of being a car mechanic, it's terrible: cars and their respective parts are massively simplified from reality, and the entire process of fixing a car is also quite simple and extremely fast. Most ""simulators"" are guilty of this as well, so it's far from a unique issue. BUT, as a puzzle game involving cars, it's lovely. In short, think of this as a normal game and not as a simulator.The obvious comparison is to Car Mechamic Simulator 2014, and 2015 is a substantial improvement. I didn't notice any bugs in either game and performance seems to have improved a bit too but I have no hard evidence to support that. The controls are, IMO, the biggest improvement. I thought they were fine in 2014 but 2015 is much more intuitive and really highlights the flaws with 2014; I'm not sure how to get more specific, just that 2014 now controls a bit ""awkward"" to me. Graphics are not cutting edge but do look very nice, so no complaints there. I love the ability to restore cars, I get quite a lot of satisfaction from it, for some reason. The basic gameplay mechanic is the same between both games: removing/replacing bolts and removing/replacing parts. Simple in concept, but surprisingly fun and also quite relaxing in a way. If you played 2014 and enjoyed that, then you'll love 2015.Now for the minuses. The camera is a bit weird. It's far from the worst I've dealt with but it's not great either. It can be a bit tricky to aim on certain parts, especially the driveshaft; I'd say it's solidly midpack overall. While I generally think the soundtrack is quite good, it could be more varied and if you don't like EDM, then you'll hate it. The store front for buying new parts is just a massive list of all the parts, with no way to sort between different ones; a method to search through them would be great. At least you can sort parts in your inventory by arrival and condition, as well as search by name for them. Draining oil took a coupe of tries to do properly because I couldn't aim the drain under the lift and the plug is small, but that's likely just operator error (read: entriely my own fault.) Load times are also quite long. They aren't unbearable but can take several minutes to load at worst (when trying to load the Parking section and you have numerous cars stored); hopefully this gets fixed in future updates. All this are fairly nitpicky and I can easily look past them. No game is flawless, afterall.Overall, if the idea of working on a virtual car sound appealing, give this game a try. If you don't like it (and you'll find out pretty quickly if this is for you or not), thank God that Steam refunds are a thing. Like Farming Simulator 2015, this is a simulation game that doesn't suck and offers some nice gameplay...even if it truly isn't a simulator.			"

												I've turned wrenches on all sorts of things, from lawnmowers to helicopter gunships.  While this game isn't a ""perfect"" simulator by any means, it's actually pretty fun and semi-realistic.  There could be a lot more to it, but for what it is, it's actually a great time-waster or way to just kinda sit back and relax.  If you have experience with working on vehicles, you won't find this in the least challenging, but then, it's not really about challenging, is it?  It's fun, as long as you're not expecting a real brain-twister.  As for people who don't have much (or any) experience in working on cars, this is actually a really good way to learn about how things are attached to each other and roughly how they work.  There's a ton of detail being left out, but it's really all about the major parts and being able to customize stuff / repair stuff.The most fun part of the game for me was when I got up to the point that I had enough money to turn my repair shop into a restore shop.  I don't take repair orders anymore.  I go to the auction, find a car to refurb, completely restore it, and sell it for a heafty profit.  It's a great non-frustrating game to tinker around with.			"

												Have to give this one a cautious thumbs up. There aren't enough customization options in the base game, and the game is a bit over-monetized. That said, it still plays pretty well and has a fairly good feel to it. It does have a couple of issues that I'll correct right now... 1. the radio is under the window cill behind the Right Lift. 2. The unlockable diagonistic tools can be activated using F1-F3 when in examine mode when looking at the engine. I didn't discover this until 100+ hours into the game. So except for those usability fails, it's a pretty interesting game... Has an issue with part identification in expert mode tho, ie there's no manual to refer to to figure out which part to put on a car if you sold the old ones too soon. "

												The Positives.---------------------Teaches about Car Parts and their effects on condition.Good Graphics.Smooth frame Rates.Nice looking Detail's of parts.The Negatives.---------------------This Game is not complete.Missing Battery Cables.Missing Fuel Hoses.Missing Radator Hoses.Missing Differential Gear Ratio options for the Drag StripNo Cars from the Muscle Car early years.No Workshop Options for our own Content.Most parts are all the same look such as Brake parts all look the same.This Game got very boring very quickly.Most of all, absolutley No Engine Animations whatsoever, no rotating or moving Parts.Very DissapoiningNeeded.-----------A Drag Race with other Vehicles would be the main addition that would make this game more complete.I myself do not have a problem of purchasing DLC as long as it is of good quality.Making DLC is not an easy task and takes a long time to get them looking good.Jon J.

												I wanted to learn more about cars in a fun way. This game does that.I like doing things myself, and learning how things work. I change my own oil and brakes, but looking at the car all the parts were just a mass of inscrutable metal shapes. After playing this game for some hours, I suddenly saw all the parts for what they are. Running Gear. Sway bar. Tie Rod. Tie Rod End. Strut. Coil Spring. There are individual parts, and they have names and purposes.ConsThere are very few interesting decisions in this game.  There's no strategy elements like managing prices or over/under charging, no honesty level, no sales or marketing or competing with other mechanics. The process of repairing cars never changes. There end game is buying cars from the auction, repairing, them then selling or keeping them. Load times are awful for what the game is. The upgrades are boring. The UI when selecting parts can be finicky.I feel like it was a real lost opportunity that the game doesn't offer information about each part. I know I can go hit Wikipedia, but it'd add so much to my experience if I could just right click the timing belt and learn it's function, maybe origin and evolution. What is the difference between a carburetor and fuel injection? Why did older cars have a middle muffler? This would add a lot of resource to the game.Pros If you're looking for car knowledge, this is 1000x more interesting than reading a website or book about cars.It doesn't turn you into a mechanic, but takes the mystery of automobiles and brings them into the realm of the knowable.Your fingernails aren't black for days after.

												What to say, what to say. I'll start off by saying that I love cars. I love racing games and I love my own car. I have owned a small array of cars starting with a 1976 Camaro RS to my current, and more fuel efficient lol, Scion tC. But man, do I miss that Camaro... Good times. Anywho. I have always enjoyed working on my cars and have had the pleasure of doing some large projects with friends and family on other cars. This game is almost as fun as that. It's a lot simpler and all you have to do is click to get those rusted bolts off, rather having to sit there for hours spraying WD-40 and hoping your breaker bar doesnt snap and break your fingers. It's a great game to play and pass the time. If you know your way around a car well, you might come  across some areas where you're just like ""what. that doesn't make sense,"" and this happens because this is a simulation close to the real thing, but there are easily errors. If you know nothing about working on a car and hope to learn from this, it may be some help to you. It is a great start in learning what everything does and where things go, but the systems in this game are not universal and cannot be directly applied to cars in the real world. Maybe with the upcoming REAL CAR DLC we will see some better representations of real cars and their powertrain, but otherwise, not really. In the end this is still a very fun game to pass the time and possibily get you addicted. Bear in mind that things move slow. You gotta work a lot to get XP and all sorts of other cool stuff, which is great because you won't get bored super easily which means you'll be playing this game for hours. Maybe they'll even com up with some sort of multiplayer DLC to race your cars against eachother or to see who can better diagnose and fix a vehicle. Anyways, get this game. It's awesome. Esepecially if you can find the sale. 11 bucks for the whole thing! hell yeah!			"

												Previously being a mechanic this game is highly accurate to a degree, a big step up from 2014 was the ability to completely rebuild an engine, while building the engine in car is more of an easy approach I recommend they have a system for the next game where you can pre build the engine before installing it, it would be much easier and save you all the hassle of constantly going up and down, to pull the heads off, main caps and then finally getting the pistons out. While the systems and jobs are quite accurate and in depth I think they could have implemented more diagnostic tools, the scan tool is a cool tool but if they could implement a fully functioning scan tool where you can look up and clear DTCS I think that would produce a whole new level of experience in the game for experienced players. After pretty much going through the whole game in expert mode its a fun challenge that keeps you glued to the screen. Overall a great game for what it is, and has a lot of potential.			"

												Very complete and real simulator! They should encourage kids to play this at school, learning so much. At the beggining is tricky and if you don't have at least some knowledge you will end up deasambling the whole car and assembling it again. As long as you know how an oil change is done and you are familiar on where some parts are located you should be fine. And if you get stuck in a job o get frustrated you can abort it without any penalties and then try different car jobs. After playing bread simulators, goat simulators, survivals of all kinds... I think this is the most and way far best simulator I ever played. 10/10... Of course if you are not a pretolhead or not interstead in mechanic or learning this game is not for you.+PROS:+you get jobs+you buy car parts+sometimes you need to examine the car and find out what is wrong with it (far more easy than it sounds)+remove/place parts one by one, screw by screw+get paid+buy tools and upgrades to improve your job+as more experience you make the more challenging and complex the game gets and more FUN+awesome electronic/EDM background music+no bugs found yet, exept once I removed a part and got it twice which is nice.+repair parts+sell parts+and more (yet for me to discover)-CONS-you can get stuck on a job, but you can quit it and recover-some parts are so small and difficult to find sometimes but thats part of being a mechanic simulator-needs patience-need to be intersted on cars or the science behind them (specific audience) "

												The visuals and gameplay mechanics are really good, once you get the hang of them, they feel very natural. At it's core the game is about finding faulty parts and replacing them with new parts. The challenge comes by not knowing which parts need replacing, and finding them using different techniques and tools you unlock along the way. There is also an auction system where you can buy cars, repair them, then keep them or sell them for a profit.One thing I really wish they had is some description of what each part does in the car. I have the basic understanding of how an engine works, but even the smallest blurb would have been helpful and a nice addition to the budding mechanic in all of us.Now for nitpicking, would it have killed them to put in a buy button to the work order? As of now you have remember the required part, switch to your tablet and find the part to buy. How about an indication of whether you already own the part? Instead you again have to remember the part, switch to your inventory and search it up. Sure, it's a simulator, that's part of the game, but it does get quite tedious and distracting when you have to search 20 different parts individually.Lastly sit down and be ready, unlocking everything is quite a grind, though personally I don't mind, I find it oddly meditative.

												The game in all is one of the few games that actually make me glad I am choosing to become a car mechanic in my future. This, although with a lot less of the frustration really working on a car can bring, is accurate, but only to an extent. As said by many people, it’s missing the human factor to it. From the “I can’t touch anything or I’ll have to clean grease off it” incident to the “I’ve lost the one screw and will have to replace the whole part” mistakes. It’s also missing the whole electrical aspect of cars; it would be cool if they could have cars that you would work on that showed you just what the working of a smart car is like.  I would hope that in future updates it will allow:-More car customization, such as different paint jobs (which can even be a part by itself where you have to paint each stencil/layer yourself)-Ability to work on the interior of the cars -Ability to go to car shows and drive the car around and get awards and money -As many car types as you can think of from all different car companies (Can give the ability of the player to load all or just some of the cars they want to work on) including different engine types -Create a customer system where people come in and have their cars fixed within a certain time span (have the phone for people who have bigger projects and have the schedule on computer) It's unrealistic that people would wait to have their car fixed while I'm out at auction and fixing my own cars or just goofing around-System so that you can sell cars to not just people at auction, but do trades as well-Allow players to expand the shop, adding more lifts, open floor areas, and have the ability to hire people in your own shop to help with buying items, fixing parts, testing and painting cars, even buying /selling cars, and even having them take care of a project by themselves -Different modes for players to choose from, such as casual (which is basically what the game is now), a career mode that would start with your business only getting a few costumers, would grow depending on the player’s judgment, and would have ways of advertising and seeing how well you are doing -Ability to add mods (which would help add new cars and different aspects while keeping the game itself simple and giving players the option to expand-Broken parts are not all rusted; parts can have breaks, malfunctions, be clogged but unnoticed until it is actually inspectedThe game as it stands is a good time consumer and definitely helped me distinguish that not every part is called “that round doohickey” or “that thing” due to that I have to look up every part individually by name in order to order a new one. It’s a great educational tool that is easy to work with and understand. What I find absolutely amazing is that even with my slow computer I can run this game with no problem with high quality and only minimal lag with ultra high quality with the only problem just being mouse movement is slowed. I like that it is realistic in the aspect that if you spend all your money on a car you won’t have enough to buy parts to get more money or fix the car and will eventually have to chop shop a car. What is nice is that the game is still being updated and actively worked on. It’s a game where sometimes I can’t stop until I’ve made enough money or until I’ve gotten down to only one customer but then I realize that I have parts to fix, then that I should sell some things, then that there is another customer. But wait, it’s a different car I haven’t worked on. Now I have to find the parts that need to be replaced because they are located everywhere or it has a V8 OHV engine and all the rods and rocker arms need to be taken out.  But then I’ve made the mistake of once again not going to bed when I wanted to. It feels like a Billy Mays commercial… “But wait! There’s more!”Overall, Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is an amazing game. I would even be willing to pay for updates such as the ones I’ve listed because just one of those alone will bring hours of more fun, discovery, and things to learn about.			"

												A great, very simple game. It takes a short bit to get used to how it works and what issues go to which part of the car. If you're very car savy then this will be a walk in the park for you and it'll just serve as a fun simulation to work on some sweet rides. Others, like me, who just know how to change the oil in our cars...if that, will actually find this educational as well as fun. A game like this could have easily been too complicated for people to enjoy, but they hit it right on the button. The graphics are nothing to complain about either! The only complaint I have is that after awhile you start to see that a lot of the jobs are quite repetitve. It would be nice to have more variety of issues to solve with the cars. Thats pretty much it. 9/10 Great game			"

												The game itself isn't terribly difficult to master, and the gameplay and UI are good.  Removing and replacing parts on the cars is easy enough, as the game usually lets you know what's in the way or what you need to remove first before you can proceed.  There's a lot of room for improvement within this game, but it looks like the developer is on top of things by offering additional DLC and tweaking certain areas to make things better.If you're an actual auto mechanic and are looking for ultimate realism in this game, don't get your hopes up.  It's not going to have every single bolt, nut, washer, and other parts.  It does simulate a lot of the meaningful pieces of a vehicle, though.  The differences between the vehicles in terms of engine and suspension types also adds to the complexity and challenge of the game.  If you're a casual petrol-head who enjoys the puzzle of taking apart a car down to the chassis and rebuilding it from the ground up, you'll like this game.			"

												First time for me with Car Mechanic Simulator, didn't try the 2014. Very fun game and addictive. Got me a shoulder injury.But, not very challenging and not very long until the game gets repetative.We shouldn't have to pay for those DLC's because they are that should be included into the game already.There's also a whole lot that the game could include (modifications, customization, improved trading and auctions, second hand parts etc.), but maybe in the future?Great game all in all and much fun.

I am a bit dissappointed that only Polski Fiat is in the yountimer extra DLC. I had from the former communist East-Germany  (DDR) a Trabant 601S.

												As someone who knows hardly anything about the inside of a car, it seems very accurate. The names of the individual car parts are accurate.Whilst playing through the game you will learn teh very basics of the car parts, what they do and how they work.The overall game is great for people new to cars who want to learn and play at the same time.With enough time playing the game I would probably feel comfortable enough changing the brake pads on a car and possibly adding new oil.One major problem I have with the game is the loading time. If I have two cars in the garage and load up the it will take a good minute to load the game, then the first car and then finally the second car.When taking jobs, loading in the cars also takes quite some time.It can become quite boring waiting for the cars to load and it's the one thing making me want to close the game down and play EuroTruck Simulator 2 which quicker loading screens.

												Very complete and real simulator! They should encourage kids to play this at school, learning so much. At the beggining is tricky and if you don't have at least some knowledge you will end up deasambling the whole car and assembling it again. As long as you know how an oil change is done and you are familiar on where some parts are located you should be fine. And if you get stuck in a job o get frustrated you can abort it without any penalties and then try different car jobs. After playing bread simulators, goat simulators, survivals of all kinds... I think this is the most and way far best simulator I ever played. 10/10... Of course if you are not a pretolhead or not interstead in mechanic or learning this game is not for you.+PROS:+you get jobs+you buy car parts+sometimes you need to examine the car and find out what is wrong with it (far more easy than it sounds)+remove/place parts one by one, screw by screw+get paid+buy tools and upgrades to improve your job+as more experience you make the more challenging and complex the game gets and more FUN+awesome electronic/EDM background music+no bugs found yet, exept once I removed a part and got it twice which is nice.+repair parts+sell parts+and more (yet for me to discover)-CONS-you can get stuck on a job, but you can quit it and recover-some parts are so small and difficult to find sometimes but thats part of being a mechanic simulator-needs patience-need to be intersted on cars or the science behind them (specific audience) "

												The visuals and gameplay mechanics are really good, once you get the hang of them, they feel very natural. At it's core the game is about finding faulty parts and replacing them with new parts. The challenge comes by not knowing which parts need replacing, and finding them using different techniques and tools you unlock along the way. There is also an auction system where you can buy cars, repair them, then keep them or sell them for a profit.One thing I really wish they had is some description of what each part does in the car. I have the basic understanding of how an engine works, but even the smallest blurb would have been helpful and a nice addition to the budding mechanic in all of us.Now for nitpicking, would it have killed them to put in a buy button to the work order? As of now you have remember the required part, switch to your tablet and find the part to buy. How about an indication of whether you already own the part? Instead you again have to remember the part, switch to your inventory and search it up. Sure, it's a simulator, that's part of the game, but it does get quite tedious and distracting when you have to search 20 different parts individually.Lastly sit down and be ready, unlocking everything is quite a grind, though personally I don't mind, I find it oddly meditative.

												Previously being a mechanic this game is highly accurate to a degree, a big step up from 2014 was the ability to completely rebuild an engine, while building the engine in car is more of an easy approach I recommend they have a system for the next game where you can pre build the engine before installing it, it would be much easier and save you all the hassle of constantly going up and down, to pull the heads off, main caps and then finally getting the pistons out. While the systems and jobs are quite accurate and in depth I think they could have implemented more diagnostic tools, the scan tool is a cool tool but if they could implement a fully functioning scan tool where you can look up and clear DTCS I think that would produce a whole new level of experience in the game for experienced players. After pretty much going through the whole game in expert mode its a fun challenge that keeps you glued to the screen. Overall a great game for what it is, and has a lot of potential.			"

												I definitely love this game. Even with not as many possibilities as I want to have.I would like to see in the future for example boxer engines (like Subaru or Porsche have).Some things are not as detailed as they should be. For example hooses from air filter to throttle or air filter to turbo, then into cooler and ended at throttle again. Something like that. There are a lot of things to improve, but still... Its fun to play this game. Maybe in the future we will have some user mods that can add those features.There might be some showroom as well for restored cars from auctions.Resume? Definitely worth to buy this game and spend some hours to play. After few hours there is some kind of stereotype, but there are some DLCs that can extend a time to play.Thanks for nice game			"

												Successor of the indie surprise CMS 2014 this game is a diamond in the raw. Insta-buy for fans of 2014.Exactly why it's so addicting to repair stuff I don't know, I never even changed a tire in reality.Repair, get money, upgrade your stuff, repeat -that's it.A meditating game to relax when you don't want brutal action.Oh and don't expect to be able to change your gearbox at home after playing, life doesn't work that way. :)This game is still quiet raw, I'll keep buying it year after year until they make it perfect. Hints for the devs->How about web radio support like in euro truck simulator 2? Also trucks and motorcycles, more music.More ingame joke stuff like in the first game the clients' description of the damage. More test drives.Game crashes often with Nvidia when trying to minimize/maximize. Faster loading. THX.			"

												After the first few cars that come into your shop for repair, you've got the concept down. After you unlock a few of the basic skill unlocks, there's nothing you can't really solve. After you're able to buy cars at auction, that's it. You've reached the end game. By that point you're stripping cars down to bare metal and replacing them piece by piece, car after car, making unneeded profit on a hugely routine exercise. There's no real change except for which cars you choose to restore, and sell. The money will never go towards anything but buying and restoring more cars. After you've done one or two, you've even unlocked all the points you need for the garage visual updates, and will have points to spare that you don't need. Buy car, fix, sell, repeat forever.And so, I recommend this game. Which feels weird to me.It's super repetetive. The DLC is kinda nice and not stupid-expensive, but doesn't add enough to be a game changer. Even the recent addition of Expert Mode hasn't really changed anything, as I've done enough of this to not need the non-expert prompts as to what to do next. But I keep going back and doing that repetition.I guess in a way it's soothing, or at least I find it so. It's not like you're accomplishing much, but after a lot of (clicking only) effort, you've finished a nice rebuild of the car and can sell it and get it out of your workshop. Why does that seem good? I don't know. I can't say.My biggest wish is that it went a few layers deeper. Like if I had to fix it all down to a new level of detail: not just replacing the headers, but how about all the gaskets too? Or the interior needs fixing (all cars, no matter how jacked at the auction, have perfect interiors). Or if I want to get a small, cheap car, and throw a turbo and lowered springs on it and sell it that way. It's weird. I can't make myself hit the ""No I don't recommend this"" button because I enjoy it, but there's so many caveats and missed opportunities I feel I should hit it. I guess, in the end, it's a 3 out of 5 stars that I somehow can't stop playing.			"

The names of the individual car parts are accurate.Whilst playing through the game you will learn teh very basics of the car parts, what they do and how they work.The overall game is great for people new to cars who want to learn and play at the same time.With enough time playing the game I would probably feel comfortable enough changing the brake pads on a car and possibly adding new oil.One major problem I have with the game is the loading time. If I have two cars in the garage and load up the it will take a good minute to load the game, then the first car and then finally the second car.When taking jobs, loading in the cars also takes quite some time.It can become quite boring waiting for the cars to load and it's the one thing making me want to close the game down and play EuroTruck Simulator 2 which quicker loading screens.

												This is so real I sold my car so I can drive this game to school every day.A few important areas such as gaskets and such have been overlooked.This game also makes being a mechanic look super easy (its not, its far from it)If they add more vehicles and more functionality I'll ♥♥♥♥ my pants			"

												This review assumes you know Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 and it's game mechanics - either from playing it or watching lets plays etc.If you've played Car Mechanic Simulator 2014, this is a lot like that - a bit too much to my liking actually. It feels like what 2014 should have been, yet not a big enough step forward for a brand new game. I still recommend it because there aren't many games like this out there and it's got a reasonable pricetag for the value you're getting.This game is a bit more detailed than 2014, but shares all of it's good parts, so I'll just talk about things that I was a bit disappointed with:What I find is really lacking is a sense of progression. There are unlocks you get with experience but it feels a bit tacked on and not like a core game mechanic. I'd love to have either a story like in the similar Nintendo DS game ""Touch Mechanic"" (which is by the way a lot of fun) or a more extensive way of upgrading your tools and garage - i.e. starting in a small garage and buy better ones later on.What I think would be nice to have is a less strict assemble and disassemble order - allow me to make mistakes, for example get the order wrong in which I put together parts if I'm not careful. Let me interact with all the parts as I see fit - i.e. let me stop mounting a part mid-way and continue later if I want to - don't just completely remove it if I stop.The body-parts system is shallow - you take off and mount parts without so much as touching a screw. Similarly the painting system is just picking a color and pressing a button - I would have expected to spray the car myself.What I still hate since the first Car Mechanic Sim game is buying parts - it's a dumb waste of time to look up each part on a pseudo web-page - allow me to bulk order all parts that I found out need changing!That all said, if you like the concept of the game or the previous Car Mechanic Simulator, this is the game for you - there aren't many like it out there.For a future Car Mechanic Game I'd wish for these things:A physics system - no magically disappearing and reappearing parts - let me unmount them and physicalls move around the garage. It doesn't have to be as sloppy as in Surgeon Simulator, but something similar in concept would be fun.Also it would be great if one could unmount whole blocks of parts without taking it apart piece by piece.

												This is a great game who doesn't like to take apart a car repair it put back together and not even get dirty doing it just kidding on the dirty part. The only problem I have is in the stores of the game there are some part that are there but they don't have a car to use them on. Is that because your going to add those car or are they there for something to do. Also wouldn't mind seeing an improvement to paint like some strips and decals. And maybe one other thing being able to put dual carbs on the Tempest Magnum,Bolt Hellcat,Bolt Reptillia and maybe even a engine swap in these cars.			"

But after you`ve figured out all these, this game will definitely make you spend some time on it. I usually play 4-5 hours every time...Besides, when you have enough money and experience to play with the auction system, congrats, you have reached the top level of the game, and watching the car that was utterly rubbish when you bought it turning into brand new shiny one, you would have the sense of achievement.Recommend it~			"

												For those who know close to nothing about cars, and what goes into them, what minor but vital components are needed to make a vehicle run, this simulation CMS '15, would be great for many people. Now, the only part(s) I'm disappointed about, is the lack of vehicle modifications that can be performed. Unlike real life, you can't turbocharge, supercharge, procharge any of the vehicles in this game. Another part I'm not so pleased with about this simulation, is there are no pickup trucks whatsoever. I hope that in the near future there will be DLC containing pickup trucks, vans, and other miscilaneous vehicles. One other Disappointment I have is the amount of driving, or lack of driving ability there is. It would have been nice to have freerome, a race track other than the Factory Test Track, and a Dyno in the Garage. But overall this simulation is pefect for beginners that want to go into the automotive trade.			"

												The title says it all: this is a simulation of being a car mechanic. Well, that's actually not true. As a ""simulation"" of being a car mechanic, it's terrible: cars and their respective parts are massively simplified from reality, and the entire process of fixing a car is also quite simple and extremely fast. Most ""simulators"" are guilty of this as well, so it's far from a unique issue. BUT, as a puzzle game involving cars, it's lovely. In short, think of this as a normal game and not as a simulator.The obvious comparison is to Car Mechamic Simulator 2014, and 2015 is a substantial improvement. I didn't notice any bugs in either game and performance seems to have improved a bit too but I have no hard evidence to support that. The controls are, IMO, the biggest improvement. I thought they were fine in 2014 but 2015 is much more intuitive and really highlights the flaws with 2014; I'm not sure how to get more specific, just that 2014 now controls a bit ""awkward"" to me. Graphics are not cutting edge but do look very nice, so no complaints there. I love the ability to restore cars, I get quite a lot of satisfaction from it, for some reason. The basic gameplay mechanic is the same between both games: removing/replacing bolts and removing/replacing parts. Simple in concept, but surprisingly fun and also quite relaxing in a way. If you played 2014 and enjoyed that, then you'll love 2015.Now for the minuses. The camera is a bit weird. It's far from the worst I've dealt with but it's not great either. It can be a bit tricky to aim on certain parts, especially the driveshaft; I'd say it's solidly midpack overall. While I generally think the soundtrack is quite good, it could be more varied and if you don't like EDM, then you'll hate it. The store front for buying new parts is just a massive list of all the parts, with no way to sort between different ones; a method to search through them would be great. At least you can sort parts in your inventory by arrival and condition, as well as search by name for them. Draining oil took a coupe of tries to do properly because I couldn't aim the drain under the lift and the plug is small, but that's likely just operator error (read: entriely my own fault.) Load times are also quite long. They aren't unbearable but can take several minutes to load at worst (when trying to load the Parking section and you have numerous cars stored); hopefully this gets fixed in future updates. All this are fairly nitpicky and I can easily look past them. No game is flawless, afterall.Overall, if the idea of working on a virtual car sound appealing, give this game a try. If you don't like it (and you'll find out pretty quickly if this is for you or not), thank God that Steam refunds are a thing. Like Farming Simulator 2015, this is a simulation game that doesn't suck and offers some nice gameplay...even if it truly isn't a simulator.			"

												Before you buy.......Yes the dlc's are very much copy and paste with a new car body bolted to it.No its nothing like working on a real car, taking skin off your knuckles, snapping a bolt and then finding the dead bird cooked to a radiatior.And yes the dlc's do seem to bring new bugs to the game even if you have'nt bought them.Should you buy this game? Yes 100% yes  "

												absolutely love this game. everybody should get this if you get the chance. you learn a little about how cars work and have a blast while doing it. one of my favorite games of all time.Positives:-learn about general mechanics of cars-relaxing laid back game -sexy cars-cant afford a classic car to restore? this game is as close as you can get without pouring money into a real carNegatives:-after a certain point loses it's challenge (have over 2mil money and 52 xp points to spend and nothing to do)-not enough driving challenges-cant drive your fully restored muscle car in real life (asking too much but this is still valid.)-feeling like a badass mechanic when you really dont have any expierence with real life cars.-dieing of old age waiting on next Car Mechanic Simulator (gimme! gimme! gimme!)I tend to purchase games based on cost to time spent playing (skyrim was $60/spent 140 hours playing=$0.43/hour of play)this game i spent $55 and played for over 75 hours playing and still having fun=$0.73/hourbe aware that each hour is fun and an adventure of itself. (stripper: $20/1 hour of play=$20 cost per hour) this game makes a stripper cry.			"

												Loving the new Car Mechanic 2015 many new parts and lots more things to do. The DLC's are decent and not over priced like some I could mention and it seems like they listen to us gamers big thumbs up from me keep up the good work guys :) The graphics are much improved and the game seems to run very smooth when dismantling and assembling parts.Navigating around the menu is easier and the game still has that relaxed feeling to it which is what appeals to me.I have a lot of knowledge about car engines and where i should be looking for parts to change, but don't despair if you don't know a thing because a cool feature when you start is it highlights the parts you need to replace and you get a check list so you know when your done.Iv'e just started so can't comment on the new stuff it has to offer, but i will update at a later stage :)			"

												The gameplay is addicting, even for a person like me who knows (or knew, I guess I should say) literally zero about how cars work. A true gearhead will see more lasting value to the overall product. As someone who enjoys deeper gameplay elements, however, I feel there's something lacking. You the player simply work on cars to make more money, which leads to easier and faster methods of working on cars, and that's about it. I would have really liked to see a career mode in which you eventually own and operate a living, breathing shop with budgets to manage, employees to hire/train/fire as appropriate, and perhaps eventually build a nation-wide chain of shops if your business acumen is up to the challenge.In other words, great core mechanic mechanic (so happy I got to say that) that has lots of room for expansion as an overal game concept. Also maybe throw in customer interactions, crappier computers, weak coffee, deadlines for getting work done... the list could go on.			"

												I think that 6 hours are enough for me to write this review...CMS 2015 Is a great step forward from the 2014.If you like cars in overall, you will love this game.Pros and cons:+You can own cars and you can make them look as you want.+The overall look of the parts is great.+you don't need to remove the whole exhaust to replace a manifold+tablet system (you can buy the part that you want anywhere, at any time)+upgrades and upgrade points+more scanners+you can change exterior parts (even lights)!+much more parts to replace-oil drain can be sometimes hard to operate with-Too much XP needed to have something. example: 9000 XP to have parking, or 1000XP for a 1 point.i would give 9.9/10.EDIT:Well, some cons are being added.-Tons and tons of DLCs-50000$ for a parking with 2 parking spots (idk how i missed that)The rating after a little change: 8.8/10, but i would still reccomend the game, because it is not the DlcDay 2			"

												I only put about five hours into it, so I'm sure there's plenty of stuff I haven't seen/done yet.First off, this is one of those odd European simulation games. You're a car mechanic. You fix cars.No jetpacks, no fire breathing dragons, no guns.At the start you're dropped into your garage. There's no tutorial. Occasionally when you look at a menu, or try something out there will be a brief tooltip about what that particular feature does. This can hamper your enjoyment. For example I spent a good 15 minutes trying to figure out how to order parts. I should have seen the obvious, that you use your computer to search for, then order parts. Makes perfect sense in retrospect.But, you say, how is the repair portion? You know, the actual meat of the game! At first, everything is deeply confusing. First, you look at the repair order. In the beginning it tells you what parts need to be replaced. You go over, select the proper view mode, and start clicking on parts. In one mode, parts can be inspected. In another mode you can disassemble parts. In another you reassemble. So, basically it goes, find the problem, remove bits until you can remove the problem part, replace and reassemble. Later more difficult jobs appear, that give you a general idea of the problem, and you need to search for the bad parts yourself. Eventually you wind up doing bodywork as well as other repairs. Also there is a point where you can buy, repair and resell cars, but I haven't gotten to that point yet. The layout of parts is somewhat simplified. There isn't any wiring that I've seen so far, and I haven't had an interior job yet. These things may happen later though. As you do more jobs, you gain experience. This allows you to have access to more tools, more in depth jobs, and different kinds of cars to work on.I'd say I'd recommend the game. It's oddly calming and soothing, while at the same time providing an interesting challenge. It does have a demo, so if you're interested, try it out!  "

And the work on the cars gets more complicated, or prolonged because of the ammount of things you need to repair on the vehicle, whether its body panels or all the way to the inside of the engine block.

												For the oldies among you who remember gearhead garage and buying some piece of... metal.. and then transforming it into a work of art, this is the new better version of that. Yep it has an auction room, garage and a test track (although I dont like the test track at all). You can paint your car any colour you want (doesnt seem to be any decals to apply though). On the whole a great game when you want to take a rusted heap of metal for a couple of thousand and turn it into a great profit. It can be a bit tediuos at first as you can only repair customer veichles. Once you get your parking though and a little capital... oh yeah. Nothing like a 100% castor rex standing in your garage, painted and ready to sell..I like this game very much and hope to see more content added in the future. I would especially like to see a better test track.			"

Good game for $5This is a good game for if you want to play a game while listening to a podcast, because it doesn't require a very high amount of concentration. I wouldn't want to play it just by itself though, since it can get a bit tedious. For someone like me, who's unfamiliar with the inner workings of cars, the game basically functions as a puzzle game. I recommend getting this game at a discount, since it's not worth its full price, but for $5 it's a nice time-waster of a game.			"

												Have to give this one a cautious thumbs up. There aren't enough customization options in the base game, and the game is a bit over-monetized. That said, it still plays pretty well and has a fairly good feel to it. It does have a couple of issues that I'll correct right now... 1. the radio is under the window cill behind the Right Lift. 2. The unlockable diagonistic tools can be activated using F1-F3 when in examine mode when looking at the engine. I didn't discover this until 100+ hours into the game. So except for those usability fails, it's a pretty interesting game... Has an issue with part identification in expert mode tho, ie there's no manual to refer to to figure out which part to put on a car if you sold the old ones too soon. "

												I've turned wrenches on all sorts of things, from lawnmowers to helicopter gunships.  While this game isn't a ""perfect"" simulator by any means, it's actually pretty fun and semi-realistic.  There could be a lot more to it, but for what it is, it's actually a great time-waster or way to just kinda sit back and relax.  If you have experience with working on vehicles, you won't find this in the least challenging, but then, it's not really about challenging, is it?  It's fun, as long as you're not expecting a real brain-twister.  As for people who don't have much (or any) experience in working on cars, this is actually a really good way to learn about how things are attached to each other and roughly how they work.  There's a ton of detail being left out, but it's really all about the major parts and being able to customize stuff / repair stuff.The most fun part of the game for me was when I got up to the point that I had enough money to turn my repair shop into a restore shop.  I don't take repair orders anymore.  I go to the auction, find a car to refurb, completely restore it, and sell it for a heafty profit.  It's a great non-frustrating game to tinker around with.			"

												I wanted to learn more about cars in a fun way. This game does that.I like doing things myself, and learning how things work. I change my own oil and brakes, but looking at the car all the parts were just a mass of inscrutable metal shapes. After playing this game for some hours, I suddenly saw all the parts for what they are. Running Gear. Sway bar. Tie Rod. Tie Rod End. Strut. Coil Spring. There are individual parts, and they have names and purposes.ConsThere are very few interesting decisions in this game.  There's no strategy elements like managing prices or over/under charging, no honesty level, no sales or marketing or competing with other mechanics. The process of repairing cars never changes. There end game is buying cars from the auction, repairing, them then selling or keeping them. Load times are awful for what the game is. The upgrades are boring. The UI when selecting parts can be finicky.I feel like it was a real lost opportunity that the game doesn't offer information about each part. I know I can go hit Wikipedia, but it'd add so much to my experience if I could just right click the timing belt and learn it's function, maybe origin and evolution. What is the difference between a carburetor and fuel injection? Why did older cars have a middle muffler? This would add a lot of resource to the game.Pros If you're looking for car knowledge, this is 1000x more interesting than reading a website or book about cars.It doesn't turn you into a mechanic, but takes the mystery of automobiles and brings them into the realm of the knowable.Your fingernails aren't black for days after.

												I'm torn on this one - the game is somewhat addictive - until the repetitiveness starts - after a few dozen hours you have restored every car, know which faulty part causes which problem, have built your 'dream' car out of the available cars, have your repair skills maxed out and so on.I bought this game in a humble bundle with the youngtimer DLC (that ***** Maluch) included and bought the Trader pack and the performance DLC in a steam sale. In my opinion, the DLCs are a huge bad point of the game: some integral parts of the game must to be bought via DLC and even those are somehow incomplete. For example the performance DLC allows engine upgrades, but no suspension and brake upgrades. What's the point of the car upgrades anyway because there's only a dragstrip and nothing else.So you often get the feeling that parts of the game are missing. Another example: what is going on with car interiors? You strip a 1-star-condition car down to the naked shell, yet there's a pristine interior in it in which you can click around on named items, but no function.A last word on the car-brand-DLCs:DON'T! You pay about 6€/$ for a mere two additional cars and nothing else per DLC.Long story short: if you get the gold edition in a steam sale for less than 15€/$ or so, I'd recommend it, otherwise avoid it.

												Came essentially free with a humble bundle of other things I wanted. Was initially interested in the game and the concept as I have an interest in vehicles, but playing it fixed this. I gave it a couple of weeks and came back to it just in case, but this did not help any.Anything remotely interesting (instead of replace this list of random parts that makes no sense) is locked behind a massive grind, paid DLC, or both. The controls are clunky and poorly thought out, my initial assumption was that the keyboard controls were gimped in favour of controller compatability, but it doesn't even register a controller.If you received this with a humble bundle and haven't activated it yet -- don't, it's not worth hitting ctrl-c.If you are considering paying for it, definitely don't.

												8.2/10+ If you have more money to buy the mod on this game, just do it.+More knowledge about the car, How to modify your car... and double your money  In game, Not your life, lol  by restore a classic car. + If you have a perfect knowledge after spending an hours, or even a day to play this game, You should try the ""expert mode"", The Real Mechanic simulator.cons :- always destroy the stuff you want to rebuild  SPOILER ALERT : 90% of success fixing items doesnt help either, you still sucks at fixing the items, just 75% of success - How can I put my ""Users mod"" if the mod doesnt exist at all... :( advice : just buy the Perfomance and stuff dlc  it good rather that you buy maserati or another manufacture's dlc   "

												What to say, what to say. I'll start off by saying that I love cars. I love racing games and I love my own car. I have owned a small array of cars starting with a 1976 Camaro RS to my current, and more fuel efficient lol, Scion tC. But man, do I miss that Camaro... Good times. Anywho. I have always enjoyed working on my cars and have had the pleasure of doing some large projects with friends and family on other cars. This game is almost as fun as that. It's a lot simpler and all you have to do is click to get those rusted bolts off, rather having to sit there for hours spraying WD-40 and hoping your breaker bar doesnt snap and break your fingers. It's a great game to play and pass the time. If you know your way around a car well, you might come  across some areas where you're just like ""what. that doesn't make sense,"" and this happens because this is a simulation close to the real thing, but there are easily errors. If you know nothing about working on a car and hope to learn from this, it may be some help to you. It is a great start in learning what everything does and where things go, but the systems in this game are not universal and cannot be directly applied to cars in the real world. Maybe with the upcoming REAL CAR DLC we will see some better representations of real cars and their powertrain, but otherwise, not really. In the end this is still a very fun game to pass the time and possibily get you addicted. Bear in mind that things move slow. You gotta work a lot to get XP and all sorts of other cool stuff, which is great because you won't get bored super easily which means you'll be playing this game for hours. Maybe they'll even com up with some sort of multiplayer DLC to race your cars against eachother or to see who can better diagnose and fix a vehicle. Anyways, get this game. It's awesome. Esepecially if you can find the sale. 11 bucks for the whole thing! hell yeah!			"

												I love this game, I actually stopped playing games but I find myself playing this one, building cars from scratch, buying restoring and selling, just to do it all over, for more XP and money, Hell I got so much money I restore the customers cars as well. (If I owned a real shop people would love me haha)But in the end it is a game, even the devs said this is a game not really a part for part gutting of cars, but for the most part you can recognize parts as well as some very minor work. I think brakes, for the most part, but even then there are online manuels as well as actual books for peoples cars.But its fun.... To be the guy that is completely dry ♥♥♥♥ing the customer instead of you the person being boned with out lube when it comes to payment haha.I definitely recommend this game for those of you that are car lovers or are just generally fasinated by what goes in to a car. I applaud them with the DLCs and add ons. Not much for the community add ons but I like the game.This game inspires me to want to become a mechanic, I know it takes A LOT MORE work to become one and there will be no little outlines when I need to rebuilt but i love tinkering and fixing things. Thanks for this game devs. You guys rock!!			"

												Building German Whips, game is okay, it might take some time to get bored as you will have things like upgrades, for example bigger chance of reparing a broken item, a tablet for easy access, editing your garage, buying broken down cars and referbushing them to make them into sick whips so the roadmen can drive them side to side like me on the CR. Wid da sick muscle car you can get some good wheelies like Charlie the fat plum on the YZ, get me fam? alright the game has some bare cars, with DLC's its even better, still havent got to test them all since im poor and live in Diggy but hoping to get them since they go cheap on sale, just a shame you cant find it in British Heart foundation.Also RIP Toms grandad, true manny on the map 0161.

												I played their first game, Car Mechanic Simulator 2014. It's neat. Don't get me wrong, you do stuff so fast in the original and in this newer version. However, it's neat to learn part names, and see the inner workings of vehicles.I'm so far enjoying the game. Also duely note, the amount of bolts and stuff you have to take off a vehicle would vary greatly in reality.However it is a simulation game, and no simulation is precise (100%). I still think, they did an excellent job though.It's got so much more options in this one, compared to the first one and it's alot better optimized for gaming cards.The first one felt really sluggish at times, though i may of been using an older video card then than what i got now.Not entirely sure, but it's need to see the cad like shadow underlays of parts you remove (3D view) of the car parts and stuff.Very fun, i recommend this game to anyone who likes working on their automobile in their free time or are already a mechanic. (though for mechanics some that aren't really happy with their jobs may not like playing this) but the ones that are truly in love with mechanics and automobile industry will likely find it entertaining. I hopefully will get into mechanic field someday, but its hard to say when that will be. Great game thus far Playway!			"

Graphics Quality is great for the price but yes, you should buy this game. it is enjoyable. Buy parts, repair, collect.  and i'm not there yet, but body fixing is also a great idea. like buying used cars, fixing them and re-sell them. great idea!Will buy the 2016. especially for that price. cheap/good/fun/			"

Menus and gameplay is very smooth and I have yet to find any bugs or experience any crashes. There is a lot more progession in this game compared to 2014. Don't expect to get unlock all the features of your garage in 30 minutes. At the time of writing this I'm about 6 hours in and just unlocked the path test.			"

												Being one who had purchased Car Mechanic 2014 and felt like i had wasted my money.  I was highly skeptical about the 2015 version.   After doing a lot of reading of reviews and such i took the plunge and went ahead and purchased 2015.  I gotta say I am quite happy I did.  Love the changes made to the game.   My only complaint would be lack of cars.  Hoping in the future that will be changed with DLC as well as mods.  But overall I am loving it.  I would would have to say this is a must have for anyone who enjoyed games like Gearhead Garage one of my all time favs.			"

												I got last years game and decided to buy the 2015 version straight away. It's a good game!. Sometime a job will come along in the game and your be taking a lot of the car apart just to find that one faulty part. A basic knowlegde of cars is needed but you will learn fairly quickly about how to take the parts on and off and in what order.  Everything in the game is very decent or better, the sound. the graphics, the gameplay and so far i haven't come across any bugs. There's quite a few extra 'help' in the game like the OBD scanner or a test brake/suspension place in your garage but they cost one experience upgrade which is 1,000 XP in the game, It takes quiet a while to level up, so there's no way your get everything without some hours put in. My biggest problem with the game is the repairs list. You can only see what you need to replace on a list while near the car, once you go to the computer to buy new parts that list is gone. It can be very annoying traveling back and forth to the car to see what you need or you have forgotten. I do know once you unlock repair the items on a bench yourself, you won't need the list as much but i feel the repair list should always be available by pressing O, no matter where you are. Overall i'd give this game a 8/10.			"

												CMS 2015 basically takes the 2014 version and improves it. They have different vehicles but more of them and somewhat more detail such as body panels, radiators and fans etc that sort of thing. I have enjoyed playing it though imo there doesn't seem to be much of a challenge financially as it's pretty much a continuous upward climb towards riches. At 9000 xp (7ish hrs for me) you unlock the abillity to buy cars in various conditions and fix them up which is fairly rewarding and has greater financial risk/reward if you don't manage your funds.All in all I wish the game was more detailed (ex. piston heads don't require removing bolts from underneath to remove, many bolted parts are simplified, no fasteners on body parts, only fluid you deal with is oil, so no coolant, trans, gas, wiper fluids etc all omitted, no hoses, no tuning, no interior parts, no glass repair etc. However it is still a fun game, and somewhat educational though simplified.TLDR; If you are interested in car mechanics you'll like this game, it isn't ultra detailed but it has enough to be fun and challenging at times. Do not expect 100% accuracy to real life.			"

												Being early in the release of the game and with dlc on the way, this game has impressed me and got me hooked, waiting for more...The detail of the cars is amazing, and while I thought it would be boring, I found myself hooked playing it for the last 4 days.  Troubleshooting and repairing vehicles is recreated in this game, however to a slightly limited scale. If I had to nit pick problems with their product here, it would be only that it is too basic. The idea that you canrebuild a car with a ratchet and socket is unrealistic, and I would like it if they added usable hand and power tools in the future. First and foremost in my mind should be a torque wrench, where you have to look up torque specs and sequence (could be done using the computer?) and having to set the torque value on the wrench and torque in sequence. welders and paint guns could also be neat to use when doing body work or painting. I think automatic transmissions would also be a must add.Im sure some of these features will come in time, but as of right now, im fairly pleased with the game. Id recommend it to any car guy or gear head in an instant.			"

												This game surpasses the original by a large margin. There are a few annoyances, such as:1. Needing to make sure you put replacement parts in the exact spaces they should go. for example, rocker arms. There are 16 of them on a vehicle, if you need to replace 3 of them, you may need to remember exactly where the 3 brand new ones are supposed to go.2. Insane amount of XP required to buy the parking garage, so you can buy cars at auction to flip. 3. Getting some jobs, where you need to paint the the car, even though you still need one or two thousand XP in order to unlock the paint shop.4. A few very minor bugs which happen where it doesn't let you work on anything, because it doesn't think you are looking from the correct position on the car (like looking in the engine bay, to work on the engine).5. Dumbed down some of the dual parts. such as suspension arms, you buy one type of suspension arm, and it works on both the right, and left side of the vehicle, which should normally be impossible.The positive definitely outweigh the negative on this one though. You can take apart far more pieces to the cars than the original game, the parts website has been upgraded with some search filters, and a functioning search box, to find exactly what you're looking for, continuous game play, and you decide what jobs to work on, and when. If you want to work on random job, just go to the phone and pick one of the four options, or after you get your parking garage, you can buy a vehicle at an auction, fix it up, and sell it for a profit.

												this isnt much of a simulator because it takes 1-2 seconds to take the brakes off in reality if the car your working n has been used at all they take upto 1hr to take an bolt off but for being a game to fill in the time its brilliant the graphics are very good and the whole system like building your own garage up (kind of) is good but the xp system is annoying af because ive played arund 8hrs and theres still a lot of stuff that i carnt unlock because of xp like most of the jobs are locked even though they should be easy like replace the filters or somthing but on a different car that you wont get to work on for 20ish hrs of straight gaming. but if your looking to learn a bit about mechanics on cars this is a reat game for not getting your hands dirty but if your looking for a simulator just go down to your locle garage and ask for a job.

												The game is pretty sweet. I have spent 30+ hours on it and still haven't gotten tired of it. One cool thing to add may be an Engine Hoist and Engine Build Stand to allow for out of car builds and placements. Also color customization for more parts ie: Rims, Tinted windows, Brake Calipers, Grilles, Engine Covers, along with other things. I know its a mechanic sim but mechanic Customization sim?? May add some more variation. Also the 1/4 mile track and tuning would be cool to bring back. Over all, GREAT GAME!			"

Also performance upgrades would be pretty cool.Over all I give this game a solid 9/10! There are only a couple of little bugs that I have seen since the alpha release and I am glad that a lot of them have already been ironed out :) I look forward to many cool and new ideas and innovations to be rolled out in future updates and DLC'sHighly recommended!

												Incredibly fun game providing a good load of knowledge about car mechanics - instant fav!I remember playing Street Rod on C64 a long time ago where I could tinker around the car in a very limited way and I loved it. I'm interested in classic cars (now we have the second classic in my family) and that involves lots of real life mechanical repairs and/or adjustments which made me really curious about how to deal with certain mechanical problems. I'm extremely happy to have this game and getting a better overall view of the whole picture through it. Now it' much easier for me to approach towards any upcoming problmes of my classic :)CMS 2015 is literally an interactive learning material combined with game elements. Great thing, don't miss it!Update: I got my first complete restoration finished: a ""Bolt Reptilia"" (which is a Corvette literally) - it was a frenetic experience. Taking it apart bit by bit, remove every single part possible and rebuild it to a shiny 100% condition is just like a pilgrimage. The chrome is fantasic under the hood! And also I guess this is how far the game can go really but repeating this over and over again is a joy.			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is a solid improvement over 2014.  The amount of destructable parts you have is much better than before.  I like that you can now restore cars and work on their bodywork too.  The possibility of DLC should keep the game fresh with new challenges and vehicles unlike 2014 where once you have taken apart a v6 that was really it, game mastered time to move on.  I would recommend this game to people who are curious to see how cars fit together (all be it in a very simplified fashion).   However there are some drawbacks which I hope they iron out soon.1.  The music is annoying and repetitive, please add more stations and the ability to play my mp3s.2.  Colouring things rusty to indicate their condition really gives the game away.  I rarely need to use diagnostic equipement or test drives to isolate the problem.  Also, please stop giving me a list of things I need to replace, this compounds the issue. The whole point of the game to test my diagnostic skills and therefore the xp I get at the end of each job.3.   Using xp to unlock the ad-ons to your workshop like parking, paint booth and test path is stupid.  These should only be based on cash.  The whole xp to unlock thing puts the new car restoration part of game out of reach until the very end (9000xp = 100+ jobs) as you need to unlock the garage parking in order to visit the auctions.  I want to be able to buy a car and work on it slowely as money, skill and ad-ons allow.4.  Turning down jobs/doing a poor doesn't have consequences (except some xp)?!? are you kidding me? Customer rep needs to play a greater part.  As I recall there were repeat customers in CM2014 if my memory serves me correctly.5.  Tutorial needs to be bigger.  This is the part of the game where you give me a list of things that are wrong.  Also, put it outside the campaign.  If people are still struggling to to find things in the campaign perhaps introduce Workshop manuals that can be bought via the PC or Tablet???Well thats enough of the negatives, all in all I still enjoy the game and for only $20 I really think you cant go wrong.  It is different and thats why I like it.  I think the community and the developers will inmprove this game as times goes on.  Get on it. "

												loved cms 2014 love cms 2015 keep up the good work, that being said, upgrades would be nice not just a add turbo option but actual upgrades some will take work to implement but some such as the double carby manifold setup should be really easy for the ohv v8 as it bolts on the same way as the single carby version using very little engine bay room evident with some of the old cars huge engine bay with a engine that leaves alot of room to fill, things like bigger high performance fuel pumps and air filters, different spring stats eg: stiff sport suspension or standard, also as in the picture above new modern engine in old cars would be great aswell as a bigger test track tuning that varies depending on parts installed, different option between modern and old car diffs eg: open diff, limited slip, and locked diff, even some different cosmetic changes like different headlight tail light options ect, adding variety like this would extend the already long playability by a heap being able to build multiple versions of the same car differently for noticable handling and performance differences a more in depth test track like at the ford factory would be nice a offroad section wet areas high speed turns ect, as for the driving controller support for the steering would be awsome along with manual gearbox option and handbrake would add a little more ""screw around with your creations options"" 9.5\10 will score a 10\10 once there a few more changes of which going by the screenshots you already have on your to-do-list once again great work and dont forget to think outside the box itl keep this game addictive and fresh for a long time to come			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2015. You can get rid of almost every part of your car, test your cars, sell them, even go to the Auction House and buy rusted, busted cars. The best part: Fix them and sell them for a WHOLE CHUNK OF MONEY. Also, there is a Garage, Paint Shop, and Diagnostic Test for your cars when you have enough XP. Store your cars in the Garage. Paint your cars in the Paint Shop. Test your car faster on the Diagnostic Test. I'd recommend this game to you. This game may seem a bit expensive, but it's definitely worth the $19.99 you have to pay. I'd buy it if I were you.			"

												I know nothing about cars other than my general knowledge of mechanical engineering. Cars were never an interest to me, and if something is wrong with my car, I always take it to someone to fix- never would I do it myself. Not even an oil change.That introduction aside, I LOVE this game. Even without that real-world interest level, this game is polished, sharp, and always has you eyeing goals in the future without holding your hand.  How rewarding it was when I was first repairing some more difficult issues, and without knowing where some parts were located, stripped down the entire engine of a car looking for those parts only to have to reassemble the whole thing- and get it right! It really is a great balance between simulating the work of a mechanic and gamifying it so that it's not quite so world-dreary and labor intensive.I am quickly banking cash and gaining experience with excitement, as soon in game I'll be able to buy a beat-up car at auction and fix it up to resell for huge profit as a side project in my garage.If you don't know cars, but enjoy simulations, progress, and have a bit of a mechanical-puzzle oriented mind, this is a very, very well done game and I highly recommend it. I may not be a mechanic after this, but at least my eyes won't cross in ignorance when someone says ""catalytic converter"" to me at the garage.Side note: I love the music in this game too. A great mix for working away at the cars in game.			"

												This game is fun and a good tool for locating and replacing parts of a car.  I have some experience in auto repair and other misc. hardware as I'm a maintenance mechanic for the USPS.  Since I'm no expert in repairing cars and I like to learn, I enjoy this game and I've learned quite a bit from the repair jobs I've done so far.At the time of this review I'm only a few hours into it but already I notice some things I would like to see added for extra realism.  For example, hoses (air, radiator and others) battery cables and other major wires, various fluids like washer, brake, transmission etc. and gaskets in the engine would be a nice touch. Something else that would help with the immersion would be to have different size wrenches and sockets with ratchets to use on different size bolts and nuts. I think it's important to have a lot of different parts for the different cars as most cars take different parts in real life; at least for the larger more important parts.  That would be nice to have to look up the make/model in the computer to get the right part. :)  Honestly I don't think it wouldn't be that hard to add that if only they added part numbers to the car part inventory.  Finally I would like to see options of stock, upgraded and high performance parts so you can upgrade the cars you buy.  Overall though the game has potential to take many hours of fun and learning.  Recommended.			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2015. You can get rid of almost every part of your car, test your cars, sell them, even go to the Auction House and buy rusted, busted cars. The best part: Fix them and sell them for a WHOLE CHUNK OF MONEY. Also, there is a Garage, Paint Shop, and Diagnostic Test for your cars when you have enough XP. Store your cars in the Garage. Paint your cars in the Paint Shop. Test your car faster on the Diagnostic Test. I'd recommend this game to you. This game may seem a bit expensive, but it's definitely worth the $19.99 you have to pay. I'd buy it if I were you.			"

												I really recommend this game. You can fix cars (obviously), you can buy cars at auction, restore cars you bought at auction, sell or collect cars you fixed after buying from auction and you can drive them too! How cool!There's lots of parts to rip out of your clients cars and put back in. I also like the decent amount of DLC that's coming our way lately. DLC is a must to make game more fun though.PS. I really hope for a multiplayer in some way at some point. :)			"

												Game is okay, spent some time with it and not too shabby though the features beyond picking and placing car parts is extremely limited. Processes in the game become obsolete as you gain money (get to the buying cars stage and you never have to go back to diagnosing or repairing other people's cars, just get yours to 100%). 4/10As far as advertising/exploitative marketing practices go, steer clear of obviously lacking expansion packs. The new Bentley pack has 5 reviews that share similar timestamps, similar usernames, no time played on the game, and all positive statements. Buyer beware.			"

												This is a fantastic game. If you like to work on cars.If you played car mechanic sim 2014, you know what you're in for, but now engines are detailed. Pistons, Crankshafts, Pushrods, Camshafts, all can now be disassembled. There's also bodywork that can be fixed, more engine configurations, This is essentially a direct upgrade of 2014. There's now an auction mode, and the devs have been stedialy releasing content as the game goes along.The only negative is you still can't rotate the camera on an axis.If you like working on cars, This game is worth a buy.

												It's even more realistic than Car Mechanic Simulator 2014. There's no hand-holding, but that said... it's FUN! Yes, you may have to do a Google search for a part here or there on your first few jobs, but it's an excellent learning tool to develop a basic understanding of critical car components.The controls are incredibly intelligent and easy, and the ability to buy upgrades every 1,000xp is an excellent addition.I really hope they do a Car Mechanic Simulator 2016, and I hope they go even deeper than before.This is one of the most rewarding games I have ever played.

												This is a FANTASTIC follow-up of CMS 2014! I'm proud to see these devs were able to make the quota on KickStart! Awesome job, guys! Anyways, like any game in production it has its pros and it has its cons, but the negatives are miniscule, but can add to some frustration after a case of beer and lack of sleep. Here's my honest opinion:Pros: Great Playability Great Detail Beautiful Graphics Paint Shop with Custom Colors AUCTIONS!!!!! Multiple Jobs (3 to ~4) at once Tool Upgrades Shop Upgrades Fun Test Track New Cars Greater Variety of Cars did I say AUCTIONS?!?!!!!!!!!  (and also restorations)Cons: Limited Customization       rims, engine upgrades/swaps, interior are all unavailable as of this review. I was looking forward to being able to soup        up a sweet ride, maybe slap a v8 in a little eco-car or twin-turbo a 'Mustang', but I'm optimistic that some of these            will be factored in, in the future. Camera      it's a bit wonky at times. It's nice, during certain circumstances it works, but the automatic zoom and movement gets         frustrating at times. It is somewhat customizable, but still can become frustrating. Inventory      organization is mostly irrelevant. You can search between catagories (engine, drivetrain, suspension), which is       convenient, but one thing I was expecting to be implimented: vehicle catagories. Every time you go to a parts store,      you're required to inform the make/model/year, etc. If i had the ability to catagorize my inventory based on the       specific vehicle/engine type or based on the job, that would be significantly better. I can't tell you how many times       I've bought parts, tried to clear out my sh**-list parts, and ended up selling my recently purchased replacements.Limited Soundtrack      I will admit that some of the music is half-way decent and that it is a nice change from CMS 2014, however the list of       songs is quite short and they're all some form of a technoish sort. It's not a big fault of the game (being that you can      simply walk over to the radio and turn it off) but I, personally, would like to see some little-known artists of all       varieties of genres, not just Techno. (Rock, Hip-Hop, Country, etc.) When I'm in my irl personal garage, I have my       select types of music based on a variety of factors and situations and mood. That's part of what drives me to stick on            a job. It may be a miniscule fator to some, but in my experience, music really has an effect on whatever task or              duty is at hand.Altogether, this game is FUN! If you like cars, tearing them apart, or just want to gain a general knowledge on what they're made of, try this game out! It's quite enjoyable and will keep you planted in front of your monitor for hours, driving you to add just one more job, make just another couple extra bucks for that sweet restoration you just spent half your wages on at the local auction house. I love this game, I love the whole concept of a virtual garage (mostly because I can't break anything when i throw a ratchet across the shop). Thanks for reading! Hope it helps!P.S. Buy it. P.S.S.  Your wife should be used to you splurging on ""unnessecary"" purchases by now if you're really a car guy.			"

												Not accurate and too easy.This game seems to be aimed at people how dont know anything about cars, the type of people who wouldn't play this.this game is lacking many features, there is no wiring, no abs sensors, the engine bays are pretty much empty, no wipers or wiper moters, no interior lights, no exterior light bulbs, no fuses, no airbags or other SRS systems, no MULTI-METER no oscilloscope you can only use 2-post ramps, and you cannot open the gear box to work on the transmission you just have to replace the whole unit, same goes for all other parts they cannot be taken apart, there are many other things missing but it would take me all day to list them.BUT, for somone who wants a basic game its not bad, the graphics are pretty decent but the gameplay is lacking and I hope that a new verson of this game comes out where all the parts are present and where you can strip parts to work on them. Bare in mind I played on the harder mode the game offers so I'm going to imagine that the easy mode holds your hand.But I'm still recomending the game as it's clearly intended for children who would be overwelmed by too many parts.

												9.5/10!This game is a 100% upgrade from the already good Car Mechanic Simulator 2014. I played a few hours and realized, It has hardly any loading screens! Also the variety of cars is a step up too, Plus the many more detailed parts that have been added its like your working a real car. In this installment of the series you can have 2 cars in your shop at a time (3 If you know how to do it ;) You also can paint cars and replace the body panels as well. So what you waiting for? Go grab a copy.(PS: I have played the game for 7-8 Hours its just I play offline and steam doesn't keep track that way.)			"

												It's fun to hear the problem of the car (""rattling noise from the engine bay""), diagnose it regarding to the problem and then fix it. Also you got to upgrade your garage with a diagnose-track, a lot of utilities (OBD-Diagnose, multimeter, pressurepump,..) and you can even buy and sell cars later in the game. You learn some things about the parts of the engine, the chassis and so on. It's quite well made and more or less comparable to real life situations.BUT The game just advances waaay too slow, it includes a lot of grinding for experience-points and you see yourself just fixing the same thing over and over again just to get that paintjob-room and in the end it's not that special.It's also not really rewarding as it just takes too much effort to also get the little things. + I'm really tired of changing the f-ing tyres (haha).I paid 4€ for it, I would say I'd recommend it for that price because it kept me busy for one day but after that I couldn't really motivate myself again to continue.But as the normal price is 20€ I can't recommend it at that point.

												Huge improvement over 2014 and I like the fact that you can now have three cars in your garage at once instead of one. Its also nice that there is no more loading screens after you completed a mission and going on to the next one. I also like the new Visual Tuning DLC Pack so it is now time for a Performance Parts DLC Pack and also bringing performance tuning back like in 2014 and a DLC where you can do a 1/4 with the cars and a 4X4 pack like in 2014. But other than that great game. Its also nice that you can now buy upgrades for your garage. The only thing that is a downfall for me is that you cant work your way up to having better garages and that you use one garage all the time and also the fact that you need 9000 XP Points before you can sell cars on auction and lastly that it seems like all the wiring has been removed from the engine bay and that the parts are no longer connected to each other like for example the air filter is no longer connected with a pipe from the air filter to the engine etc. 8/10 :)			"

												Ca Mechanic Sim 2015 is one of those games that you don't think you'll understand or do well at simply because you only know the basics or nothing about cars.  This game is very easy to pick up, and has things to help show you what you should be doing.  The game goes on forever, however, the missions do get repetitive, and after unlocking everything, there's nothing left to save up for.CMs 15 is probably one of my top favorite games.

												This is a fantastic game! Very addictive. You just want to fix one last problem before you stop playing. But after you fix it, you end up going on to the next issue. I decided to test my knowledge a little and ditch the tutorial. I didn't do too bad, but I messed up when I first started playing. They should be more specific in the description of the issue. The first problem I addressed in game was the front wheel hub. Well, teaching myself how to play, this simple task took a little longer than it should have. After getting the front wheel and suspension all taken apart and getting to the wheel hub, I realized it was for the other ♥♥♥♥ing side (-.-)12/10 would recommend and I will be investing a lot of time into this game. If you like mechanical stuff or are just interested in seeing how cars work, do yourself a favor and get this game.			"

												A good relaxing game that can get a bit tiresome and repetitive. This game gets far better once you are able to go to auctions and buy cars to restore and customise. A big recommendation that makes the game better is to go into the game files and rename all the cars to their real life counterparts, it just gives you a better idea of what you are working on. Overall I'd give it a 7/10 without DLC and a 8/10 with DLC just for the extra vehicles as they are a bit more well known such as the Ford Mustang.  "

												This game is pretty good. I got it with all of the DLCs up to this point on sale and it was well worth it. Even though it is a ""simulator"" it is limited in what it simulates. It does let you take in repair jobs and remove old parts to replace them with newer ones. You have to put the cars on the lift to be able to access certain areas of the car; other parts of the car are only accessible under the hood. You have to remove certain parts first in order to get to other parts. You have to order replacement parts for the repair jobs you do. What the game does not simulate are things like the following: best practices, like disconnecting the battery before doing jobs like removing the starter and such. You don't have to torque done wheel lugs in a star pattern. You can't bulk order parts like spark plugs and oil filters that you are going to regularly need in order to get better pricing. As a matter of fact, you cannot even shop around from multiple suppliers to get better deals on parts. Another example is that you have an oil pan to catch oil when you drain the oil sump. However, if you use this, it is solely for role play purposes; you don't get a huge mess on the floor if you drain the oil with nothing to catch it. Also, you can remove the drain pan under the engine without first draining all the oil out.Think of this game as more of a 3-D puzzle game. You will learn the basics of what car parts are, where they are on the vehicle and how they fit with other parts. You won't really learn any real auto mechanics, though.I have really enjoyed this game, because there is always some new goal to work toward. As you get more experience and money, you can upgrade your tools and also your shop to make diagnosis and repairs easier and faster. Eventually you can buy your own car at auction and then ""soup it up"" but I haven't gotten to that point yet.This game looks good and the controls make sense, though there are some little annoyances like having to always use the ESC key to close windows instead of the key that you used to open the window. The music is terrible but you can turn it off.This is a good one if you like cars and want to pretend like you have your own shop. No bruised knuckles or greasy hands either!			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is a great game if you like to tear apart cars and then put them back together! I really like CM15 more than CM14 the graphics and abilities are much better in CM15. If you would like a somewhat insight to what it's like to work on cars, this game is good for that although it is lacking some parts such as gaskets, wires and a few other things that are found under the hood of common cars. I would recommend playing this game because it is fun and there is no need to cheat since you can earn money quickly, and grow your business fast, having 3 car slots open keeps you moving right along and a to do list it helpful to keep you wondering where in the car you will be next!

												I have been playing this for a good few days now, and It is a good game to kill bordam but that is it, its missing so many basic things out even a noob like myself knows, and some parts in this game should be mixable as they are in real life, we should also have sinbins for lets say spraying a custoemrs car another colour, more cars for the default game is really needed, sorry but making us by a few cars as DLC's is a rip off, open the game to the moders also you have a hole useless modding option.Custom options like better paint, vinals, inside of the car, better wheels and wheel colours, lights and so on, your mean to be simulating, why havenet any of these cars come in smashed, crash damage is a comman problem and a RSA car wouldn't come with a list of problems you would have to find them and see if the car was safe, in the UK you need a MOT also maybe adding options like this in to the game I am sure the US also has a car safty check it must past per year to drive.Its a OK game but thats all it is, its not really a Simulator as its not really simulating anything, Also stop making ever car have the same frame or engin, work on your moddles ALOT, add more flaver, maybe even add hotrodding and low ridding options to the game to make older recks worth restoring.

												I'm not sure why I got this game as I have little knowledge with cars beyond regular maintenace. At first it was a little intimidating working on my first few orders but it starts you off with simple things like replacing Fuel, Air, and Oil filters, and other simple tasks. Then you begin to work with different vehicles and much more complicated issues where you will need to competely break down the powertrain.Of course it's much more simple and MUCH faster than in real life, but it's been a lot of fun so far. Especially with the unlockable upgrades such as unlocking a Paint room, and getting more tools for diagnosising problems, and being able to repair parts efficently without ordering new ones.I'm still pretty new to the game with a few hours of gameplay, but I think it's a lot of fun. The visuals are great, the sounds of a car lift going up and down are great, as well as the music.			"

												Only played this for a short time so far, done a few jobs, but so far it looks amazing, has pretty good detail in both graphics and parts/cars. Its unlike any simulation ive played before, you kind of get the feeling of being a mechanic, which is cool. I would recommend this game to anyone. Great job guys, glad i backed this on kickstarter			"

												Mehhh is my fist word... So I went in to this with high hopes, but they were quickly dashed.  Don't get me wrong it is a fun game and I have spent some hours playing it.  But I just don't see an end game.  Ton's of hrs spent grinding away fixing cars and then the auciton is a joke prices go thougth the roof for a POS.  I'm gonna give this game some more time and see if it imporves or if some mod saves it but other then that I woudn't recommend it.			"

												This game is great! Dev team are nice and helpful, and they fixed my stupidity with a problem. The problem is (if u guys have it) was that if u have Vsync off you have troubles moving. But on to the game. Its fun, interesting, and overall very educational on cars. I expected much from this game seeing how good the CMS 2014 game. But i was wondering (seeing how some sequals arent good) that this would be a flop. But it turned out great. Graphics are good, FPS is good, and most is good. The only thing i dislike about the game is the camera in inspect mode is a little wonky at times but i get by. Overall i would give this game a 9.5/10. Great game!PC Specs:EVGA GTX 680 2gbIntel Core I5 3570KGigabyte GA-Z77X 6GB/s8GB Ram			"

												I had downloded Car Mechanic 2014, the game was abit slow but still enjoyed the game, then i heard about they're bringing Car Mechanic 2015, i thought i was gunna have the same problem, then i seen the clip, all the stuff from 2014 and then some, i was eager to download it. Now i downloaded it I'm glad i did, the graphics are just fantastic, the jobs you get, i would recommend this game to anyone and everyone, I'm addicted to it, if you loved Car Mechanic 2014, you'll love this even more.

												First of all, being a Car DIY person, I do know a fair bit about cars.  It is also the reason why I bought this game in the first place.Car components are held together like puzzles.  Being a car mechanics (in this game), you need to figure out how to take components apart, inspect them and replace if necessary.  At first, it was kind of fun.  Especially it takes away the problems in real world e.g: cables in the way, not enough rooms to work with, bolts rusted up or even strips away.However, after about 20 hours of gameplay, car fixing is so repetitive and the fun kind of disappeared.  In my save, I had 250K cash trying to figure out what to do with it...  Sure you can buy cars from auction, refurbish it, then take it to drag race but that's about it.The other thing I don't like is loading time.  I had this game on SSD (8Gb ram, i5 4570 CPU) but each time I switch from location to location it will take 30 seconds to load.  Its like from Main menu into game 30 seconds (your garage), then from your garage to auction house, another 30 seconds.  I felt like I'm playing this game on CD or something.Game music is kind of cool initially, but after 5 hours or so, you would want to mute in-game music and play your own stuffs.Overall, I do have a bit of fun with this game but game-life is a bit short.  Consider I bought this game while it was on sales (75% off) I think this game is reasonable.  The DLC tries to expand the game-life a bit, but personally, I don't think it succeeded.			"

												Ahh, another year, another CMSI was looking foward for this (CMS 2k15). In all honesty, the game blew me away.Not only modern day shitboxes are on the game, but classic muscle cars are on here, which is right up my alley. They also grew a pair of balls by adding a V8 and making an L4 with and without DOHC (Dual Over-Head Cam). The only, and I mean ONLY bad thing about this game is the XP system. Final gameplay rating, 9/10.I also gave a brief description on realism of the parts on CMS2k14, so might as well make one here amiorite?Anywho, this game blew CMS'14 out of the water. They moved the oil filter to the bottom, which is what I stated. Not only that, but they added more parts to work on, including ABS, even MORE rubber bushings, sterring rack, and much, much more. I'd rate the realism 10/10.Final rating: 9.5/10. I highly suggest getting this for people into cars, or just want to learn some basics, like oil changes, brakes, etc.			"

I love that the Dev's made this version to except new cars in the main game and not be made to play sepret expantion alone... I love that the Dev's are still adding thing to the base game such as the Tablet, new car and music for the radio. They took what they learned from the first game and the feed back from the fans and made a much better game. Rock on Dev's. I backed you in kickstarter and would do so agian with confadents. :)			"

												Okay so i have been thinking a long time before i thought about writing this review because i want it to be as truthfull as possible. So i have around 33 hours + on this game as i am writing at the moment and i think that if you are looking for a car game where you want to tune and fix cars, you are kinda on track and off track.Because CMS 15 is about fixing cars, but there is so little tuning options and customising options when it comes down to it. As well, when i started this game i bought because of the restoration part... But i got dissapointed, there is endless of fixing cars on contract before you can even get to an auction, you need way to much xp to unlock everything as well. If i could choose i would have wanted to do it more simple like in real life, that you have to pay and expand you way, and not with xp and pay. And except that there is a lot of cars to choose from which is a big +, but it's kinda all the same, because there is not much diffrent motors or car parts. And it explains itself because it is a Car Mechanic game.So what is the Pros and Cons?Pros--Many diffrent car models-Fantastic looking Grapichs-It is what it is supposed to  be-You have a lot of diffrent things that you can do on a car-A lot of rimsCons-You need some damn good patience-It circulates in the same jobs and same parts all the time with small exeption of diffrent parts to switch out-Have to get Xp to unlock, paintshop, dyno, test areas and auction house, as well to pay money for service areas-To little custom car parts, and diffrent ways to tune.-Having to buy all the content because it is DLC and not just normal contentAnd that was it, this is my opinion the game could be much more but it is what it is			"

												I would really recommend Car Mechanic Simulator for everyone who is interested in cars and how they work. If you have the previous version of this game (Car Mechanic Simulator 2014) and you like it, I still recommend buying the new version since there is a significant update over last version: cars now have much more parts, engines and car bodies can be disassembled and repaired. Now in later stages of game you can buy cars, repair them and sell for profit. The game today also got a FREE content update in form of a new car to repair, the developers said there will be more free content updates. I as a car fan find this game really enjoyable and recommend this to everyone who is interested in cars.			"

												Okay so i have been thinking a long time before i thought about writing this review because i want it to be as truthfull as possible. So i have around 33 hours + on this game as i am writing at the moment and i think that if you are looking for a car game where you want to tune and fix cars, you are kinda on track and off track.Because CMS 15 is about fixing cars, but there is so little tuning options and customising options when it comes down to it. As well, when i started this game i bought because of the restoration part... But i got dissapointed, there is endless of fixing cars on contract before you can even get to an auction, you need way to much xp to unlock everything as well. If i could choose i would have wanted to do it more simple like in real life, that you have to pay and expand you way, and not with xp and pay. And except that there is a lot of cars to choose from which is a big +, but it's kinda all the same, because there is not much diffrent motors or car parts. And it explains itself because it is a Car Mechanic game.So what is the Pros and Cons?Pros--Many diffrent car models-Fantastic looking Grapichs-It is what it is supposed to  be-You have a lot of diffrent things that you can do on a car-A lot of rimsCons-You need some damn good patience-It circulates in the same jobs and same parts all the time with small exeption of diffrent parts to switch out-Have to get Xp to unlock, paintshop, dyno, test areas and auction house, as well to pay money for service areas-To little custom car parts, and diffrent ways to tune.-Having to buy all the content because it is DLC and not just normal contentAnd that was it, this is my opinion the game could be much more but it is what it is			"

												At first, it was hard to figure out the controls and what everything was, but once you know what you're doing, this game is extrememly fun. It's a great game for car enthusiasts and is relaxing to play casually if you just want to take your time repairing and driving. The only bad part is even with the 4 dlc I own, there isn't very much content for replayability or incentive to progress after about 25 hours of playing.			"

												While this game is fun, it gets to repeatitive. Unlocking harder jobs means trudging through many simple ones that seem to become more the same. Plus, unlocking all the equipment you would like to use means leveling up 1000xp for each unlock. I've been a mechanic for 16 years, went to school for it. Yet some objects are out of place or even missing. No battery cables to disconnect, not being able to know the status of a part without taking it to a test track even though many parts CAN be checked on a lift such as ball joints and tie rod ends. The worst part is the fact that this game wouldn't work on my old PC even though it met the requirements. All because it was a Win 7 32-bit PC. Now that Im running win 10 64-bit, I realize the game wasn't worth the $10 I paid.			"

												Another great edition to an already good game especially with the DLC's.The one complaint I have though is I think this game is meant for only high end computers because if you have a slow computer you have to tone down the graphics so much it may remove some enjoyment.If this was a racing game I can understand why they would want such high detail graphics,however considering this is more of a puzzle game it does not make sense.If you have a slow computer CMS2014 may be a better choice.

												i bought this game to purely learn about the inside of a car and to see how to replace things like a real mechanic,  and guys i will say I'm impressed.   I've worked on real cars before and this replicates it to the bone marrow.  This game has a lot of scenarios so you basicly figure out any type of problem that could happen to your car.  One other thing the creator actually makes you figure out where the wared out parts are.  There is no guide line to tell you where the part is located.  You either will have to undo the car peace by peace to see where the malfunctioned part is or simply look on the internet to see where its located at and then do it in the game and trust me your going to learn a freakin lot on how to do stuff yourself.  For christ sakes if you just want to learn how to do a perfect oil change.  Get this game!			"

												I had no knowledge about car parts or any mechanic stuff, i bought this because simply i love cars. And oh boy i got hooked. And here's why i love this game so much:Story:You're a car mechanic and you fix'em cars.Presentation:This game didn't really go for photorealism despite being a simulator, and some parts look really funky at times, but most of the time it doesn't really matter because this game runs really smooth and you don't need a beast to run this very smoothly so good optimaztion there. And mostly i didn't really cared about funky looking parts because i had so much fun. Oh, i almost forgot to talk about how much detail and effort has put into this game. You will be surpised to see how detailed the car parts are even thorugh they didn't went for the photorealism.Gameplay:Gameplay in this game is so addicting and fun for both car lovers and problem solvers, so in the first few jobs the game tells you what to fix, but 3-4h in the game gives less infomation about the problem and you need to dig(or shall i say, screw) your way into the car to find the problem and replace it with new parts. Also this game really teaches you about car parts and how to remove them and put'em back in. It is a very fun and addicting IF you're a car lover like me or a problem solver, novice mechanic, or people who like puzzle games. Well if you're not one of those people i suggest stay away from this game because it's not for you.Overall:Overall this game is perfect for Car lovers, problem solvers, novice mechanic, and people who like puzzle games. For those people this game gets 9/10 BUY THIS GAME NOW. But if you're not one of those people do not purchase this game. I myself would put a recommended review because this game deserves more positive reviews.			"

Was fast, was simple, fun to play. This game is going to make you nervous. Mainly if you forget to backup your savegames. Isn´t in DOCUMENTS folder. It´s real hard to find.

												This is a pretty damn fine game: finishing jobs and upgrading stuff around the 'shop is satisfying game, the economy is well- balanced, and the cars look gorgeous. However, I upgraded my OS several months back (to OSX El Capitan 10.11.2- I know, I'm trying to game on a Mac, so shoot me), and the game completely broke. Now, I can't get past the loading screen without the game crashing, with no way to alt- tab out of it or otherwise get out of it- the screen just freezes, with any audio from other programmes still running in the background. I recently picked up CMS 2014 on sale as well, and had the same problems. If this problem gets fixed, so I can actually play the game, I'll definitely try to change my review to focus on the fun aspects of the game, but until then I can't recommend it.			"

												+Nice graphicsGood optimizationMany cars with different types of suspension, engines, drivetrain...Easy to learn and play-The game could be more challengingthey've added ""expert mode"" in which part names, condition and bolt highlighting are left outit's still pretty easy to assemble parts as there's a hologram that shows where the part is to be placedeven in ""expert mode""Crucial parts like air tubes, fuel and brake lines are missingIt's still a lot of fun to play but it could be more realistic and difficult			"

												While this game is fun, it gets to repeatitive. Unlocking harder jobs means trudging through many simple ones that seem to become more the same. Plus, unlocking all the equipment you would like to use means leveling up 1000xp for each unlock. I've been a mechanic for 16 years, went to school for it. Yet some objects are out of place or even missing. No battery cables to disconnect, not being able to know the status of a part without taking it to a test track even though many parts CAN be checked on a lift such as ball joints and tie rod ends. The worst part is the fact that this game wouldn't work on my old PC even though it met the requirements. All because it was a Win 7 32-bit PC. Now that Im running win 10 64-bit, I realize the game wasn't worth the $10 I paid.			"

												Another great edition to an already good game especially with the DLC's.The one complaint I have though is I think this game is meant for only high end computers because if you have a slow computer you have to tone down the graphics so much it may remove some enjoyment.If this was a racing game I can understand why they would want such high detail graphics,however considering this is more of a puzzle game it does not make sense.If you have a slow computer CMS2014 may be a better choice.

												This is a pretty damn fine game: finishing jobs and upgrading stuff around the 'shop is satisfying game, the economy is well- balanced, and the cars look gorgeous. However, I upgraded my OS several months back (to OSX El Capitan 10.11.2- I know, I'm trying to game on a Mac, so shoot me), and the game completely broke. Now, I can't get past the loading screen without the game crashing, with no way to alt- tab out of it or otherwise get out of it- the screen just freezes, with any audio from other programmes still running in the background. I recently picked up CMS 2014 on sale as well, and had the same problems. If this problem gets fixed, so I can actually play the game, I'll definitely try to change my review to focus on the fun aspects of the game, but until then I can't recommend it.			"

												I do like this game, and I am a retired auto repair shop owner.  I bought it in alpha and enjoyed it and played it a lot early on.  But after a while the challenge diminishes rapidly.  It only takes a few times to learn a car, and new cars are not much of a challenge.  The DLC of new vehicles are expensive and there should be many more vehicles in the base game.  The vehicles are typically based on a basic format so if you have 4WD DLC your just getting one basic vehicle with some minor changes between them.  They represent different companies but are all designed the same.  The only really different vehicle is the Maluch, and its, just weird.  All in all I played over 120 hours.  You have to have the visual tuning DLC to make the game playable, but they charge seperately for it, so you know what your in for with this game.			"

Was fast, was simple, fun to play. This game is going to make you nervous. Mainly if you forget to backup your savegames. Isn´t in DOCUMENTS folder. It´s real hard to find.

												If you played CMS2014 and enjoyed the basic premise, you'll enjoy CMS2015.  CMS2014 was basically a series of puzzles where you're given a car and have to find the broken parts and replace them, but Endless mode left you wanting more because all it did was throw broken cars with no explanation of what might be wrong at you and make you tear your hair out trying to find that one busted rubber bushing.CMS2015 fixes that.  The entire game is like Endless mode from CMS2014, but now there are dynamically generated jobs that have basic problem descriptions (Car is loud, handles funny, engine keep cutting out, etc) to help limit how much of the car you have to tear apart to find the problem.  2015 also adds basic bodywork and the ability to paint cars (you have to unlock this part of your garage).The most fun (and profit) in my opinion, comes later.  You can, after you add a parking garage to your shop, go to auto auctions and bid on junkers, then restore them and sell them for profit.  The more you fix up, the more money the car is worth when you sell it.Compared to CMS2014, the cars have many, many more parts.  You can unlock some new diagnostic tools (compression gauge and voltmeter) and some old ones make a return (diagnostic path and road test, which is much improved).They're doing a wonderful job listening to their playerbase as they move forward with future updates (they've added some features and fixed some bugs at the request of the community already, the game has only been out a few weeks and they've released over half a dozen patches), and they're planning on adding more.  Chiptuning hasn't returned yet, but they're looking for good tuning ideas to implement instead of 2014's three-bar system, and they're taking votes on which cars to put into the first paid DLC pack.  They've released two free cars already.CMS2015 does everything CMS2014 did right, and fixes just about everything CMS2014 did wrong.  If you had fun playing 2014, or you enjoy knowing How Stuff Works, you really can't go wrong with this.It's not AAA GOTY, but it's a wonderful casual game.			"

												In many ways this is a leaps and bounds improvement over the 2014 version, however one thing I think it's missing is some sort of achievement or goal.  You play, fixing cars, solving problems, even going as far as buying wrecks and restoring them... but by the time I got there, I kinda of wondered what the point was.  At least the previous version started you small and you could upgrade to bigger and better shops as it progressed... this one, you get 1 shop and the cost of upgrading it and XP requirements are almost too easy.  Still, it's inexpensive and a good time sink... but don't be surprised if you reach a point where 'what now?' has you moving on to a different game.			"

Posted: December 3, 2015
												This is my Review for the Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 (CMS15) after playing it for about 10 Hours now (which Steam did not record correct, im sorry). Interface I´ve read some of the Negative Comments to this Game and most of them ctiticise the Interace of CMS15 f.e as ""poor Choice"". I´ve played CMS14 (the Game from last Year) and have to say, compared to the Interace from that the new Interface has some advantages BUT also some Disadvantages.Clearly the New Interface looks more Fancy and more Dynamic then the old one. The old one had always the Feeling of something static is going on with no Dynamic in its moves (f.e when looking closly to a Wheel etc). The new Interface solve this Problem with a lot of good Animations and good Grafics (comapred to CMS14). It also feels a bit smoother in its Animation, which offers a Great feeling when using it.The New Interface is also easier to handel for People who are new to the Car Mechanics Simulator, for Players of the Old one its kind of hard to get used to it, but personally i think thats still an advantage, cause its overall better in the handling.But there are some negative Things i dont want to Skip here: I persoanlly dont like the new Highlighting of Parts at all. Its sometimes very hard to Spot something you have simply not seen, if you want to remove a certain part. Also the Assembeling and Disassembeling is really hard now, cause the Highlighting is pretty poor and bad. Another Thing that is really annoying to me, is the Fact that you cant switch the Conditions View on while working on the Car. That was possible in CMS14 and made it a lot easier to get the Parts selectet you want to select. Now that Function is missing and its quiet Hard sometimes to get the Parts selected or even spot them.But overall its acceptable for Fans in my Opinion, cause it makes the Game only Harder not runins it. Gameplay The Gameplay is much much better then CMS14 for me. The Cars are more Complex, you can Filter the Categorys from the Shop on the Computer, you have different Things to Buy, Customize and so on. And you can Finaly reject Jobs that you dont like, and thats cool.I dont know how many times i had to remove a entire Gearbox from a V6 4x4 in CMS14 and was simply♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of it (cause its very low payout and very hard work), so finally i can skip Orders like that, yea :D.Players who played the old CMS14 will like the new CMS15 very much in my Opinion, cause its solves a lot of Problem CMS14 had Sound This is a very negative Part for me. I´m a huge Fan of Music and Soundtracks and listen to Music like 5 to 6 Hours a Day. The Soundtrack from CMS14 had something for most of the People. Some Rock & Metal for Guys with a ""harder"" Taste, some Techno Music for People who like that or some Dubstep for People who enjoy the Electrical Music as well as some good other Tracks. Sure not all Tracks where for everyone, but you could say that not 1 was really ""Bad"".In CMS15 my Ears are bleeding to be honest, cause this Soundtrack is really awefull. Not only that there are some good Rocky Songs are missing, not the whole Soundtrack is more like a Techno / Dubstep / and things like that Album. F.e there is this Song from a Girl with some Douett Part in it (the only one) and i´ve never heard a Professional Singer in a long time, who misses so much Notes like she did in only 1 Song. And this Pattern of awefull Music is applied to all Tracks in CMS15.If there is CMS16 planned (dont know it atm) please take more Time for the Soundtrack and dont choose this Crap again. Its nice that you want to support ""little"" Musicans (as far as i see they are all not that Popular), but please choose those who have talent :). Conclusion I´ve said a lot of positive Things, a lot of negative things and a bunch of awefully things about CMS15. Now its the final moment: Would i reccomend it or not. I have to say, personally, i would reccomend it for Poeple who played CMS14 and people who like Simulator Games. Its a good, nice puzzle Game which can provide Hours of Fun and you can acutally learn something about Business Management and Cars as well (not much, but at least you now know where your Cars Gearbox is right?).

												I'm on the fence about this one honestly. Got a little time into it and while it's pretty neat, there's not a whole lot they let you do. You basically get two options when you repair the cars, either fasctory parts or performance parts. There, you only get one option each. Campaing is all right, nothing to get excited about. I'd LOVE to see more variety when it comes to the parts you can use and the cars themselves. Perhaps allowing workshop content would greatly contribute to most of my issues, but that's on the dev end. Verdict? Get it on sale, otherwise pass.			"

												Dumb, boring and repetitive. Never was big on cars which may make my opinion bias but i thought id give it a go to see if i could learn something.All in all i now have less of a an infactuation for cars.With my par for a good game being $1 an hour i spent $10/hr as i only played for 2 hours before i wanted to hang myself.Would not recommend			"

												Great idea. The trouble is you don't play a good idea. Your clicking parts on and off a car. All the cars use the same set of parts. There are some tuning options but they are very limited. Don't think you can chop and change engines etc. Limited choice on wheels with no real choice on width or diameter. So you click parts on and off  a car. Then you get to set it up on the dyno. This is 3 buttons you fiddle with till the mixture is right. Doesn't say what you are actually doing and its so random you might as well throw a dice. Then theres the drag strip. Throttle is just a button so if you have a car with decent power your either spinning into the wall or short shifting gears so you never get a meaningful time anyway. Like I said a great idea that very soon becomes very boring.			"

												Slow, progress is painfully slow, so slow it's like having a dead end boring job in real life, Except you don't get paid, so... total waste of time. The game is fun, initially. It's fun when I fix the first car, it's fun when I fix the first complex part. But, you'll need to fix the same boring simple car, screw and unscrew the same spot thousands of times, BEFORE you can even get to play with the second car.Just speed up the experience and money! or just open up all the cars!Seriously, why?Game developers don't get paid extra for holding gamers playing longer (by wasting time). It's a single player game, and a car mechanic game, there's literally nothing to brag about for spending(wasting) so much time on it.It's the desert bus game with a better interface. Playing it should be considered performance art.			"

												Dull and boring gameplay. You accept repair contracts, get a list of parts to change, and then proceed to do it.The interface is clunky and not intuitive and the graphics are nothing to write home about.Might be a nice way to teach someone the basics about car parts if that is the desired goal, but that's more or less the only reason I could think of to play this game.0/10. would much rather repair real cars.

												This felt more like a demo than a full-fledged game. People bring their cars in and tell you what seems to be wrong. You unscrew an endless series of bolts, find the faulty part, order a replacement, then put everything back together. The game uses color cues to tell you which part is faulty, and guides you as your reconstruct the relevant part of the vehicle, so there is very little challenge. It got old after about an hour.3/10			"

												this is a truely unique gaming experience, i love the accuracy , the music , the selection of cars. everything about this game screams professionalism. wether youve never worked on a car in your life , or youre an aspiring mechanic, this game has something for everyone. its a very simple concept but its done authentically here. you feel like its YOUR garage. when you work on a vehicle its exciting, you can diegnose using different tools , you can buy upgrades to your shop as you level up, you also level up your skills . you can even unlock your own parking lot , which you can use to store vehicles that you buy. i cant recommend this game enough , try it for yourself. I promise you wont regret it.			"

												You basically take apart cars and replace broken parts (which are shown as covered in rust). As you gain experiemce you will unlock ability to repair parts rather than replace them with new ones. Also you gain access to some diagnostic tools which willl tell you what is broken, but you will rarely use them because they'll just color code what you already see as rusty as thus broken. First 10 hours of the game you are likely to have lots of fun, but soon after you will inadvertly realize you have just been taking apart 3 variants of engines and 3 variations of undercarriages stuffed in different chasis all that time. There is little progression to speak of. In fact the only difference awaiting you at the end is option to buy  broken cars and sell them after you have fixed them the same way as completing the repair job. There's no customization, no tuning and virtually no driving cars in this game. If you're looking for that you will be dissapointed. If you're looking for simplistic puzzler to kill 10-15 hours in you will enjoy this title. If you're looking for something akin to classic games like street rod, you will find this title dull and repetitive.			"

												the first one was better. it has way more realistic repair orders and you actually diagnosed cars. this one your car as a problem in the description and when you look at your repair order it just shows a list of parts that you are supposed to replace instead of having to actually look at the car and figure out what is wrong. the learning curve is dumb, the first few jobs are replace timing belts or cradle bushings. im sure eveyone online know exactly how to do that... should start out with lower level jobs like changing a set of brakes or doing an oil change. it would help people that dont know how to work on cars ease their way into this and maybe even learn something. another thing is it should have a budget per car that looses money the longer you take.

												It gets incredibly boring incredibly fast. It's incredibly simplistic, and unless you have a thorough knowledge of how cars work, you'll get lost trying to find which parts you need to swap out. The mechanic of taking off certain parts so you can access others is neat, and it creates a more accurate simulation, but for the game, I feel it makes things way too time-consuming. This game is not worth the money I spent on it, and should really be free.			"

												Can't recommend this1. Too much grind - about 9 hours of hard work until you get your own parking and ability to actually buy own cars.2. Awful loading time - every time scene changes or car loads prepare to wait for about 20 seconds minimum3. FPS - it barely runs at 60 fps on GTX 970, that's on minimum settings with no AA.4. No free camera - camera always rotates around selected part, selecting distant parts can be troublesome.			"

												I understand this is a ""Car Mechanic Simulator"" game, and i don't know nearly anything about cars.Also i like this game sort of but i wouldn't recommend it to anyone, and if you do want to play it play the Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 Demo its not that much differentOnce i fully pull apart and put new things on everything on 3-4 different cars in this i felt like that was it the only thing more to do is make money and store your own cars in the garage then just have them sit there because there is nothing elsei made a list of the things i dislike they are in no order-the only thing you can really change on a car is its colour, other then that you repair or replace parts exactly the way it is including the wheels/rims-Rims and tyres are one piece (there is a picture with them separate)-Car seems to lack wires?-When bolts come out of some parts theres no holes in the piece it was in-The inside of the boot/trunk has no detail at all-No spare tyre-The shadow under the car while on the lifter makes no sense-No number plates-Cant change interior at all including the seats which also has a picture out of the car-Cant change windscreen wiper blades-Apart from the colour What ever is on the car you cant change you cant- Rust is how bad a part is there is nothing more to that-Some menus feel like there meant to be on a touch screen (the swiping i'm meaning)- No real car brands?On the test track (Considering this is a simulator game the driving isnt the worst)-There is no person in 3rd person view-Cant remember what car it was but it was only one that i know of theres like a jutter when you drive in 3rd person view-The car from the Youngtimer update has no engine when its hood is off, not sure if other cars are the sameFor the people who say loading times when you get a car or go the the test track is 3-5 seconds really that big of a deal..I would of liked to see trucks in this and just have Mechanic Simulator and have dlc for different types of Mechanics, i cant wait for the aeroplane, boats or motobikes Mechanic Simulatorsi do look forward to seeing what else they make as well			"

												Like everyone, I'm impressed with the level of detail of when dismantling the car, but the game itself..boring to anyone except someone who does this for a living.  It is a GAME so it's missing things that make it a true simulator. No angry customers or budget for keeping the place running. Customers coming back to say you didn't put a screw or a bolt back...accidents there in the garage..challenges, maybe you get to go to Nascar and have to SPEED repair cars.  There needs to be a clock period. Where you quote a customer a time to pick up so you have to work a little faster. And for the love of god please allow us to add our own music..itunes play list..something.Hearing the sound of the wratchet (may have spelled that wrong) definitely did take me back to being a little girl in the garage with my Papa but as a hard core simulator fan this falls short.It plays more like a mechanic class than an actual game.  I'll give it a good review just because you did an amazing job on the parts.  But I won't be buying any more of your games ladies and gents. You need to take a look at other simulators and add a LOT MORE to make it a true Sim.			"

YouTube™ Video: Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 Early Access Gameplay July Brake job 

			Views: 32		

			Just a quick brake job so you can see the gameplay.		

 These Devs take this title very seriously and listen very well to the playerbase.But the Devs themselves downvote negative reviews.Suggestions I think will make this title much better.wheel support for driving on the test trackmore cars(solved by MODs)More test tracks. (solved by MoDs)more parts and customization (Solved by MODs)realistic Auction pricesreduce loading times  (fixed, Good Job to the Dev's)I'm still hesitant about the Chip tuning minigame.Positivesthe music is pretty good, I found myself jamming to the take me home song.the U.I. and gameplay is simple and works wellThe price for the DLC was good at $2.99 but once I built the three cars it only added about 15 minutes of gameplay for me, Honestly.(solved by MODs)I have built real cars, it only takes me about five minutes to totally strip and rebuild a car in this title.

												These games are difficult to recommend.  If you know cars well you will be insulted by how much they leave out, and if you don't know cars but want to learn more you'll be grosly misled.   I enjoyed 2014 more than 2015.  Because 2015 didn't fix any of my complaints from the first game, it would be very awkward to recommend it.  However, it is not a bad game.ProsImproved Graphics.More detail on car parts and repairs.You can now buy your cars from auctions.ConsNo campaign mode.Work orders are less creative because there is no campaign.  2014 would tell you ""the car makes clank sounds and accelerates slowly"" and then you had to figure out what was broken.  2015 just gives you large lists of broken parts to fix.  Not nearly as interesting.2014 would also have you plug the code reader into the obd port.  2015 has you use the code reader on the actual parts, very odd.You still don't have to add transmission fluid after putting the transmission back in place.  Same goes for anti-freeze in the radiator.  Its still fairly difficult to line-up the oil-catch under the oil plug.Some of the jobs are still absurd expensive, people spending $15,000 on crappy econoboxes to fix them.  Some of the parts are still crazy priced.The interface and controls are still awkward and counter-intuitive.Some tasks, such as removing the wheels, still take far too long.Ok, so the list of cons is big.  Do I recommend the game?  I would recommend 2014 before this game.  It seems like 2015 didn't solve any of major issues with the series and they took some of the core expierence away by getting rid of campaign mode.    "

												To all potential buyers please read the following statement... this is not a simulation game this is a puzzle game. Basically, all you do is put together a puzzle that becomes a car. Take out an engine? Just click a button and drag in a new one. The realism on this game is probably a 1 and it was only fun to dismantle a car (doing so took me an hour and now I can't return this terrible game.)			"

Real low money and XP rewards.There is nothing else in the game either, no managment side of your buissiness, why cant we start with a small back alley garage, save up for bigger buissiness etc?When you pick through the game and admit to yourself and be honest, the game has no content and becomes boring and dull where you need so much money and XP just to get a wrench.

												Always start with a JokeA penguin is driving along the motorway eating a tub of Ben and Jerrys Phish food ice-cream and making a hellova mess when suddenly the car lurches to a stop with steam coming out of the bonnet. The penguin covered in ice-cream phones for a breakdown truck which arrives promptly and the mechanic is not phased to see he’s been called out by a talking penguin and gets to work under the bonnet.After a couple minutes the mechanic closes the hood and looks at the rather stained penguin and says “you look like you have blown a seal” and the penguin say “ah no, its Ice-cream”Now that the ice is broken, lets get down to business.Good concept, spoiled by a constant stream of below average DLCs that add little other than new new car shapes.Like all of these simulators, the business side of the game is pointless and only there to slow your collecting down. Despite 70hours of play, I'd only reccommend this on Sale and to sombody with OCD.More than a year on and the developers promised steam achievements are nowhere to be seen			"

												Very much a niche sim that requires you to have a lot of knowledge about the subject matter already. There is no real tutorial, help file or wiki to help you find what parts are to be found where. Combined with the ho-hum camera, this means you'll spend most of your time clicking around the car, hoping to hit the hot spot with the correct name. If you're out of luck, it'll be hidden inside other components. Strangely, finding the right parts to replace seems to be the core game component. The other mechanics are bolting/unbolting said parts and ordering replacements online. Oh, and you get to push the button on the lift.The music is very much an acquired taste, so bring your own MP3s. Grab a Haynes manual and a lot of patience while you're at it.			"

												Overall, this is quite a nice game. Game progress is actually quite slow, but it gives you time enough to learn the game mechanics (pun intended). Graphics are OK, what do you need? Being a mechanic and disassembling cars is fun and you can learn a lot. However, finding faults and disassembling parts can be quite tedious, because ""inspecting"" the state of parts can be difficult. Sometimes you can just see it by looking at the amount of rust, sometimes a very small and hidden part (like brake pads) is broken, which you cannot see. Some other disappointments are very long loading times, and slow collecting of XP for expanding your garage's functionalities.			"

												When I started to play this game, I had just about no car knowledge whatsoever. But I figured that as I own one, this could be a good opportunity to actually see how it works. And CMS was a great tool for that. Here's my pros and cons list:Pros:-Excellent learning curve.-Easy controls-Interesting lineup of cars to work on-Super relaxing game-Constant updating makes the game better and better Cons:-A bit redundant eventually. (I got every upgrade and reached about a millions dollars now with no idea on what to spend it all)-No preview option when using the paint shop.-No real city to ride your own cars once you get themTo conclude, CMS 2015 is well-made, fun game. Learning how cars work is really nice playing this game. You WILL enjoy it even if you have no prior knowledge on cars. Devs update it often to keep it interesting and release awesome DLCs as well. I would definitely recommend this game!			"

												I've played about a hundred hours on this game.  I've never been one to RACE thru a game at a RECORD pace, and this one was no exception.  It took me about 90 hours to get to the point where I had all the tools and upgrades, and could afford the parking lot, the final purchase required to buy cars at auction (the only way to OWN your own cars).I haven't read thru the community forums much.  In the beginning, I needed to go to YouTube to find videos on how to find the parts in some of the cars, such as the fuel pump (located on top of the fuel tank, btw ...), and it took me awhile to figure out how the color scheme works with each mode, as they change depending on whether you're in DISASSEMBLE mode, ASSEMBLE or a third mode you can use to diagnose the condition of the parts.Once you get it, it's a piece of cake to figure out the order of taking the car apart and putting it back together.I also bought the DLC, but I haven't seen much in the way of custom parts yet, other than RIMS and PAINT.  In fact, that brings me to my WANTS, or things that would make this game better.1.  Why not be able to take the cars out and drive them around a city or RACE TRACK?  The one little test course is a quick set of bumps and turns thru an alley, and gets old really quick.2.  The addition of tracks or courses would make improving your car more exciting, and maybe motivate you to build it with 100% new condition parts.  As it is, you really need to have a junker to tell any difference in performance from car to car.  Beefing up the UPGRADE system would be nice, too.  Souping up the motor and suspension, or TURBO and NITROUS kits would make shaving times off a time trial a lot of fun, and give you some reason to stay with the game after you get to where I am, where everything gets a little tedious.3.  For me it's hard to understand why you can repair CERTAIN partz at certain times, but not others.  You end up with hundreds of broken partz that you have to sell one by one, mouse CLICK and ENTER.  When selling stuff, the sound of my keyboard and mouse is like an old manual typewriter.  You can sell the ""JUNK"" with one button, but anything above 10% condition gets thru that filter.  And its all junk if you can't repair it, unless you want to build cars out of damaged partz.4.  What about a reputation system?  The cheaper, better, and faster you repair carz should bring you more trusting and higher paying customers.  As it is, you select cars from a list, by clicking on a phone.  Rather sterile, and boring after a while.5.  Also, I don't know about the value of the cars.  There may be a list somewhere, but I haven't seen it.  Makes auctions a little silly if you can't tell the sale value of the car before bidding.6.  How about some RACING WHEEL support, along with the tracks or city driving?  These muscle cars BEG to be driven hard, not just crashed and trashed in an alley with KEYBOARD controls.  It would be fun to drive thru downtown traffic, pull in to a RACE TRACK, and race against AI cars or your friends.  OPEN and CLASS races would be fun, and could also add to the FAME of your CUSTOM shop when you win, or just show up and race a lot.That's it, for now, MotorKatz!  I obviously liked the game, but I don't feel like it has enuff depth to keep me interested, as it stands now.  Like any good game, it has left me wanting more!Good Luck!Jack			"

												Great game, runs beautifully and looks pretty nice. Does feel a little bit grindy to get to the auctions though. I levelled up enough only to find I was only half way there in budget which made me a little sad, but still, very impressive and just like the last version, teaches you a lot about cars and how they work without making you feel intimidated.Now, what I'd like to see in the next version or future DLC.Drag racing/street racing: Yes, I know its not a racing game, but it would be nice to be able to do something with the vehicles that you own to earn some extra cash or drag racing for pink slips to earn more cars for you to modify and maintain (just like that old game, Street Rod!).Open world hub/town:This would be great to have, just like the above it will give you something to do with the cars you buy/repair. It will make you feel more attached to your vehicles and put the handling and physics to good use.MP3/FLAC in car music player:This combined with the above options would be great. I'd love to drive while listening to some of my favorite driving songs.Interior customization:Stuff like changing seats, steering wheels, sound systems (which could have an actual efffect on the way your music sounds, see above) and gauges among other things.Licensed Vehicles:This will really make me want to invest a bunch more time in this game, especially if there are a lot of 90s cars.Physical damage modelling:Not the priority compared to some of the other features I'd like to see, but it would be nice to see cars come in dented instead of just rusted. More realistic, more immersive.			"

												So. Car Mechanic Simulator 2015. The year is almost over, and I have a good 100 hours on this game, so it's about time for a review.What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said? It's definitely a very good game, it's informative in its own way, educational, and just plain fun, especially when you save up enough money and experience to expand your garage, get the paint shop, get the underground parking, and go to the auction house to buy wrecks you can fix up and sell for a profit.Of course, things are simplified a lot under the hood of each car you get to work on. I'm no mechanic, but I know enough of cars to have done maintenance on my own cars, and I have studied a lot of stuff for stories I write in which a character is an actual mechanic. There is in fact a funny thing about that; the game showed me painfully well how I got most of my knowledge about cars. It started in Dutch, as that is the language set on my laptop, and one of the first customer cars I got in showed a list that said there was a part that needed replacing. And I was all like; what the hell is that? So I saved and quit to menu, set the game language to English, started back up again, looked at the list, and went; Ohhh! Duh, a rubber bushing! Why didn't you just SAY so? I KNOW those! (And I know the name of that part mainly from watching YouTube videos of HotRod Magazine/HotRod Garage, and reading those kind of magazines - in English. For about 70% of the parts, I have NO clue what they are by the Dutch names alone)How simplified is it under the hood? Well, all cars have similar parts, for one. A front suspension has a crossmember, shocks, springs, a swaybar and end links, steering rack with inner and outer tie rods, upper and/or lower control arms, wheel knuckle housing, wheel hub, brake disk, pads, and a brake caliper. All but one or two cars come with a brake servo, and the newer models with an ABS pump and control unit. Brake lines? Nope. Brake fluid? Nope. A need to bleed the system after you rebuilt it? Nope.The engines? Let's stick with my favorite type of cars; the old ones. There's several classics that are all too recognizable; a 1957 Chevy Bel Air, a 1969 Ford Mustang, a 1968 Chevrolet Chevelle, a 1969 Dodge Charger. Of course they are not called that; the game has given each car its own brand and type. Big plus; they have actually taken the time to design logos and name badges that are on the cars, and they look good, too!But, the engines. Those four cars I mentioned all come with a carburated overhead-cam V8 engine. All parts are interchangeable, except for the two-carb intake manifold that comes on the Mustang. Have you bought a Chevelle and want to spruce it up a bit with a dual carburetor setup? Sorry, no can do, that dual-carb intake manifold is not an optional part for that car. Even when you take the V8 out of a Mustang and put it in the Chevelle, you can only put on the single-carb intake manifold. The only optional parts you can change on a car are the rims, and body parts if you have the Visual Tuning DLC pack.For the rest, though, it's good. Quite simplified, but with plenty of detail parts even so. Take apart one of those old V8's, and you find yourself with a box full of individual rocker arms and pushrods which you can take out one by one - and there's sixteen of them in one engine.There's one big drawback, though. You can't take the whole engine plus transmission out of the car in one big lump and put it on an engine stand to disassemble it, like almost any car restorer does; you have to disassemble, and reassemble it, in the car. And some parts you can only reach from underneath. Once you have gotten down to the engine block, it's; take out pistons, lift car, get under, remove oil pan (if you already hadn't), remove crankshaft caps, remove crankshaft, get out, lower car, remove engine block. Fix up or buy new one. Put in engine block, lift car, get under, put in crankshaft, put in crankshaft caps, get out, lower car, put in pistons, lift car, get under, put on oil pan and filter, get out, lower car, rebuild rest of the engine. That would be SO much easier if you could just take the whole thing out, put it on an engine stand, and disassemble/reassemble there.And the simplification shows. The plug wires are the only wires you'll find in the whole car. The detailing goes as far as to put individual clips on the air filter box/distributor cap you have to take off, but a wiring loom for all the electrics? Not there. Gaskets? Not there. There's a fuel filter, but fuel lines? Nope. Brake lines? Nope. And even on the most hashed-out rusty wreck of a 1957 Bel Air you buy at the auction house, ALL the bolts are always brand new. The rims and parts of the suspension/engine may be so rusted they are beyond repair, but they still come off with three turns of your wrench on the brand new bolts holding everything in place.The same goes for the fixing of the parts. You have a work table where you can fix a good number of the parts you take off a car. Butthe fixing process is; click. You managed to repair the part! Condition is now X%! Or; click. You failed to repair the part. Condition has decreased. (and it always decreases to a point so low you can't re-attempt to fix it again. So if you hash up a part, it's utterly broken and you need to buy a new one)Still, overall, it's a great game. After 100 hours I'm still not bored of it, even if I'm doing pretty much the same things over and over again. It just has that certain something about it that keeps drawing you in to play it more. There's just a few little things that could make it even better.- placing of the oil drain pan. That is SUCH a hit-and-miss, because you can't look upwards properly once you're moving that thing around. I end up just removing the oil pan and taking the $100 fine for oil cleanup, rather than to fiddle around with that drain and having it sit just a smidge too far to the left, right, front or back anyway.- disassembling/reassembling the engine outside of the car on an angine stand. If that could be implemented, it would be SUCH an improvement.- customizing of the cars. Currently, it's just visual with body parts and head/tail lights and bumpers, and rims, and only when you have the Visual Tuning DLC pack. If you were allowed to put different engines in different cars, or even do things like put that dual-carb intake on a single-carb V8 engine, that would make things a lot more fun. Also, speed parts would be nice. Take the tame little Pinto, yank out that four-banger engine, plop in a V8 with a high-lift cam, dual or triple carburetors and a turbo or a blower, and you suddenly have a much more interesting car.- graphics. Not the overall game graphics; those are pretty good as is. But some extra graphics for the cars? That would be a lot more fun. Take the Dodge Charger, give it a new paint job, and let us put on a bumblebee stripe around the rear end, for instance. Or racing stripes over the hood and trunk of the Chevelle. Or a spiffy flame-job. Hell yeah.- the test drive. Currently, there are in fact different engine sounds for the different cars, and some different driving characteristics. But the handling is atrocious, and the whole thing feels a bit... tacked on. Almost like it was an afterthought. There is massive potential for improvement there.- bodywork on the cars. At the moment, it's front bumper, headlights, hood, front fenders, doors, trunk lid, taillights, rear bumper. Not even windshields/rear windows/side windows (and everyone who ever restored an old car knows that the quarter panels/rear fenders and floor pans are 90% of the time the areas that need the most work). I can see a lot of potential for improvement there as well, the outer bodywork, and the interior as well. Allow us to put in leather bucket seats, for instance, or give the interior a different color than black.Do I recommend this game though? Hell yes!			"

												I do like this game however it gets boring fast with nothing to invest money in other then cars you can't drive on a street or a good race track, I think the creators of this game need to look deep into Street Legal Racing Redline this has potencial and street legal racing even know its old was and still is amazing you build your car in the same way with little less detail on running gear parts nothing modders didnt fix... This game suggest simulation and like many others say who are experianced at this in real life half of the problems in reality do not occure in game torque specs on bolts amazing idea there is important things that should be detailed more or less im♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥cause i wana drive what i build also custom motors and more parts. I paid $30 for street legal around 2003 and that game tops this still i expected more this is more or less the same as 2014 version that looks better.. Its been hyped up way more then it should...

												When I started to play this game, I had just about no car knowledge whatsoever. But I figured that as I own one, this could be a good opportunity to actually see how it works. And CMS was a great tool for that. Here's my pros and cons list:Pros:-Excellent learning curve.-Easy controls-Interesting lineup of cars to work on-Super relaxing game-Constant updating makes the game better and better Cons:-A bit redundant eventually. (I got every upgrade and reached about a millions dollars now with no idea on what to spend it all)-No preview option when using the paint shop.-No real city to ride your own cars once you get themTo conclude, CMS 2015 is well-made, fun game. Learning how cars work is really nice playing this game. You WILL enjoy it even if you have no prior knowledge on cars. Devs update it often to keep it interesting and release awesome DLCs as well. I would definitely recommend this game!			"

You won't get license to become mechanic but at least you know few stuff about car(+). Long and incredibly boring. and yes that is why it's good for some reason(-). Loading are terribly long especialy at start up(-). Not sufficent help provided(-). No card drop,no archievement (at least put like fixing 200 car or something)(-). Can they put note when i buy car part. i keep close the computer (ingame one not my real computer) to look at what stuff i need to buy. basically lot of small yet essential stuff are missingVerdict: Like car? Like incredibly repetitive job just like real life? hell i don't even like cars and i like this game...Edit: Play it again (31-july-2015) and the xp seems to be much faster now (it used to be 15 car=1k xp=1 upgrade			"

												Well. I'm hobbyist mechanic (meaning I worked on 3 of my cars) and the game is boring for me. I imagine, it could be too difficult to someone who doesn't know mechanic stuff on the other hand.For that kind of beginners it should have wiki-style help or something, so they can learn stuff (Automation game has that - AWESOME game btw, I learned a lot about engines thanks to them)For more advanced users like me, it could show symptoms, not list of parts that need to be replaced.Gameplay is very basic and repeatitive (is that a word? I'm not native speaker), after 2 hours, I calculated I have to repeat same stuff over and over for about 2 hours more to unlock new kind of repeatitive stuff to do.. So yeah, actually, in that matter it is a simulator, you get to do simple stuff over and over again :Dtl;dr - I didn't feel like car mechanic when playing this game. I felt like... I'm playing mediocre game. Other games let you feel your role better (again, check Automation, it's awasome)			"

												I've done engine/transmission swaps, factory and forged block and head rebuilds, and I'm currently in the process of attempting to make 800 rwhp on my '94 SC300 with a 2JZGTE VVTi/R154 swap.  Going with a GTX4088R, 2000cc Hi-Z Injector Dynamic injectors, dual 450 Walbro pumps, an OS Giken triple plate clutch with a hydraulic actuator conversion, Hypertune race intake manifold, a supra MK4 4.06 rear end, and many, many other mods.  In summary, I spend hours upon hours on forums reading about high HP builds and basic repair/maintenance on several different forum sites.  Even though my life is spent on cars outside of work, I can't get enough of this game because even with all of that experience, I still learn a thing or two each time that I play it.  Buy this game if you even have the slightest interest in automotive repair and modifications.			"

 Gameplay: 7/10 It gets tedious. You'd better hope you like unscrewing things (and then attempting to repair them, failing, buying new things, and screwing them back on). Then again, I'm sure being an automotive mechanic gets boring after a while, too. The cars all have the same basic components, as most cars do, but some have different layouts for more specific systems, like rear brake drums instead of discs or I4/I6/V8/V8OHV engines, etc. Despite this variation, after a few cars, you've seen it all. There's a lot of attention to detail, but even then, the game is not 100% accurate. If it was, though, I'd imagine it would be a lot more difficut. I'm glad that driving does not happen much in this game, because the driving mechanics were honestly not very good at all. Besides that, everything runs smoothly without any serious glitches. It performs as advertised. Graphics: 9/10 There isn't much to look at in this game, but what there is looks pretty nice. In other words, the textures and models all look great, but they mostly just sit there - no action. Plot: 0/10 It's a game about being a mechanic. What were you expecting, an epic tale of love, loss, and man's journey to find himself? There's no plot, you just fix cars for hours. I'm not really factoring plot into the overall rating, because that isn't the point of the game as I see it. Soundtrack: 4/10 One of this game's weakest points has to be the soundtrack. I know some mechanics, and I don't think many (if any at all) of them listen to EDM, and certainly not the same 5 songs in an endless loop. Now, you might think that it's fine. You'll just shut off the music and load up your own or whatever you usually do. Bad news:  YOU CAN'T SHUT IT OFF  (at least as far as I can tell). Now, it isn't  bad  EDM, it just gets super annoying. You must listen to the same songs over and over and over and over. Replay Value: 4/10 This game quickly becomes boring. There are only so many variations on cars and so many different tasks you can perfect performing. After a while, there's just no point in playing. The Trader Pack added the ability to buy cars at auction and restore them to keep or sell, but the only thing you can do with the money from selling cars is buy more cars or more car parts. It's very circular. It just feels like there's something missing at the upper level of this game. Overall: 60/100 I can't blame this game for being something I don't like. It's a simulation of being a mechanic, and I wasn't expecting much. So, as a game that simulates being an automotive repair specialist this game is probably a 90/100 (and stands pretty uncontested in its field). However, there's just about no replay value. There's no real reason to be satisfied with restoring even some of the nicest cars in the game because there's nothing to do with them after that, besides look at them and drive them around the generally pointless test track (the only textured driving course included with the game). The lack of replay value is what really ends up making this game kind of disappointing.  Suggestion:  What would make this game a 95/100 is a racing element: being able to buy performance-enhancing parts to upgrade your cars and then race for money. Despite its flaws, I'd say that Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is mostly worth the meager $19.99 it asks of your wallet.			"

												Hi! I'm not a huge car guy... the last vehicles I could work on was my 71 Ford Maverick and a 76 Chev 454, hehe. These days it's like one look at the engine compartment, and uh... good luck with that!!  :DDefinitely two thumbs up for this game! It's fun to play and had me scratching my head a few times. I had the plan to be Mr Awesome Mechanic and replace everything with 100% quality parts. That is fine and noble... my advice is write down the model numbers of the parts you're replacing! I sold off the old parts as junk. Then couldn't remember which belt I needed to buy (was that a V8?) What do you mean it's missing the driveshaft and a couple lugnuts? It'll be fine!  Just drive slow and only do left turns.  :DCMS 2015 is fun and cool! If you like sims, this is definitely worthwhile. In garage view, it seems better-suited for mouse and keyboard. I've got an xbox1 PC controller... saving that for the test drives once I figure out how.Rating: 7/10. There's a ton of more stuff to discover about the game, though...			"

												Vastly improved over CMS 2014. Graphics are much nicer and the engines/vehicles look much closer to their real life counterparts, though there are still a few mistakes. Wider variety of vehicles and a larger garage enables multiple jobs simultaenously.The ability to purchase cars at aution and restore them either for profit or your personal collection is very welcome. The only complaints I have about the auction house are that each car gets sent to your parking lot automatically and there is a set number of cars per auction. I do understand that the limited number of cars is more realistic but it is rather bothersome when I am looking for a specific car to work on. The issue with sending cars to the parking lot is understandable and would be more bearable if the loading times were lower.I also really liked the addition of diagnostic tools and a leveling system not based on cash. The only complaint in that department is that the repair skill maxes out at 90%. That is literally my one complaint about the new system. Everything else was a welcome change.The developer also seems to be pushing updates regularly (as of July, 2015) which is much appreciated. Several patches were already released since I purchased this game. More vehicles and tuning parts have also been added as optional DLC.			"

												Game is very intuitive and for someone like me who knows very little about car parts it can teach you quite a bit. It also eases you into the game slowly, giving you easy things to do at the start then getting more complicated as you gain experience. Just be careful you use ALL the tools at your disposal, unlike what I did below.Had a job where one of the problems was a lack of power.Used the test track and test path, no luck finding the problem.Took absolutely everything out of the engine bay, couldn't find the problem either.Remembered I had an electronic meter I earned earlier in the game which I could use. The problem was the fuel pump in the fuel tank at the back of the car.Smacked myself in the head, replaced the fuel pump and had to put the whole engine back together.10/10 would do it again.			"

The only negative side to this game is the current LACK OF FOV SLIDER. This may have been fixed by the time some of you read this, but as of 10/30/2015 there is no FOV slider in the game and the field of few is quite low, somewhere in the 60-75 area. Which gives me a headache after about half an hour or so. But other than that, the game is fantastic.			"

I don't have a good explanation for it.  8.5 / 10 (It would be 9.5 if you had to negotiate the minefield of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that is working in customer service. Possible DLC?)			"

												Very good game. It has a nice learning curve which helps those that always wanted to learn, but wasn't allowed to do so! Very time consuming to get those experience levels to expand your garage, but in a good way. Makes you want to do more jobs. It kept me going to the early hours of the morning, just when I got tired I wanted to do more jobs lol. Now how many of us can admit that in the real World...? Needs more vehicles, hope they add a lot more in the future ;o)			"

												I had a little fun with the 2014 version, but felt that it could be improved... have a little more detail. This is the answer! Just needs the licensing for actual cars and the addition of power tools. Always liked the sound of that compression drill used to remove the lug nuts.			"

												If you don't know what the pointy thing is at the midsection of your arm when you bend it or the soft squishy cushion like area at the top of your legs.. and you sometimes get them confused - you can still play this game.If you like to be led through all games regardless of genre and large open spaces cause you to reach for that old paper bag - you can still play this game.If you're looking for something a bit different after you've upgraded your weapons for the 'Nth' time and now you don't remember what it is or you're stuck on deciding whether your character's hair should flop to the right or left then give this game a shot. You learn real stuff about cars, instead of panicking and fleeing to the nearest dark corner when I lift the bonnet of my trusty Cruiser I can now point at a lot of the parts and name them. You can spend real time fixing up cars and then sell them on to earn money to buy more cars to sell or add to your personal collection.Also the devs regularly update this simulator, they take an active role in the community and cues from the suggestions made on how to improve the game.More fun than a dog with a box, dogs love boxes why is this?!

												It's quite a good time-waster.  :)It won't entirely hold your hand all the time, but it's easy enough to figure it all out with a tiny bit of patience.In fact the things I miss are the really big eff-ups, like lowering the car when something *is* underneath, or the disgruntled customers...these would add a laugh into the game that's missing IMO.And a FOV setting.  God I miss that badly!Edit:After some time I've realised there's one big missing thing here; the challenge. There's none.And so after you've completely re-built a couple of (owned) cars the game has really nothing to offer.  You can make truckloads of money this way.			"

												There are quite a lot of pros and only a few cons to the game. Mind you, I will be comparing the older version to the newer version.Pros:-It is not very laggy: The biggest issue I had with the older version was that I set my game to the lowest video settings, but I still kept on lagging. This game takes that and throws it in the bin. With the same computer and same specs, the 2015 version was much more smoother than the 2014 version. I had at least 30fps all the way, whereas I would have 15-20fps on the 2014 version. -Interesting Campaign Mode: The one in CMS2014 was very controlled, you were given the same puzzle as everyone else who played the game. This gives you the choice to select the orders you want to take, and that is a game changer. No longer do you HAVE to do an order. You get to pick what you want to do. i.e I don't feel like fixing that guy's brakes, so I'll just select the order with the engine problems instead. This helps to make the game much more smoother and much more playable.-Much fewer glitches: I had a problem with CMS2014, and that was my order #43 glitched and I couldn't finish the order no matter how closely I followed the instructions. Since this is a newer game, we don't have as many glitches anymore. This game is being constantly updated, so it allows for improvement all the time. -Cool DLCs: We have had two DLCs come out by the time I am writing this review, Visual Tuning and Young Timer. Young Timer is free, with the nice little Fiat 500 lookalike. The Visual Tuning DLC does cost some money, however it is much more cheaper compared to the price tags on the other DLCs. Cons:-Time Consuming: Unless you are an absolute car bore who likes fixing the cars in this game like I do, you are not going to have a fun time. This is a simulator of what mechanics do on a daily basis, so ofcourse it is going to be time consuming, what did you expect? -Unlockables: In CMS2014, we had the OBD scanner as a tool since the beginning of the game. Why do we need to work on 10 cars maximum in order to unlock the tool that we had for a long time in the previous game? They could've let some tools remain like they were in the previous game. However, it does add for an interesting aspect to the gameplay, because now you get to work for the things you really want. Although that is interesting to me, it might not be to the other gamers. -Repair Uncertainty: Now again, unless you are a car enthusiast that finds these innovations interesting to the gameplay, you are probably not going to like the fact that there is a chance that the item you repair may not be fixed successfully. Overall, I think they did an excellent job with the new 2015 simulator. The new additional features are absolutely worth every single penny of that price tag. This new game completely demolishes the other older one, and I am not saying this because my CMS2014 Order #43 did not work. I genuinely believe this new game is a huge step forward from the previous one. I can now only imagine how much greater the 2016 version will be, definitely a rival to the upcoming Street Tuning Revolution. I am only joking, that game is a total in depth tuning game and it will take Red Dot Games a little while to catch up to that level, eventhough in my opinion it is very close. Then again, I have not played Street Tuning Evolution yet, so I can't tell the gap there might exist between the two games. CMS2016, that is a game definitely to look forward to.  "

												This is the most realistic and exciting way to take cars apart and put them together again! I only have one problem. The game has a shortage of cars and gets really easy and repetitive when the end is reached. The best moment was definitely when I spent about 2-3 hours taking apart a fancy car, buying all new parts for it and putting it back together again. 8/10 is what it's worth.

In classic sim style, this game takes you through each challenge while at the same time leaving just enough room for diagnostic and troubleshooting on your own.  You don't have to be a mechanic to get into this game but at the same time it helps a little if you know the basic fundementals of auto mechanics.  It's not a racing game, it's a casual tinkering game that really gets you thinking.			"

												This is a pretty great game for the price, very engaging and while I haven't played much of it, if the rest of the game is as good as the tutorial, this will be a game I try and play frequently. The only negative side to this game is the current LACK OF FOV SLIDER. This may have been fixed by the time some of you read this, but as of 10/30/2015 there is no FOV slider in the game and the field of few is quite low, somewhere in the 60-75 area. Which gives me a headache after about half an hour or so. But other than that, the game is fantastic.			"

Tires(they seem to be made whole with mags contrary to pictures shown in steam)....what else then the more the merrier!1st game i see of that style and sure is great. i hope in near future we see more of theses (or just upgrades for this one)			"

												I would reccomend this game as it is fun but the content and fun does not last longIts too Bad Red Dot does not want to expand this into a more elaborate game as Play Way has just informed me since after playing CMS15 for 2 days straight I have fixed 56 cars and unlocked the parking garage and auction and after restoring 2 cars now have over 50k and the game has now gotten very repetative with nothing else really to do. I have pretty much completed the game play after a couple days of playing. Maybe in the future they will see the potential to adding online and racing to go along with the building of cars to help the game have more substance! "

												Being a Mechanic newbie i had high hopes about learning a few things with this game. After a rough 10 hours of play i can tell you that not only did this game helped me understand the basics of mechanic but also makes your learn to identify problems with the sounds and the tools that a real mechanic would use! 10/10.

												Fun game. Being a mechanic its not the most technically correct but does a pretty good job of having the correctly named parts. Its repetitive at first but once you get enough cash you can buy cars at auction and do a restore. That being said though its just more of the same as you have to then take off every part, repair it if possible then put them all back on.Fun game if you like car mechanics. They are also working on improvements and DLC addons that should bring lot more to the game like tuning etc. Right now its a parts changing game.The actual game play is not like the trailer videos. You never see third person and body work is just clicking the part off, buying a new one then clicking it back on again. Painting is 3 sliders then a click to paint.The test track is great fun where you can burn rubber and generally drive like a hooligan.I may sound a bit negative but I really like the game and would recommend it as its only going to get better			"

												 Car Mechanic 2015 is a definite improvement from the 2014 version. There is a lot more detail in the work you do to the cars. I find myself not wanting to stop playing. I finish one job and I tell myself this is the last one I'm going to do today, then I start looking at the next job and find myself working on it till I finish. It is very addictive!  If you know nothing about cars, Car Mechanic 2015 will help you understand the basics of what is what on a car an where it can be found!I can't get enough of this game! I have had no issues with the game play at all! If you don't have it yet, get it, you'll love it!  Since I am a trained mechanic myself there are a few things that should be added to the next version, if there is going to be next version, like powers tools! Instead of using the ratchet sounds add in some power tool sound fx! Like the impact wrench and an air wratchet! These would make the game even more enjoyable! Also custom paint jobs woud be really cool as well! Something where you could have a set of custom designs the customer would like to put on their car and paint it in the paint booth! Even metallic colors would look great! Something for the designers to think about! I have a lot of ideas for future Car Mechanic Simulators! This game is well worth the money! Two thumbs up from me! Definitly on the top of my gaming list!			"

												Hi! I'm not a huge car guy... the last vehicles I could work on was my 71 Ford Maverick and a 76 Chev 454, hehe. These days it's like one look at the engine compartment, and uh... good luck with that!!  :DDefinitely two thumbs up for this game! It's fun to play and had me scratching my head a few times. I had the plan to be Mr Awesome Mechanic and replace everything with 100% quality parts. That is fine and noble... my advice is write down the model numbers of the parts you're replacing! I sold off the old parts as junk. Then couldn't remember which belt I needed to buy (was that a V8?) What do you mean it's missing the driveshaft and a couple lugnuts? It'll be fine!  Just drive slow and only do left turns.  :DCMS 2015 is fun and cool! If you like sims, this is definitely worthwhile. In garage view, it seems better-suited for mouse and keyboard. I've got an xbox1 PC controller... saving that for the test drives once I figure out how.Rating: 7/10. There's a ton of more stuff to discover about the game, though...			"

												Great way to kill time and learn the basics. However even though I know just the basics about a lawn-mower 2 stroke engine from a high school course -- I barely remember from 1987 I would say this game needs more reality to it. All the bolts require the same wrenches and there are no screw drivers that I have seen so far. There is nothing detailed about electrical lines. Nothing detailed about the distributer cap. You can put on wheels without being dinged point for not using the staring method to keep the tires from warping. There is no torque wrench, their is no scraping off an old gasket to replace with a new one. Shipping is instantaneous when there could easily be an online store you can ship from that the server populates that all people are trying to buy first -- in this case you would need to be able to put an order-in-as-next. Then the shipper should come by depending where in the country the item came from - 10 minutes - 2 hours, not days that wouldn't make a very good game unless they lowered the XP requirements for tools. The tools are too simple to use, nothing to hook up or see hooked up. You can drain the oil and do a compression test, which makes no sence like not using the star-torque to properly put on a tire. So more or less its a game for just to learn the names of the main parts of a vehicle, nothing really mechanic level -- or even close to. Yet I still have quite a bit of fun, I just pretend I scraped off a gasket and torquied and I just star-torque the lug-nuts back onto the tires when I put them back on.Devs: Please make some point loss for mess ups. Compressor test without oil, come on. -10 XP right there. How about when the driver takes the car to the back, they blow the engine costing you -100XP and $1000 and brings the car back with a seized cam rod and/or a piston because you forgot the oil. Also it would be nifty to have a boss that hangs around waiting for you to make a mistake and yells at you, but you can go into a fist mode and give him a temporary black eye for -10XP, MIGHT BE WORTH IT! Make this a $10.00 DLC for all this albet it sells fast!How about a DLC for weather so we an listen to lightning and rain and see some flashes out the window. An event where the outside tree is falling apart and if you arn't aware it crashes though and destroies your car in one of the bays? This way move to centre would be fun. A snow store causes your fingers to get really cold so you have to close a window and turn up the heat. I would pay $5 for this sort of enhancement DLC.Devs you have a great start here, why not a little extra realism for fun? All I do is pile up the XP and money, but nothing special is happening. Maybe there is a buy junk car sell for big bucks mode after I unlock the paintshop.But I like the game but no one should pay more than a copy on sale, the asking price is for a more realistic version. One more time I have to say this ""Why - No - Gaskets?""l8r all			"

												Not without some issues, but still fun. That is if you know what some of the parts are to begin with. Not much of a tutorial, and as stated, you really need to know something about cars if you want an easy start of the game. However most gamers will be able to figure most of it out. Biggest strength of the game is it's a great teacher (if you like figureing things out for your self) of basic mechanics, biggest weakness is it's play for the long term, you'll tire of the game quickly if it's not your thing.

												Well, this is certainly a great sim. Perhaps not the most accurate ever in terms of mechanical detail (you'll probably notice a lot of chassis parts bolting into thin air when fixing or restoring vehicles) this game will definitely provide hours of entertainment. I won't lie, it's starts getting a little stale after a while, however, due to a lack of any pactical used for cars you've fixed or restored (aside from the tiny test track and drag strip you can run the car on). I think this game would be way better if they added more in terms of the business end of your repair shop, or in terms of the ability to enjoy your vehicles after all the work, besides selling them. Maybe add the ability to do interior customization work, and the ability to paint a car more than just a solid, single color. Sure, you can mod the game, but it's not like modding something like a Fallout or Elder Scrolls game. It seems like nobody actually makes pre-defined mods and the modding process itself seems pretty conveluded. Never the less, the game is enjoyable and can kill time with the best of them. Every aspect of the game that is present, is easy pick up, fun to play and intuitive. Now, Play Way, maybe you should make a racing game where you can import cars that have been restored or built in CMS15 and use them to race. That would give this game far more sustinance than the repeated grind of buying cars, fixing them, testing them, selling them.			"

The only negative side to this game is the current LACK OF FOV SLIDER. This may have been fixed by the time some of you read this, but as of 10/30/2015 there is no FOV slider in the game and the field of few is quite low, somewhere in the 60-75 area. Which gives me a headache after about half an hour or so. But other than that, the game is fantastic.			"

												Around 6 hours into the game I've done about 8 cars.The game tends to hold your hand a lot, and everything is pretty straight forward. So far it has been more of a point and click simulator than a car mechanic simulator but it is still fairly entertaining.Not knowing anything about what goes on under the hood myself, the game has been somewhat educational in showing me where and what parts are that I've only seen on a repair/service bill. I do think with a little more time put into the game I might actually be able to go out to my car and identify them myself.For a simulator title, the game is very simplistic. Taking off parts is as simple as holding down a mouse button, and when you need to unbolt or unscrew something the same applies. When putting something back onto the car, you are provided with silhouettes of missing parts. This makes assembly fairly simple almost to the point of being too easy.Most of the cars have been more of the same, and I can see the game getting very repetitive quickly. The only difference in difficulty boils down to how extensively you will need to strip the car to get to the broken part. This becomes more of a chore than a difficulty factor. Speaking of broken parts, the only indication of this is rust. Parts do not have cracks etc. The only indication of wear on parts is rust. This makes most of the problems you fix linear and adds to repetition.All of this taken into account, you would think I would not recommend the game. However the game is fun in a zen repetition kind of way, and there is some novelty to the learning experience. My first maluch (old) car was more interesting since I had even less of an idea of where everything is, and I even left out some parts when putting the engine back together xDIf this is something that interests you, and the price is right, give it a try. But don't expect too much realism or much of a challenge.			"

												If you don't know what the pointy thing is at the midsection of your arm when you bend it or the soft squishy cushion like area at the top of your legs.. and you sometimes get them confused - you can still play this game.If you like to be led through all games regardless of genre and large open spaces cause you to reach for that old paper bag - you can still play this game.If you're looking for something a bit different after you've upgraded your weapons for the 'Nth' time and now you don't remember what it is or you're stuck on deciding whether your character's hair should flop to the right or left then give this game a shot. You learn real stuff about cars, instead of panicking and fleeing to the nearest dark corner when I lift the bonnet of my trusty Cruiser I can now point at a lot of the parts and name them. You can spend real time fixing up cars and then sell them on to earn money to buy more cars to sell or add to your personal collection.Also the devs regularly update this simulator, they take an active role in the community and cues from the suggestions made on how to improve the game.More fun than a dog with a box, dogs love boxes why is this?!

												I'd have to say, I wasn't expecting this game to be any good but after playing over 2 hours with the game it's clear to see that this game is pretty interesting and fun!Is it perfect? No. But I will say that for a game that simulates being a mechanic rather than it being another joke game like modern Simulator games have become is breath of fresh air and I have to say that I think I might be putting more time into this game a lot more. I'd love to see this kind of creation in a racing game from these guys in the future because this is just outstanding.8.5/10 - Too Much Oil			"

												I've always been interested in cars.  I come from a computer background so really autos are just another something to flex my nerd muscle.  In classic sim style, this game takes you through each challenge while at the same time leaving just enough room for diagnostic and troubleshooting on your own.  You don't have to be a mechanic to get into this game but at the same time it helps a little if you know the basic fundementals of auto mechanics.  It's not a racing game, it's a casual tinkering game that really gets you thinking.			"

												this game is a grate game for those who are interested in the workings of vhicles, it puts you in control of a fully functoning work shop with all the ability that a real shop would have. your are capable of compleating many tasks in this game from raparing cars to buying restoring and selling cars. however i would like to see a more dedicated riving section, this game has so far got the physics of the driving ingame spot on so why cant this be injoied on a larger scale, aswell as this a more indepht tuning feature of the game should be added, thiss would notonly inrich the game play but also make the game more relistic, the last point is that this is an ever expanding game and i cant wait to see what dlcs are added .... and i would love to see a multiplayer dlc...

												It's quite a good time-waster.  :)It won't entirely hold your hand all the time, but it's easy enough to figure it all out with a tiny bit of patience.In fact the things I miss are the really big eff-ups, like lowering the car when something *is* underneath, or the disgruntled customers...these would add a laugh into the game that's missing IMO.And a FOV setting.  God I miss that badly!Edit:After some time I've realised there's one big missing thing here; the challenge. There's none.And so after you've completely re-built a couple of (owned) cars the game has really nothing to offer.  You can make truckloads of money this way.			"

												Around 6 hours into the game I've done about 8 cars.The game tends to hold your hand a lot, and everything is pretty straight forward. So far it has been more of a point and click simulator than a car mechanic simulator but it is still fairly entertaining.Not knowing anything about what goes on under the hood myself, the game has been somewhat educational in showing me where and what parts are that I've only seen on a repair/service bill. I do think with a little more time put into the game I might actually be able to go out to my car and identify them myself.For a simulator title, the game is very simplistic. Taking off parts is as simple as holding down a mouse button, and when you need to unbolt or unscrew something the same applies. When putting something back onto the car, you are provided with silhouettes of missing parts. This makes assembly fairly simple almost to the point of being too easy.Most of the cars have been more of the same, and I can see the game getting very repetitive quickly. The only difference in difficulty boils down to how extensively you will need to strip the car to get to the broken part. This becomes more of a chore than a difficulty factor. Speaking of broken parts, the only indication of this is rust. Parts do not have cracks etc. The only indication of wear on parts is rust. This makes most of the problems you fix linear and adds to repetition.All of this taken into account, you would think I would not recommend the game. However the game is fun in a zen repetition kind of way, and there is some novelty to the learning experience. My first maluch (old) car was more interesting since I had even less of an idea of where everything is, and I even left out some parts when putting the engine back together xDIf this is something that interests you, and the price is right, give it a try. But don't expect too much realism or much of a challenge.			"

What I do is get cars at auction, restore all the parts possible, and then sell the car for a profit. But the thing is, besides getting all of the cars, the game really has no end point. Another thing I link to mention is, if a car is in TERRIBLE, but driveable condition, and you drive it on the test course, you will tell no difference from driving a car in PERFECT condition. That is all I have to say.  Other then that, good game.			"

												I've done engine/transmission swaps, factory and forged block and head rebuilds, and I'm currently in the process of attempting to make 800 rwhp on my '94 SC300 with a 2JZGTE VVTi/R154 swap.  Going with a GTX4088R, 2000cc Hi-Z Injector Dynamic injectors, dual 450 Walbro pumps, an OS Giken triple plate clutch with a hydraulic actuator conversion, Hypertune race intake manifold, a supra MK4 4.06 rear end, and many, many other mods.  In summary, I spend hours upon hours on forums reading about high HP builds and basic repair/maintenance on several different forum sites.  Even though my life is spent on cars outside of work, I can't get enough of this game because even with all of that experience, I still learn a thing or two each time that I play it.

												Well. I'm hobbyist mechanic (meaning I worked on 3 of my cars) and the game is boring for me. I imagine, it could be too difficult to someone who doesn't know mechanic stuff on the other hand.For that kind of beginners it should have wiki-style help or something, so they can learn stuff (Automation game has that - AWESOME game btw, I learned a lot about engines thanks to them)For more advanced users like me, it could show symptoms, not list of parts that need to be replaced.Gameplay is very basic and repeatitive (is that a word? I'm not native speaker), after 2 hours, I calculated I have to repeat same stuff over and over for about 2 hours more to unlock new kind of repeatitive stuff to do.. So yeah, actually, in that matter it is a simulator, you get to do simple stuff over and over again :Dtl;dr - I didn't feel like car mechanic when playing this game. I felt like... I'm playing mediocre game. Other games let you feel your role better (again, check Automation, it's awasome)			"

 Gameplay: 7/10 It gets tedious. You'd better hope you like unscrewing things (and then attempting to repair them, failing, buying new things, and screwing them back on). Then again, I'm sure being an automotive mechanic gets boring after a while, too. The cars all have the same basic components, as most cars do, but some have different layouts for more specific systems, like rear brake drums instead of discs or I4/I6/V8/V8OHV engines, etc. Despite this variation, after a few cars, you've seen it all. There's a lot of attention to detail, but even then, the game is not 100% accurate. If it was, though, I'd imagine it would be a lot more difficut. I'm glad that driving does not happen much in this game, because the driving mechanics were honestly not very good at all. Besides that, everything runs smoothly without any serious glitches. It performs as advertised. Graphics: 9/10 There isn't much to look at in this game, but what there is looks pretty nice. In other words, the textures and models all look great, but they mostly just sit there - no action. Plot: 0/10 It's a game about being a mechanic. What were you expecting, an epic tale of love, loss, and man's journey to find himself? There's no plot, you just fix cars for hours. I'm not really factoring plot into the overall rating, because that isn't the point of the game as I see it. Soundtrack: 4/10 One of this game's weakest points has to be the soundtrack. I know some mechanics, and I don't think many (if any at all) of them listen to EDM, and certainly not the same 5 songs in an endless loop. Now, you might think that it's fine. You'll just shut off the music and load up your own or whatever you usually do. Bad news:  YOU CAN'T SHUT IT OFF  (at least as far as I can tell). Now, it isn't  bad  EDM, it just gets super annoying. You must listen to the same songs over and over and over and over. Replay Value: 4/10 This game quickly becomes boring. There are only so many variations on cars and so many different tasks you can perfect performing. After a while, there's just no point in playing. The Trader Pack added the ability to buy cars at auction and restore them to keep or sell, but the only thing you can do with the money from selling cars is buy more cars or more car parts. It's very circular. It just feels like there's something missing at the upper level of this game. Overall: 60/100 I can't blame this game for being something I don't like. It's a simulation of being a mechanic, and I wasn't expecting much. So, as a game that simulates being an automotive repair specialist this game is probably a 90/100 (and stands pretty uncontested in its field). However, there's just about no replay value. There's no real reason to be satisfied with restoring even some of the nicest cars in the game because there's nothing to do with them after that, besides look at them and drive them around the generally pointless test track (the only textured driving course included with the game). The lack of replay value is what really ends up making this game kind of disappointing.  Suggestion:  What would make this game a 95/100 is a racing element: being able to buy performance-enhancing parts to upgrade your cars and then race for money. Despite its flaws, I'd say that Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is mostly worth the meager $19.99 it asks of your wallet.			"

Not only that but there are no fuel lines, radiator pipes, brake lines etc. You don't really know how parts work, but no doubt after this game its easyier to figure that out via google.

												Well this game has gave me a head start on mechanics. The only thing is that it only theaches you what parts are (Their names) And how to take them out of the vehicle. Not only that but there are no fuel lines, radiator pipes, brake lines etc. You don't really know how parts work, but no doubt after this game its easyier to figure that out via google. This game is really awesome! And so I recommend this to anybody that is willing to learn mechanics and needs a head start!			"

												This game is awesome especially for casual gamers or people who have no clue about cars. I am a father of 2 and live a busy life. This game lets me have the fun I need tinkering with vehicles without getting myself dirty and ever leaving my children into the garage. I love it!			"

												So. Car Mechanic Simulator 2015. The year is almost over, and I have a good 100 hours on this game, so it's about time for a review.What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said? It's definitely a very good game, it's informative in its own way, educational, and just plain fun, especially when you save up enough money and experience to expand your garage, get the paint shop, get the underground parking, and go to the auction house to buy wrecks you can fix up and sell for a profit.Of course, things are simplified a lot under the hood of each car you get to work on. I'm no mechanic, but I know enough of cars to have done maintenance on my own cars, and I have studied a lot of stuff for stories I write in which a character is an actual mechanic. There is in fact a funny thing about that; the game showed me painfully well how I got most of my knowledge about cars. It started in Dutch, as that is the language set on my laptop, and one of the first customer cars I got in showed a list that said there was a part that needed replacing. And I was all like; what the hell is that? So I saved and quit to menu, set the game language to English, started back up again, looked at the list, and went; Ohhh! Duh, a rubber bushing! Why didn't you just SAY so? I KNOW those! (And I know the name of that part mainly from watching YouTube videos of HotRod Magazine/HotRod Garage, and reading those kind of magazines - in English. For about 70% of the parts, I have NO clue what they are by the Dutch names alone)How simplified is it under the hood? Well, all cars have similar parts, for one. A front suspension has a crossmember, shocks, springs, a swaybar and end links, steering rack with inner and outer tie rods, upper and/or lower control arms, wheel knuckle housing, wheel hub, brake disk, pads, and a brake caliper. All but one or two cars come with a brake servo, and the newer models with an ABS pump and control unit. Brake lines? Nope. Brake fluid? Nope. A need to bleed the system after you rebuilt it? Nope.The engines? Let's stick with my favorite type of cars; the old ones. There's several classics that are all too recognizable; a 1957 Chevy Bel Air, a 1969 Ford Mustang, a 1968 Chevrolet Chevelle, a 1969 Dodge Charger. Of course they are not called that; the game has given each car its own brand and type. Big plus; they have actually taken the time to design logos and name badges that are on the cars, and they look good, too!But, the engines. Those four cars I mentioned all come with a carburated overhead-cam V8 engine. All parts are interchangeable, except for the two-carb intake manifold that comes on the Mustang. Have you bought a Chevelle and want to spruce it up a bit with a dual carburetor setup? Sorry, no can do, that dual-carb intake manifold is not an optional part for that car. Even when you take the V8 out of a Mustang and put it in the Chevelle, you can only put on the single-carb intake manifold. The only optional parts you can change on a car are the rims, and body parts if you have the Visual Tuning DLC pack.For the rest, though, it's good. Quite simplified, but with plenty of detail parts even so. Take apart one of those old V8's, and you find yourself with a box full of individual rocker arms and pushrods which you can take out one by one - and there's sixteen of them in one engine.There's one big drawback, though. You can't take the whole engine plus transmission out of the car in one big lump and put it on an engine stand to disassemble it, like almost any car restorer does; you have to disassemble, and reassemble it, in the car. And some parts you can only reach from underneath. Once you have gotten down to the engine block, it's; take out pistons, lift car, get under, remove oil pan (if you already hadn't), remove crankshaft caps, remove crankshaft, get out, lower car, remove engine block. Fix up or buy new one. Put in engine block, lift car, get under, put in crankshaft, put in crankshaft caps, get out, lower car, put in pistons, lift car, get under, put on oil pan and filter, get out, lower car, rebuild rest of the engine. That would be SO much easier if you could just take the whole thing out, put it on an engine stand, and disassemble/reassemble there.And the simplification shows. The plug wires are the only wires you'll find in the whole car. The detailing goes as far as to put individual clips on the air filter box/distributor cap you have to take off, but a wiring loom for all the electrics? Not there. Gaskets? Not there. There's a fuel filter, but fuel lines? Nope. Brake lines? Nope. And even on the most hashed-out rusty wreck of a 1957 Bel Air you buy at the auction house, ALL the bolts are always brand new. The rims and parts of the suspension/engine may be so rusted they are beyond repair, but they still come off with three turns of your wrench on the brand new bolts holding everything in place.The same goes for the fixing of the parts. You have a work table where you can fix a good number of the parts you take off a car. Butthe fixing process is; click. You managed to repair the part! Condition is now X%! Or; click. You failed to repair the part. Condition has decreased. (and it always decreases to a point so low you can't re-attempt to fix it again. So if you hash up a part, it's utterly broken and you need to buy a new one)Still, overall, it's a great game. After 100 hours I'm still not bored of it, even if I'm doing pretty much the same things over and over again. It just has that certain something about it that keeps drawing you in to play it more. There's just a few little things that could make it even better.- placing of the oil drain pan. That is SUCH a hit-and-miss, because you can't look upwards properly once you're moving that thing around. I end up just removing the oil pan and taking the $100 fine for oil cleanup, rather than to fiddle around with that drain and having it sit just a smidge too far to the left, right, front or back anyway.- disassembling/reassembling the engine outside of the car on an angine stand. If that could be implemented, it would be SUCH an improvement.- customizing of the cars. Currently, it's just visual with body parts and head/tail lights and bumpers, and rims, and only when you have the Visual Tuning DLC pack. If you were allowed to put different engines in different cars, or even do things like put that dual-carb intake on a single-carb V8 engine, that would make things a lot more fun. Also, speed parts would be nice. Take the tame little Pinto, yank out that four-banger engine, plop in a V8 with a high-lift cam, dual or triple carburetors and a turbo or a blower, and you suddenly have a much more interesting car.- graphics. Not the overall game graphics; those are pretty good as is. But some extra graphics for the cars? That would be a lot more fun. Take the Dodge Charger, give it a new paint job, and let us put on a bumblebee stripe around the rear end, for instance. Or racing stripes over the hood and trunk of the Chevelle. Or a spiffy flame-job. Hell yeah.- the test drive. Currently, there are in fact different engine sounds for the different cars, and some different driving characteristics. But the handling is atrocious, and the whole thing feels a bit... tacked on. Almost like it was an afterthought. There is massive potential for improvement there.- bodywork on the cars. At the moment, it's front bumper, headlights, hood, front fenders, doors, trunk lid, taillights, rear bumper. Not even windshields/rear windows/side windows (and everyone who ever restored an old car knows that the quarter panels/rear fenders and floor pans are 90% of the time the areas that need the most work). I can see a lot of potential for improvement there as well, the outer bodywork, and the interior as well. Allow us to put in leather bucket seats, for instance, or give the interior a different color than black.Do I recommend this game though? Hell yes!			"

												Great way to kill time and learn the basics. However even though I know just the basics about a lawn-mower 2 stroke engine from a high school course -- I barely remember from 1987 I would say this game needs more reality to it. All the bolts require the same wrenches and there are no screw drivers that I have seen so far. There is nothing detailed about electrical lines. Nothing detailed about the distributer cap. You can put on wheels without being dinged point for not using the staring method to keep the tires from warping. There is no torque wrench, their is no scraping off an old gasket to replace with a new one. Shipping is instantaneous when there could easily be an online store you can ship from that the server populates that all people are trying to buy first -- in this case you would need to be able to put an order-in-as-next. Then the shipper should come by depending where in the country the item came from - 10 minutes - 2 hours, not days that wouldn't make a very good game unless they lowered the XP requirements for tools. The tools are too simple to use, nothing to hook up or see hooked up. You can drain the oil and do a compression test, which makes no sence like not using the star-torque to properly put on a tire. So more or less its a game for just to learn the names of the main parts of a vehicle, nothing really mechanic level -- or even close to. Yet I still have quite a bit of fun, I just pretend I scraped off a gasket and torquied and I just star-torque the lug-nuts back onto the tires when I put them back on.Devs: Please make some point loss for mess ups. Compressor test without oil, come on. -10 XP right there. How about when the driver takes the car to the back, they blow the engine costing you -100XP and $1000 and brings the car back with a seized cam rod and/or a piston because you forgot the oil. Also it would be nifty to have a boss that hangs around waiting for you to make a mistake and yells at you, but you can go into a fist mode and give him a temporary black eye for -10XP, MIGHT BE WORTH IT! Make this a $10.00 DLC for all this albet it sells fast!How about a DLC for weather so we an listen to lightning and rain and see some flashes out the window. An event where the outside tree is falling apart and if you arn't aware it crashes though and destroies your car in one of the bays? This way move to centre would be fun. A snow store causes your fingers to get really cold so you have to close a window and turn up the heat. I would pay $5 for this sort of enhancement DLC.Devs you have a great start here, why not a little extra realism for fun? All I do is pile up the XP and money, but nothing special is happening. Maybe there is a buy junk car sell for big bucks mode after I unlock the paintshop.But I like the game but no one should pay more than a copy on sale, the asking price is for a more realistic version. One more time I have to say this ""Why - No - Gaskets?""l8r all			"

												I really enjoyed this title.  It's fun to play and fix or buy cars at auction to rebuild, tune to your tastes, etc., but this is definitely a niche game, and you need to be aware of that coming in.  There's no racing, unless you buy the extra DLC test track.  There's no building and tuning cars to your tastes unless you buy the Visual and Performance DLC.  As long as you know that coming in, you'll be satisfied with your experience, otherwise reconsider as you'll be better served buying a tank of gas for your real car with that 20 bucks. "

												I was dubious about this game. There's a vast amount of Simulator titled games out there and from the title, this doesn't sound like it's one of the more interesting ones. In the end, I think it was a sale that enticed me in and I'm glad I did, there's gameplay to be had here.You don't necessarily get dropped in at the deep end, you start off only being able to access the more simple jobs. I know how a car works and how it's bolted together so unfortunately I can't comment on how easy this is for those totally new to it all. It's reasonably realistic though, so if you're picking it up you're learning something!The initial pace is a little slow and a bit 'grindy' in places. Once you've unlocked everything though there's a few ways you can play it. I've taken to buying cars at auction and completely rebuilding them to see how much profit is available in each model. There's a few other strategies I've not tried yet such as only replacing parts less than 80%.Eventually, you'll realise that all you're doing is giving the mouse some exercise as you're just clicking the same things over and over again. When that happens, you can switch the brain back on and take on a few customer jobs instead, requiring you to investigate things. I'm not sure how much life is left in the game, but I've had over 60 hours in it so far so I've gotten my moneys worth.			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator (henceforth CMS) 2015 is a distinct improvement over what was offered with CMS 2014. The fact that you can choose what jobs to accept or decline is very nice, especially as you are starting out and may not know where a particular problem might lie. However, where I think this game really shines is being able to buy a heap for cheap, gut it, repair what parts you are able, replace the rest, and sell it for a tidy profit. You may also elect to keep it for yourself, but there is little to do with it if you do, other than to simply look at it. My recommendation to any new players of the game is to do enough jobs to save up a bit of money, then start buying and fixing up cars from the auction. You can bet that the price of the car is going to double or triple in the auction house, and I would say to save up enough money to possibly double THAT amount before you start fixing things up. Until you really level up your repair skill (something I would definitely focus on fairly early on), you'll probably need to buy parts to replace all of the ones that you fail to repair. All of that aside, here is how I would evaluate the game:The Good:- Fixing up old cars and selling them is fantastic. This is where this game shines, and the enjoyment of this outweighs all of the negative points of this game put together. At the time of this review, I have clocked a little over 30 hours on the game, and I periodically return to it simply to do this. Although a little unrealistic, it's very satisfying to take something that's absolute garbage and get it into like-new condition, and there is a hefty bonus for selling a car that is in 100% condition.- Leveling up your skills as a mechanic is now separate from money, which you will be needing for the purchase of cars when you get tired of doing work orders.- Havng the garage means that you can hang onto a car that you really like, and it can be expanded with plenty of space for you to collect them all.- Fixing parts is free, but it has the possibility of breaking them, as well. This means that many jobs can be done quite cheaply, and this further increases the potential for profit in selling cars.- The game looks very nice and runs smoothly, at least on my computer.- The core gameplay of removing and replacing parts is executed well, and most things are pretty efficient, although it would be nice to have a side-by-side for your inventory and the shop.The Bad:- There is very little to do with cars once they are fixed up, other than sell them or send them to the garage. However, I don't really like driving or racing games, so this has little bearing on my opinion of the game.- Accessibility of parts is kind of an issue. Even if you are doing things in the most efficient way possible, you have to use the lift multiple times to get at every single part. The worst culprit by far is the crankshaft (and, by extension, the engine block). You have to use the lift once to remove the oil pan and the pieces keeping the crankshaft in place, another time to remove the pistons (and any other engine parts required to get at them), and once more to get the crankshaft out. Then, if you need to get at the engine block itself, it's a FOURTH go on the lift to get it out once the crankshaft has been removed. This is all a pretty minor gripe at the end of the day, and it may be fairly realistic, but it's still kind of annoying.- Even with the convenience of the PDA, which makes it so that you can buy parts without having to run back to your desk, the shop menu is separate from your inventory screen. This means that it can be cumbersome to buy a lot of parts to replace those that you have broken when fixing up an old junker.- Collecting oil requires you to be a sniper. Don't bother with it. Just pay the $100 cleanup fee.- Parts that you are repairing break quite often. When fully leveled, you have a 90% chance to repair a part, but you do not FULLY repair it. This means that you roll those dice multiple times per part. They really should've had a decrease in condition by a random amount if that 10% chance comes up, but instead, the thing is totally borked. So if you have a part that is in poor condition so that you need to hit ""repair"" 4 times to get it fully to 100%, then you actually have a chance that is 90%*90%*90%*90%, or about 66% chance of getting it fully repaired and 34% chance of breaking it entirely and paying to replace it. That may not sound bad, but that is what it is like when you're at max level. - DLC. Gross. Well, it's not AWFUL, but here's the thing: the ""Gold"" version of this game only includes some of the DLC. Most of the rest of it adds actual brand name vehicles to the lineup. So, since they have to pay to use those brands, it makes some sense. Even so, it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth to buy the Gold version and not even get the majority of the DLC.The Ugly:- The game actually looks very nice on the whole, but the textures for new parts sometimes doesn't say ""shiny chrome"" so much as it does ""plastic thing painted to look like shiny chrome.""- Some of the paint colors are pretty awful.... well, just like with real-life cars, truthfully. Many of them are quite nice, but it seems like you're more likely to wind up with something pretty ugly. You can paint them a new color, but you really can't preview a car's color very well in the paint shop without paying to have it painted, which means that tweaking that color can get kinda expensive.

Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 (CMS 15) is exactly what is sounds like: a car mechanic simulator. The player takes the role of a mechanic in your very own garage. As you build up a good reputation and learn more, you get to work on harder, more complex vehicles. You are given hints early on to help you determine exactly what parts to fix or replace, but soon those nice yellow outlines will disappear, and you're on your own. Cars get nicer, and so do your payouts.Car Mechanic Sim is literally all I hoped it to be. I wanted to learn more about how cars come together, and it did the job perfectly for me. While it's not a 100% accurate simulation, the game does a good job of giving you the gist of certain aspects of how a car works. Before playing CMS15, I wouldn't have known how suspension even works in cars. I really like working on older cars, such as muscle cars and other little classic cars, because of how different they are from modern designs, especially the engines and the suspension setups.ProsGood basic learning toolLots of inexpensive DLCs to expand the gameplay (licensed brands, tuning options)Good array of cars parodied from real-world vehicles.ConsNot a full car simulation! It's a mechanic sim!Gets progressively more difficult (could be interpreted either way really, just putting it in the cons because it has more weight as a con) The gameplay is a bit repetitive after a while.

												Love it so far nothing wrong with it so far helped me learn a lot about cars that I am unaware of. Very addicting but I would like a request for a couple of cars which are the Subarus impreza/wrx or cars with flat 6/ Boxer engines cause I own a 2010 Impreza and just would like to work with those and learn about em i can do it on the internet but playing around with them on a game would be much more entertaining,			"

												Great way to kill time and learn the basics. However even though I know just the basics about a lawn-mower 2 stroke engine from a high school course -- I barely remember from 1987 I would say this game needs more reality to it. All the bolts require the same wrenches and there are no screw drivers that I have seen so far. There is nothing detailed about electrical lines. Nothing detailed about the distributer cap. You can put on wheels without being dinged point for not using the staring method to keep the tires from warping. There is no torque wrench, their is no scraping off an old gasket to replace with a new one. Shipping is instantaneous when there could easily be an online store you can ship from that the server populates that all people are trying to buy first -- in this case you would need to be able to put an order-in-as-next. Then the shipper should come by depending where in the country the item came from - 10 minutes - 2 hours, not days that wouldn't make a very good game unless they lowered the XP requirements for tools. The tools are too simple to use, nothing to hook up or see hooked up. You can drain the oil and do a compression test, which makes no sence like not using the star-torque to properly put on a tire. So more or less its a game for just to learn the names of the main parts of a vehicle, nothing really mechanic level -- or even close to. Yet I still have quite a bit of fun, I just pretend I scraped off a gasket and torquied and I just star-torque the lug-nuts back onto the tires when I put them back on.Devs: Please make some point loss for mess ups. Compressor test without oil, come on. -10 XP right there. How about when the driver takes the car to the back, they blow the engine costing you -100XP and $1000 and brings the car back with a seized cam rod and/or a piston because you forgot the oil. Also it would be nifty to have a boss that hangs around waiting for you to make a mistake and yells at you, but you can go into a fist mode and give him a temporary black eye for -10XP, MIGHT BE WORTH IT! Make this a $10.00 DLC for all this albet it sells fast!How about a DLC for weather so we an listen to lightning and rain and see some flashes out the window. An event where the outside tree is falling apart and if you arn't aware it crashes though and destroies your car in one of the bays? This way move to centre would be fun. A snow store causes your fingers to get really cold so you have to close a window and turn up the heat. I would pay $5 for this sort of enhancement DLC.Devs you have a great start here, why not a little extra realism for fun? All I do is pile up the XP and money, but nothing special is happening. Maybe there is a buy junk car sell for big bucks mode after I unlock the paintshop.But I like the game but no one should pay more than a copy on sale, the asking price is for a more realistic version. One more time I have to say this ""Why - No - Gaskets?""l8r all			"

It may be overwhelming at first to people like me, but as you carry on you began to learn how everything works. The DLC was actually satisfying and the graphics are excellent. This easily has to be one of my favorite games on Steam. Hopefully there will be a Car Mechanic Simulator 2016.			"

												Awesome game, not quite a true simulator, but a real sim would give you backache, broken toes, and hours of fiddling around for the right tool. Still easily worth the money I paid for it, and my all-time favourite simulator game. Would recommend to petrol heads, vague car likers, and anyone in general. Nice to find a chilled out yet still awesome game I can play without having to disable the music instantly. 10/10			"

												Yes my review says I DO NOT recommend this game and it is not because it is bad. It is amazing as it really does simulate being a mechanic, its tedious, repetetive and will sometimes get frustrating. Now having said that it is a lot simpler than being an actual mechanic as it does not go into extreme detail. It is a very simplified game, and this brings me to what it really is. A game. This lies somewhere in the middle of being a game and a simulator, its way too repetitive to be any kind of fun as a game but it doesn't quite get to the detail to make it fun as a simulator.So in summary Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 gives a very good feeling of what it is like to BE a mechanic but is terrible at simulating working on cars. It is a confused game and is not really a simulator. I really did expect more.I am not saying don't buy it, just do a little more research first so you know what your getting into.			"

												I like it for what it is.  A simplified instructional simulation on how cars are basically put together.  It's got a bit of a learning curve but once you've done a couple of brake jobs you can knock it out in no time.  You can upscale the learning by then looking at your own car and try and identify the parts.  I drive a 2002 Jeep Wrangler so there actually are similarities.All in all it's fun learning a bit about how to tear cars apart and put them back together without all the chemicals, fumes, rust, dirt, busted knuckles, sweat, and uncomfortable crawling around a car.  Plus it won't let you put it back together wrong and it does guide you through what components you need to to add/remove before the next step of the buildup/breakdown.The car selections I encountered were mostly european looking cars with a few classic muscle type cars.  I presume alot of the content has pantenting and tradmarking so modern cars aren't readily available.  I probably need to check out the mods to find different cars.			"

												This game is a massive improvement to CMS14 in every meaningful way, and will help to quickly fill in the gaps to your car knowledge. As with any simulator, there is only so far that you can go to make it feel like the real thing, but in terms of interactive, consumer-grade media, this is probably the best thing on the market right now.The game can get a little repetitive at times, but I'm sure being an actual car mechanic gets a little repetetive too, particularly if you were to specialize in a limited field (like Japanese import transmissions, etc.). This game allows you to work on all aspects of a car, and for the most part, you can strip the cars down to the bone. The upgrade system is kind of a grind, but overall the pacing feels right. If you start a traditional game, the vehicles will have lists of the parts that need replacing, which can be highlighted on the car and identified easily. Over time, the lists will start to identify fewer and fewer parts, and force you to have to search for them and inspect manually. The projects themselves also become increasingly complicated. This system feels like it's rewarding your learning, and it's an empowering feeling. In general I detest the business model in games nowadays -- especially from major studios/publishers -- that basically forces you to buy 'modules' in the form of DLC that should have been included at launch by default. This game does that, but doesn't feel like you're being robbed either. You may only be interested in learning the SUV/Truck or an old Mini, so in that sense it works and makes sense here. In this setting. it doesn't subtract from the gameplay or force you to purchase the ending/continuation of the story, so I can't knock it too much.In a relatively limited timeframe, you will probably be able to name every single part on a car, regardless of the engine/vehicle type. If that is your goal, you can't miss this one. Can't wait to see what they do with the next iteration.			"

												I love this game. It's a great game to unwind to, zone out, and just get lost while listening to music, or hell, even the game's really cool soundtrack.If you're new to cars, or have an intermediate proficiency, then you really will probably learn something from it. A few folks complain about it not being accurate or realistic, and it isn't, but it gives you a very general overview of how cars are put together and how to take them apart. If you're at all a gearhead, or at all enjoy tinkering, puzzle games, or relaxing games, then this is for you.			"

												Fun game. Being a mechanic its not the most technically correct but does a pretty good job of having the correctly named parts. Its repetitive at first but once you get enough cash you can buy cars at auction and do a restore. That being said though its just more of the same as you have to then take off every part, repair it if possible then put them all back on.Fun game if you like car mechanics. They are also working on improvements and DLC addons that should bring lot more to the game like tuning etc. Right now its a parts changing game.The actual game play is not like the trailer videos. You never see third person and body work is just clicking the part off, buying a new one then clicking it back on again. Painting is 3 sliders then a click to paint.The test track is great fun where you can burn rubber and generally drive like a hooligan.I may sound a bit negative but I really like the game and would recommend it as its only going to get better			"

												This is the most realistic and exciting way to take cars apart and put them together again! I only have one problem. The game has a shortage of cars and gets really easy and repetitive when the end is reached. The best moment was definitely when I spent about 2-3 hours taking apart a fancy car, buying all new parts for it and putting it back together again. 8/10 is what it's worth. I recommend this game for sure!			"

												The game is awsome i love the way they are taking it. but there is a few things that i have to dissagree with. the motors need the option to be pulled out complete and put on a motor stand for conveinice. there is to may times tht i have had to raies and lower the car to just pull the pistons the raise it back up and pull the crank and gear box. the re lower the car for the engine block. you shouldnt have to pull the gear box to take the block out anyway, that is wrong in general. i am a full time mechanic and know there is alot of things this game could improve on. but over all for someone who doesnt know any thing about mechanics this game would teach them the basics, im not saying use it as your guide to tear apart cars for real. it not that accurate.

												It's a fun game that makes you want to work on cars in real life (if that's something you enjoy doing to begin with). Pretty detailed as to things that need to be removed in order to remove something else such as Spring caps before you can remove the lower strut. I enjoy the game from time to time, but after about 1-2 hours straight, I need to take a break. They're slowly adding new features like being able to add any rim to any vehicle, the tuner ability to change out headlights and tail lights, grills, etc. Would be nice to see a bigger selection on the visual tuning, but what they have is decent for now. They said they'll be adding more and other feature so just waiting around for those options now. Would be nice to add a turbo or supercharger to any vehicle instead of just turbos to the vehicles that are factory turbo.

												Since this trend of what I call ""blue collar gaming,"" I've been reluctant to partake.  On a whim (and after reading other reviews), however, I picked this one up and was blown away.  Not only is the game fun, but I've learned a ton about the basics of automobiles and how they work.  Coming from this as a complete novice (the equivalent of ""where's the crankshaft, in the glove box?), I went from having to dismantle pretty much the entire car every repair to figuring out exactly what I needed to for each job =)One thing I will add, however -- I've learned on Steam to pay attention to how developers are supporting their games, especially when they first hit the store.  If you check out the news on this game you'll see how responsive Red Dot has been -- it's insane!  Almost weekly (and sometimes daily) there's a bug fix, a mechanical improvement, DLC ... very, very impressed.If you think you'd have fun learning how to wrench on virtual cars, trust me and get this one!

												This game is absolutely amazing, and much better than it's predecessor. It's very good for people like me who didn't know too much about how exactly car components work and where they go. It obviously doesn't substitue for actual mechanical knowledge, but it will help you if you want to do minor mainainance on your vehicle without having to ask where to put the oil in after you drain it for an oil change. It's quite stress relieving, and is very calming for a ""simulator"" game.The only cons I can really think of is the fact that some people might not like the techno/electronic music that plays, but it's easily turned off.

												This is a pretty entertaining game, even for a light/heavy line auto technician who does the real life stuff. Its great to pass the time with, learn a little (for the average individual who doesn't do this kind of work), and enjoy a game for those who have the automotive passion. Most average players won't notice the mistakes, but it's understandbly not 100% realistic. A couple examples are: The ""power steering pump"" looks exactly like an A/C compressor on most models. Also, I had no idea a belt driven radiator fan could bolt up to nothing with four bolts in FRONT of the radiator. And lastly, coming from someone who does this kind work in reality......don't spend an hour with frustration on how to drop the fuel tank or try to remove the back seat in a car to change the fuel pump in the top of the tank. You know, the usual, real life step you would have to take. Because none of that works or is apparently needed. You can apparently just remove the fuel pump in the tank that's buried in the car. Makes no sense. Real world thinking screwed me there for a bit.Anyway, game doesn't have any bugs. No glitches or issues with playability.All in all, not too bad of a game. I enjoy it.			"

												Great game with lots of material. It takes a while but once you get to the auction and get into building your own cars it's pretty awesome. The only complaint I have is this REALLY, REALLY long load times.  You can pretty much tear apart your car out in the driveway before you load into the drag strip or auction house. First upgrade recommended, the tablet!. All in all it's very much worth the price.			"

												In my opinion, this game is very good for people like me, who like cars and maybe would like to become a mechanic. Of course, the game may not be very accurate, but it can still help to get the basics, and diagnose main engine, suspension and other problems. Optional feature - DLCs make the game even more enjoyable. By buying DLCs you can get new cars, car parts or features like chip tuning and dyno testing. But you don't need to have DLCs - you can play without it, and can still enjoy the game. I hope that the game will have even more features in the future.			"

												So much, yet so little..,First of all, I thoroughly enjoy this game, I really do. I find myself perpetually visiting the site in order to see what new features and DLCs are available to satisfy this newly created obsession of putting wonderful machines together in different ways that I could never hope to afford on a garbage man's salary.When I first purchased Car Mechanic Simulator 2015, it was one of those titles on my wishlist that I'd hoped would finally give me enough of that car-mod junkie fix I was looking for. My feelings might be mixed on that one though. I played a game called Street Legal Racing (Redline) for a while that allowed you to put some cars together, but was extremely limited without the plethora of User Mods available out there (unfortunately, they cause the game to crash as often as -insert expletive here). What it did do right however, was the customizeability, and a nod to the racing genre if you felt like pursuing the in-game ""game"".Ok, let's start with what CMS 2015 is not. It is not a ""Need For Speed"" clone, and that is Ok. As titillating as the prospect of racing a hard worked, hard earned car is around a fictional Nürburgring facsimile with 15 sirens blaring in the background, I am of the mind that even with a AAA budget, you can either do one thing or the other very well but not both. CMS 2015 focuses on the simulatory aspects of building up your virtual baby with a level of detail that pleases and surprises.You start out with a workshop and some car repair jobs to choose from. As you progress, you gain some cash and leveling points that you can spend on equipment and such. Without delving into too many details so as to stay on point, you get to purchase or fix different components ranging from the suspension to the engine and really get into the ""nuts and bolts"" of things. After 20 or so hours and a real sense of accomplishment, I felt myself wishing that I could get even further detail into the parts I was dealing with. I was satisfied with changing things like cylinder heads and screwing on the bolts, but I kind of felt like ""where is the head gasket?"" That pesky thing that once caused me an overdraft and a scolding from my manager for coming in late. Another thing I desperately wanted, was to take Mr. Bean's car and drop some American V8 muscle in it with 21 inch rims and a boeing wing for downforce. Unfortunately and inexplicably, you can't! It seems to me that the foundations of the game are solid enough to support this though and I do really hope to see something like this very soon. In conclusion, the aspects that are included are very well polished. The assortment of cars work as unique puzzles that need specific pieces to fit in the right order and give you a greater appreciation than the sum of their parts. Yet, more detailed problems can be fleshed out to create greater challenges, as well as interesting combinations that could increase the longevity of the game (not to mention better custom modding) by leaps and bounds.Either way, I want more!

It's really relaxing, but also gives you a great sense of achievement. It felt great to get my paint shop up and running, and now I'm chasing the XP and money to get parking so I can get auction buys. I have a keen interest in cars in real life so was wary that this could be a let down, but the opposite is true. I couldn't recommend it more. Well done.

												I've only played a couple of hours so far, but I can already tell that this is a superior game. I'm enjoying it.I don't know anything about cars. Car Mechanic Simulator won't make me a mechanic. It doesn't go that deep. But it is teaching me what the various main components of a car look like, where they are, and as a driver, what a symptom would be if such and such a part went bad.The game brings you in slowly, in the beginning showing you a list of what needs to be replaced in any car that comes in and making sure you don't screw anything up. I've had no problem figuring out what is going on. The graphics/sounds are nice and smooth.I can't categorize this... perhaps I could say it's a puzzle game that also teaches you a little bit of real world info. But I can recommend this. Pick it up. No reason to be intimidated. The less you know about cars, the better this game will be for you.			"

												I wont thumb it down just because of its addictive nature and it is a fun game to play. Game is missing basic essentials to a vehicle which is a killer for me but alot of the other components are there. For a simulator it is very lack luster. I can see where the game wanted to go presuming others agree with this review, they did as well. It just hasnt happened yet or it wont happen. I will continue to play and wait for updates(DLC as well). This may seem like a negative review, it isnt. Its a fun game worth the money but be ready for some serious repetitiveness after about 10 hours depending on how much an individual plays.			"

												If you repaired cars, the logic here will fail you. Fuel filters above the gas tank? Really? I know, lots of positives. But they concentrate on European models. One day I'd like to see this game based on US models.  The feeling of once again taking a 20"" wheel off a Surburban in mid air, ah that's manly man stuff.  Or changing a rear end in a Camaro or Challenger, the blower on a Hellcat, the heater core in a Blazer (look that one up). Nope not here.I just didn't enjoy it. I'll give it a positive because it's pretty and the game works, but it's Euro-centric and not my cup of Jack Daniels.			"

												I was dubious about this game. There's a vast amount of Simulator titled games out there and from the title, this doesn't sound like it's one of the more interesting ones. In the end, I think it was a sale that enticed me in and I'm glad I did, there's gameplay to be had here.You don't necessarily get dropped in at the deep end, you start off only being able to access the more simple jobs. I know how a car works and how it's bolted together so unfortunately I can't comment on how easy this is for those totally new to it all. It's reasonably realistic though, so if you're picking it up you're learning something!The initial pace is a little slow and a bit 'grindy' in places. Once you've unlocked everything though there's a few ways you can play it. I've taken to buying cars at auction and completely rebuilding them to see how much profit is available in each model. There's a few other strategies I've not tried yet such as only replacing parts less than 80%.Eventually, you'll realise that all you're doing is giving the mouse some exercise as you're just clicking the same things over and over again. When that happens, you can switch the brain back on and take on a few customer jobs instead, requiring you to investigate things. I'm not sure how much life is left in the game, but I've had over 60 hours in it so far so I've gotten my moneys worth.			"

												Just started to play the game. First time running the game there was no overlay or text on screen. Restart fixed this. Game seems pretty cool if you have ever taken apart a car before. It IS pretty realistic having to remove certain components before you can get to the part you are trying to fix/replace. The actual bolts do leave alot to be desired though. For instance when taking off a brake caliper there is no slide, boot, need to grease or brush/sand/grind. I realize this may be beyond the scope of the game/sim but the more realistic the better. People could actually learn something! Including me! I am no pro mechanic and im sure there is alot myself and others can learn from it. Overall so far I think its a pretty good start for this type of sim and im sure, in time, it will get even better and more realistic. I will be checking it out more.			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator (henceforth CMS) 2015 is a distinct improvement over what was offered with CMS 2014. The fact that you can choose what jobs to accept or decline is very nice, especially as you are starting out and may not know where a particular problem might lie. However, where I think this game really shines is being able to buy a heap for cheap, gut it, repair what parts you are able, replace the rest, and sell it for a tidy profit. You may also elect to keep it for yourself, but there is little to do with it if you do, other than to simply look at it. My recommendation to any new players of the game is to do enough jobs to save up a bit of money, then start buying and fixing up cars from the auction. You can bet that the price of the car is going to double or triple in the auction house, and I would say to save up enough money to possibly double THAT amount before you start fixing things up. Until you really level up your repair skill (something I would definitely focus on fairly early on), you'll probably need to buy parts to replace all of the ones that you fail to repair. All of that aside, here is how I would evaluate the game:The Good:- Fixing up old cars and selling them is fantastic. This is where this game shines, and the enjoyment of this outweighs all of the negative points of this game put together. At the time of this review, I have clocked a little over 30 hours on the game, and I periodically return to it simply to do this. Although a little unrealistic, it's very satisfying to take something that's absolute garbage and get it into like-new condition, and there is a hefty bonus for selling a car that is in 100% condition.- Leveling up your skills as a mechanic is now separate from money, which you will be needing for the purchase of cars when you get tired of doing work orders.- Havng the garage means that you can hang onto a car that you really like, and it can be expanded with plenty of space for you to collect them all.- Fixing parts is free, but it has the possibility of breaking them, as well. This means that many jobs can be done quite cheaply, and this further increases the potential for profit in selling cars.- The game looks very nice and runs smoothly, at least on my computer.- The core gameplay of removing and replacing parts is executed well, and most things are pretty efficient, although it would be nice to have a side-by-side for your inventory and the shop.The Bad:- There is very little to do with cars once they are fixed up, other than sell them or send them to the garage. However, I don't really like driving or racing games, so this has little bearing on my opinion of the game.- Accessibility of parts is kind of an issue. Even if you are doing things in the most efficient way possible, you have to use the lift multiple times to get at every single part. The worst culprit by far is the crankshaft (and, by extension, the engine block). You have to use the lift once to remove the oil pan and the pieces keeping the crankshaft in place, another time to remove the pistons (and any other engine parts required to get at them), and once more to get the crankshaft out. Then, if you need to get at the engine block itself, it's a FOURTH go on the lift to get it out once the crankshaft has been removed. This is all a pretty minor gripe at the end of the day, and it may be fairly realistic, but it's still kind of annoying.- Even with the convenience of the PDA, which makes it so that you can buy parts without having to run back to your desk, the shop menu is separate from your inventory screen. This means that it can be cumbersome to buy a lot of parts to replace those that you have broken when fixing up an old junker.- Collecting oil requires you to be a sniper. Don't bother with it. Just pay the $100 cleanup fee.- Parts that you are repairing break quite often. When fully leveled, you have a 90% chance to repair a part, but you do not FULLY repair it. This means that you roll those dice multiple times per part. They really should've had a decrease in condition by a random amount if that 10% chance comes up, but instead, the thing is totally borked. So if you have a part that is in poor condition so that you need to hit ""repair"" 4 times to get it fully to 100%, then you actually have a chance that is 90%*90%*90%*90%, or about 66% chance of getting it fully repaired and 34% chance of breaking it entirely and paying to replace it. That may not sound bad, but that is what it is like when you're at max level. - DLC. Gross. Well, it's not AWFUL, but here's the thing: the ""Gold"" version of this game only includes some of the DLC. Most of the rest of it adds actual brand name vehicles to the lineup. So, since they have to pay to use those brands, it makes some sense. Even so, it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth to buy the Gold version and not even get the majority of the DLC.The Ugly:- The game actually looks very nice on the whole, but the textures for new parts sometimes doesn't say ""shiny chrome"" so much as it does ""plastic thing painted to look like shiny chrome.""- Some of the paint colors are pretty awful.... well, just like with real-life cars, truthfully. Many of them are quite nice, but it seems like you're more likely to wind up with something pretty ugly. You can paint them a new color, but you really can't preview a car's color very well in the paint shop without paying to have it painted, which means that tweaking that color can get kinda expensive.

												As someone who really works on cars, I'd say this is a failry accurate mechanic sim without the grazed knuckles and frustration of hard to get to bolts.Very similar to games such as Gearhead Garage and Street Legal, this game puts you in charge of your own workshop. You make money fixing customers cars which you can then spend on buying cars at auction. The auction cars always need some work, when the work is complete you can either add the car to your garage, or sell it for a profit.I am restoring a DeLorean in real life so I also grabbed the DeLorean DLC. It's pretty accurate, although some things in the engine bay are in the wrong place and the DeLorean in this game has a power steering pump instead of an A/C unit, but I understand this is probably a limitation of the game engine. It did feel weird taking the mix unit and intake manifold off to inspect the Valley of Death as I have done on my own DeLorean.I've had hours of fun, the only downside to the game is it can get repetitive. quite a lot of the customer jobs are big jobs such as rebuilding the entire front and back suspension system, which is time consuming and monotonous. Having said that, life as a real mechanic would be very similar. There is also not much you can do with your own cars once they have been rebuilt, apart from sit in them or take them around a test track.Overall I'd recommend this game to anyone who has an interest in pulling cars and engines to bits and at the moment this is probably THE best game on the market for anyone wanting a modern Gearhead Garage clone.

												I'm no expert when it comes to cars but this game has got my attention, I bought this game not only to have fun but to learn car parts as well. The game is really fun (seriously), especially if you buy the Performance DLC because you can modify your own car even more like swapping engines! Unfortunately there's no tutorial, at least for the control. You won't be guided what to do to fix the car, you'll be given list of parts that needs to be replaced and that's it (I even search Google Image to find the location of the part xD). If you gain enough XP there will be more challenges, like you need to find the broken parts yourself. Soon you'll get tools like OBD Scanner to help you examine broken parts faster and more easily.---------------------------The game's pretty small though, unlike game like Euro Truck Simulator 2 where you can name you company, hire staff, travel between countries. This game only let you work inside a garage alone, so this game can be boring after you play the game for a while. Well you can test cars in a test track, buy your own personal car, and have a drag race but that's basically it. Even so, to purchase your own car, you need to get a parking lot, which require lots of XP to be able to purchase it.---------------------------You should purchase this game if you're interested in cars, because believe me, you'll be fixing cars all day long and if you're not into it you'll ditch the game right away.

Definitely worth picking up when it is on sale.  The DLCs are reasonable priced as well.			"

												I love this game! I find myself always going onto this game expecting to be on for 1 or 2 hours, then i usually actually end up being on it for longer then that. Its helping me learn how to diagnose whats wrong and figure out where faulty parts would be, instead of just pulling things apart hoping to find something which is what i was semi doing at the start of playing this game. Ive also finally learnt that the engine in the Maluch is in the back of the car not the front hahaa  xD  Just sucks that need to buy anything else if want more to do. Dyno would be helpful butnot sure i would wanna pay for it. To those who have it, is it worth the money?Overall this game is really awsome and i recommend it to anyone who loves cars or wants to learn about fixing them.			"

												ProsThe SimulatorHow to start?The Simulator is incredible ... Many pieces to work with, several types of defects, several ways to solve unique problems ...Simply incredible, many of the rules used in the maintenance and reform of automobiles appears in this simulator, not to call the game ... at immersion level and incredible the game ""clean"" without DLCs is already greatDLC'sAll very well done, with parts, components and unique builds for each car, now these dlc's with official marks make the simulator even more incredible.My favorites are the Performance DLC and Visual Tunning left a lot of memory for the classic SLRR MWM, and the wordless delorean even with the effect of time travel ... and very fun to point the car to a wall and it simply disappears without crashing. ..ConsWell not everything is perfect, the game sins in a few basic things ... the repetitiveness, the soundtrack, and the total lack of races.RepeatabilityThis was a little impossible to escape, after all, work is repetitive ... so there's no wayThe soundtrackCould have more songs, besides electronics, prepare a hot hod listening to electronics does not match the moment.RacingAs stated by the developers themselves on the facebook page ... ""The focus of the game is not racing, but only maintenance, if you want clues, wait for the community to develop"" (Not exactly with those words), if you prepare the car do not Take a turn on a curved track or leave the garage for a few laps in the neighborhood ... and a shame.DLC'sCustom PaintsPaint modern cars prepared or old hotrods, deserve some decals, a black hood, banners and etc ... could there be such a DLC ...SuspensionOk, the producer gave wheels, Tires ... but how about a suspension of races ?, or maybe an offroad suspension, or even a suspension for street races, it would be very interesting to be able to prepare cars like thisVisual tunning (In the photo has Spoiler in the DLC does not)A DLC that has the name of Visual Tunning and does not have bolder Escapes, bodykits nor the simplest and most basic Spoilers !, Spoilers! Do not put in a photo what does not come with the product ...InteriorsIf it is possible to have tunning in the game, do not think that it lacks the substitution of seats, steering wheel and things like ... nor is it necessary to put speakers in the car ... but to be able to use banks Sparco for example would be good ...ConclusionThe Simulator is incredible, yes ... are they planning a 2017? Maybe, but keeping the 2015 or Creating a 2017, add more things more options, the players thank you.Final grade(9,5 / 10)			"

Car Mechanic Simulator is about fixing cars that have problems beacaue the owners hate evething about there car. Besides fixing other peoples cars you can also go and buy one for your self. But wait it gets better. THE CAR THAT YOU BUY USALLY HAS NOTHING TO IT. No doors no.... you get were im going. This game also has great dlc. So if you like fixing cars then this is the game for you.

												I have played this game for awhile now, it has honestly been one of the best car mechanic sim experiences I have ever had. It may have a small varity of cars (for free anyway), and it may take a lot of grinding and basically no lifingthis game to get anything worth your time like a garage, your own car, customizing it and such to an extent of course. But really all in all this game is amazing, the graphics aren't all that bad, the game mechanics/controls aren't all that confusing, and its a time consumer, you can just sit there and work on cars for hours, of course this is my opinion. So do I recommend those of you who: love cars, have almost no life like many of  us dont ;D, and you just want a game to waste time with, OF ♥♥♥♥ING COURSE PLAY THE♥♥♥♥♥♥OUT OF THIS GAME!!On the other hand for those of you who dont really have the time to waste and or actually have lives and all, pffft losers just kidding, but really I wouldnt recommend you getting it, you definitely could get this game and play it occasionally and get somewhere eventually but it would most likely take more time. This concludes my review thank you to those who fully read the whole text much appreciated.			"

They advertize superchargers and turbochargers and coming soon DLC for engine mods from last year thats not out. they have maybe 3 vehicles that come turbo'd in the game, but you cannot add a turbo to other vehicles with those same engines.  you can't engine swap v8's into RWD 6cyl/4cyl cars, theres no ride height/lift kits for the ONE truck (2 versions just the REX has black trim around windows and different headlights/tailights) and ONE suv that comes in the Truck&SUV DLC package. theres maybe 2 options for body parts on a majority of the vehicles (one being stock/other is a ""custom"" bumper, headlight, hood etc..). the only way to change wheel/tire size, power and RPM limits, or weight of a vehicle is by going in and modding the actual files in the game (which they encourage you do) in which if you do it wrong you'll wreck the game, instead of coming out with a Dyno/Tuning room. It shows you can remove the tires from the wheels and put different tire types/sizes, you can't. I was hoping to see customization for suspention and ride heights as that would be huge for customizing the look and drivability of vehicles in the showroom or on the test track. All in all i would recommend this game knowing all of these as its still addicting and relaxing game, It just seems Incomplete to me. I hope they have ALOT more coming for this game. "

												Well, I got this game for the Christmas Sale 2015. Since then i gamed it for like 2 days, around 10-12 hours daily, and now a few hours sometimes. This is a game, not like the other simulator games, this is a game you can play and play without getting tired of the game.Recommended.			"

												Gioco originale ed interessante....e dove finalmente c'è bisogno almeno di un minimo di cervello.Graficamente ben fatto e non ""impegnativo"" neanche per un pc con caratteristiche medio basse.Molto carine le aste,anche se personalmente avrei messo delle descrizioni minime delle auto con possibilità di gurdarle a 360°.Un pò  deludente il DLC chiamato total modifications con tanto di Maluch con mega-alettone e parafanghi maggiorati come immagine principale (le uniche modifiche che puoi fare all'estetica delle auto sono gruppi ottici e a qualcuna puoi cambiare il cofano anteriore)....come ""total modification"" è abbastanza misera -_- .Nell'insieme un buon gioco con il quale passare piacevoli minuti.Lo consiglierei sicuramente.

												I love this game but I wish there was more.The way you have to click on certain things in a particular order can be really frustrating. No key bindings. No help files. Little things like that really should be fixed.As far as wants: I wish there were more to this game like the ability to buy junkers and auction them or time based rewards for getting jobs done quickly. It just feels not quite complete.But overall this is a fantastic little game for what it is. For people who love clickers and incremental games, I think you’ll love this. For tinkerers, engineers, gear heads, etc. I think you’ll love this. For anyone who is into CAD or part modeling, you’ll at least appreciate this. It’s a really fun little game.Overall recommendation; Buy it on sale for <$15 "

Only thing i can think of that could improve the game is if you could do something with the cars, like race them(drag race or normal), tune them (Camber, Lower, Engine tuning, etc.) and possibly enter your car into a car show to win money			"

												So it seems the engine bay extremely reduces your frames. I load up into the game, it goes up to 80 FPS, then I bring in a car, FPS goes to 60, then stare closely at car gets 30, then opening and inspecting in the bay is 20 FPS. This does not mean you will certainly have the same problem I did, but lower specs will struggle. A lot. GeForce 630 overclocked or less will most likely have this problem.			"

												            Well. It is a very fun game. You do jobs until you have enough XP and money to get a garage.. then get cars at auction. What I do is get cars at auction, restore all the parts possible, and then sell the car for a profit. But the thing is, besides getting all of the cars, the game really has no end point. Another thing I link to mention is, if a car is in TERRIBLE, but driveable condition, and you drive it on the test course, you will tell no difference from driving a car in PERFECT condition. That is all I have to say.  Other then that, good game.			"

												So the past couple days, as of this writing, I changed my oil, replaced the oil filter, replaced the brake pads and bled the clutch and topped off the tire pressure on my car.That being said after all that I was in the mood to finally give this game a shot but I can't really call this a simulator because I wasn't busting my knuckles on things, getting my hands covered in something that probably causes a cancer known to the state of California, losing tiny parts and yelling curse words, that would make even a sailor blush, for all my neighbors to hear.I'm pretty sure anyone who has worked on a car knows what I'm talking about; if you really want to get to know what a person is really like inside have them work on a car.On a serious note though I think the game is pretty cool and refreshingly different but as someone who works on his own cars I have to say this is more of a puzzle game than a simulator but still intriguing if you're interested in the internal workings of a car; I can see how this game would be super interesting for someone who hasn't much experience working on cars.Maybe I just haven't got far enough into the game yet but the cars seem rather barren and the engine compartment isn't a dizzing array of hoses, pipes and wires like in real life.Also why is oil disposal $100? Maybe it's just where I live where you can dispose of oil for free at any auto parts store or a county waste site, but it's probably just one of those gameplay balancing things.One thing I do like is being able to go on the computer ingame and then finding and ordering parts from fictitious websites. It's not a biggie but a nice touch I think.My only real complaint is the music which is pretty much, so far, nothing but the wub wub wub kind of dubstep.Being a car mechanic themed game I would expect something a little more blue collar like rock or blues but that's okay; I opted to turn the music off and listen to my own music so it's not that big of a deal.One suggestion for the developers: Make a more detailed version of this game in VR with the Vive controllers. That would be awesome!			"

Even the tool controls do not show up so remember what buttons they are. Overall, good game if your into this kinda stuff.			"

												Seriously! My Grandma can screw faster than that, and she never misses. So far, I have been enjoying the game. Although it is long and drawn out, and you really don't get to choose what you want to do, the game is very detailed, and I appreciate it for that. No game breakers here, just don't play this if you get bored really easily. Biggest things I hate so far are how long it takes to take apart and replace parts, and how everything is so vague. Example, ""Odd noise from engine bay. (found 6 of 7 items)"" so I take apart the engine for like the 3rd time, ""Hey I wonder if it could be the battery?"" and sure enough, it is the battery. What the hell? noise? whatever. 8/10 would play again			"

												Overall I really enjoy this game. I really feel like this is a spiritual successor to a much older game that some car enthusiasts might be familiar with (""Gearhead Garage""). There are a lot of welcome improvements over the 2014 version of the game such as the ability to buy cars from the auction and sell them. The variety of cars is good and I like how there is an actual variety of how you assemble the vehicles. The graphics are pretty nice. Some of the game modes such as the test track and the paint booth seem a little underdeveloped in my opinion (as in the steering is a little difficult and the paint booth is pretty simplistic in terms of color choice.) The DLCs are pretty reasonably priced for the content in them. The only two things that bother me to any extent in the game is that you have to put a LOT of time into the game before you are able to access the auction block. I feel like the real highlight of the game is the ability to buy cars in various condition at the auction and then fix them up to sell them. Along with the auction sequence comes my second issue with the game: you should be able to put the car up for auction as opposed to outright selling it, and the work order screen should have some information on how much of a total monetary and time investment you have in the car.  With those things said, I don't think that they interfere with my enjoyment of the game to the extent that I would quit playing it or that I wouldn't recommend it.I bought the game as a bundle with a lot of its DLC included. I would buy it again. I would recommend it to others that are interested in cars and simulation games.			"

If you can enjoy those types of mechanics (eh...pun) with a gearhead theme, you will enjoy yourself :D -Start out small and do odd jobs to gain cash and xp.-Upgrade your tools, facilities, and skills. Start making some more cash.-At 9k xp you can start going to auctions and buy cars to upgrade and sell or keep in your collection.-DLC is where it's at. Performance/Visual Tuning pack gives you lots of new options.-Kinda Grindy. You get xp for every part you install or replace or screw you turn.			"

												Definitely an enjoyable game. Feels kind of like a puzzle in the order you have to take apart and put things together. Cars in the game will have different engines, running gear, brakes and other parts. Doing the jobs and getting xp can be repetitive, but once you get your own parking and get to buy auction cars and keep and sell them, gets a lot more fun.My only big con is the music for me, don't care for the techno type beat, but I just mute the ingame music and run my music player and listen to my own music. I find it actually relaxing to play this.			"

Highly recommended for fans of motors, cars, or puzzle games.Yeah. That's what I'd call this at the end of the day--a puzzle game.Generally it goes like this: Someone comes in with a car and tells you what's wrong with it--or rather as much as they can. In the beginning this is usually a description like ""Loud exhaust"" or ""Strange knocking sounds"", and then a full list of parts. You then go buy those parts for the customer, go in, and find and replace them. Eventually however the game stops holding your hand. You're given the description of the problem, and a list of the NUMBER of parts that need replacing, but you're not told which ones they are. You have to go in and manually inspect the engine, or the exhaust, or the transmission, and you have to diagnose those problems yourself. It's challenging, it's fun, and it's all the great parts about working on a car with none of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.It's a really cool game, and the DLC just makes it even cooler, with the addition of aftermarket parts, engine swaps, and new cars to play with. The DLC are VERY appropriately priced as well, each one adding just enough content to justify their price without feeling like a ripoff or a total steal.The only thing I can possibly complain about is the god forsaken soundtrack. It's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, but there are literally like... 4 or 5 songs that just play over and over--I suppose it's a rather realistic simulation of listening to the radio, but without any ads or DJs. Thankfully though, you can mute that♥♥♥♥♥♥ So when you get tired of the music--and you will--just go put on some hair metal and get back to thrashing.			"

												In this game I am the mechanic you fear in real life. I just swap decent parts from one side of the car to the other replacing the bad parts with the decent ones then putting the bad parts on the side that had the decent ones. I tried to send out an incomplete car but the developers were one step ahead of me. I don't know why I do this, a rubber bushing is like $12 in this game and takes 2 seconds to get but no I'll just disassemble half the car for a half hour to find a bushing that meets the minimum quality required for this car and swap them out. I am a horrible person. I do like this game alot I just have a personal problem.I think this could be fixed by giving the car an starting percentage of quality by averaging all the parts on the car and you have to send the car out better than when it arrives.My biggest complaint about games is the lack of music selection, but I understand theres liscensing fees and stuff like that plus royalties so I can let it slide. I just turn the music off and play the radio like its a real garage. I would like to see a game mechanic where you can have the game play streaming music from the internet, no idea how that would work it's just an idea.			"

												The most recent updates to CMS2015 have rendered it completely worthless. All the so-called Tech Support ever does is to say ""So Solly, You on you own."" Nice timing on their part waiting until we're well past the refund deadline. I will be avoiding red-dot games and their affiliates like the (CENSORED) PLAGUE from this day forward.

Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 (CMS 15) is exactly what is sounds like: a car mechanic simulator. The player takes the role of a mechanic in your very own garage. As you build up a good reputation and learn more, you get to work on harder, more complex vehicles. You are given hints early on to help you determine exactly what parts to fix or replace, but soon those nice yellow outlines will disappear, and you're on your own. Cars get nicer, and so do your payouts.Car Mechanic Sim is literally all I hoped it to be. I wanted to learn more about how cars come together, and it did the job perfectly for me. While it's not a 100% accurate simulation, the game does a good job of giving you the gist of certain aspects of how a car works. Before playing CMS15, I wouldn't have known how suspension even works in cars. I really like working on older cars, such as muscle cars and other little classic cars, because of how different they are from modern designs, especially the engines and the suspension setups.ProsGood basic learning toolLots of inexpensive DLCs to expand the gameplay (licensed brands, tuning options)Good array of cars parodied from real-world vehicles.ConsNot a full car simulation! It's a mechanic sim!Gets progressively more difficult (could be interpreted either way really, just putting it in the cons because it has more weight as a con) The gameplay is a bit repetitive after a while. You may like to try the challenge mode to mix things up a bit!Final Thoughts:CMS is a good way to pass time and learn something while doing it!Rating: 9.0/10This review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.

												This game is literally working in a car repair shop withhout oil and mess all over your hands, without missing nuts and bolts and of course, being in the comfort of your home. The game becomes more fun when you can buy your own cars and fix them up, however eventually you would have fixed so many cars, that it would be a bit boring after some time. The dev's have been releasing DLC's frequently though, so that we have more cars to mingle around with. Recently the Mercedes DLC came out, now THAT was a suprise. here are the Pro's and Con's about this game.Pro's-Wide variety of cars-Huge amount of customization for the garages-Bodykits and new rims if you get the DLC-Nice and simple auction system-Upgrades that make it more convenient in-game, for eg. faster un-bolting times, portable tablet for easy purchase of parts etcCon's-Bad inventory organising and sorting-Small and confined area to test your cars-Interior of cars are never damaged, torn or worn-Strange driving physics Overall I feel this is a great game for car enthusiasts and is not over complicated for those who are still extending their knowlage of cars, this game runs very smoothly on my MacBook Air and should do well on a PC running core i5 and has 4GB of ram.

The only issue I have is later in the game when it becomes more profitable to just buy cars and fully repair/upgrade them with performance parts the game gets a little bit repetative.			"

												Be nice to see were you can buy junk or used cars, fix them up, 2 different types of every part- Stock & AfterMarket. The parts selection should be like that for all Vehicles. You should then beable to choose if you want auction the car off or keep it. i think there also should be a Drag Strip & Circuit Track & offroad area for testing purpose's for the vehicles to give it more gameplay and fun. As for Tool upgrades and Shop Upgrades, i wish there where a next level for like the bolting you should beable to get a impact wrench and etc. As for Shop Upgrades i would really like to see 3 different types of buildings, and alot more upgrades for interrior, same with interrior jobs and etc for vehicles. ut other than that and alot more things on the forums already, that could be added, its a great game though i enjoy specially being a mechanic.

If you can enjoy those types of mechanics (eh...pun) with a gearhead theme, you will enjoy yourself :D -Start out small and do odd jobs to gain cash and xp.-Upgrade your tools, facilities, and skills. Start making some more cash.-At 9k xp you can start going to auctions and buy cars to upgrade and sell or keep in your collection.-DLC is where it's at. Performance/Visual Tuning pack gives you lots of new options.-Kinda Grindy. You get xp for every part you install or replace or screw you turn.			"

												Definitely an enjoyable game. Feels kind of like a puzzle in the order you have to take apart and put things together. Cars in the game will have different engines, running gear, brakes and other parts. Doing the jobs and getting xp can be repetitive, but once you get your own parking and get to buy auction cars and keep and sell them, gets a lot more fun.My only big con is the music for me, don't care for the techno type beat, but I just mute the ingame music and run my music player and listen to my own music. I find it actually relaxing to play this.			"

												Overall I really enjoy this game. I really feel like this is a spiritual successor to a much older game that some car enthusiasts might be familiar with (""Gearhead Garage""). There are a lot of welcome improvements over the 2014 version of the game such as the ability to buy cars from the auction and sell them. The variety of cars is good and I like how there is an actual variety of how you assemble the vehicles. The graphics are pretty nice. Some of the game modes such as the test track and the paint booth seem a little underdeveloped in my opinion (as in the steering is a little difficult and the paint booth is pretty simplistic in terms of color choice.) The DLCs are pretty reasonably priced for the content in them. The only two things that bother me to any extent in the game is that you have to put a LOT of time into the game before you are able to access the auction block. I feel like the real highlight of the game is the ability to buy cars in various condition at the auction and then fix them up to sell them. Along with the auction sequence comes my second issue with the game: you should be able to put the car up for auction as opposed to outright selling it, and the work order screen should have some information on how much of a total monetary and time investment you have in the car.  With those things said, I don't think that they interfere with my enjoyment of the game to the extent that I would quit playing it or that I wouldn't recommend it.I bought the game as a bundle with a lot of its DLC included. I would buy it again. I would recommend it to others that are interested in cars and simulation games.			"

												Fun game if you have an interest in cars and car mechanics.The game looks and feels great - you never feel like you're battling a crummy UI or awkward camera. Stripping parts is neither fast nor slow - gives the sense that you're tearing a machine down, rather than just automagically removing everything - this is always going to be hard to balance just right but I think the game gets as close as it needs to.The only thing I've found that I wish I could do is make recommendations to the customer. As it is every job has a minimum wear level - so any parts below a certain wear need to be replaced.  A good example of where I'd like this to work differently is if I'm doing a brake job and am replacing 3 brake pads - in reality this would never happen, you'd replace them all, even if the 4th isn't particularly worn.I don't really rate the driving aspects of the game - but it's not why I bought it so I can overlook it, and once you get the test path you don't really need to drive the cars anyway. If you're looking for a game more like Street Legal Racing then you might be dissapointed though.			"

												Definitely an enjoyable game. Feels kind of like a puzzle in the order you have to take apart and put things together. Cars in the game will have different engines, running gear, brakes and other parts. Doing the jobs and getting xp can be repetitive, but once you get your own parking and get to buy auction cars and keep and sell them, gets a lot more fun.My only big con is the music for me, don't care for the techno type beat, but I just mute the ingame music and run my music player and listen to my own music. I find it actually relaxing to play this.			"

												In this game I am the mechanic you fear in real life. I just swap decent parts from one side of the car to the other replacing the bad parts with the decent ones then putting the bad parts on the side that had the decent ones. I tried to send out an incomplete car but the developers were one step ahead of me. I don't know why I do this, a rubber bushing is like $12 in this game and takes 2 seconds to get but no I'll just disassemble half the car for a half hour to find a bushing that meets the minimum quality required for this car and swap them out. I am a horrible person. I do like this game alot I just have a personal problem.I think this could be fixed by giving the car an starting percentage of quality by averaging all the parts on the car and you have to send the car out better than when it arrives.My biggest complaint about games is the lack of music selection, but I understand theres liscensing fees and stuff like that plus royalties so I can let it slide. I just turn the music off and play the radio like its a real garage. I would like to see a game mechanic where you can have the game play streaming music from the internet, no idea how that would work it's just an idea.			"

If you can enjoy those types of mechanics (eh...pun) with a gearhead theme, you will enjoy yourself :D -Start out small and do odd jobs to gain cash and xp.-Upgrade your tools, facilities, and skills. Start making some more cash.-At 9k xp you can start going to auctions and buy cars to upgrade and sell or keep in your collection.-DLC is where it's at. Performance/Visual Tuning pack gives you lots of new options.-Kinda Grindy. You get xp for every part you install or replace or screw you turn.			"

												So the past couple days, as of this writing, I changed my oil, replaced the oil filter, replaced the brake pads and bled the clutch and topped off the tire pressure on my car.That being said after all that I was in the mood to finally give this game a shot but I can't really call this a simulator because I wasn't busting my knuckles on things, getting my hands covered in something that probably causes a cancer known to the state of California, losing tiny parts and yelling curse words, that would make even a sailor blush, for all my neighbors to hear.I'm pretty sure anyone who has worked on a car knows what I'm talking about; if you really want to get to know what a person is really like inside have them work on a car.On a serious note though I think the game is pretty cool and refreshingly different but as someone who works on his own cars I have to say this is more of a puzzle game than a simulator but still intriguing if you're interested in the internal workings of a car; I can see how this game would be super interesting for someone who hasn't much experience working on cars.Maybe I just haven't got far enough into the game yet but the cars seem rather barren and the engine compartment isn't a dizzing array of hoses, pipes and wires like in real life.Also why is oil disposal $100? Maybe it's just where I live where you can dispose of oil for free at any auto parts store or a county waste site, but it's probably just one of those gameplay balancing things.One thing I do like is being able to go on the computer ingame and then finding and ordering parts from fictitious websites. It's not a biggie but a nice touch I think.My only real complaint is the music which is pretty much, so far, nothing but the wub wub wub kind of dubstep.Being a car mechanic themed game I would expect something a little more blue collar like rock or blues but that's okay; I opted to turn the music off and listen to my own music so it's not that big of a deal.One suggestion for the developers: Make a more detailed version of this game in VR with the Vive controllers. That would be awesome!			"

												Very awesome at first and can be very fun to play for a while however it can get very boring and repetitive after having a certain amount of hours played. The customisation feels very limited and the game seems to always be the same thing, buy a car and repair it. Granted there are drag races and etc, it is a game you would play for a little while and never really go back to. However if you are a car guy and want to play it regardless, I recommend the game as it allows you to work on cars and just have a good time repairing it.			"

												ANOTHER RELAXING ENTRY IN THE ""<thing> SIMULATOR <year>"" GENREIf you're looking for action, excitement, drama or tension, this probably won't scratch your itch (unless you take a car with horribly worn steering components and brakes onto the test track, maybe).What it will do, is fulfil a 'hobby', and maybe give you a little basic education on automotive repair and maybe even an understanding of how a car is constructed.Make no mistake, this simulator/game will NOT take the place of professional training, but it might help you discover an interest......think of it as being for automotive maintenance what Guitar Hero is for music performance; a fun, little 'introduction to' game.

												Car Mechanic simulator is a TON of fun. I've lost more than a few hours playing this game (a lot of offline hours not counted at time of review here). I'd strongly recommend this to anyone who has an interest in learning about cars, but doesn't have an extra car they can risk working on. Here's a quick list of pros and cons of the game:Pros:- Great concept and parts. You get work with a lot of really deep and interesting parts on a surprising number of different car models.- Great progression. For the most part, the game starts you off with an easy fix (outer tie rods, brake pads, calipers, etc), and then builds up the difficulty by making you diagnose the problem, and giving you the tools and education to make that diagnosis.- Impressive graphics. Nothing stunning, but for a game of this caliber, it's got great visuals for hundreds of different car parts.- GREAT with Steam Controller. Load up a good Config, and have a blast.-Educational. Seriously, this game taught me a lot more about cars than I would've imagined. It won't turn you into a master mechanic, but it may help give you an idea of what's going wrong with a car, and maybe even give you the motivation to look up some How-To videos on youtube.Cons:- Restrictive. The game deals almost exclusively with the engine, suspension, and exhaust, and the only fluid you'll encounter is an oil change. While that's not too bad, I would've loved to see some involvement with a vehicle's AC system. Additionally, it doesn't take into account steering, brake, or transmission fluids, or well-placed oil which is a little disappointing.- Unrealistic. In this game, you can pop off an Outer Tie Rod with a single screw- don't try doing that in real life, or you'll find yourself calling for a tow truck. While I understand the appeal to fun, a lot of parts just have this overwhelming sense of easiness about removing/replacing them.- Occasionally frustrating. The green/yellow/red outlines for parts can be a help, or a big hinderance when trying to figure out what part needs to be removed before the piece you've selected. While it's not a bad system by any means, it's in desperate need of some alternative options. Also, I don't know what car the Maluch was modeled after, but I hope the factory that made it burns down.- Lack of customization. All of your upgrades concern either improving your maintenance speed (why?) or adding OBD/Compression/Electronic testers. You can unlock a paint shop, test path and parking lot, but your garage is never given any real options to make it feel like home.- Lack of endgame. In a perfect world, you'd combine this game and, a decent racing game. While fixing a car, or filling your lot with top-of-the-line beauties is nice, it's hard to get excited when there's not much room to have any fun with them. All this horsepower, and no room to gallop!All in all, CMS2015 is a lot of fun. If you're on the fence, wait until one of it's awesome sales roll around. It's definitely worth $20, and the DLC (aside from the Maluch) are all worth checking out.			"

												The game lacks content. You can very quickly run out of things to do, goals to strive for. It also lacks achievements, not bothering to even try to add anything there. There is a good, solid base to build on, but the developers appear to have chosen to put out the minimum possible and then add a few DLC. I have put over 40 hours into the game, I own all the DLC and I won't complain about the game or the DLC at all, it's the value I take issue with. The game / DLC is simply overpriced for the amount of enjoyment you'll get out of it. It feels a bit like your typical early access title where you can see a lot of potential but it never gets realized. I assume 2016 will come out soon and be a rinse and repeat of a formula that appears to be working for the developers, at the expense of consumers.			"

Then visa versa once you're done. Voila, you fixed a car. 15 dollar profit.Now do that 40 times and buy upgrades for your garage, making everything easier.			"

												This game is a great game if you know some basic knowlege about cars. If you dont... your expierence will probably be frustrating. I have a father who is a mechanic  so I know a decent bit about cars. My time playing this game was a mix of fun, frustration, sadness, anger, joy and a small piece of confusion. The computer in the game is the most informative database. If you dont know what a part looks like USE THE COMPUTER! The controls in ths game can be kind of a hastle. Floating objects can get in your way and block your vision. Also getting the right click and left clicks down is annoying at first but you'll get used to it fast. Fun,Frustrating, Satisfying9/10.

												i watched gameplay for a while and decided to try it out. i purchased the dlc at the same time so i cant review the main verison only.  but i really like the game with the dlc and recommend checking out gameplay videos prior to anyone buying the game.  if you like the gameplay vids then i think you'll like this game.

												If you liked the aged old classic ""Gearhead Garage"" you will fall in love with this!! Absolutely amazing detail and its just a great title to sit back and play and relax. Many many hours to come for this title and for the price its at? It is an absolute steal! Get it now! You know you want it!			"

												This game is a massive improvement to CMS14 in every meaningful way, and will help to quickly fill in the gaps to your car knowledge. As with any simulator, there is only so far that you can go to make it feel like the real thing, but in terms of interactive, consumer-grade media, this is probably the best thing on the market right now.The game can get a little repetitive at times, but I'm sure being an actual car mechanic gets a little repetetive too, particularly if you were to specialize in a limited field (like Japanese import transmissions, etc.). This game allows you to work on all aspects of a car, and for the most part, you can strip the cars down to the bone. The upgrade system is kind of a grind, but overall the pacing feels right. If you start a traditional game, the vehicles will have lists of the parts that need replacing, which can be highlighted on the car and identified easily. Over time, the lists will start to identify fewer and fewer parts, and force you to have to search for them and inspect manually. The projects themselves also become increasingly complicated. This system feels like it's rewarding your learning, and it's an empowering feeling. In general I detest the business model in games nowadays -- especially from major studios/publishers -- that basically forces you to buy 'modules' in the form of DLC that should have been included at launch by default. This game does that, but doesn't feel like you're being robbed either. You may only be interested in learning the SUV/Truck or an old Mini, so in that sense it works and makes sense here. In this setting. it doesn't subtract from the gameplay or force you to purchase the ending/continuation of the story, so I can't knock it too much.In a relatively limited timeframe, you will probably be able to name every single part on a car, regardless of the engine/vehicle type. If that is your goal, you can't miss this one. Can't wait to see what they do with the next iteration.			"

												I Like the game, I really do. The game is Complex, and quite unique. What it needs though, is more updates, Multiplayer, More Parts, and a few more vehicles.

												Red dot games have come a long way into making DLC's such as the merc and maserati and other content, whos know whats next jaguar or land rover,             my opinion is if Red dot games take some time not uploading that means there cooking something big, apart from that hours of grinding to get money to go to the auction house and become broke and countless hours of repairing V8's and V6's and accidentally going over 88 MPH in a DeLorean finding you just went back in time, i would rate this game an 10/10			"

												In all honesty I got this on a sale because I have Gearhead Garage and back then it seemed like an updated version sadly its lacking compared to that game which is old. This in all honestly has become a dlc factory to me and with the priceing (licensied cars or not) to much for what the dlc's contain even on sale. Even if this has better fx's and more acurate part locations it lacks what I was looking for in a mech sim no junkyard to route around, auctions that are pretty much fixed for priceing never seen a good grab for the cash you spend at one. If anyone has been to auctions you know its a hit or miss for what you get but priceing doesn't set to quality of a car the way bids go in the game you know what to stay away from and just skip to the next car from the way bidding goes. I can't really recomend this for people that came outta gearhead for the buying and selling and shop jobs or IHRA Professional Drag Racing or was is NHRA? been a long while either way the amount of customizing you could do to the cars in garages for engines suspentions ect. it just doesn't fit the ticket in my honest opinion.

												So much fun on this game! I was really looking for a game that lock me up on my PC and spend hours excited to play it. The game has good graphics, you are always on the control of your actions. The machanisms are perfect. For the next version I recommend to explore advanced ways to use your car, like on a free life game! Imagine this game engine on the GTA world for example? Or maybe some engine to put your car on a real track an test it on the curves etc... I strongly recommend this game. SO MUCH FUN!			"

												Most addicting simulator available.Audio - 7/10 I usually listen to my own music.Video - 9/10Gameplay - 10/10Story - 7/10 You take control of a bodyless camera and are told to repair cars, simple and effective. Once you unlock the auction the ""story"" ceases to exist. I'd like for more of a background to the player, maybe a rags to riches story? Immersion - 10/10I played and enjoyed the 2014 game but felt the immersion was lacking a bit, but holy hell is this game immersive. I've worked on and around cars for nearly all of my life, my father owned a body shop and would also do engine repairs. I hate to say this but this game makes me feel like I'm in a garage. I say that I hate to say that only because there are obvious video game aspects to the gameplay.This is also the only game where I own all of the DLC. Most DLC in other games feel utterly pointless but I really like that the developer was able to get deals with companies like Masarati, Delorean, and so on. If I stuck the same vanilla cars I probably would have quit playing but thankfully the added items, cars, and features allows for non-stop gaming.I can easily sink 5 hrs into one sitting. This definitely gets a recommendation from me.			"

												I'm no expert when it comes to cars but this game has got my attention, I bought this game not only to have fun but to learn car parts as well. The game is really fun (seriously), especially if you buy the Performance DLC because you can modify your own car even more like swapping engines! Unfortunately there's no tutorial, at least for the control. You won't be guided what to do to fix the car, you'll be given list of parts that needs to be replaced and that's it (I even search Google Image to find the location of the part xD). If you gain enough XP there will be more challenges, like you need to find the broken parts yourself. Soon you'll get tools like OBD Scanner to help you examine broken parts faster and more easily.---------------------------The game's pretty small though, unlike game like Euro Truck Simulator 2 where you can name you company, hire staff, travel between countries. This game only let you work inside a garage alone, so this game can be boring after you play the game for a while. Well you can test cars in a test track, buy your own personal car, and have a drag race but that's basically it. Even so, to purchase your own car, you need to get a parking lot, which require lots of XP to be able to purchase it.---------------------------You should purchase this game if you're interested in cars, because believe me, you'll be fixing cars all day long and if you're not into it you'll ditch the game right away.
