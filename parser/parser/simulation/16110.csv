												Probably my least favorite of the classic three, but still a fun game. Restarted it recently and forgetting the series of events kicked my ♥♥♥, but once I remembered what to do I had fun again			"

												The second of the series and it is fun, I'd say a little better as there seems to be more flushed out. Great to come back to as it is in real time so you can just check back every now and then. A Great game for killl/passing time.			"

												I played this game as a kid with my dad. It's an old one for sure. It's fun, though! It doesn't have a ton of replay value, but the first time through the game, there are puzzles to solve and achievements to get! It's cute and simple, but can be played with any computer, and it's long-lasting!			"
