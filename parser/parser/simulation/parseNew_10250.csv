												Mixed bag this one. At a price of 9,99â‚¬ i can not recommend it but if you can get it for a couple of euros it's definitely worth it. 2-5 euros is the price point i'd give to this game that Akella left a bit too rough on the edges.  Good:- Sometimes you get the 'being there' feeling. - Skirmishes around a convoy can be epic as you try to struggle your way through- Looks pretty good though forget DirectX10. doesnt work for anyone. i play with 9.0c settings. - Detailed guns and boats and crew. - Good enough UI once you learn it's quirks. - Good enough and fun enough management of destroyers and other ships under your command if you got any. - Good looking smoke - when it decides to stay visible. Bad- UI is rough in the corners. also forget about modern day markers telling you exactly what to do - instead listen closely what the instructions are and follow them - or try to work yourself around them. (i.e. go to sector G-7 and look for a convoy - how about going north of that and trying to look there first where they might be heading)- Damage models - i dont understand what determines who wins and who loses fights between PT boats. sometime crew fly around after direct hit. sometimes you can dump a lot of ammo on an enemy and still go down with the fishes. - Better like restarting missions all the time. Allies first mission took me some 10 tries. (mission does randomize convoy consists (?) and locations a bit so every mission is slightly different even if you retry the same mission over again). - Missions are locked and you can only advance through the hard way - Hard to say how much content there really is here  - 3 tutorials in the beginning though that you really should do.

												this is a must have for any WW2 navy geeks..ultra realistic, tough missions, great graphics, detailed modelling.  I recommentd the Pt  BOAT  gold pack as both original and expansion are worth the price at $14.99			"

												A mix of Battlestations Midway and Silent Hunter. Runs perfectly for an older game as well.			"

												The game could be really cool - and honestly isn't that bad when you get it to work.  Do direct x 9 and you may get it to work for a while but it hard locked my computer after playing for a few minutes.			"

												the game has great graphics but that's about it. The interface is dificult to understand and hard to use. The tutorials are confusing. Needs a lot of work to be playable.			"

												Very poor, promises plenty delivers little, even in the tutorial the interface does not work, plus the horrendous racist german voice overs are enough to completely ruin what could have been a good game, garbage, avoid!			"

												Barely passable, totally missed out on the Pacific and ALL American boats, there's no customizing boats like the US did, crews are killed off imediatly, missions are hard especially because you can only really control the PT boats and the computer crew is very bad at decision making, such as firing at a target. Tarpedo sights are bad, hip shooting works best. Poorly thought out game overall.			"
