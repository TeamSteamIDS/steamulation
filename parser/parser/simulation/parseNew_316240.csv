												If you like Farming Simulator 15's tree cutting... don't buy this, run back to it as fast as you can.The physics are from 2001, tree cutting is automated (you just drive to a spot and press Right Click when it tells you).Let me save you some money and don't buy it :)			"

												Hello all,At of this moment, I cannot recommend this game for purchase by anyone.After spending over 6.5 hours in the game, I have identified a game-killing bug which breaks the entire profitability model of the game.  Essentially there are only two selling points.  One to sell logs (you don't make much money here), and one to sell boards (you make a bit more than just selling logs).  When you sell boards at the board selling point, the game immediately crashes to the desktop every time.  I've tested twice on two separate saves, and confirmed the crash 3 times.  I'm confident it will continue to crash.On top of that, the game's engine appears to be the same or a newer iteration of the game engine from Professional Farmer 2014.  There does seem to be a lot more detail on the map compared to Pro Farmer 2014 though.  It is a completely different map though, just to be clear.Certain assett (like some buildings, etc) elements and sound effects are also identical to Professional Farmer 2014.The overall graphics are good, but not great.  There are indeed some beautiful day and night effects, but then the main vehicles that you'll be using in the game all look like toys that a 5 year old would play with.  Many of the controls are also incredibly simplistic.  For example, cutting down a tree requires a single right click.  To pick up a log, you just take your loader and right click it once, and it pops into the loader.  Take it to the trailer, right click, and bam!  it's in the trailer.  As such, this game is probably going to appeal more to smaller children who haven't developed their motor skills yet, or for people who want a logging experience without the complexity of other games.As far as other bugs go, there are several places in the game where there are buildings, log piles or other objects floating in mid air.  Cars constantly weave left and right like drunk drivers.  Roads and streets are lazily laid out on the map.  The game's engine is really just horrible.  Either that or the graphics artists responsible for creating the world are just horribly lazy.I'm running an Intel i7-5960X processor (currently intel's BEST i7 as of March 2015), 16GB of RAM, an NVidia GTX 980, and the game is installed to an SSD.  Average FPS is about 50-60fps at 2560x1440p.  No idea how the game performs on lesser machines, though I may do some testing on my older gaming PC.Also, the game REQUIRES DirectX 11.  If your video card is a bit older and doesn't fully support DirectX 11, then this game will never run on your PC regardless of what you do until you upgrade your video card.  If you've got a laptop that doesn't support DX11, then you're pretty much entirely screwed.  You'll need to buy a new laptop with a video card that supports DX11.  This may or may not kill the deal for some buyers.  Personally, DirectX 11 is a better engine for games, but only if you can run them.All said, as it stands now, I cannot recommend this game.  It seems to be more of the fodder that we've been fed from the likes of Playway and UIG (or in this case, UIE.  Same company, same crap).  If they can fix the fatal crash and fix some of the other bugs, then they game might be worth about $10 bucks, but not much more.For a much better forestry experience, just do yourself a favor and pick up Farming Simulator 15.  It has much better forestry overall than this game.			"

												This game does the work for you. Just click and drag.No animation at the processing plant.Vehicle skins looks like they're from the 2000s.Go get Farming Simulator 15. It combines this game and Professional Farmer 2014. It also has WAY better graphics and realism along with an amazing mod community.			"

												Well, what to say, about this game.Even on low graphic its lagging as hell. (i can play farming simulator 2015 with max graphic no problem).Very bad optimisation.AI car, are driving like they all drunk.Vehicule are not drivable, control a bad, direction is bad, cant even drive in straight line. release the gaz for an instant stop.Cutting wood, is an automated motion. you cant choose how long for the trunk. the tree dont fall on ground, it goes throught the ground.Pîcking the trunk on ground. no need to be on spot, just put the uncontrolable crane close to trunk to pick up.Same to put on trailer, drop somewhere over the trailer for a perfect stack.No need to unload to the factory. hit enter to unload / wood disepear.The only positive thing in that game is the possibility to buy and upgrade your factory.

												Crappy game, Focused so much on the Sounding graphics the machine graphics are left horribly un done. The equimptment is horridly overpiced, and the lumber sells for almost nothing. The building price is increadibly high as well.Thestart menues is also poorly constructed need to exit out of the game itself just to change modes. The tuturial is just as bad as the machine graphics, it is lack luster tells you very little about actual gameplay ine the ""free mode"" and the ""open world"" in the game also is lacking. The only thing this simulator simulates is a pain.			"

												5 minutes into the game, drowned my excavator and got my forklift stuck in a rock.  When I exited the forklift I fell under the map.Just another cash grab at the whole ""SIMULATORS AMIRITE"" phase.

Product received for free
												Originally bought as a joke by my friends, I decided to download the game and give it a try for the laughs. What I found was nothing short of astonishing. The games runs at a beautiful 4FPS. The graphics blew me away with the light rays touching gracing my eyes like the glory of God himself. My truck clipped and became stuck on everything, just like real life.When I finally arrived at the woodmill to begin my day of work, I found thie gameplay to pump my adrenaline in a way that I haven't felt since the glory days of PS2 gaming.I watched as the simple gameplay produced the most beautiful tree cutting animations I have ever seen. I've cut trees down before, but nothing this astounding.This game is simply a must play. Don't look at the price, because it doesn't matter, because it is worth it.10/10 Best game.			"

												Was gifted to me as a joke. Me and a Friend sat down to try it. Wasted a handful of hours playing it. still figuring out how to actually buy land and cut trees. Never going to get those hours spent on this game back. But you did get to drive a forklift and that was pretty sweet.			"

												How can this even be sold? the interface is incomplete and annoying, the physics are barely functional, the game is horrible in every aspect. Semi tractor's can't articulate the trailer more than 30 degrees, vehicles take a while to get to speed and stop instantly the moment you let off the acceleration key.. it's just stupid. Get Giant's Farming Sim 2015/2017. Much better.			"
