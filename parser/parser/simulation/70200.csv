												This is not online poker... HOWEVER, the AI is good enough to make for a fun and challenging game that I finished and STILL come back to to get a quick Texas-Holdem' fix.Your goal is to win enough money to ""buy up"" cities in Texas, eventually playing the governor in a winner-take-all round of poker. The graphics are cartoony but nice. But, then, you're not playing a poker game for the graphics. And when it starts to get a little slow (waiting for each player to decide), you can increase the game speed and start cranking out several hands per minute.If you're a poker player and a fan of casual games, this is worth checking out.

												This game is not for people who are even semi-serious about poker. I'm a fan of both poker and city management games, so I thought this would be right up my alley. It probably would be a great game, except for one thing; bad AI. The other players don't play at all like real people. They will ""check"" the whole game while they have a straight flush. And it almost NEVER fails that one of these idiots will raise the bet by 50-80% before the flop. They are impossible to bluff, too. I have sat down and tried to play this game three separate times, with three different strategies. Every time it has ended in frustration and anger. That is not how a game is supposed to make you feel, not EVERY time.I also feel that it is relevant to note that I have played a lot of different poker games (I'll estimate around 20) and this one has BY FAR the WORST AI.

												A remarkable little game that is really fun.  If you are looking for a game that offers a little break from the daily grind, and you like poker, then this game fills those prerequisites nicely.			"

												This game is good for what it is. It is limited though with voice acting being not great. The gameplay is ok. The simmulation is about right. Its not a graphic achevement but its not terrible. If u wanted a casual poker game ye give it a go but maybe not a full price			"

												It's a poker game that has some 'growth' to it, and sort of follows a story. I've played it before via demos etc. It's a good mix of poker and goal-oriented objectives. It isn't repetitive if you like to play poker, it's a nice break from pokerstars/whatever online poker you play. Only downside is there's no online lobby or whatever - but if you have a handful of minutes and you want to play poker against a computer then this is a radical game.			"

												The AI cheats. If you have anything semi-decent and raise, they will immediately fold unless they have something that will beat you. You can only raise when you are bluffing, in which case they will always match you and you will lose.It is apparent the AI can see your cards and takes them into account when deciding their action.

												It's a fun Texas hold'em type poker game. With side flavor of town management, which is kinda neat.Hardcore poker players should find something better. This game is more geared to novice players and people just looking for a time killer.Good as a before bed type wind-down casual game.			"

												Ok game. It get's pretty boring and repetitive. You make no money at all from owning towns which is dumb. Also there is clearly programmed for bad beats and luck. Never seen so much fluke, or people tripping pocker pairs, and I ran into a guy who got pocket aces 3 out of 4 hands. Also ran into a guy who got pocket Aces, then pocket queens, then pocket kings, all in a row. There is no direction or help in game, leading to you needing to look online. 6/10.			"

												I've been stuck paying the big blinds twice in a row, more than once. I'm not a poker expert but that doesn't seem right to me.The AI is dubious at best. No controller support. No way to quickly fold and skip to next hand before it's your turn.Ex: You have a 2-7 offsuit but you have to wait for 4 AI players to look at their cards, him and haw, decide to play or fold, THEN you can fold and skip to the next hand!

												A nice little time waster, but be warned that the AI can be a bit crafty at times to the point where it might get frustrating for some players. If you are looking for something after Poker Night at the Inventory, then this might be your kind of poker game. I got this on sale (75% off) and I thought it was worth a shot.			"

												Gov Poker 2 nailed it by trying to make the AI as monotonous as possible (not saying it's a bad thing). They will rarely try to pull any fancy moves. If you wanna try to get better at pot odds, value betting and playing passively; look no further. If you can't understand what I mentioned, skip this game because it will bore you. I compare this game as playing againts microstakes irl players. If you are beyond this level, you should probably play the real thing. I imagine this game would have been great practice back in the dumb days of poker. Again, it's an ok practice tool for someone that wants to get better at the math behind beginner poker. 5/10 will play for fun. 7/10 will play for practice. 10/10 will find better tools for free to learn basic poker.

												Thanks for reminding how not a game poker is.The graphics are very nice to look at.The music suits the setting well.The game even has a (dumb) story.I don't like poker, so I don't recommend this game.BTW: If you want to win this game easy: Set the animation to fastest and always choose pass & continue except when you must play, then go all in if you've got anything, else pass & continue. Rinse and repeat.Of course this would never work out in real life.Dumb. Dumber. Poker.Poker is not a game. Poker is all about knowledge of human behavior. I'm taking in account they tried to implement this in this game. But heck ... how should this ever work out in a computer driven poker simulation? And even more how should this ever work out in online poker (which this isn't, but as so much people in the reviews about this game have spoken of it ... go f*ck yourself ... online poker is just playing cards but not playing poker.)@ngel			"

												fun fun fun.....challenging enough, and takes some time to finish (no shortcuts)... maybe not so much as the time it took me ...... but some time. you will get your money's worth, I would say.23h and 190 game days. The game is fun and has a good difficulty. The graphics serve their purpose, the audio is just fine, etc etc ;)8/10			"

												Best. Poker game. Ever.The animations are nice, the game play is great. It is a lot less ""cheaty"" than all other poker games (like when you have a one in a million hand like 4 of a kind, and an opponent just happens to have a royal flush - neither hands are seen hardly ever in a game, but there they are together....hmmmmmm).I also enjoy the achievement trophies, it has kept me playing long after beating the game......there are trophies for certain types of hands, ways you beat others or got beaten, betting styles, etc.HIGHLY recommended.
