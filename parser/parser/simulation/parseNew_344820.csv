Early Access Review
								For those who backed Forsaken Fortress in crowdfunding, prepare to be dissapointed.  I liked the idea of the open world and modular basebuilding, which this release is completely lacking.  You don't build a base in this at all.  You build furniture, or production stations.  And the world is divided into small areas with travel times/loading between them.  The original game I backed was abandoned.  The buggy final version of the original idea is still better than this release.  That being said, what they have released is an ok game, just not what they promised and not that interesting.  It is probably worth the $10 they are charging, just don't expect what was promised by the crowdfunding campaign.			"

								Not familiar with devs history or previous game but this one is heading in the right direction. Ultimately it's a blend of Dead State crossed with This War of Mine on a tighter budget. 3 game modes are provided, Survival, Challenge and Endless. Survival focuses on a 20 day period, Challenge modes goal is fighting out of the city and Endless limits item respawns and such.


YouTube™ Video: Forsaken Fortress Strategy Gameplay [PC HD] [60FPS] [Early Access] 

			Views: 1,239		

			Forsaken Fortress Strategy PC Gameplay 1080p 60fps Platform: PC Video Game Genre: RPG, Strategy, Simulation, Early Access Developer: Photon Arena Publisher: KISS ltd Release Date: 18 Sep, 2015 Steam:...		

Fresh rounds require selection 2 team members, all characters have alternate stats and others can be recruited while traveling to new locations. Employing a map/hub system the game shows all the possible ranges of enemies along with loot that may be discovered. Perhaps in some ways a downside as it leaves little up to chance. Complete missions and return to a central base, where you spend time hoarding loot, upgrading  and receiving some well deserved R&R. Characters can be sent out solo or in teams so while it's possible to scout multiple locations at once, with more rewards comes greater risk.Decent game of the price and one that surprised me. At the very least it's worth keeping your eye on. More so fans of survival sims/rpgs like those I've mentioned above. Cheers.			"

								Money grab which started with kickstarter, they promissed nice game...however wasted all the money ($121,096) and didnt delivery final product. After sometime they started to sell ""new game"" (much worse than game demo they showed) here on kickstarter which they presented as the same game... All ppl who gave them money before recieved this piece of sh.. and no more future updates, no communication from devs, nothing. Again money grab cause why not when it worked first time. You cant rly hide unfinished game with early access tag... So save your money and buy something else instead, thank me later.			"

								I helped Kickstart this game and it's been a long time in development sense that time.  I wouldn't go as far as to say it's a ""scam"" like some others but it's clear these developers don't have the talent needed as a team to reasonably execute what they set out to and claim.  What it boils down to right now is a group of college students that have some talent for sure but really no experience to make this something worth getting unless they spend another year on it, and even then it won't be anything like advertised.I would rate this lower than Dead State but with arguably better graphics based on preference.  I also backed Dead State in Early Access.  I guess for now the only people willing to attempt a game of this genre and scope (open worldish, zombie survival base builder rpg... that's not a shooter) don't have the combined team talent or resources to successfully execute it.  They should probably aim for better game play, stylized (and simplier) graphics so they can focus on the things that really matter.There's a lot of areas to point out as undeveloped and missing if really needed to justify the down rating but even at this phase of the game there appears to have no real character screen where you can see any character Stats or Skills, whatever and this is a game advertised as characters with Stats, Skils, even Relationship Development.  The closest thing is the Inventory menu.			"

								Be very watchful for these devs and even the publisher in the future. Do your research on their staff (mostly the devs) and be sure to avoid any game that any of them are involved in. They do not respond to emails on their main web page, they have no delivered their last promised game, and they did not even get very far with this current game (that I was looking forward to more than their previous). Even for $10, do not give them the satisfaction of receiving money they do not deserve- I don't even condone torrenting the game, it's [that] bad.[Edit]I actually recieved an email explaining the break they took and the fact they want to bring out a meaningful update in January. It seems that SOME small amount of life will be brought back into the game, and they even asked what features we'd like to see. So, keep an eye out, but stay away until something is brought forth.""You Have a New MessagePhoton replied to your message:Hi Michael,Thank you for your message and I apologize for the very long delay. The devs were unable to work on the game for a long time as they ran out of funds at the same time they had major life changes to handle, but now are able to work on FFS again. We want to release an impactful update, hopefully in January.If you are not busy could you please tell us more about the features you'd like to see and why they appeal to you? We are looking at a range of features to implement in the future and it's a huge help when fans give us details like you did.Best,The FF TeamHit reply to respond to this message.""This was the email sent to me.

								This game sounded very promising when i bought it back in the end of 2015 the devs made updates often and it was fun to play, Now 4 month after last patch (i was told there was one i jan. 2016 and i can see we are on 1.13 now) but no release note on it and the only thing it did for me is break the game totaly.Here is what happend after last patch ... i started the game and all i got was a black screen and background music (program not responding) so after a few tries i finaly got it closed by force. 2. try i restarted it this time in window mode and it started normaly and i tried to load game, it loaded and i came into an empty base and all my charectors died and i was given the option to load again or return to main menu. Tried to load a few times same result so  i figured new patch save games dont work.So i started a new game there are 3 game modes and 2 of them didnt do anything after i selected charectors and clicked start, so i tried the 3 it let me click start but all i got was a black screen game dosn't crash it just give me black screen and background music after a few min. i forced the game to close.I just tell it like it is, the game is unplayble im very sad i paid money for this game and i hope no one else pays money for this game unless the devs wake up and fix it, steam need to pull this game down since it's broken and the devs ignore the player not even responding when asked if we can expect a new patch.  I'm not saying its a hox game yet coz i don't know what going on with the dev team but unless they respond soon i'll black list this dev team forever and do what ever i can to spread the word.And to steam please wake up and test the products your selling this hurts you too, i've always ben a big fan but i'm not going to support greenlights when you keep selling games that is so broken you can't even play them.I'll give this game 0/10 as its not even a game right now only a start menu.

								Forsaken Fortress Strategy:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  After an endless decade of biochemical war, bandits and zombies are crawling all over the city! Society as we know it has vanished! The year is 2150, you are the leader of a group which is determined to survive. Your focus is exploring, scavenging, fighting and building the best shelter for survival! Forsaken Fortress Strategy is a survival / team management / strategy game which takes place in a post-apocalyptic area. At the start of each game, you will have to choose 2 out of 6 available characters, each of them has a specific skill set (crafting, close combat etc.). The girls will start with weapons but are restricted to how much they can carry compared to the blokes. Your camp is basically a house and you will have access to a stash of necessary items, a construction workshop and a bed to be built.  When you are ready, you will have to explore the world so you can scavenge important items the like planks of wood, metals, medicine, food and more in order to build useful structures. You can build a kitchen for cooking one of your favourite meals (roast with chemical gravy, what a treat), beds, workbench, medical station and more to make sure you survive as long as you can. Early in the piece, you will be able to recruit the other 4 characters, which will be very handy so you can carry a lot more of the items that you find out there. You will come across bandits: some have great firing power (AK47) and you will probably relive the famous scene from an Iconic movie, where Indiana is face to face with an enemy waving his sword impressively to scare him. What does Indiana do, get out his gun and shoots him! Well, you will not be Indiana in this case. So, make sure you get guns as early as you can! You will also encounter zombies; some are your height and some will be twice as tall and will be quite a handful to kill.Make sure you look at the state of each your characters as low morale and energy could sink them. Feed them well so they can still walk about. The combat system is easy to get used too and I really like the fact that you can pause and direct your characters to attack a specific enemy. The audio is well done in my opinion; it really project the atmosphere of being in a sorrowful, empty, scary place with no way out.In terms of graphics, they are sound. The camera view is not as smooth as I would expect; I think it needs to improve in that regards.3 modes available on this early access: Survival (survive 20 days), Challenge (clear the city gate to win) and Free mode (Survive as land as you can).Positives:~~~~~~~~ -	Good graphics & audio-	Easy combat and crafting systems-	Interesting enemies (zombies wise)Negatives:~~~~~~~~  -	Camera mode need improvements-	No achievements or trading cardsIf you like survival / team management / strategy blended together, as I do, this game will be a great addition to your game library.7.5 / 10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes. Any opinions expressed are entirely my own!MORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HEREFOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE "

								A good game with a lot of potential. Unfortunately, the devs have pulled a Houdini. No contact, no changes in about... eight months now? Or maybe it's only been seven, I lost count. But this length of radio silence is not really acceptable, and a lot of the chatter on the discussion thread during that time period points to them being fairly unreliable at best.If you want a game that's maybe 20% complete, then by all means, get it. Just don't be hopeful about it getting finished.			"

								I just have played this game a short time but i can already tell you guys that i like it !It is a good mix of ""Dead State"" + ""This War of mine"" + ""Frozen State"". For an early access there is already much to build/explore. The fights versus Zombies/Mutants are not too hard, it´s a good combat-training. Some of them also have Melee-weapons and are therefore a higher risk for your squad. The Bandits however are an other category. They are more organized, can have guns/armor, fight in group, encounter you and do good damage. For all those who like this style of games : YES Forsaken Fortress Strategy is worth its money!(everything is my opinion, I liked it. Could be that you don´t, so don´t blame me)			"

Early Access Review
								I give the framework a 9/10, though im not sure when Ill ever see a 10/10 framework. Maybe this one is it.The gameplay is very good, but it provided me up to seven hours of satisfaction to hit end game. Though, I may have just masterfully beat the game so I am unsure. It requires alot of wits, timing, stealth and angling to get yourself through certain situations. Alot of the early game requires you to be a runner and get the hell out of the LOS of those who are clearly stronger than you. Late game feels lacking but thats probably due to early access status. All in all if they add huge amount of customizablity, and a more personal touch so that you feel more engaged with your survivors this game can be up there with the triple A titles. Also if they somehow give attention to a modding community, I think this game will be up there with the elder scrolls series and fallout series with moddability. I think this game needs the community's touch which mods will add tremendously. If they do this I honestly think this game will provide the minimum of 200 hrs of gameplay. Probably 1000 for me if they truly increase the magnitude of this game. (These aren't superficial numbers lol, I would do it)			"

								Great game! I've been watching FF progress since they were making open world title, but when it became released, I decided not to buy it. And now I see this remake, and it's really good even in current state. There are some bugs, but they are not game-breaking, and there's much to do in the game, many places to loot, many combats to fight.I think game devs made a right decision in the situation with original title. At least now it is really playable and, what's more important, really enjoyable.So, would I recommend this game? Yes. Even if devs will somehow stop supporting this game, the game in its current state will give you many enjoyable moments, worth more than 10$ which you originally pay for it. It's a perfect blend of «Dead State» (minus turn-based combats, but there's an option to pause the game and give orders while the game is paused, in case you need to think over how to deal with danger), «This War Of Mine» and some other survival game titles.ps By the way, I saw a line about survival game mode — it seems that these reviews were written before recent update. When I bought this game, it was 30 days to survive, not 20.			"

Very unfortunate that some one/some people on the team took it over, pushed it in another direction, then when that crapped out since it completely changed the scope, decided to leave one or a few of the remaining team hanging in the wind.

Early Access Review
								The learning curve on this game is steep. I'm a huge fan of survival squad based rpg games so this game is right in my wheelhouse, if it were turn based it could potentially be the best thing ever. So far there's a lot of places you can visit and various bits of armour and equipment that you can make.  Though the screenshots don't look like the game, which is odd, the interface is different as are the characters. There's only a few characters to choose from and each one has a special ability, but it's quite easy to recruit characters which makes the characters not feel as important.I didn't notice much in the way of bugs other than characters not running when others would and sometimes when trying to move the camera around it wouldn't let you do it.The emphasis in the early part of the game is melee combat, which is fine, but most of your human opponents have guns.  If you can get the jump on them by hiding around a corner or behind a door when they come charging at you it's easy to use three guys with melee weapons to gang up on them and wipe them out. Two maps are particularly good for this while other ones are harder because there's less cover and it's easier for the enemy to snipe you. The real danger comes from facing multiple melee based enemies.  Day 7 kept wiping me out with a horde of zombies with spiked bats even using the door as a chokepoint they still manage to get 4 in the doorway and wipe out my three guys. Long range weapons may fix that, but I hadn't made them yet while trying to do everything else to keep my team alive. Zombies with weapons is just mean man.An easy setting would help along with multiple save spots and an autosave at each dawn. I can make a long laundry list of features that could be added, feel free to contact me developers :)Though I kept dying, I do like a game that has a challenge to it. It's almost alarming how similar it is to This War of Mine, like it's an isometric version but with zombies and a more developed combat system. It works though. Hopefully updates will address balancing a little and it could be an engaging time suck of a game.			"

								Forsaken Fortress Strategy is a interesting survival strategy game with RPG elements. This game a bit resembles to The This War is Mine. Game have 3 gaming modes :-Survive: you should survive 20 days-Challenge: clear way from the city-Endless :survive as long as possibleI played Survive mod, the story if i want be short nothing special, in 2150 earth wasted biochemical war, society collapsed, zombies and bandits everywhere , we start at beginning with one person, but we can afford to join some other people to us.To survive we should building own base, getting resources in another areas, trading with other survives, fight with zombies and bandits.All character have another specification, some can fight better, someone trade, this system a bit same with This War is Mine. In each area you can send only one person or if you want you can send in team alsoSo my verdict+popular at now post apocalypse world+good music+good crafting system+ability to conclude you to a long  time+early access -early access-a bit annoying camera mode-a bit week sounds-a graphic quality medium-animation not the best-a bit bad fighting system-a bit high price (just if we don't count EA)Overall: 7,5/10This game now in early access, whet its been released everything can happened, this can be better or worse.I think its a game have a big potential, if a devs resolve all problems this game can be really enjoyable. If you like PA world, and survival games, I think you should pay attention to this game. But if you not convinced at the moment, I recommend to you wait for a discount or some new patches/ full release do do final decision.			"

Early Access Review
IntroductionMixing games - and genres - like This War Of Mine and Dead State generally seems like a good idea. This isn’t always the case, though, as we sadly all know (and have usually experienced ourselves). So, is this altered remake of the originally-crowdfunded game worthy of your time right now or does it need to be in Early Access a while longer? Let’s quickly find out.GameplayYou start off by selecting two survivors from a group of six. All of these survivors have their own skills; one of them may be good in building while another one might be better with firearms, et cetera. Once you have chosen two people you will be dropped off in a house and your goal will be to survive for 20 days (by then it’s already 19). If you ever played This War Of Mine then you will likely already understand how it all works. For those who haven’t (yet) played that game; the game expects you to expand your hideout by building and upgrading useful furniture. This is done by looting places close by. All the while trying to survive, take care of your survivors and actively defend yourself from humans and zombies alike.Your survivors have several meters that you have to keep an eye on: sadness, energy, hunger, wellness and injury. You can increase the meters (or, at least, try to let them decrease at a slower rate) by building campfires and kitchens while also making sure they don’t get hurt too much/get sick and by just letting them sleep every now and then.

Besides carefully watching over your group you can also let them craft weapons (which you should absolutely do if you want to make any progress) and other tools that will help you to (easier) survive those 20 days. Naturally weapons and gear can be equipped to make your characters more powerful but they won’t suddenly turn into superheroes. These are still (virtual) human beings, and even though they can be shot multiple times before they die they are not invincible: once a survivor is dead you will have lost him or her forever (unless you apply a first aid kit in time) and you can then try to recruit a new one. But it will never be the same as they all have unique skills, which I already wrote about a moment ago. Still, it’s better than nothing. At least with another survivor you have a better chance at surviving.So once you’ve been dropped into your house you can choose where to go to with one or both of your survivors. By opening the map you can choose which way you want to go. It’s recommended to start in the Easy or Normal areas because otherwise you’ll most likely be killed within seconds. Each area is different; there might be an alley with a house where you can loot of items from (but you still have to be beware of enemies!). In other areas you might be able to find survivors that you can recruit while in others you will most likely get shot by untrusting survivors if you’re not too careful. These are the places you can normally get a lot of loot from, however. The risk/reward mechanic works very well in a game like this, especially considering the setting and tone.There are a lot of places to loot/scavenge but depending on how many survivors you bring with you you might not have enough space in your inventory to grab just about everything. This results in having to make some tough choices along the way; do you bring a first aid kit with you in case someone gets hurt during the next mission (maybe even the same one?) or will you just grab a few pieces of wood instead so that you’re at least able to build or upgrade that next piece of furniture (that might prove to be even more useful (in the long run)). Life really is hard.

While Forsaken Fortress Strategy isn’t a roguelike you do have to be careful that not all of your survivors get wiped out. Otherwise it really is game over. Thankfully you can save in-between missions, in your hideout. But only here! You can’t save during actual missions. So if you have a feeling that things are going well make sure and save once in a while. It might just save your life (no, not literally, of course). It will save a lot of stress and frustration in the end.Your survivors can also use stealth and it’s recommended to use it as much as possible in order to prevent unplanned battles. You can’t avoid everything, but sometimes it’s clear when you might just lose a battle.There are multiple gameplay modes, too. You have Survive, which I have discussed in a little more detail just now, Challenge, where you goal is to get out of the city and Endless, which speaks for itself.One other thing I’d like to mention, though, aside from the actual gameplay is that the controls do take some getting used to, but so far this - for me at least - only applies to the keyboard controls.Audio & VisualsThe music is moody and it definitely fits the game’s atmosphere, although it’s a little more up-tempo during battles. There doesn’t seem to be any voice acting and the sounds effects are rather basic, but they get the job done I guess.

The visuals are okay and could definitely use a little more detail, especially as far as the animations are concerned. Keep in mind, however, that this still is an Early Access game. While it clearly lacks polish at this very moment, it’s possible that the gameplay is the main focus of attention right now. So it’s likely we’ll see graphical improvements and more polish during the upcoming months.Length/Replay ValueI can be really short about the length. Since it’s still in Early Access some content is currently still missing: bigger maps and more enemies, for example. Therefore it’s hard to exactly calculate but you can easily get 10-15 hours or more out of it right now. I think, with some luck, that the story can be completed even faster than that, but I don’t see any reason to rush through it. For €10 this is a pretty good deal!ConclusionForsaken Fortress Strategy won’t set the world on fire, but with just a little more polish it is and will be absolutely worth your time and money. If you enjoyed games like Dead State and/or This War Of Mine then there’s nothing to dislike here. The gameplay is solid and while the rest of the game is still in a relatively early state I expect the final product to look and play much better than what is currently being offered.Too long, didn’t readPros:+ Different gameplay mechanics+ Six survivors with their own unique skills+ Multiple gameplay modes availableMixed:+/- Graphically it doesn’t look terrible, but there are still some bugs and glitches that need to be fixedCons:- Might be a little intimidating if you’re new to the genre- Lacks polish- Keyboard controls can be a little awkward  Please note: a Steam key for this game was provided by the developer/publisher. Rating: 7.0 (out of 10)(Ratings aren’t calculated based on a formula, but on my personal feelings)Want to read more of my unbiased reviews? Just click here.If you have any kind of feedback - positive or negative - please feel free to leave a comment (in case of negative feedback please try to keep it constructive). It would be greatly appreciated!Early Access ratings may change at any given time, depending on the updates. There's also the possibility that certain features discussed in this review will be updated or removed later during development, making parts of it obsolete. I'm afraid this is beyond my control. "

								Forsaken Fortress Strategy ? Nothing Forsaken, no fortresses, ok it is kind a little strategy ^^ Why would you name your game like that. Honestly only title would driven me away from it if I didnt check trailers and screenshots.Now for the review;Great survival game, altought it is in early access it runs smooth without any bugs or glitches. Graphic is very good, nice textures and models.Sound has awesome music that will complete whole gameplay, however I would like more voice-acting.This isnt some small lets make a game and sell it, lots of effort and knowledge were put behind this title. Gameplay atmosphere is deep and totaly enjoyable, another plus goes for combat, intentory and crafting system, a very well job done.I can safely recommend it buying it while in early access because game has a lot of potentional and it already looks good, and price of 9,99 is very reasonable what this game has to offer. 3 diferent mods and all are replayable for fun ^^Overall:Graphic:    8/10Sound:       8/10Gameplay: 9/10Would give it all nines, but game name is just wrong ^^-Disclaimer- Key for this game was given to me by developer for testing and reviewing			"

								Still a lot of work to be done before this is ready and given the mixed performance since this was first announced on Kickstarter I'd suggest being cautious. It's all very well supporting indie developers so long as you know the risks and at this point the team need more experience as well as probably big dose of funding, unfortunately neither are going to be happening any time soon.

								The studio managed to get back on track and deliver on the promised game, even if the scope has been reduced from the original to deliver within a strained budget. For now gone are the vehicles, gone is the open world, gone is the random environment. What will happen next will probably depend on how the early access sales go on Steam, which is a shame since there aren’t many games featuring good, tactical squad based combat. Developers are quite active and receptive to ideas and suggestions and kudos to them for getting the game out despite the initial difficulties and all the negativity which developed in their community; still, the game is quite unfinished and future patches will define its success.

								The game is at a stage of quality approaching a 10/10 review.But due to their mismanagement of kickstarter funds.Due to the fact the game was originally demo'd to players as a Fortress Defense type product that meets Fallout free roam gameplay WITH vehicles!! And also because its still kinda buggyI give it a 7/10. Take that how you will. The gameplay is atleast convincing and of a higher quality than most early access titles in its own genre which is RTS Survival Zombie strategy they also added a very human approach to it and it costs significantly less than its only competitor The Walking Dead: Escapists game so its worth the 9.99 for sure. If you like the TV show The Walking Dead then this game is not bad at all. It is actually worthy of the price I'd say and the story is featured nicely in the game's own design. A rare feat not easily disregarded.			"

								Out of respect for the game itself....I will still recomend this game mainly for the fact that this is still somewhat uses what the game was suppose to have :PThe price is decent....but doesn't seem very fair to most of the backers that had to pay 25$ or 20$...can't exactly remember what the amount was again but I do know it wasn't for 10$.Will however admit that I am somewhat dsappointed at the fact that the game has been turned into...this...If this isn't the actual game itself, but more of a different approach, then sure it is indeed fun and the This War of Mine approach is interesting considering that game was 2D while this isn't.But here is a couple reasons why I was really hoping for the game I gave some money to back then. It had a Open world situation...no ""spend # hrs to travel to ****"", sure time could be used traveling in open world...but it isn't always the same...that and it had vehicles. Another is that the creativity in base building...has now been downplayed and has been brought down to smply base customizing. Will admit it is still decent, but I would of loved to build the base rather than have a pre-set building the entire game.Another point so far is survivors...I simply go up to one...ask...and they join...seems silly when you would likely consider they want something done first or want something in return...not a simple ""wanna join? > sure!"" situation.Another point I was wanting to add is that the character sheets are...really confusing.Example: I chose 2 survivors, one who had a skill in scavenging and the other at crafting. But somehow my crafter had MUCH better scavenging stats while the scavenger had crappy scavenging stats...and sure the crafter had great crafting skills...but my scaveger also had great engineering and good crafting. I am wandering if the ""skills"" add certain things rather than actually effect the stats.Other than that...if they are still working the the offical game, then great ^_^....if this is now the offical game...then...kinda unfair :(			"

								What's the Craic GuysSo it's safe to say this game isn't the same game I helped kickstart BUT saying that, its still got some good potential. Comparing the game to 'This War of Mine' is fair. Kickstarter said it would be open world its not. You have to build your base select areas to explore and scavenge. Bandits zombies and other creepy looking monsters will defend areas, you'll need to explore the easier areas first and build up weapons and let other survivors join your team. Managing food can be hard at the start but keep your team small at first and you'll be fine. Sticking to easy areas gets you started pretty quickly. I'm going to wait until the games been updated a bit before playing it again. I would advise keeping an eye on this one.I was really looking forward to an open world adventure where you could equip a group of survives send them out in a truck to kill bandits for loot then return to base to defend it from a wave of zombies. manning towers and gun turrets. But sadly this is not that type of game. My first playthrough:

								**This is subject to change as updates come through**Forsaken Fortress Strategy; where do I start?It's still in EA, so I'll go easy on it, but for the kind of genre it's going into, I'm going to have to give it a thumbs down. Sorry Photon Arena, but that's how it is. Here's why:Pros:- Interesting survivor mechanics- Solid design and most things have a logical flow to them- Diverse enough game modes (unlike most other games of this type)Cons:- No tutorial game mode (or tooltips in-game). Sorry community guide writers (you guys are awesome), but a game like this should have one by default- Help section doesn't actually help much; the descriptions are quite bare; and there's missing content- Building functionality essentials are 'missing'; by that I mean, they aren't in the help section- Neutral NPCs appear as enemies on the map- Very repetitive events- I can hear the zombies, but I can't see them...in the day time**If you're one of 'those' people (and I can understand why)**- Made in Unity 3D <--- Not a con in my books (even though I am a UE person)I'm not asking for someone to hold my hand here, but there is a difference between hand-holding, and giving players a handy-dandy, well-written reference.

State of the game right now is still a bit rough, but it's certainly playable. It still needs a lot of work and polsih to be a complete game, but if the developers have enough patience to finish it properly after all these years, I think it has a lot of potential to be a great game.Gameplay is real time 3rd person squad startegy scavenger, as others have said, I did get instant Dead State and This War of Mine vibe, although I'm fairly sure that the first beta versions predate both of them. For a price of 9,99e right now, it's a decent game at current state.			"

								Early Access 1.11VFun game with a solid idea - as it goes on I'll be changeing and updateing my opinion as I'm sure you are able to read the game description I won't tell you what this game is about since the got it coveredProCombat is easy to understand and get into Base construction is free form with a decent EA varity of buildings and more promisedscavenging resources feels more relistic then mining or cutting treesgood mix of starting charactersConsno mouse scroll - only WASD to move the map (might be a option to alter that unknown as of now)characters do not seem to defend themselfs unless in active combat modesick / tired status happens far to easily game is a bit clunky as game will slow down when to many things are happeningnuetrals show up as red on mini map same as enemiesover all I'd give this game a solid 6 outta 10 with hope for more - its fun and I plan to keep updateing this as I learn / game updates			"

If the issues that i encountered are fixed i believe you could get a lot of hours out of this game but as always beware that this is an ''early acces'' game and is not guaranteed to become finished.			"

								I was an original Kickstarter backer way back when.  At one point they finally released an alpha of a game remnant that barely ran and then afterwards went silent.  Most of us had written off the developers, and then yesterday got a steam key after another 1 1/2 years and installed hoping it was the game they promised.  This game is a pile of crap!  Don't buy!

								HI allI played it for 2 hours or more and it seems great and all the guys who made it did a good job.I was hoping for more going and hunting building where i want to and maybe get me food from other places by getting of bushes or killing animals but it is more of survive only in a town.i think if they take this game back and make it the why it would have bin this game would be better but my opinion is No.Maybe if it turns out more of survival and the stuff it was ment to be then i might check it again if it is better.

								The game looks good but its ♥♥♥♥ing broken. Atleast for me. Everytime i start up a game the camera freaks out rotating and  jumping to every single angle before being firmly planted in the ground. This game needs an immediate patch for this♥♥♥♥♥♥to be playable. After that then i can recommend this. Not until then tho.			"

								Recomendation Changed*sigh* I gave it time. Devs don't respond. No updates in months but worse, absolutely no communication from the chinese developers. Those of you who have done early access before know what comes after zero developer communication....Dead Game!!! The following review was posted with high hopes for this game, however I had no knowledge of the reputation of these developers beforehand, should have done my homework.....I may be a little biased here. Not because I know the developers or anything, instead, because this is a game I've had in the back of my mind for a long, long time. Basically you build, craft grow or trade to keep a group of 2-6 survivors alive in a post apocalyptic world. A world where zombies, mutants, bandits, psychopaths and xenophobes really dont give a hoot about your existence. In fact, they are often downright rude. I understand that resources in the new world order are limited, but is it necessary to try and kill me and add me to said scant resources? Unscrupulous!Anyway joking asidepros+full rotating/zooming cameras...... you know the deal+crafing, building, trading, starvation, illness, freezing, sleep deprivation, yep, there all here for you to suffer through          and overcome+creepy sound and music+ wounds and other negative effects like being exhausted are animated on screen instead of just a minus 3 to hit or whatever on your character sheet.+ pretty solid gameplay.+ animations often match action. There is different animation when your character s making vegetable soup and when they are roasting meatm and different sounds too. This is a nice touch.Note: one of the people who gave this game a negative review posted that the scavenged areas do not reaspawn and he is just dead wrong. Seems to be kinda random but after a week or so loot does respawn and even kinda ""grows"" meaning if you let it alone longer you will gain more lootCons- balancing, but hey its still early access.- no description of what your skills actually do. but it appears they decrease time for an action to be completed. I know thats the case for scavenging anyway.definetly early accessSome glitches every now and then.Once again this game scrathes an itch in my ganing desires.......I beleive I will scratch that itch now/			"

								This game seems to have been abandoned. No updates in months on a game that's no where near completion. Do not buy this game unless you dont mind playing unfinished products.			"
