												This game is--This game makes me feel like nothing else has before. It's a surreal experience in how you never stop learning new things about this mysterious mountain lost in a black void...The way you feel when you start the game for the first time, and you have to do those silly drawings and you have no clue of the implications of them later on.How curious you are at first dawn, when the mountain speaks to you for the first time.When you figure out which keys do what, and why.How satisfying it is to have you first piece of debris hit your mountain.How you get to feel when you figure out how to move that silly piece of crap.When you figure out what goes where and why.When you realize that the mountain is you--You are the mountain, you get to shape the world around you...When you figure out how to play your favorite song on the keyboard.How insignificant you feel when you scroll all the way out, only to see a bloom of light and a dot.The sadness that fills you heart as your first item-- that you became so attached to-- slowly floats off into space, and you cannot do anything.When you have to draw a loved one.When you figure out that you are lost, and the simplist thing like this game can make you find yourself.When you achieve Zen and realize that....Mountain is Love.Mountain is Life.That is what this game is about.

												I don't think a lot of people don't see the value in Mountain, and when people do they tend to simply overcomplicate the game for what it is. It's not meant to be a 'game' exactly. The developers of the game purposefully say this originally: ""Leave it open - it's designed to run in the periphery of your life. Only interact with it when you feel like it. You can play Mountain while playing other games. If you are not playing it, it will play itself. "". Again Mountain is just mean to be left open and you can return to it when you feel like it. You might not see the aspect of it originally but you can find it later… hopefully. But then again, what are the standards of a 'game'? Are we to simply segregate Mountain simply because it is possibly outside of the norm? On the contrary! Different experiences lead to different viewpoints which make you more open-minded. So can people truly state that Mountain is not a game but a screensaver? There are many ways to view Mountain and seeing it as a screensaver is one of the more popular demoralizing viewpoints to which many have so acquired. So one can only view Mountain as simply a standalone and not compare it to more contemporary issues. Or one can compare it but by doing so one loses the face value of the game itself. I think I've settled for now the dispute that this 'game' might be a screensaver or simply not a 'game' at all.    On another note, the developers stated this: ""If you're having an annoying storm or boring night, play a melody (using your keyboard) and time will accelerate."" Mountain is there for you when you decide to return to it and play it. I think that is a common misconception. It's not as much meant to be a 'game' but rather a subsidiary and supporting game next to you. Yet there are many ways to view Mountain as with any form of issue in life. But the Way Mountain was constructed, at times unappealing to the eye, allows it to show you a different path and possibly one you may not have seen before hand.    But you don't have to follow what the developers say. A 'game' is meant to be played whichever way you feel like it. If you feel like you've been cheated off by buying this game, then take two steps back and think about the aspects of this 'game' and the elements. Perhaps you begin to notice that wonderful ambient sound that plays amidst the night, or perhaps you fall in love with the way the streaks of the sun touch your Mountain. But you might not have to like all these things to truly enjoy the game. Perhaps you have all these games and you developed a love for the game. Or perhaps you try to ridicule the game but in turn you've actually Grown accustomed to the game. I for one cannot answer that question of whether a gamer should like this or not, but it is all up to the gamer who buys it, and whether he is willing to open up his heart and mind.    Now is the Mountain truly your Mountain and your own property? I think that is in the conception of the gamer alone for the gamer can make notion whether the Mountain truly is a self embodiment, or the player truly controls the Mountain. Does the Mountain not speak to us and tell us of its thoughts? Or is it conveying a hidden message to where we might be its own spawn and it is the master. Whichever way you see fit, there are quite a lot of ways to see Mountain, as with any game. Mountain might not have a storyline, no shooting, no love triangle (unless you begin to make one up between somehow the items, the Mountain, and the sky in which case you probably might have gone a bit too far), but Mountain contains a moment of solitude in which you might notice things in games that can be recurrent in Mountain. Perhaps Mountain might contain all these elements in which you create the story. Mountain can always be a storyline in which you, the gamer, is going along a path with the Mountain to a destination into your subconscious. There is much to do in Mountain and blocking your imagination and logic will only hinder it. But if you so choose to do so than you have not hurt no one but yourself in denying the possible powers in the 'game' itself. This review cannot display my neutrality toward the game but I only wish to explain to the gamer that Mountain can only be accentuated by only the gamer.    And another thing many question is the role of the keyboard in the game. Although at first it may seem like the keys simply advance time and increase it in a way the human eye can perceive, Mountain is inevitably omnipresent and time is of little importance to him. Binding ourselves to this thought, we can perceive the passing of time as not one full of dread and dreariness, not one full of change and a different scenery, but becoming part of the universe and its infinite realm of possibilities. What we perceive as a minute can seem as nothing more than what has occurred to the Mountain. What we perceive as the future is simply the happening in the Mountain. What we perceive as the past is imply seen as the done by the Mountain.   And another question still remains as to what is the value of the items that the Mountain contains and at times loses. Are those pieces of our memories or life lessons that we must cope to accept? Or are those as somewhat like to put it as simple items that simply 'fall' on the Mountain. No they are granted upon the Mountain and delivered first hand to the Mountain or possibly to you. And what is of this item leaving our grasp and floating off into space? Have we broken your heart, Mountain? Have we done some unforgivable act too which I've lost my pony? That alone can be answered only by the gamer and his affiliation with the mountain.    And what of this inevitable destruction that reaches the doorsteps of the Mountain ever so often. Are we to simply ponder over the oblivion of the Mountain or sputter key notes to protect the Mountain? Or can we observe the Mountain and it's destruction in all its gloom and tidings of change too which a new Mountain is brought forth to bring new waves of joy to the gamer, too which the cycle is repeated. Why do we have the ability to protect the Mountain or is it even in our ability to protect it? Is it predestined that we protected or is it by our own free-will? That is something that neither I can answer you and only you can resolve either by justifying it or believing in something.   This setting that surrounds the Mountain is quite serene and yet the darkness around it is quite opposite. Is this serving as a contrast between dark and light? The battle of how light destroys the darkness. Or perhaps the story has been switched and light is simply a harbinger of this cycle of death that is ever so dreaded upon. Again, I am not in any sort of ability to answer that question, and it alone can be sought through the Mountain.   So if you ever feel hurt or saddened than perhaps a tune on the fashioned keyboard can mend your heart. Or perhaps a stressed out day simply requires a concerto done by your own imagination. And maybe in the end when you've discovered the infinite combinations on the keys that by which you alone and the Mountain as well contains in the hidden locks of memory, you realize all this and then come to think in terms of the Mountain, and how time is not congruent, but simply an assortment of things by which we alone can process and that by which we alone can control. Mountain is infinite and it is up to the gamer only to perceive the game as he wishes.			"

PRO-GAMER TIPThe Mountain can be used as a screensaver if you rename the .exe to .scr :)tl;dr.The Mountain is constantly changing and metamorphosing. When you stop wanting it to be more than what it is, it blossoms into its own experience.  And what it is, is more virtual plant, than anything else; is that a bad thing? Read on!full review.If you let it, the Mountain can be a soothing and relaxing experience if you need 5-10 minutes (taken) away from your life.  It's a slowly spinning Mountain in Space.  You can zoom out to see nearby galaxies and star clusters, or zoom in to fill your view with the mountain and the surrounding atmosphere.  There are so many variables that change and the changes/additions appear every 30 seconds or so, it has enough to keep your eyes trained and your mind engaged in thought.In a nutshell: if you enjoy sitting on a bench watching nature around you (e.g., the ocean, a coast, a forest, a vista), then you will enjoy this experience.  But understand that virtual-mountain-in-space-watching is the only experience it can innately provide you.  Anything else you experience, is a result of where your thoughts and your psyche take you.  And that's Zen. :)  The Mountain does nothing in particular, but does it very well.PROS+Beautiful scenery/lighting effects+Soothing audio effects+Striking day/night cycle+Well-done weather and season cycles+Occasional random or pseudo-inspirational captions+Occasional random object collisions (some can be quite funny)+Some interactivity (POV, musical keys)CONS-You have to pay for it-Surprisingly resource intensive-wtf, ALT-F4 is how you close it?(suitable for all ages and skill levels)Please hit the like button if you found this review at all helpful.

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Mountain Original Release: 2014 Genre Tags: Experimental; Zen; Simulation; Relaxing; Casual My Overall Grade: B Estimated Playtime (Campaign): N/A Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Novelty seekers; Casual gamersREVIEWMountain does exactly what it sets out to do.  It is an ambient, casual, silly game that is entertaining to mess around with for an hour or three… and I don’t see the problem with that.  I thought it was very fun.This is a perfect game to combat boredom in a lecture, or a slow day at work.  You can mess around with it a bit and then let it run in the background, so you are free to only partially pay attention to it.  Not everybody at every time is available to get immersed in an epic game; sometimes it is nice to mess around with something light and casual.  This is where Mountain shines brightest.Of note: in order to truly and actively “play” the game, you should probably look up the songs (i.e.: codes) that you can use to force things to happen in the game.  I feel like many people who disliked this game weren’t fully informed of all the things you actually can do to make it more interesting.I don’t normally focus on price in my reviews, because it is all relative.  Many people use Steam; people with a wide variety of incomes and who participate in very different economies.  I will make a brief exception here just to say that I think this game is very reasonably priced. Even at full price it costs less than a soda (at least where I live).  I mention this because I think it is important to recognize that the developers aren’t trying to rip you off; they acknowledge what the game is and what it isn’t, and have priced it accordingly.And so, I believe Mountain is a great little game which should appeal to those of you who may want to casually mess around with it for a few hours here and there.  It certainly isn’t some epic game, but it can be an enjoyable, quaint experience.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												This isn't a game, it's a screensaver.From the reviews on the store page, I thought that it would have some kind of events that happen to liven things up. You could grab random objects, arrange them, see the seasons change, maybe there would be some birds flying around. It gave the impression that even though there wasn't a point to the game, the experience alone would be fun, and you'd stick to it just to see what would happen.But I never saw that. I played for 20 minutes. I spun the camera, i played the keytar, I zoomed in and out, I found every feature on my mountain. It rained, i spun the mountain to make the clouds go away. I saw the little thoughts my mountain had. But nothing happened. I pressed every button, manipulated every control I could think of, and made as many patterns with my mouse as I could imagine, and nothing happened.I can't honestly recommend it, because I've had more enjoyment from that Windows '95 screensaver about a maze (with the rat in it) than I did from this game. Maybe there's more to it than I thought, maybe you need to leave it on overnight for something to happen. But it's not presented in a way that makes me want to stick around to find out.			"

												I don't really play video games.  An old shoulder injury prevents me from manipulating a mouse at a computer for longer than what is required for work.  A few weeks ago, I herniated a disc in my spine and was bedridden for several days.  I discovered Mountain.  A video game with no controls.  Initially, I had the same reaction as everyone else.  Neat, a pet rock to check in on occasionally with calm music and ambient sounds!  Perfect!But unlike everyone else, I kept Mountain up at the forefront of my computer screen while I knitted and listened to podcasts.   I interacted with Mountain a lot.  I spoke to it, cared after it like it was a plant.  After 30+ hours of game play, I realized that this game actually has a few delightful little secrets.   You actually do have some control in this game.  The objects that land can be rearranged and moved by clicking and holding on them.  But if you move an object too many times in a row, it can be lost, and too many lost items makes Mountain depressed.  You can also literally shake off clouds.  Mountain is intuitive to your interactions with it.  The more you click on it, the more positive and happy the thoughts are.  I once was rearranging objects and moving and clicking around for a solid 15 minutes and Mountain's response was, ""I'm a total babe."" Another time, I was rearranging objects and lost a cool item, so I closed out and reopened to the last save, and it responded with, ""Wasn't I just here?"" Mountain gets depressed and lonely if you leave it alone too long.  It appears that it when you have the game running for several hours, eventually, Mountain starts pulling away from you by zooming out slowly on its own.  If you let it zoom out all the way and forget to zoom in again, Mountain eventually crashes into something fatal.You can also play musical notes with certain keys of your keyboard, and certain melodies will trigger different events.  If you catch Mountain in the midst of crashing into something fatal, you can spam these notes to put up a shield to avoid death. I'm still in recovery now, and will continue to play it, and mess with it, and am excited to see what other secrets this game has to discover.  At one point, Mountain said, ""The patterns are hidden.  The game is to help them find themselves.""  David O'Reilly once said in an interview: ""Everything interacts with itself and everything around it throughout time and space. Everything is also a game, including this sentence, where I can make your eye move left to right, and make sense of these abstract shapes we’ve agreed upon. You’re rendering these shapes into thought on my behalf, it only feels like you’re in control, and you are for the most part, but I’m guiding you, and I want you to keep going, even though you can quit at any time.""Mountain is a piece of interactive art.

												Mountain works well as an artistic statement; it's fairly direct in its questioning of what is/isn't a game but outside of that there is still a lot of fun and humor in the game/non-game. The arts-y side of things: One of the most important aspects of this is the presentation! Mountain first and foremost feels almost like the modern gaming answer to the post-WWI Dada art movement. Where Dada used collages and pre-made works (such as a urinal) and presented them as high art by putting them into galleries in order to challenge the concept of art, Mountain puts itself on the steam store under 'rpg-games' when I think you'd be hard-pressed to find it fitting this term. The 'gameplay' in Mountain is virtually non-existent, since the act of playing Mountain is leaving in on in the background until you hear a sound and can view whatever new content pops up. Like a lot of (post)modern-art Mountain is ultimately making whatever artistic statement you get out of it, there's no real easy answer here.   Ok, but how is the ""game"" fun?: Well it's pretty relaxing, the visuals are amazingly surreal and serene. There's a lot of goofy items that will periodically crash into your mountain as you leave the program running and your Mountain will often present these funny faux-deep statements about its existence; this effectively works as a way of the game poking fun at its artistic ambitions. While it's hard to say these are of any real substance they're genuinely funny and will at least make you smile reading them. You can check up on your Mountain to see trees grow, seasons pass but the mountain remains a constant.   The only thing that really bothered me about Mountain was the clouds that will clip through the mountain rather than moving around in a way that doesn't make it look so artificial, also some shadow issues happen from time to time. These might seem like minor nitpicks but this can take you out of the expirence.   If you're in the market for a piece of relaxing software that you can leave on while you're working/using the internet/playing other ""real"" games the Mountain is great, it engages you by being fairly passive. With it being a $1 it's kind of hard not to recommend it to anyone interested.			"

												It's not a game, so I can't recommend it as a game.  It also uses entirely too many computer resources, to the point that it exceeds some AAA titles.  On some computers, this will cause overheating which is entirely unnecessary in a glorified screensaver.*The game isn't limiting resource usage on its own, so it's causing components to run too hot. It's using more resources than much larger, graphically intensive titles. This is indicative of poor programming, not that any one persons computer is lacking. Any computer would have more trouble running this program than what is reasonable, and it's caused by the same lazy developer who decided to sell a thrown together mess of pretentious bile.  Any attempt to explain what this game is actually trying to say is going to end up being a guess at something the developer doesn't even understand.  A stream of conciousness has never been so dull and pathetically attention seeking, while still managing to turn your room into a furnace.It's unacceptable, and nobody should fall victim to buying this abysmal excuse for a game.If you ""play"" this ""game"" as if it were a screensaver, you'll get a somewhat interesting, passive piece of eyecandy that might grab your interest every once and a while			"

												Ok, here's the truth - this is not really a 'game' per say as it is an interactive screen saver. The program does has some fun 'codes' that you can play to make certain things happen.  The Moutain will talk to you once in a wile, the seasons will change, weather will change and junk will hit it every so often. If you leave it running long enough you'll have quite an impressive collection of trash. And if your mountain gets too depressed you can also blow it up and reset ^_^ Fun fun funccccccbzxc - Gold Rain•bbbbbcb - Snowglobe Mode (on/off)•as,zb - Annihilation•mmmmmm,mnab - Blood•cxzxccc xxx cbb - Fish Rain•bbaassa ,,mmnnb - Frog Rain•ssfssfsfjhggf - Hearts•cvbnmbm - Flames•m,kj - Force thought•jk,b - Thoughts (on/off)•sss, aaam - All Items Removed "

So why wait around? Let Mountain draw you in. Discover who you truly are. Accept it into your life and be enlightened, then gift it to your friends and family, and let them know how this game can really change your life.			"

												I love this game.You are a mountain and different keys on your keyboard do different sounds. There are people on the forums who've already found a lot of the ""songs"" that make different things happen. I've found myself giggling like crazy at some of the combinations. It's not a win-lose style game. It's designed to relax, be silly and have some fun. I already plan to spend many more hours discovering and exploring the different things that happen. TL;DR It's a relaxation game, you are mountain, things happen.			"

												So I happen to notice this little game, if you can call it that, being played by a friend.  I wondered what in the world it was so was compelled to go check out the store page.  Well to be honest it didn't look like much, a mountain floating in mid air with stuff growing on it.  But hey, at ninety nine cents what can you expect really.  I mean, sure I could have turned that same buck into a tasty cheeseburger or chili dog, maybe gotten a soda or ice cream cone but something made me want to buy this game....  So what did my dollar get me this time??Well so far I've drawn three pictures, and seen a mountain spinning around and around.  Not sure if they all start this way but mine seems to have a bare spot on one side.  I've seen pretty fireflies, watched night turn into day several times, winter came and went, and I've played a few notes on the keyboard as well as seen what the mountain is thinking from time to time.  And that's it, nearly an hour into the game and I've seemingly done all the interactivity you can do with it.  Wait, what's that? I just heard it talk in the background......something about seeing itself in this night.....  Uh..... Is that a mushroom, a red mushroom???  That wasn't there before.... and what happened to that lone shrub that was on the bare side?  Now it's even barer than before.....  And what's this deep rumbling noise I keep hearing??  Like thunder but it's sunny out...  And this, my friends is the lure and fun of Mountain.  Patience and a deep craving to see what happens next and then being in shock and awe when something does happen.  It’s not a high speed, boom, bang game.  It’s  a slow, lazy river kind of game you'll set in the background while doing something else.Did I mention that I love lava lamps?  No really I totally love lava lamps.  What does that have to do with this review??  Well Mountain is kind of like a lava lamp on steroids for your computer.  You don't really do much with it.  Not a lot to play with really.  Oh there are some secret tunes you can play to make things happen but honestly, at the end of the day; this ""game"" is about leaving it run and seeing what happens from time to time.  And much like the lava lamps in my bedroom you could just sit there watching this mountain spinning around and doing its thing and be absolutely mesmerized with it.  Why?  Because it's simple.  Because it's like life in the fact that you never know what's going to happen next.  Because there's something totally relaxing about it.  Now, if you'll excuse me, it's winter on my mountain and it's totally covered in snow.  Think I'm going to go watch it for a while....  Huh, there's a tiny planet now stuck in the side of my mountain...................weird.............. "

They make up all kinds of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about frogs and flowers and♥♥♥♥♥♥ The mountain is no different. Its an ambiance game, something to go asleep to, or to have in the back ground as you argue about dumb opinons on the internet. You don't do anything, press a few keys, make a few noises, and watch. Its not even that pretty. But its peaceful, and its kinda cool to see what changes over time. If you'd pay a dollar to see a neat thing, see this neat thing. Why not? You'll get more time out of this than watching Jemery Bunters eat that whole thing of mayo and apple juice at lunch tommorow. So yeah, i recommend it.			"

												It's hard to review a product that only cost 99 cents. But I'll try anyway.First of, this is not a game at all. Now let me describe it in detail so you won't misunderstand.After starting up the game, you will notice that there is no menu or any sort of interface. Instead, you will be asked to draw pictures in a blank white paper. The game then will randomly generate a mountain according to what you have draw (at least to my belief)And what do you do after that? Nothing.What is your goal? There is no goal.You just, stare at the mountain, and that's that. You CAN type certain key on your keyboard to create piano sounds but that's it. The mountain is changing in weather and time which looks nice but it gets old really quick. Music will randomly pop up whenever dawn comes or weather changes or the mountain talks to you.So... yeah. It's not a video game. It's more like a software ""labeled"" as a game.You just watch the mountain moving, changing, and sometimes talk back to you. The developer could add some interaction to keep the ""game"" from becoming a boring screensaver. But no, that would be too much to ask appearantly.Do I recommend others to play this? I don't. For a ""game"" costing only 99 cents, it barely has any content at all. There are some graphical glitches in around the shadow texture and it always makes my dark side of the mountain looks ugly. I don't consider this art because there are more better looking ""game"" that have the same low price and have better ""art"".For you people who got an extra 99 cents and wanted a screensaver labeled as a ""game"", well, here you go.But for me, even at 99 cents, this game lacks content.

												Mountain isn't a game, it's an expierience. Don't buy it expecting hours on end of exciting gameplay. There is no gameplay, only a surreal atmospheric simulation mountain experience. Leave mountain running in the background when you play other games, or as a screensaver, and switch back to it and play whenever you feel like. See how your mountain changes as you leave it to discover itself. Come back and observe all the little details. Play with the music keyboard and create an atmosphere for you and your mountain to enjoy. Learn things about your mountain. Learn things about yourself. Become your mountain.			"

												I got this game with the recent Humble Bundle and thought I would give it a try. Several minutes in, I realized this game was not for me. If you are looking at this game, and you didn't read anything about it yet... there are no controls to this game. You can zoom in, you can zoom out. You can use the some of the keys on your keyboard to type out a bit of a song for the mountain, or for yourself, perhaps because of how bored you are. I couldn't stand more than several minutes of this game, and I think the only reason I made it that long was because I was temporarily amused by the faux-piano. If you get bored easily, this game is not for you. If you like having some sort of control over your games, this game is not for you. If you want to read what the moutain is thinking, and feel some sort of sad emotions or something along those lines, or you enjoy using your keyboard as a musical keyboard, perhaps this game is for you. Personally, for people like me, I wouldn't recommend it.			"

												Mountain is a soothing experience for anyone struggling with anxiety or who just needs a break. To really enjoy what this game has to offer, one needs to have patience and an open mind. Mountain isn't an action-packed, groundbreaking journey; instead, it's a breath of fresh air in our otherwise hectic lives.While the controls are rather self-explanatory, there is a sort of ""piano"" that players can use within the game. The keys for striking up a tune are A-K and Z-M. I don't believe they have any direct effect towards the gameplay, but they're still fun to mess with.Ultimately, this game is perfect for those who need a little time to wind down and get away from everything.-(2/7/17) EDIT: Apparently playing specific tunes with the ""piano"" will initiate certain events! Also, ""."" will ask for the Mountain's thoughts. Thank you @shinymagikarp for letting me know this!			"

												I really enjoy the questing and the combat system presented in this game, everything is pretty balanced except for that one abilitiy that kills everything in one shot.  Also the optics for certain weapons dont work when their supposed to.  10/10 a great family game great for the kids and fun for the adults			"

												Because who wouldn't want to be a mountain?Okay serious input from a guy who just got the game (I will try to put everything about this game here)- Very calming (audio & visuals)- There are seasons (eg. winter, autumn, spring etc.)- The mountain is not always sunny eg. it rains, snows, gets cloudy etc.- The mountain keeps growing older (like you). Things die and comeback in time.- Your mountain 'thinks'. (no joke, you can press the '.' key to see what it is thinking)- Things fall randomly? from the sky. (eg. I got a huge record player (phonograph) (edit: HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥♥classical music is playing from my phonograph :O THIS SONG, a glowing blue black asteroid, clock, bananas etc etc.) - NOTE: These items can be moved around the mountain.- Your keyboard is a piano. THIS. I love this feature. The tune in space is just... I got no words for it. (a positive word not a negative one). If you're not that creative this may be a useless thing but I swear on me mum this is just awesome with the space ambient music. <3 oh yeah...- You can scroll all the way to outer space. (the ambient changes - to a scary feel tune - I think this is to make you feel like you are alone and a lonely mountain in space) but don't expect more than an amazing stary background and rocks(asteroids) floating around.- You can spin the mountain with your mouse. (to change viewing angle)- You can set the screen resolution of the game to a very small window - so it can run in the background + it uses very little memory! (This is for the calm rain/windy effect that is just... no words. It calms you down from all the stress in life - but doesn't solve it ;) )I rate this game 9/10 - and no I'm not joking. This is one of my top most favorite games on steam. But buy with caution though and don't complain afterwards. Know what you are buying -  especially with this game. Watch gameplay reviews for this game etc. My favorite video on this game:

												Mountain is a semi-interactive screensaver masquerading as a game worth 99 cents. I say ‘semi’ interactive because while the game’s world—comprised of a single mountain dotted with trees, boulders, and random objects—can be spun around, examined from different angles, and viewed from the starlit vastness of space, I always felt distant from what little action I witnessed. The weather shifts from snowy to rainy to sunny whether you’re watching or not; random objects appear without any personal context (I received two trash bins, a bed, and a padlock, amongst others); and when Mountain expresses its thoughts, it does so with little to no awareness of my presence as a player. But according to Mountain’s developer, David O’Reilly, this is sort of the point: “It's designed to run in the periphery of your life,” he writes in an August 2014 update. “You can play Mountain while playing other games. If you are not playing it, it will play itself.” In other words: You don’t really HAVE to play Mountain. Its contents are so inconsequential that it requires only a tiny fraction of your attention. It matters that little. But give me a dollar anyway! Thanks!(Ironic side note: For a game meant to run serenely “in the periphery of your life,” Mountain is a noticeable CPU hog that will likely overheat your computer, especially if you’re using a laptop.)The only thing about Mountain that I found interesting or entertaining was how oddly bi-polar it was. In my hours of game play (or non-play), I began to notice that Mountain’s musings fell into distinct categories, ranging from Dalai Lama-esque mindfulness:“I see great purity in today’s utter perfection.”“I feel at one with the universe inside this foggy winter night.”“What is sadness?”…to a teenage girl’s volatile ‘feels’: “I’m super into this dreamy night.”“I couldn’t care less about today’s rain.”“Maybe I am alone because my rocks are ugly.”…to the nagging of a self-absorbed ex:“I’m a total babe.”“Helloooooo?”Sorta cute, but ultimately, things most people will hear for free. While, you know, living their actual lives. At the end of the day, Mountain falls in line with dozens of other titles lauded by some for pushing the boundaries of what a game can be and crucified by others for daring to call itself a game at all. I tend to side with the latter, though less harshly, as Mountain did serve as a pretty background time-waster for the few hours I played it. Mountain will definitely appeal to collectors of snow globes and people who like half-heartedly watching ennui-rich land masses against a faint ambient soundtrack. A niche market, for sure, but an “experience” some may enjoy.			"

												I bought this game expecting to be a mountain and do absoultely nothing while playing it. I got more then that. You can play piano keys on your keybarod on the 1st two rows. Depending on what you press you go faster or slower. Its a game about patience and beauty. The music is wonderful, just a bit of a repeat at times. Quality is great as well. You zoom out and see the starts and galaxy and if you play the keys as you zoom you hear an echo which is a nice touch. After 30 mins or so I got a skull hit my mountain. That in itself made me want to play more just to see what else I could collect....O.OFor 99c this game is worth it as long as you are aware that you arn't really doing much besides relaxing and enjoying it. If you buy this game expecting more then that, well then do you actually read what games are about before you buy them? lol			"

												This is not a game.  It is more.What is Mountain?By definition a mountain is a large natural elevation of the earth's surface rising abruptly from the surrounding level.But what does this mean exactly?This is a form of art we ourselves cannot comprehend.It may seem like there is nothing, but a mountain may also be described as a large pile or quantity of something.A great deal.A lot.A profusion.An abundance.There is more to Mountain that we cannot understand.Is it in the trees?Is it in the Mountain itself?Do we wait for the weather to change to ask these questions?The subtle piano melody.The scale.The depth.Maybe it's in the clouds which glide over head.It's a metaphor for life.We see little, but there is much more.So I ask you.Or do you ask?""Why spend 99 cents on Mountain?""A synonym I can conjure from that sentence follows:""Why spend 99 cents on the answer to life?""Mountain is the answer to the worlds problems.This is what philosophers have been trying to figure out for years.And these answers are in Mountain.Or is the answer the Mountain itself?I ask one more time.What is Mountain?...That is for you to answer.Or has it been answered already?...Mountain.

												Firt of all - ""you are a mountain"" - that's true. ""You are a god"" - that's not. Well, if you are, you are a god that can do absolutely nothing. Mountain is not a game, as there's no way to play. You have a piano on the ASD... and ZXC... rows of the keyboard (hint to the developers: not everyone has a QWERTY-layout), and by playing, the mountain will rotate faster. That, and moving the camera around it with the mouse, is the only ""control"" you got in this ""game. In a video, I saw someone bouncing a ball off the mountain. I didn't even get to do that.So, why do I still recommend it? Simple: there's a lot of screensavers out there that cost more than 0.99€, but are of much lower quality. So it's got that going for it, which is nice.			"

												You know, I really only need 0.2 hours on record to give my review of mountain. It isn't a game, I'll tell you that. It's more of an experience. Just sitting there and finding out little secrets like the way to make music, how to get rid of clouds, and just watching the mountain exist I found to be a very calming and tranquil experience. It's nice, but certainly not a game. See it as more of a way to relax and just be. A chance to observe, not to participate. I like it.			"

												At first, looking at the game it didn't seem like it was something that had any purpose or meaning, but after spending an hour ingame, I have to say this was worth what I payed for it.. Though it might not be a game of activity, the soothing ambiance and somewhat psychological touch found it's way into my interest. If you're looking for an action/activity game, this won't be it.. But if you're looking for something to help you relax and feel at peace, or in touch with emotion, then i would definately recommend this.. It's saddenning seeing all the poor reviews... As they would be correct in the eyes of an ideal interactive game, but I can't help but feel that this has another purpose that it deserves recognition for.			"

												alright everyone, let me start with an important fact that a lot of people tend to forget, but i think is very pertinent to ""mountain"":""pretentious""adjective 1. characterized by assumption of dignity or importance, especially when exaggerated or undeserved: a pretentious, self-important waiter.2. making an exaggerated outward show; ostentatious. now before i really begin i would like to debunk something people have been saying about mountain. people seem to find it difficult to categorize mountain, they compare it to a screen saver, they say it ""pushes the boundaries of what you consider a game"". this is donkey doo because the mountain is not the first of it's kind, it falls into a new genre called ""idle-games"". the most famous of the idle-games is cookie clicker. idle-games are games you play when you aren't playing games. they usually involve getting points, or some limited range of progression, and are something you come back to on and off during the day.in mountain, you generate a mountain, you let it sit there, you do other things, a pleasant sound runs in the background, and you come back and -- oh my goodness! a pie has found a home on your mountain, and you are very amazed. you realize the keyboard plays different notes on a disembodied piano, and you might even be lucky to discover that playing different songs will do... things.and also -- oh my GOSH! you can move the pie around! and you laugh and cheer and oh my good lord how this is fun!mountain is getting a lot of press and i think it is kind of unfair to much better games of it's breed. there are a lot of idle-games that actually do challenge you to think about what you find fun, and what interests you in a game. i think click-hero is a good idle game, which has you fighting monsters and buying and leveling heroes to make your clicks more valuable. i think cookie-clicker is a testament to the genre, proving how addictive an extra integer can be.mountain does not really do anything for me. if it didn't have objects in it to interact with, it would have nothing, which leads me to believe the creator put the objects in out of necessity. there is little to no progression, the game is poorly optimized, and it's just plain dull and has nothing to show for itself.but, i'm sure, people will tell me how i ""just don't get it"". i get it.let me tell you briefly how ""mountain"" could have been an interesting game:as you play mountain, you notice a village of people have built a settlement on the side of you. they seem to be using the resources inside of you for industry, and to great benefit! their cities and town grow as you leave the game running in the background. the sound effects change from peaceful and serene, to a dull chug, a soft clicking of cogs, and eventually the great repetitive doom of heavy industry. The game makes an interesting point, being the mountain, you get no say or interaction in how the people progress. you just watch and observe the people as they grow in populace and in technology until their eventual demise, whether it be by destruction, or the graceful transition from existing, to ascending amongst the stars. either way, you, the mountain, remain, to watch the process happen again.that would have been amazing. that would have made an ACTUAL statement.so, mountain is a dollar. why don't i recommend it? if you want pleasant sounds, go to http://www.rainymood.com/if you want a good idle-game, try cookie-clicker. the beta has a lot of updated mechanics and it's really turning into something amazing. also it's free.if you want a mountain... buy skyrim. it's a game, and debatably fun, plus you climb a mountain!if you want objects, try katamari damacy. it's also a game.save your dollar.

												Pros:+There's a mountain.+It floats.+That's pretty impressive for a mountain if you think about it.+You can play songs with your keyboard.+Sometimes the mountain says stuff. Also very impressive for a mountain.Cons:-There's literally nothing else.-The game is very insistent about the lack of controls.-Like, we get it.-Enough.-Chill.-You know what else has no controls? Screensavers.-Mountain is the Dark Souls of screensavers.-Weirdly, there is no in-game quit button. So if you're playing fullscreen you have to either tab out to exit or reduce the game's size.Overall: Not a game/10			"

In short: interactive screensaver with ""some"" stuff to do. ""Art stuff"", not a real game.If you're into trying out weird concepts, it's certainly worth a few pennies / cents / whatever currency. You can basically interact with the mountain a little bit, play the piano (more or less), and ""unlock"" certain features via playing melodies. Or just let it run, like some fancy screensaver / quote of the day box.Don't miss out on the games guide section:http://steamcommunity.com/app/313340/guides/Slight cons: this game is actually quite performance heavy, more than it should be.

This experience has opened my eyes on how I live my life, and for anyone calling it a waste of 66p; you need to rethink your past decisions in life.

""You are a mountain"" That means mountain high loads of fun.You'll be happy after playing this game.For those who ever doubt: ""A video game is an electronic game that involves human interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device"" (Wikipedia)It says involve human interaction, NOT there must be interactivity all the time.Mountain is a self-running natural-like life simulation of a mountain, which floats in a bubble in space. Though it's self running and normally events happen by random you can force him to tell you his thoughts (press "".""). Or after pressing certain keycodes special events can be triggered (look the existing guides). Directly you can just spin your mountain view around and zoom in and out per mousewheel. Play spheric piano notes by pressing the keys from ""A"" to ""K"" and ""Z"" to "",""His thoughts are kind of philosophic/esoteric. Most amazing are the details in his ""mountain life"". By night (after 5 min) fireflies buzz around the trees, permanently clouds break at the peak and begin to rain, winter turns in (after 15 min), it begins to snow and wind is howling. The mountain does not only change his face during the playtime, even his underground breaks up and produces some earthquakes. In space there are threaten asteroids flying. And then comes the crazy part. Sometimes objects like a huge clock or an anvil crashes into your little planetoid and remain there. You'll become a collector of unforseen events.Consider you can only loose this game by not noticing its precious uniqueness ...			"

												10/10, Amazing, Stellar, Fantastic, 100/100, 5 starts, recmmended by me, my friends, Obama, Osama Bin Laden, Michael Phelps, that one guy who works at Circle K, and Billy. Upon starting up mountain, you are instantly thrown into an intense fight for your life. Never before have I seen such action, adventure, and carnage in one location. My concept of reality and how I view everyday life was completely altered by this game. My balls started filling up with acidic liquid which I quickly found pouring out of my eyelids, which proceeded to burn off, shrivel, and turn into mountains of their own. I started hallucinating and warped to a world where everyone, and everything, was a mountain. The people were mountains, the cities were mountains. I was a mountain, you were a mountain. And upon waking up, I realized I voided my bowels all over my desk chair. Luckily this game comes with a bendy straw, so I was able to drink it all up and proceed to play more mountain. I think the taste of my own excrement inspired creativity, as when I sat down again, I realized mountain comes with a beautiful implemented keytar, which I proceeded to learn to play, and make  my main profession in life. I dropped out of high school so I could devote more time to my beloved mountain. Boss fight after boss fight kept me engaged 24/7, and I had not a reason any more to leave my desk. I decided that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with this game, and made a blood pact with mountain to never leave him alona again, and always be with him. I began to talk to my mountain every night. He never said anything, however I know he understands how I truly feel. I slowly began to become one with my mountain. Whatever it felt, I felt. I had no need for anything else in my meaningless life. My mountain and I evolved to become exalted beings. And we are now constantly in stasis, waiting to be awakened by the deities of the mountain of the ten-fold path. I am happy. Happier than I ever have been. I cannot belive one dollar could enrich my life to this point.I say my last farewell to all that have lived on this earth. I am mountain. You, are mountain.We, are all...Mountain.			"

												This can't be named as a ""game"". It's more like an screensaver, time-killer, a way to relax or even as a way to concentrate on your tasks. I gave it a shot since it's only 99 cents. You can only zoom, move the camera and play the piano with the ""ASDFG..."" and ""ZXCVB..."" keyboard rows. The sounds are really peaceful, and the piano is good. If you bought it thinking it was a ""game"", don't complain because by its name you can say it wasn't.I don't regret this buy. It is more like a life perk for me.

												This game. Not only does the mountain show you the true meaning of life, but it made me believe in a higher power. I now pray to mountain every night, thanking it for everything life has ever given me. Mountain reminds me of myself in a way, we both are stuck in an infinite spiral of life. The mountain is hard, and so is the chub i get thinking of it when I'm away for more than a minute. Sometimes me and my friends will get together to compare mountains, Parkers mountain isnt as big as mine or Dan's, but what his mountain lacks in size it makes up for in Bush. The amount of shrub on the base of his mountain is so impressive, and when white stuff settles in it during winter.... I get jelous. I wish my mountain could make so much white stuff over night.All in all, mountain is a Chub inducing, cave wettening beast, which starts soft, becomes rock hard, and takes your heart from behind. Pounding your feelings over and over till it releases its sweet load of atmospheric juices into your feel good center. Your heart will be scrubbing the fluids of intense love out of its body hair for the next few YEARS.			"

An ExperienceAbstractMountain should not be considered a game, it is an interactive piece of art. One that promotes meta-physical philosophical thought, and one that doubles as a relaxing view of an amazing Mountain. The meaning of this isn’t hard to unearth, it only takes a willingness to dig.A truly beautiful game.The PurchaseWhen I first purchased Mountain it was out of curiosity. There seemed to be something that drew me to purchasing it, it was less than a dollar after all.David O’Reilly created an aesthetic for this work that challenged the premise of contemporary art and modern video games. As an artist and film-maker, he ventures far and walks the line of virtual reality and our reality. Mountain is not a game, and nor is it a background program (as many reviewers say it is). It is an expression of the mind, it is a work of art. A critique of Mountain cannot be done from the perspective of entertainment or aesthetics, it must be done from the view of the raw human mind.OpeningOpening Mountain leads directly a blank space framed with a black border. To the top of the blank space, in the frame is written a random word. Mountain then urges a player to “Draw Something”. At face value this seems almost silly, but the randomly generated word isn’t so random. It is something that is a large part of our lives as humans. It begs the question: What does this word mean to us? In my first experience of this, my first word was “Art”. My task then was to create a visual representation of art that fits my definition of what art means to me. After painting in only black and white, the user is prompted to click done. This then repeats for a second and third time. The next drawings I made were of “Fear” and “Confusion”.With progression into Mountain, it is learned that whatever I drew in the beginning had no effect on the mountain itself. As if to hint that whatever those words meant to us, mean nothing to the rest of life. That our lives mean less in the big picture than what we define our lives with.After the three drawings a mountain is generated. With a holy choir note in the background, the user is spoken to. “You are mountain.” says the game “You are God.”“Please Enjoy Your Time Here.”Then I was left with a mountain.MountainIn what seems like an endless endeavor, Mountain rotates in an empty space.With time, day and night will pass, Fall will turn to Winter, and Spring will dry into Summer. Rain will wash down the slopes of Mountain and winds will ruffle the trees growing on the sides.Every once in a while Mountain will think. With a pleasant note, a thought appears on the top of the screen. But this thought is seems empty. It is almost, meaningless in the grand scheme of things. The thoughts of Mountain are small compared to what the situation is.These thoughts are a connection to the daily life of Man. How our small opinions have no real impact on the world around us. When Mountain speaks the thoughts are comments on its current position in the universe.However I would be wrong if I said that all of Mountain’s thoughts are transparent.Some comments paint the grim reality of many people.“Why am I alone?”“I don’t really know what I am”“What Am I? Are you part of me too?” These thoughts appear in between the comments on the warm Spring sun and on the bright blue sky.After observing these more meta-physical questions, the normal thoughts are shown in a new light. It leads to one thinking that these thoughts are all that there is in life, that in an empty and endless world our voice is the only existential connection to our being.But this is idea is quickly brushed away. Maybe there is something else to remind us of our being.Maybe materialistic entities can be our connection to ourselves.So every once in a while, about as often as Mountain thinks, an item falls onto Mountain.The item has no meaning. It just lands onto Mountain, and sits alongside it for the rest of eternity. Some of these items are references to previous works by O’Reilly.Early in my experience I was pleased to learn that pressing different keys caused a different musical note to play. If played in specific orders, those resembling main melodies to famous pieces of music, an effect will happen. The connection of the action done and the song is up for interpretation, and can be seen differently by different people. The combinations so far act as entertainment, but to each person his own analysis of the music.Besides musical tones played at the users command, there are ambient sounds to accompany the experience. Crickets at night and the sound of wind create a mood of relaxation and peace. This harmony is the true experience of peace for most of our lives, or to many, the external façade of peace, a mask of stress and pain. The calmness is almost surreal in this context.After a random amount of time, Mountain will end.The player can force it with the musical tone aforementioned, and a randomly generated object will collide with Mountain, ending it (It is said however, that with spamming musical notes, this can be avoided, almost as if we can postpone death with meaningless, or to some, meaningful, noise).Or Mountain will reach a more natural ending. And a message will appear describing the death of Mountain.The message can be natural, that Mountain was ruined by a passing sun.Other deaths are less natural, that I, Mountain, died to Rupert, The Bringer of Ice.In essence, Mountain is an experience, not a game.An Experience that is unique, special, and a reflection of who we are.

												I'm sorry but the update sucks..Why are there achievements? This game seems to become a competition on how to get 100% the fastet way. Thought it is supposed to be relaxing.After the update, Mountain is unenjoyable. Don't buy this game. It is complete garbage now.			"

												I know a lot of people will just hate this, because it's not your expectation of a game.It's more of an artsy film in the format of a video game than a game per se.It has an obvious philosophical flavour to it and mainly poses the question: ''What is it like to be the world, to be mountain?''It's worth what it's worth. Keep in mind they're asking for one buck. "

This review is created for  My Curation Page.   I received this game for free, however, my review is unbiased You are Mountain. You are god.Mountain is a strange product on Steam. Note I said the word ""product"", not ""game.This product is not a game. ""Mountain"" is an experience.GameplayFor the very low price of $1.09, I highly recommend you purchase it. Mountain is not a game where you actively participate, instead you keep it running in the background, or perhaps as a fancy wallpaper. There are 2 ways you can interact with your Mountain. You can:A) Spin in around in circles.B) Use your keyboard as a piano. There are many guides on how to make your own music.As you run Mountain in your background, occasionally switching back to the Mountain window to inspect any changes, you will notice trinkets that have crashed into your mountain, such as a plane, or perhaps a ball. However, if you don't give your mountain enough attention, such as occasionally playing a few random notes, or spinning your mountain, you will notice the trinkets you amassed over the hours begin to disappear off your island, as mysteriously and quickly as they arrived.The next ""obstacle"" you may come across is a ""meteorite"" hurtling across the vast emptiness of space, directly at your mountain. There are 2 possible outcomes: You play a jumble of random notes and evade the impending doom, or accept your fate and watch on in horror as your mountain is obliterated into nothingness.Final ThoughtsIn conclusion, Mountain is a great product on Steam, and if you are looking for something new and different, look no further then Mountain. Observe your mountain change and amass a collection of trinkets. Pros of Mountain:Relaxing AtmosphereNo skill requiredFancy WallpaperAmass a collection of trinkets for hoarders all over the EarthCasual ""Gaming""Interesting experienceCons:No music (You must create your own)Very limited action (The only action is the ""meteorite"" that comes once in a blue moon)Will become old VERY fast6/10Enjoy the review?

												8.2/10 - Mountain is more than meets the eye!You don't need VR to enjoy this game; but I definitely look forward to trying this game again when I get a good setup. This is more of a passive game which you sit back and watch the wonders of your mountain evolve and diminish. The keys are musical notes that will trigger special events. If you aren't going through some of the 20+ codes then you are really missing out! I highly recommend the Annihilation trigger.Worth the $0.99! I can't wait to try with VR.

												""Mountain"" is not a game. It should have been produced as a screensaver, because that is what this is. It shows a mountain on the screen, which slowly rotates, while sun comes up and goes down and sometimes weather changes. You may type things on the keyboard, but the only effect is that after you typed a period, a random sentence is shown at the top of the screen. You may use the keyboard to play the piano, which is the best feature of this program.I have heard some people rave about ""Mountain"". I have no idea why. It is less interactive than a Tamagotchi. I let the program run for over an hour, and absolutely nothing happened. Controls there are none.Do I recommend ""Mountain""? Here's the thing: it is excellent for what it tries to be, so if what you are looking for is a screensaver that you can watch and contemplate, then ""Mountain"" is a great choice. But if you want to play a game, then by all that is holy give it a miss. It isn't worth the 99ct asking price,I do understand that if you wait really, really long, you might see a random object impact your mountain. But that did not happen within an hour, so I killed the mountain by launching a meteorite. At least something happened.			"

												I was there floating in space, going through the wonders of fall. I loved watching my leaves change. Out of nowhere, a large object speeds towards me. ""Mother of God"", I shouted. After building a shield of melodies, it continued to move closer to my mountain. It penetrated my tightly knit landmass, and stayed there. The object was a fork. THis was my only friend, I never thought I would meet any friends in space. We laughed at eachother, but then we got in a small fight. I crate had landed on the other side of me, and the fork did not like him. I decided that they needed to get along. I pushed the fork from my dirt, and moved him to the crate. Whilst moving him, I hit the wrong melody key, and lost all strength in my meditation. The fork fell from my theoretical grasp, and into space. He floated for days until I could no longer see him. Now all I have is a crate.Also, please add co-op in which two people can watch the same mountain, and play the keyboard together.			"

												Is this game worth your precious time? Yes and No. Look, this game is cheap and if you just have some cents left in your account, you should buy it. Don't expect much of the game since it's pretty much just a relaxing game where you observe your mountain and random stuff pass by, attach, and weather changing. I was sick when I bought this and what I did was I left my computer on the whole day and every once in a while, I would come back and check what would happen. And hey, if you're bored, just play piano keys with your keyboard!			"

												山 顾名思义,一种自然环境，地理面貌。这游戏节奏很慢，也没有强烈的目标性，就是看着你的山一点一点完整起来，但是我觉得这个游戏带给我们的并不是单纯的喜+1。也许从游戏内容角度上来说，这游戏非常简单，挂机看景色变化，等待不同物体的出现，然后输入输入作弊码让天下下桃心之类的...但是我觉得其实这游戏最关键的部分在于一开始让你画出的3幅图画上！如果说人类的思想是创造的根源，那其实你所谓的天马行空，也是离不开你本身的所见所闻，而无限发散的。而这游戏所造成的影响，就是暗示了...暗示着你画的图案跟山的构成，物品的种类密不可分；暗示着一切的发生都是因果循环...正所谓道生一，一生二，二生三，三生万物也不过如此。三张图定型了一座山的发展也不再显得那么突兀。也有人把这个游戏上升到洗脑神教的层面了,我觉得怎么说，这种类型的游戏很少，大家喜欢就好，如果山能在你心中成为一片净土，又有什么不可以呢？！人家刚刚被我大山教洗脑了，所以一点都不萌萌哒，大家不要介意！！嗬嗬嗬嗬,所以，综上所述！我的结论就是买！买！买！			"

												This game is an existential crisis simulator. The only real control you have over this mountain is to smash the keys on your keyboard to make noise (or music if you're so inclined - I think you could play most of Claire de Lune if you were skilled enough), which has the effect of making time move faster. You spin faster and seasons come and go in seconds. But what is the point? What meaning does time have to you? You're just an immortal lump of space rock, slowly acquiring meaningless knick-knacks. Time is endless and without purpose to you, so despite being able to control time, you still can't control your life. That being said though, this game bored the hell out of me. It's definitely much more than a screensaver, but that doesn't make it any more entertaining than one.  7/10			"

You go up, but not to heaven, why would you go to heaven when there is Mountain? You drift through the cosmos alone, but you are not alone, Mountain is watching you. You call to Mountain, and Mountain comes to you. You hug Mountain, Mountain hugs back. You become part of Mountain. Mountain is you, you are Mountain. Mountain has never left.

												The Mountain is a strange thing. I wouldn't consider this a game. I suppose it's a ""simulation"" with random events happening. It's a bare minimum of a thing. However, it's something that I assume is meant to just stay on the side as you do something else. The game is very light and even on my 6 year old laptop, it's running perfectly fine with all the effects. I can easily watch Youtube at 720p while the game keeps going. I think it's just a thing tha is a side activity. Keep it running, check it out from time to time and see what happens in it. It's not so bad really. A very strange hipster kind of application but alright. And it's very cheap, why complain? "

												This game is soothing, not something you play, not something you try to win, or end up losing.When I picked it up, it was nothing more than a waste of space in my library, never played it, but I decided to try it out, and when I did, man was I wrong about it being a waste of space. It made me happy watching my mountain go through the seasons, or see items falling down onto it, the atmosphere made it feel like it was alive, seeing my mountain think made me happy, it would have sad days, or happy days, but in the end - it was my mountain.Pick this game up if you need something to help relax.

												This game has a rich and deep storyline. It is an amazing game that words can't describe. It explores the deep secrets of life. It makes you question reality. Who are you? Why do you exist? What are we? I've been searching for a good game to actually play. I have been getting bored of most games. Too much tf2 and Csgo. I need a new game. Mountain is that game. Mountain is amazing. You just have to play the games to understand. I have been going through depression and didn't know what to do with my life. But this game saved me. It saved me from everything. I had almost choked. But this game came in and gave me cpr. This game saved my life. This is the best thing to ever come into existance. This game can do everything and has the answer for everything. It cured my Grandpa's kidney stones. It cured my dad's smoking habits. It cured my Asian eye problem. It cured my sister's hearing problem. It cured my mom's cancer. This game had brought me and my family closer together. I don't think I can thank this game enough. Even though I don't have that many hours in this game, I think this is just the start of an amazing and beautiful future. But the question is.Do I reccomend this game? Yes. I give it 30 tf2's out of 10 csgo's. It is that good.			"

												A wise man named William Shatner once said “Why do I climb the mountain? Because I’m in love!” I understand these profound words more than ever, it’s all clear now as I watch the indolent mountain spin and the rain come and go. My deepest urges to climb, hug and envelop that mountain and yet it cannot be … this embrace is but an illusion. No matter how hard I try to be near you I am but pushed further back into the stratosphere to watch you from afar. You speak to me and I listen to your sweet harmonics yet I cannot answer back, no words can answer your call … yet still I heed.So you may be asking why? Why do I continue to watch the mountain? It’s simple.Because I’m in love.			"

												I used to be an adventurer like you, then I took a copy of Mountain from a friend.At first when getting it installed, I was shocked by how fast it was done. It was superfast, only 1 hour. (You can't imagine how I am tortured when getting other games installed.) And like a miracle after I click the ""PLAY"" button it only takes 4 secs for the game to start. So it must be a good choice for those whose PC or Internet environment is not so good.While the required space of Mountain is only 200MB+, it features tremendous in-game contents. And thanks to the awesome producer for not selling DLCs so we can enjoy all of it costing only 1 USD.Its graphics always make me bewildered (in a good sense). During the xx hours playing Mountain I never get bored and I will keep playing it until I reach my, let me say, sixties. Just watch some videos of this game (I'm quite sure there are a bunch of them out there), you can find those beautiful twinkle fireflies, mighty peaceful pine trees, howling freezing blizzard (actually there's no sound effect for the snow, just imagine it in your brain), and stuff.Everything is modified delicately to make this game so perfect. In my life so far, I've only got a similar feeling when watching a legendary Japanese artisan doing his works. This game is trying to lay out to gamers the beauty of the wonderful nature and humanity. No wonder many friends of mine just told me that their minds were purified and enlightened through meditation right in front of this game.However, what attracts me most is that it has a in-game 16-tone virtual instrument. Comfortably sit back and hit your keyboard and you will feel like playing a real instrument. Personally I strongly recommend the game company release a VST version of this game so that gamers could produce music by simply applying it to their DAW/DTM.Mountain randomly gives out background sounds, useful items and important comments to the gamer, so it's also interesting to watch your mountain revolving while waiting it to have some new changes.Until now I haven't got this game cleared once. I have no idea about how to finish the game, either. But I'll let it go.I can still recall what the game said in the first place:　　　YOU ARE MOUNTAIN. Yes, I am mountain and I am this endless universe. I'll just keep on playing Mountain and playing as a mountain. So maybe by and by the game will end someday, and that will be the end of my boring life.			"

												Honestly in my opinion you shouldn't waste your money on this game. I really don't see why it's even on the Steam frontpage slideshow and even for 1$ I expected some basic functionality like sculpting , but you're really just sitting there playing away at a keyboard and hoping for seasons to change. Conclusion , shouldn't be a thing on Steam but for 1$ you can only complain so much , better games deserve that slideshow screentime though. 0/10 would not Mountain again.			"

												This game creates an incredibly immersive experience. For a few blissful hours I actually believed I was a mountain floating serenely through space, playing the piano. Eventually I realized playing the piano involves the use of fingers, which mountains inherently do not have, and once again I became aware of my humanity. I've laughed, cried, bled, sweat, hiccuped, and undergone still many more bodily functions all while playing through this life-changing game.			"

Not because its Bad, nor because its such an amazing game its not funny. it just took me away... emersed me in something strange and calming yet quirky and happy... iv sat there so far for an hour streight and i cant take my eyes of the mountain... iv also taught my self how to play the song 'stay' (pretty limitedly). i also sat there for 20 minuts listening to the darkness of space when zoomed out as far as posible... this game scares me for resons i dont know, most likely because im afraid of what i and others alike will come across or emagine during the game play... get this game... watch it... live it... play music... become it... because if you dont, someone els will. i wrote this whole thing wile Squinting and with a beer next to me completely untouched... i recommend mountain.

												Mountain makes me feel something that I cannot describe. If you need to think about buying this game, don't buy it. It wasn't meant for you. The only time in which it is appropriate to buy Mountain is if the game finds you. I was gifted this game by a friend, and I, in turn, gifted it to several friends, hoping to help extend the reaches of this experience. Every once in a while, a message will appear at the top of the screen, and what it says varies every time. But I'll tell you, when that message appears is when you will get that feeling that I could not describe. The lonesome messages will make you feel like crying, I am sure of that.You can't play Mountain, because it isn't a game. Its an emotional rollercoaster that never moves but never stops taking you places.  "

												Now, there's not really much to this, but I'd still recommend it. First thing: gameplay is almost non-existant, so I'll refrain from calling this a game.The visuals of this program are pretty impressive, even if they are simple at times. On the lowest settings (which I usually use since my computer isn't really a ""gaming"" computer), it almost looks like a watercolour painting that you can interact with.As I said before, gameplay is lacking. What isn't, in my opinion, is sound. Users can make music with the keyboard, and can play around with it to make or recreate little songs. Some specific songs give interesting effects or filters to the world, like raining blood or frogs, or even ""snowglobe mode.""I'd say it's a neat little program and deserves a place in anyone's library, especially if they enjoy just sitting around and watching things change around them. A lot like Viridi, but without the daily upkeep that it needed.			"

												Mountain is an experimental artistic game. It doesn’t have gameplay, story or even genre. You get to be a mountain, you can play the piano with your keyboard and some songs unlock events and Easter Eggs.As time passes by, the seasons change, oh and you get hit by objects that get stuck within you. Not sure how many, but I've been hit by a plane, a paper plane, a beach ball, an umbrella, a giant skull and a lot of other random stuff.It's not going to change the industry, but if most developers started thinking outside the box, like David O'Reilly did here, we could finally play something really new. I mean, no genre, not gameplay, no standard. Only different and new.Seems I was quoted by PC Gamer[web.archive.org], I feel humbled.★★★★☆ | Liked it------------------------------Old ReviewMountain is a game in its roots. It doesn’t have all those preconceptions of what a game should be or have, it tried something totally new. When you read 'game' you usually think on graphics, gameplay, story and genre. But a game shouldn’t necessarily have those; games are ways of entertainment. There's no rule saying it should have good graphics, any story at all or even controls, as long as it entertains people. This game has no story, no controls, not genre. It's an experiment made to entertain without those, and I found it, personally, entertaining. It’s not going to change the industry, but if most developers started thinking outside the box, like David O'Reilly did here, we could finally play something really new.As for those looking for gameplay, play the pianno (you can play a pianno with your keyboard in the game), something might happen.

Game over.  You don't play it you set up a random seed and watch it evolve over time on a space monitor.  Occassionally you hear a faint ping followed by a thought from the mountain.  That's right, your mountain talks.  Not too much, mostly likes to sit there in silence.  Perhaps it's trying to be a good listener too?  Perhaps it's just pretending to be listening?

												This is an interesting experiment. it really isnt a game per se, but it is well worth the dollar you will spend on it. It is as the title says....a Mountain, which is a god, a single great entity, and being that is finding a sense for itself and asking the basic questions beings ask themselves...why am I, who am I, am I alone, and so on. While this is happening, weather changes, day and night cycles, and random objects crash into its surface. You can use the keyboard to craft/play songs, many of which unlock various weather and artifact features, thoughts, and so on. I recommend leaving this game open and checking on it every so often to see what it is doing and has done while you were away.When you grow weary of it, you can destroy your mountain, wipe its surface clean, or whatever.This is something people should be experiencing. A simple and yet deep experience.10/10 "

												Changed my life in more ways than one. I don't want to go anywhere or do anything because I just want the Mountain. I went out and bought a 1,200 USD laptop to play the Mountain on. I have heard that this game brings the most joy when played at 3000 FPS. I installed a large battery bank into my car for the low price of only 3000 USD. Why would I need something like that in my car? The answer is quite simple really so that my laptop can always be charging to play the Mountain. You may ask, ""Why is that you only have 23 hours in the game but have dedicated this much time and effort to play the Mountain""? The answer, again, is really quite simple, jimmy. The game is such a rush that I have to control the amount I'm exposed to it. I'm afraid I may become addicted to this masterpiece and end up in a rehab. I'm already getting looks from people because I had to stop paying rent to pay for the battery, car, and laptop. I live in my car now, but don't feel sorry for me;feel sorry for yourself because you haven't felt the rush that this game offers.20/10			"

												This is not a ""game"" at all. It is a joke. I mean that literally. It is a joke on all of us, and I fell for it.We have a stupid, meaningless introduction, then a disjointed mountain, spinning in space, with some mystical atmosphere about it. The graphics are horrible. Throw in a random, nonsensical, useless quote or a random string of text once in awhile. Aaaaand... That's pretty much it.Basically, you could crap in a plastic bag and create as much value and worth as this ""game"". Actually, that would be an improvement, because no one would waste their time or money on your creation, unlike this ""game"".""Leave it running."" Sure, but do note it takes several hundred MB of RAM and no small amount of CPU time.The AppData folder and registry key created by this game are named ""Trash"". That's absolutely appropriate.I wish there weren't so many idiots who desperately tried expressing how clever they are by creating sarcastic, ironic, or otherwise insincere ""reviews"".I paid $0.66 and still feel ripped off. I guess the joke's on me.			"

												Most of the people I meet on Steam don't remember the 90's too well or are children but back then people were obsessed with screensavers, useful programs that prevented CRT phosphor burn-in. Once in a while you had some naive user download a malicious program under the guise of a screensaver, unaware elders and parents would fall for this not knowing the danger and next thing you know, you'd have your family screaming about thousands of dollars in charges on their Visa card originating from some former Communist country which causes the bank to close your account and force you or your loved ones on the street.This ladies and gentlemen better have been the screensaver that screwed them over.TL;DR: It's not a game but screen candy and ain't half bad at being so.

You open it, and you let it sit there. And Mountain does whatever mountains do.When I first started the game, I thought it was cool, a neat idea. A game that plays itself, something that you have no interaction with. It runs in the background, and you forget about it. Then you hear a *ping*. You look back to the window and it has a thought. Nothing big, but something to keep you interested. ""I could write a book about this pitch black night."" is an example.You become attached to Mountain. It becomes your mountain.

												Those saying that this is a game are correct, Mountain is an experience. Not a game.Taking on the adventure of Mountain observation, where occasionally something happens but mostly nothing does is a task that should not be taken lightly. You will find yourself quickly becoming protective of your Mountain, caring for it and comparing it to other peoples Mountains having heated arguments over whose Mountain is better and who knows and truly understands their Mountain the most. Its nothing short of live-changing.This is the best thing that I have ever purchased, my life is fInally found a purpose. Thank you Mountain.			"

The accurate representation of the mountain and the change of climates and seasons are so realistic, its as if you were actually there, slowly rotating around it. I give this game a 10/10			"

												Those saying that this is a game are correct, Mountain is an experience. Not a game.Taking on the adventure of Mountain observation, where occasionally something happens but mostly nothing does is a task that should not be taken lightly. You will find yourself quickly becoming protective of your Mountain, caring for it and comparing it to other peoples Mountains having heated arguments over whose Mountain is better and who knows and truly understands their Mountain the most. Its nothing short of live-changing.This is the best thing that I have ever purchased, my life is fInally found a purpose. Thank you Mountain.			"

												Mountain is a wonderful game man. Sometimes i can get really angry you know? When i play this game, i can never help but smile and feel happy. Most of the time i take the game for granted but when i reach deep down i know that without this game i would not be the person i am today. Honestly some of my most life changing moments were a result from me playing this game and having a realization. Purity would be the best word i can define this game as for it is not only a game but a part of you that you can access in a virtual way. The subtle sound of waves and wind in the in game sounds help me with my relaxation of my body. Knowing that i have this game at my disposal only makes me cherish it more because of the fact that there will never be another groundbreaking game like this. The simple aspect of the mountain in the sky opens up a ♥♥♥♥ing plentiful of eyeopening and astonishing thoughts that i have never experienced in my life before. Without extending this review to an uncalled for extent i would just hope that you people out there with any type of lifestyle ranging from happy to sad should definitely buy this game. Please have a wonderful day and enjoy the simpler things in life. Amen. I love you.			"

												A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges.High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level. These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystem of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals. Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction and recreation, such as mountain climbing.The highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia, whose summit is 8,849.868 m (29,035 ft) above mean sea level. The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171 m (69,459 ft).DefinitionThe Matterhorn, Swiss AlpsDôme du GoûterThere is no universally accepted definition of a mountain. Elevation, volume, relief, steepness, spacing and continuity have been used as criteria for defining a mountain. In the Oxford English Dictionary a mountain is defined as ""a natural elevation of the earth surface rising more or less abruptly from the surrounding level and attaining an altitude which, relatively to the adjacent elevation, is impressive or notable.""Whether a landform is called a mountain may depend on local usage. The highest point in San Francisco, California, is called Mount Davidson, notwithstanding its height of 300 m (980 ft), which makes it twenty feet short of the minimum for a mountain by American designations.[citation needed] Similarly, Mount Scott outside Lawton, Oklahoma is only 251 m (823 ft) from its base to its highest point. Whittow's Dictionary of Physical Geography states ""Some authorities regard eminences above 600 m (2,000 ft) as mountains, those below being referred to as hills.""In the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic, a mountain is usually defined as any summit at least 2,000 feet (or 610 metres) high, whilst the official United Kingdom government's definition of a mountain, for the purposes of access, is a summit of 600 metres or higher. In addition, some definitions also include a topographical prominence requirement, typically 100 or 500 feet (30 or 152 m). For a while, the US defined a mountain as being 1,000 feet (300 m) or taller. Any similar landform lower than this height was considered a hill. However, today, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) concludes that these terms do not have technical definitions in the US.The UN Environmental Programme's definition of ""mountainous environment"" includes any of the following:    Elevation of at least 2,500 m (8,200 ft);    Elevation of at least 1,500 m (4,900 ft), with a slope greater than 2 degrees;    Elevation of at least 1,000 m (3,300 ft), with a slope greater than 5 degrees;    Elevation of at least 300 m (980 ft), with a 300 m (980 ft) elevation range within 7 km (4.3 mi).Using these definitions, mountains cover 33% of Eurasia, 19% of South America, 24% of North America, and 14% of Africa. As a whole, 24% of the Earth's land mass is mountainous.GeologyMain articles: Mountain formation and List of mountain typesJeff Davis Peak seen from the glacier-carved summit of Wheeler Peak, NevadaThere are three main types of mountains: volcanic, fold, and block. All three types are formed from plate tectonics: when portions of the Earth's crust move, crumple, and dive. Compressional forces, isostatic uplift and intrusion of igneous matter forces surface rock upward, creating a landform higher than the surrounding features. The height of the feature makes it either a hill or, if higher and steeper, a mountain. Major mountains tend to occur in long linear arcs, indicating tectonic plate boundaries and activity.VolcanoesMain article: VolcanoGeological cross-section of Fuji volcanoVolcanoes are formed when a plate is pushed below another plate, or at a mid-ocean ridge or hotspot. At a depth of around 100 km, melting occurs in rock above the slab (due to the addition of water), and forms magma that reaches the surface. When the magma reaches the surface, it often builds a volcanic mountain, such as a shield volcano or a stratovolcano. Examples of volcanoes include Mount Fuji in Japan and Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. The magma does not have to reach the surface in order to create a mountain: magma that solidifies below ground can still form dome mountains, such as Navajo Mountain in the United States.Fold mountainsMain article: Fold mountainsFold mountains occur when two plates collide: shortening occurs along thrust faults and the crust is overthickened. Since the less dense continental crust ""floats"" on the denser mantle rocks beneath, the weight of any crustal material forced upward to form hills, plateaus or mountains must be balanced by the buoyancy force of a much greater volume forced downward into the mantle. Thus the continental crust is normally much thicker under mountains, compared to lower lying areas. Rock can fold either symmetrically or asymmetrically. The upfolds are anticlines and the downfolds are synclines: in asymmetric folding there may also be recumbent and overturned folds. The Jura Mountains are an example of fold mountains.Block mountainsMain article: Block mountainsThe Catskills are a dissected plateau.Block mountains are caused by faults in the crust: a seam where rocks can move past each other. When rocks on one side of a fault rise relative to the other, it can form a mountain. The uplifted blocks are block mountains or horsts. The intervening dropped blocks are termed graben: these can be small or form extensive rift valley systems. This form of landscape can be seen in East Africa, the Vosges, the Basin and Range province of Western North America and the Rhine valley. These areas often occur when the regional stress is extensional and the crust is thinned.ErosionMain article: ErosionDuring and following uplift, mountains are subjected to the agents of erosion (water, wind, ice and gravity) which gradually wear the uplifted area down. Erosion causes the surface of mountains to be younger than the rocks that form the mountains themselves. Glacial processes produce characteristic landforms, such as pyramidal peaks, knife-edge arêtes, and bowl-shaped cirques that can contain lakes. Plateau mountains, such as the Catskills, are formed from the erosion of an uplifted plateau.ClimateMain article: Alpine climateA mountain in Carbon County, UtahThe Rockies - Valley of the Ten PeaksClimate on mountains become colder at high elevations, due to the way that the sun heats the surface of the Earth. The sun warms the ground directly, while the greenhouse effect acts as a blanket, reflecting heat back towards the Earth that would otherwise be lost to space. The greenhouse effect thus keeps the air at low elevations warm. As elevation increases, there is less greenhouse effect, so the ambient temperature goes down. "

There is no interaction, save a musical keyboard, and I've yet to see any random events.

												When I feel angry, ashame, shy, mad, uncomfortable, I'd just click the client and close my eyes, try to feel every singe note floating on my fingers.  I don't know much about piano, but I really enjoy it. The Floating Life Is Just Like Water Under Ice.   When I was a child, My parents moved to a new place for their jobs, so I just went to a new school. I was not that kind of people who are good at making friends and a student in my class freaking hated me. He told everybody to isolated me just because that I was fat and my scores were bad. It was a stupid reason but students in my class thought that was funny so they started to isolated me. I pretended like I don't care about them so I went to school alone and left school alone. By the way I had a elder brother but he thought I am fat and nerd so he didn't wanna play with me.       I was sad and I felt I was a loser. I even wanted to suicide. But nobody knows cause I always pretended I was a happy guy and I told my parents that I made a lot of friends in my school. But in fact, I cried after everybody went to sleep.       After my freshman year in high school, we had 2 months of summer holiday so my parents sent me to a summer school which was located in a small town in England called Hastings. It was actually great because I went there with my father's friend's relates. In the camp I met a girl from Ukraine. She was beautiful, but I was just an fat and ugly boy and I didn't dare to talk to her. We were in different summer camps but our schedules was same (Which means we would meet everyday). I REALLY wanted to talk with her  but I was shy and I got no balls so I just pretended like I had never know her.      But in the summer camp everybody treated me nice and I talked a lot to my friends. I became a out-going person after I went to the camp. It really changed my life. After the camp I thought "" I MUST LOSE SOME GOD DAMN WEIGHT"", so that I started to go to the gym and whenever I wanted to ""Take a rest"" or give up. I always inspired myself：“U freaking fat♥♥♥♥♥ stand up and keep working hard"". And the reason was quite immature:Ï wanna be a handsome and muscle man, then I'd just go and find the girl.    I made it. Not only I became a guy with perfect body with strong muscle, also my GPA reached 3.9 and I went to a really nice university. At that time I bought this game, just like what I said in the beginning, I played it when I felt bad and when I think about my goddess. I really tho a lot of things, but finally I am now going great and two weeks ago, I went to Ukraine and I wanna find the girl.( I knew which block do she live, I didn't stalk her or what, I got these informations from her facebook.   25/6, I will never forget this day. I went to Sumy, Ukraine and I took a taxi to the block she lives in. It was like 7 or 8 o' clock. I walked on the street and I saw a view that I'd never forget.  She dressed like a sex worker and she was like waiting someone on the street. I saw a lot of girls who dressed almost the same as her. I knew what exactly was goin' on. She became a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.   I knew that was her, she looked just like her photos on facebook.   I went back to the hotel and I felt despair. I opened my computer and I saw Mountain, I clicked the client like what I did when I felt bad. I started to close my eyes and trynna calm down. Suddenly I heard a blare and I opened my eyes. I saw my mountain got destoried by meteorites just like my heart got tore apart when I saw my dream girl became a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥.  Mountain isn't a normal game. It's more like epitome of my life. Like a tomb of my love.			"

												This is definately not a game. It is a work of art. However, like all art, it doesn't strike everyone's fancy. If you have an appreciation for art, I don't see why you shouldn't take a look at this. Otherwise, this is probably not worth the effort. I honestly don't see what's really that special about this... but hey, that's my opinion, not yours.			"

												Let's be clear here: a lot of people are not going to like this game.  Many won't even consider it a game.  But whether Mountain is a ""game"" or whether it's worth $0.99 isn't important.  It doesn't matter if there's a lot to do, or nothing to do, or whether there's even a point to whole thing.  And some of you will probably think this review is just as meaningless.  ""It's just a bunch of existential nonsense.  This game is stupid and you're stupid.""  Well that's okay, because I like this game.  Mountain is for me what it can only be for ME.  It's beautiful, relaxing, thought-provoking.  It's powerful.  It's moving.  But most important... Mountain merely ""is.""  There is you, there is the mountain.  You are the mountain.  And if that isn't enough for you, then that's fine.  But I implore you to really try to experience what you've purchased before rushing to judgment.  Because in the end, the Mountain doesn't care what you think of it.  And neither should you.			"

												everyone that doesnt understand this game is just something to watch grow over time so if you are shallow its prob not the game for you if you can actully be greatful for the small things and like to see your own personal mountain change over time which is a different experience everytime you play then you should get it and for the people that are like ""this game aint worth the dollar is spent on it"" they are too ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a person to instead say something like hey this game isnt my cup of tea but atleast my money is being donated to help someone else out this game is awesome yes its mostly a screen saver but its a good one i normally just open this game up in the background of other games and its awsome to get to see my mountain grow and develop over time and change differently everytime i play ive never got two mountains that were the same some people just need to learn to be more greatful instead of being a idiot and complaining because you read the reviews and bought it because you thought it was going to be a interactive expereince how about you grow a brain cell just one please thats all you should need in order to realize hey if im going to ♥♥♥♥♥ about a game that was cheaper than anything off the dollar menu at the fast food places then maybe i should watch a review of it on the youtube and guess what using youtube and watching videos is 100% free and then you have those people that say whos going to pay for my electricity and internet and to that i say if you have the internet to download the game then you not only have the eletric but you have the internet that youd need for youtube also if you are really that shallow that you feel the need to complain about the graphics then i hope you are blind or are mentally disabled other wise tyou must be truly brain dead because theres frickin pictures of the ""graphics"" of the game when you buy it like damn if youre looking for a game with good graphics go get it dont expect good graphics from a game thats under a dollar seriously are you that dumb that you cant look at the damn picture then you must be truly idiotic this game is about 95% experice and like 1% graphics this game is supossed to be relaxing and for people who like to see things change and develop over time not for people who want some crazy graphicly intence game			"

												While yes the game is cheap and looks like one of those cool games with a pet you raise (or in this case a mountain), its actually not really a game you can do much with. You'd think there would be at least some sort of interaction other than answering questions in the beginning but no, all you get to do is turn the camera around the mountain or zoom out.I get that some people may like this sort of game but there's nothing to really do with it and you can find a thousand of these for free on your smartphone. So for the reasons said above I have to say I do not recommend this game. Though I do give them credit that players can put a lot of time into the game.Gameplay1/10Originality3/10Replayability6/10			"

												There's no reason for debate over whether or not this is a game, so let's get that out of the way, first. A game is a form of play or sport, usually competitive, involving rules that is decided by skill, strength, or luck. Mountain involves none of these things. This should not detract from what it is and not everything developed with tools often used to make games needs to be a game.That aside, here is what you can expect from Mountain:When you launch it, you are asked to draw a few things on the screen with your mouse, to generate a random seed with which your mountain will be generated. After that, you will watch your mountain (a hunk of earth floating in outer space) spin slowly around. Sometimes the weather will change and foliage will change. Sometimes, an item will land on the mountain, like a ball, lollipop, jet engine, ladies shoes, or umbrella. Every so often, the mountain will say something to you, like ""I feel at one with the universe, tonight"".After a bunch of hours, something happens. I don't know what it is, because I fell asleep. When it hit about the 20th hour, it started making a ton of noise and went to a ""game over"" screen.Essentially, Mountain is what used to be considered a demo. A little program that someone would have distributed on a floppy disk for free -- or maybe sold for fifty cents at the local nicotine-filled hacker-computer-shop that we haven't seen much of since the mid 90s. It doesn't really do anything; you don't either. You just look at it until it stops. You can make the screen small and stick it in the corner of your screen, if you like.So, would I recommend it? I wouldn't say it is garbage, by any means. If it seems like something you might be interested in and you buy it with the understanding that there's no game involved and you wont' be doing anything, then it is hard to complain about it costing a dollar -- which is absolutely the right price for this tiny curiosity. Therefore, with those reservations, I'd give this a recommendation.			"

												A mix of thriller and an mmorpg (potential wow-killer), Mountain covers the life of Mountain, from birth to ultimate annihilation. You take care of Mountain by cleaning it, taking out the trash, and help its singing career, which could save it from the apocolypse. In its lows, fish and fire will rain from the sky but if you are good enough, you can make it rain cold hard cash (coins). If you are the type of player who likes to see things burn, lead Mountain to its demise. I would only recommend this game to those willing to put a lot of time and effort into grooming your Mountain into success. Those who only play this shortly without allowing this game's amazing depth and quality influence your life indeed are very poor souls. In my personal experience, it takes several hundred hours with this game to fully experience it.I have only completed Mountain a couple of times in the time I've played, and I hope to get a lot more in the future. I can easily recommend this to anyone willing to sell their souls to the Mountain. 10/10 would sacrifice myself to the mountain again.			"

I realized that I can't make that mistake again.You'll be allowed to run until there's no more mountains to make. No more clouds drifting by, no more omniscient beings tossing random items in your general direction, and you can no longer think of anything to say.Thanks Mountain.Also, it's cool to know that you can lose at Mountain.

Its a bit like CookieClicker, just with a mountain. Its amazing! And addiccting! without even making sense. But honestly, how could I not like that game? there's a freaking sexy mountain in it! -The game is defenetly worth 1€, eh I mean 0,99€, but If you search gameplay then I wouldnt buy it, otherwise: BUUUUUYYY DA SHIAT OUT OF DA MOUNTAIN!

												this might look like a simple screen saver, but it is not. this is a game in which you might want to leave on for a little while, and wait, yes as one of the first things the game even tells you, is ""patience"", so wait more then just 20, yes for some of you, this is hard, if you do find it hard to do so, then do not use the very fair price the game is, for me, it means more then just a basic spinning mountain, it is my mountain, my special gay mountain that snows a lot, and for me, i love it, others, that is for you to say			"

												Amazing game for 0,99€ I first thought the game was a bad joke, until I got that mountain feeling, it makes u feel like a mountain and ur not able to end the game, It somehow is addicting, I dont know why, but I just have to run it the whole time, somehow the game has something deep, that the human brain cannot understand, I dont know why, but that game is awesome. Its a bit like CookieClicker, just with a mountain. Its amazing! And addiccting! without even making sense. But honestly, how could I not like that game? there's a freaking sexy mountain in it! -The game is defenetly worth 1€, eh I mean 0,99€, but If you search gameplay then I wouldnt buy it, otherwise: BUUUUUYYY DA SHIAT OUT OF DA MOUNTAIN!

And I find this perfect to just have displayed on my screen when I have them thoughts. :) Really neat idea. Don't care if it has no controls. Don't care that is has very small interaction, it's just simple and nice. Thanks!			"

												This game makes you say phrases which you would have never thought could be said in any context ever. ""Oh no, there's a pickaxe in my Icecream-cone!"" ""My mountain seems to use his teeth to play the violin"", ""Seems like there's a fan stuck between my brains"", ""Oh my god, a HUUUUGE telephone crushed my meteor-forest"" or ""Hit me gramophone! Hit me, please - Nooo! Come back, gramophone, come baaack!"".Also, after you spent some time with your mountain, you really feel connected to it. I named mine Bjørg (which is somewhat similar to the german ""Berg"", which means ""mountain"") and I already created a [OMGIJUSTGOTHITBYAGIANTLIGHTBULBTHISISTHEBESTDAYOFMYLIFE] folder to document my best moments with Bjørg. So far there is ""Bjørgplayinginthesnow.png"" and ""Bjørdsmilinglikeanangel.png"" in there.The only thing I'm sorta missing would be a Multimountainmode, where you can come over to a friends mountain and let your mountain talk to your friends mountain for a while. You know, them kids have to learn from others of their kind. Maybe they'll fall in love, crush into each other and become a mothermountain with two tops which are eventually going to draw smaller mountains into their orbit which have some similar genes and what not. You know, the full potential of this just hasn't been reached yet.I highly recommend playing this game with some friends, you're gonna fun the hell out of it (for reals, a bunch of people in a skype-call, all playing this game for several hours is something that happened last night).

												This is probably the realest, most advanced, highest quality mountain simulator that money can buy. You start off as a pebble of a mountain, but with hard work and dedication, you can grow into a beautfiul, 3d, floating piece of glory. I highly reccommend people to buy this and believe in the powers and wonders of the mountain. In addition to its glorious features, it has the ability to predict weather patterns in your life. For example. when it began to snow in the mountain, it began to snow outside as well! How advanced! The creator must have an application within the program to fetch weather data from some meteorology website. In conclusion, this game will liven up your day, and will defintely fulfill your needs of a realistic mountain simulator.			"

												Although my gametime on this particularly clever game is at a low, I assure you that the hours are soon to be racked up. The beginning of the game made me think of three simple things about life that were more complex than I had ever noticed. The deep thought process along with a blank page gave me an open mind ready to take in something. That something was the meaning of three simple words and then i expressed them with art onto my blank canvas. Afterwards my mountain erupted from seemingly... nothing. It was just there. It was all mine to control, not with controls, but with reason. I felt as if the blank pages that i had spread my deep thoughts on had emerged into something greater. Something self-sufficient. Something that knew where it was headed in the future. Trees began growing. Wind began blowing. Precipitation began falling from the universe around me. At first I was not sure, but now i know.. This mountain is my life, my heart, my soul. It is me taking a journey through the world alone.. just waiting for the next time i experience something greater. Something with more feelings than anything I've ever witnessed.			"

												I got this game yesterday, I didn't really know what to expect. I launched Mountain. My Mountain came to be. I watched MY Mountain. I laughed, I cried, I loved...I hated. While talking to Mountain through musical notes I discovered annihilation. The first time I saved Mountain with not a moment of hesitation. But then I began to torment Mountain. Letting the object of destruction get closer and closer before saving Mountain. As my hatred grew deeper and deeper for Mountain I once again initiated the annihilation sequence a s , z b this time with the intent of ending Mountain once and for all. The object of destruction was beautiful, a massive pulsating eye, it hungered for Mountain. I watched eagerly as the Eye approached, closer and closer it came. Ohhhh how happy I was to finally see Mountain pay, but then something happened. As the Eye was mere seconds away from ending Mountain as I knew Mountain, a single rogue item drifted on to my screen. A heart. I was astounded. Even after all the terrible hatred I vented at Mountain, Mountain loved me. I quickly mashed my keys in an effort to save Mountain and the screen went blank. Through a miracle I had managed to save Mountain. I do not know what happens if you let the object of destruction hit Mountain and I do not plan to find out, nor do I plan to ever see that wretched Eye again. From this day forward I will never stop caring for Mountain, not for even a second. Many of you hate Mountain, but you have not seen the Mountain I know. Live Mountain, be Mountain, and you too shall know Mountain. All you need is patience.			"

												Really enjoyed the game so far. I became a vegatable not too long ago and it is really enjoyable to watch my mountain progress all day. It's slow work but it definitely pays off. If you are thinking of becoming a vegatable in the future I highly suggest buying this game and watching what happens. 10/10 would buy again.""10/10 Best game  of the year"" - Vegatables everywhere			"

												I got this game yesterday, I didn't really know what to expect. I launched Mountain. My Mountain came to be. I watched MY Mountain. I laughed, I cried, I loved...I hated. While talking to Mountain through musical notes I discovered annihilation. The first time I saved Mountain with not a moment of hesitation. But then I began to torment Mountain. Letting the object of destruction get closer and closer before saving Mountain. As my hatred grew deeper and deeper for Mountain I once again initiated the annihilation sequence a s , z b this time with the intent of ending Mountain once and for all. The object of destruction was beautiful, a massive pulsating eye, it hungered for Mountain. I watched eagerly as the Eye approached, closer and closer it came. Ohhhh how happy I was to finally see Mountain pay, but then something happened. As the Eye was mere seconds away from ending Mountain as I knew Mountain, a single rogue item drifted on to my screen. A heart. I was astounded. Even after all the terrible hatred I vented at Mountain, Mountain loved me. I quickly mashed my keys in an effort to save Mountain and the screen went blank. Through a miracle I had managed to save Mountain. I do not know what happens if you let the object of destruction hit Mountain and I do not plan to find out, nor do I plan to ever see that wretched Eye again. From this day forward I will never stop caring for Mountain, not for even a second. Many of you hate Mountain, but you have not seen the Mountain I know. Live Mountain, be Mountain, and you too shall know Mountain. All you need is patience.			"

												This game is the perfect game to be under the casual gaming category, as it is very, very casual. It is (like I have read in many reviews on this game posted before I posted my review about Mountain; so I cite everyone who has said this) a screensaver in a sense. You don't need to touch it. Stuff just happens. That mind as well be the description.""You don't need to touch it or do anything. Stuff just happens."" (which I guess is just a simple summed up version of the description, but still)Plus it is cheap, so why not get it? It has a pleasent art style and is very relaxing to watch what happens to your somehow-though-noone-knows-why floating mountain as it collects the randomness our world has to offer it.I recommend this game because it is relaxing and enjoyable. Plus, if I may say one more thing, I love how the game, under genre, is considered to be a RPG. Lol.			"

												The Game is amazing! You are a giant celestial object, known as a Mountain and your whole purpose is to overcome the cosmic overture that is time. You start out as a mountain, naturally, and you go on through time as, guess what - a mountain. The storyline is amazingly deep and detailed - from the moment you enter the game and create your entity, you can tell that the developers put an insanely large ammount of time into it. I have beat roughly 2% of the game, and I'm still as captivated as ever. None of those fetch quests, or kill x creatures or anything of that sort. These questlines are overflowing with interaction and everything you do (or dont do) affects the overall outcome of the game. I have yet to beat it, talking to the head Mountain atm, he's telling me to go mount in that one place for that one duration... I'll write more when I finish this.			"

												This is as silly of a review as you can get when it comes to a 'game' like this.So I got this game on a whim because I like having background noise to help me focus.   After getting this, i can say that the ambient sounds, are enjoyable and relaxing.   There are a few intersting points about this game as well.   First, there is a built in piano that you can play.   Two, random occuring events will play out in which random items will crash into your mountion.   Three, its only 99 cents so why not buy it?   Four, the mountion has its own 'thoughts', so you have a virtual buddy who talks to you I guess.Overall, this is not a game, but more of an app that aims to relax and please.   There are no controls aside from the mouse, and the piano keys.   Graphics are good enough.   Sounds are pleasing to the ears.  EDIT:  As for April, 20th 2017, Mountain has had a rather sizeable update.  THe graphics have been amped up in a fairly noticeable way, and a lot more junk and sounds for these items, have been added as well.  Plus, achievements and Steam Cards			"

The way it spins and changes with the force of time, it has consumed me. There are not enough words to describe this game. It causes a sense of meaning. It makes you feel like your purpose in life is to be mountain. I cant go a minute without thinking about this game and its complex system of mountainlike activities.

												NOTE: For review with screenshots, please visit http://microfloppy.net/2014/12/06/mountain/Mountain was nominated in the 2014 Game Awards in the category ""Games for Change"".  Don't let yourself be fooled however: It is not a game that can be played. Mountain is a zero player game; an animated wallpaper.You are born a Mountain, floating through space. You experience the turning of time and seasons. Things crash into you on occation. And you ponder on your existence. You can, to a very limited extent, affect what happens on-screen, but this doesn't extend beyond different animations.The ambient music (mostly wind or rain) is atmospheric, the imagery is pretty, and you can play tunes using your keyboard.I can't say I regret buying it because I had some fun with it and it was only 66c, but it's not something I would recommend anyone buying.2/10 fireflies "

												Pointless indie dreck, status quo etc. I'm honestly sick to death of indie devs phoning it in these days when they could have been something unique and fun. GONE HOME or Always Sometimes Monsters would have been a hell of a lot more engaging if they had more gameplay and stopped huffing their own farts from a paper bag but this is game puts them all to shame on the pretenti-ometer. Its just a ♥♥♥♥ing screensaver. Thats it. It's got a somewhat nice digital piano but at the end of the day is a just a ♥♥♥♥ing screensaver. The games I listed above are hardly games, they have no challenge, no real fail state, and no gameplay really to note. At least with those games you can call them a walking simulator but with this there's nothing to say other than why? Of course as is standard with pointless indie dreck the devs are practically shooting their own farts into their veins in a seedy backally like it was discount heroin. Don't give me the duality of existance crap I took a first year philosophy class in community college too and I can smell the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. You didn't make a game you♥♥♥♥♥♥out a screensaver and wasted everyones time and money, for ♥♥♥♥s sake you can make whatever you want but this is just idiotic. And the worst part? It's not even a well designed screensaver! I noticed my rig was getting pretty warm when I messed around with it and I have a fairly well made system with adequate cooling, I hate to think what would happen to people with lower end rigs. Overall you have a waste of time and money run but pretentious devs that was given the most sumptous review ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this side of depressionnotagameitsjust♥♥♥♥inghyperlinksquest.

												I saw this game in a store and then I came to steam to see the reviews and this one gots me ''Mountain is there for you when you decide to return to it and play it.'' (that was just a little part of the review) then I bought the game and since I installed it and played it, I come back to see the mountain, I dont really know why I do that but I feel like I have to look at the mountain from time to time. I'll never regret buying this game.			"

												I don't know what to do with my life anymore, so i became a peaceful mountain.surpsingly it tells you many things. it show you the true meanings of life.it makes you realize you are just tiny human beings in supermassive universe.so being thankfull everyday, do what your best, make everyone you loves happy, and live life to the fullest. SALAM SUPER......Okay enough, its time to get serious.Its a idle-games, In this game we generate a mountain, and just like every idle-games do, we just sit there, watching it, sometimes it became rain, snow, sometimes there are quotes that tell you something, and sometimes there are stuffs fell down from sky to your mountain. and we can play piano using our keyboard. Still wondering why i bought this game LOL.			"

I took good care of it, was looking forward to have a giant pile of loot to have fun with, and it never happened. Forget the screenshots on the Store Page. The limit is something like ~10 items.

												Do I recommend this game? That's a bad question, because it implies that this thing is a game. Hell, I'm not even sure what it qualifies as. The best description I can give for it is that it's a glorified screensaver. It does nothing except spin, and occasionally the Mountain gets existential. The player can do nothing except watch. I have no clue why critics are obsessing over it. It's a cute concept, but I have literally seen screensavers that do the same thing. The developer notes on the page are straight up lying when they say that it is a game, or that you can play it, or even that it plays itself.0/10.			"

Great for parties as well as solo-play. I cannot recommend this masterpiece of a videogame enough. Anybody that does not pay the 99 cents for this amazing game is missing out.

However, please only buy this game if you are looking for a game that will change your life. This game is not for the weak. Through Mountain, I have understood many complex situations in my life.

												While I do give it a thumbs up, I do it because this ""game"" is exactly as it is advertised. In Mountain, you draw a couple of things that it asks you to draw, and it supposedly forms a mountain based on it. I do not know how this affects the mountain's generation, but it is there. You can play music notes to speed up time, or make special things happen such as rain blood, or even rain frogs. This does not exactly add to the game's fun, but it is neat to watch. Music also speeds up time, to get out of storms and whatnot. However, ""Mountain"" is CPU intensive to the point where I could not run any other games with it up. There is nothing to do BUT look at the mountain after all is said and done, and the thoughts it gives are from what I assume a madlib system where it takes a base and adds adjectives. ""I FEEL WONDERFUL ON THIS FIERY MORNING."" Do I think this game should be $0.99? Not at all. You will play it for a few minutes, then forget about it as it does not entice you to look at it at all. I wish I had not spent the money on it, but I did it because you can be a mountain that floats through space while it is bombarded occaisionally by giant items that stick into it. The clouds also seem to pass right through the mountain as if it were not even there. Take from this what you will, but it is as it is advertised.			"

												Forget the mountain. Forget it right now.The skybox in this game is the most mesmerising, mind boggling, belittling thing I've ever seen.I'll often zoom all the way out just to look at it. This is usually followed by an intense, irrational fear, which can only be quelled by getting the f**k away from that mystical skybox.			"

												While I do give it a thumbs up, I do it because this ""game"" is exactly as it is advertised. In Mountain, you draw a couple of things that it asks you to draw, and it supposedly forms a mountain based on it. I do not know how this affects the mountain's generation, but it is there. You can play music notes to speed up time, or make special things happen such as rain blood, or even rain frogs. This does not exactly add to the game's fun, but it is neat to watch. Music also speeds up time, to get out of storms and whatnot. However, ""Mountain"" is CPU intensive to the point where I could not run any other games with it up. There is nothing to do BUT look at the mountain after all is said and done, and the thoughts it gives are from what I assume a madlib system where it takes a base and adds adjectives. ""I FEEL WONDERFUL ON THIS FIERY MORNING."" Do I think this game should be $0.99? Not at all. You will play it for a few minutes, then forget about it as it does not entice you to look at it at all. I wish I had not spent the money on it, but I did it because you can be a mountain that floats through space while it is bombarded occaisionally by giant items that stick into it. The clouds also seem to pass right through the mountain as if it were not even there. Take from this what you will, but it is as it is advertised.			"

												Possibly your most brilliant buy of 2014.  The simplicity of Mountain is deceiving.  Like a lone introvert within a sea of rambunctious heart-throbbing shooters and the thrumming excitement of dating sims, this game will surprise you with the upmost joy of sheer magnificence.  As the fog of worries and ""creamy mornings"" (quoted from the game), envelop your senses, revelation dawns upon your body.  There will be times where the day will be so wonderful, that you will be happy from just... floating.  There will be days, when you are so occupied with rotating, that you will be surprised that bridges, evil faces, and other countless wonders build themselves upon you.The game does not absorb you.  You do not absorb the game... rather, you will come to understand the significance of this meaningful thought:  ""I am absorbed by today.""			"

Great for parties as well as solo-play. I cannot recommend this masterpiece of a videogame enough. Anybody that does not pay the 99 cents for this amazing game is missing out.

												Some will say that this is not a game. Some will say that this is a waste of time. ...This is indeed a game. Not all games require you to arm yourself to the teeth. Not all games require you to solve intricate puzzles. And not all games require you to perform something. A game is something that gives entertainment. And this is entertaining to myself, and many others. It is a relaxing, creative, and ever-changing picture which holds its own unique place amongst the companion games that inhabit this virtual world. But perhaps that was too long for you to care to read. Put simply, this is a special type of game that makes one think and reflect. It is a marvel amongst its own kind.			"

												Two CDs hovered just out of my reach, in the far corners of my little universe.I needed those CDs.I was looking at them, just as a humungous pie swung past my mountain in a low orbit.I was hoping the pie would hit, as I needed more pies on my mountain.Then, a GIGANTIC rubber duck flew down, and crashed into my mountain, conveniently next to the gramophone that was playing Albert Bowlly's music.Wow, I thought, That duck is really awesome.My mountain thought ""I am lonely""So I played the Yankee Doodle March to it.Then a relatively large hairpin fell out of the sky and landed promptly in the duck's head.Oh dear.Two horses go sailing headfirst into a massive piece of cake.A pin lodges itself in a glowing bottle of liquor.I play more music on the gramophone.My mountain talks to me.I talk to my mountain.This all happened in the space of 3 hours.I love this game.

												""Mountain"" isn't necessarily a game about the weather, or a game about things falling on a mountain. Simply put, it is a game that serves as a place for meditation and self-reflection. You can think of it as a substitute for that one place in your childhood that you always felt safe in.Not only is ""Mountain"" a game of self-reflection, it is a well thought out idea that, in my opinion, promotes setting time aside and devoting it to peaceful silence.Mountain is quite possibly one of the best VR games I have ever stumbled upon. You can rest assured it is capable of being the most life changing game you will ever play.Just know, this game is not meant for those looking to play a game -- it is meant for those looking for a truly life changing experience.

												Um well, this is a different take on the concept of ""game"".  You have a mountain which rotates and accumulates random objects (the first object to crash into my mountain was an umbrella -- wtf, how did an umbrella get into space is what I want to know).  On occasion, the mountain thinks very mountain-y thoughts, like ""I'm diggin' on this storm!"" or ""Hey wow this spooky night is the bomb!"" (paraphrased).  The player can pick up the random objects and set them down again (exciting).  Other than that, I'm not sure if this ""game"" does anything else -- well, there are the musical notes one can play which sound pretty nice when scrolled way out, so that's a thing.  All in all -- I shouldn't like this ""game"", but I sorta do, but honestly as it is I can't recommend it. Sure, it's kind of zen to just look into it from time to time and see what other crap your mound of spacedirt has picked up, but there's just not anything else to it.  I hope some civilizations evolve or something like that to break up the monotony, but maybe that's too much to hope for.  Maybe worth getting only when it's far less than 99 cents; I kind of feel like I overpaid.			"

												It is exactly as it describes in the title, with a little added bonus. Don't expect a huge fun game when buying this. It is a screensaver. A lot of people complain that you aren't actually ""God"". But you are. ""God"" gets to sit and watch us mess up the world, without being able to do anything about it. And that is exactly what happens in this game. You watch the mountain grow/be destroyed, and you cannot do a damn thing. I love it. I run it in the background while I work because the nature sounds are nice and enjoyable, and I like to tab to it to check on my mountain. I also keep it on while I sleep, so that I can look at it if I wake up, and it will slowly relax me and I can fall asleep. I love this screensaver ""game"" and I feel like people like me will enjoy it too. It's cute and calming. It's also good for panic attacks. Nice job, Devs. :)			"

												Once upon a time in outerspace.. There lived a Mountain....And on this mountain grew grass and trees. Then it began to collect junk. And more junk.I have no idea what possessed me to buy this and after letting it run a few hours I have no idea why I like it so much. I mean none.However, I do like it, don't regret buying it (I mean, it was only a buck, lol). What's nice is that it runs in windowed mode by default, so I have something to put on one of my other monitors while not using it. I also have no idea why I like doing this, since I had no problem just letting unused monitors be before..But now that I have this cute little Mountain, I don't know what I would ever do without it.

												It is what it is, don't get mad that you didn't do any research before you spent a dollar on something that you had no idea what it was going to be. Personnally I really liked this. It is basically a screen saver, except it feels alive.      I started to feel attached to the mountain I had made, I even found out a way to remove junk from my mountain by throwing it off, or by playing a melody. I was devastated when I played the melody from Close Encounters. My mountain was destroyed by the eye of blindness, it was sad. I ocasionally I leave this running in the background just to see if anything will happen. Its not a game, but its not really anything else other than a game. Just like making Bonsai trees isn't really like being a full-on gardener, but it basically is.       Worth the $1? I don't know, you decide. It's not hard to figure out if you will hate this or appreciate this. I was glad I got it. If it's a game, then it is a really ammusing cheap take on what games are and how we play them (like Little Inferno). If it's a screen saver, then it is a really good interactive screen saver that has way more depth, beauty, and humor than any screensaver I have ever used.       I will give it a thumbs up but you don't have to, and thats okay, just don't buy ignorantly and then complain. It is what it is and you are not forced to buy it. Just ask the mountain what he thinks of himself, he will tell you, and in a very contemplative way too.			"

												It's strange... I love this, it's something nice to relax to. Unlike what most people say, no, it's not a screensaver, it's a game... Just not a game of direct interaction. Things happen, you don't play the game, the game simply plays itself. Ooh! It's snowing on my mountain! Somewhat like those life simulator games, like Sims or Animal Crossing without the intervening of the godlike player. It's also good to do homework by, something kind of distracting... Hey, look, fireflies! But not too distracting to keep you from working. If you have a telivision in your living room with a computer, it's perfect for when guests come over and you want them to socialize. Better than sports. I hate sports. The developer behind this game took good care to make sure the Mountain's thoughts correspond appropriately to what's happening, something which most game developers leave out. In other words, as the kiddies say nowadays: ""Gr8, m8! 8/8!""			"

												Once upon a time in outerspace.. There lived a Mountain....And on this mountain grew grass and trees. Then it began to collect junk. And more junk.I have no idea what possessed me to buy this and after letting it run a few hours I have no idea why I like it so much. I mean none.However, I do like it, don't regret buying it (I mean, it was only a buck, lol). What's nice is that it runs in windowed mode by default, so I have something to put on one of my other monitors while not using it. I also have no idea why I like doing this, since I had no problem just letting unused monitors be before..But now that I have this cute little Mountain, I don't know what I would ever do without it.

Night time is extremely gorgeous, with a full view of different galaxies and lightning bugs come out of the trees.What i'd really like to see in this game are animals like deer or wolves that multiply and have their own offspring.

												It's pretty cheap game, can work as your desktop screen saver to fool your friends. It's more on the visual art and no controls. Well besides mouse and just pushing random buttons to make music. If It was any sort of price higher I would say no to it but it's pretty neat of how it goes through the seasons and such and the more you play it you'll find out about it and what goes on. Even when you zoom out it seems a little bit odd of how the universe can seem to just a mountain lonely in its own space but is it's own god to itself. Good mountain god is best mountain.			"

												It's pretty cheap game, can work as your desktop screen saver to fool your friends. It's more on the visual art and no controls. Well besides mouse and just pushing random buttons to make music. If It was any sort of price higher I would say no to it but it's pretty neat of how it goes through the seasons and such and the more you play it you'll find out about it and what goes on. Even when you zoom out it seems a little bit odd of how the universe can seem to just a mountain lonely in its own space but is it's own god to itself. Good mountain god is best mountain.			"

												This game is very nice. Very very atmospheric and ambient.Keyboard is a piano. The mountain talks to you. It's pretty damn nice. Best 99 cents i've ever spent to be honest.In terms of gameplay... there is none. Sometimes random things will pop up on your mountain and the weather and seasons change. New trees grow. Night time is extremely gorgeous, with a full view of different galaxies and lightning bugs come out of the trees.What i'd really like to see in this game are animals like deer or wolves that multiply and have their own offspring.

												Obviously this game has heavily polarized critics, both proffesional and players alike. It is considered both a piece of crap and a work of modern art however it can be universally verified as something that is different. Some people adapt well to change but I don't know of something new and weird, be it art or games or movies, that was instantly loved by everybody. Reading the reviews may not help much in deciding whether or not to purchase this game so may I suggest watching muted videos of gameplay, which is by far the most objective experience, and deciding from that.

												""Mountain"" isn't necessarily a game about the weather, or a game about things falling on a mountain. Simply put, it is a game that serves as a place for meditation and self-reflection. You can think of it as a substitute for that one place in your childhood that you always felt safe in.Not only is ""Mountain"" a game of self-reflection, it is a well thought out idea that, in my opinion, promotes setting time aside and devoting it to peaceful silence.Mountain is quite possibly one of the best VR games I have ever stumbled upon. You can rest assured it is capable of being the most life changing game you will ever play.Just know, this game is not meant for those looking to play a game -- it is meant for those looking for a truly life changing experience.

												Mountain, a brilliant game of unprecedented architecture. The game is widely known as a so-called ""Mountain Simulator,"" but it is so much more. I remember the day like it was yesterday, my wife had left me and I had nothing but a dollar, a laptop, and my Steam account. I drank so much back then, shot after shot, it did nothing. While drunk, I pulled out my phone and bought this game which is called Mountain. Once sober, I opened my computer to see that I used my last dollar to buy a stupid game. I was ashamed, this led to more drinking. It eventually led to more than the hard liquor. I stole Cocaine, Valium, and Vicodin. I was addicted. I didn't know what to do. I finally opened Mountain after a long line of Coke. Then it hit me. The game was speaking to me. Not literally, but almost telepathically. After a couple of weeks, I sobered up nicely, got a job, and finally lived in a place that I could call home. I owe everything to Mountain. I give it 0/5			"

												While many games brag about their massive scope and seemingly realistic environments, no ""game"" has ever changed the way I live and think like Mountain has. This celestial screensaver has connected with me on deeper levels than other video game character, and possibly even another human, has ever done before. When the mountain was bored, I was bored. Never has a connection been so parallel and perpendicular at the same time. That doesn't really make much sense, but neither does Mountain. Before you buy, ask yourself : ""What is a lonely space mountain to do?"" This game will answer that one question.			"

												The future of mountain simulation and, quite frankly, the best Mountain Simulator I've ever played. The sound is the standout feature, but everything else is great, too.A true revolution in the genre with that rare universal appeal nearly gone from modern life and rarely even seen in video games - a kind of appeal that only Tetris, the Beatles, or Jesus Christ could even hope to rival. There are only two groups of people who won't like this game - terrorists and pedophiles.Ratings cannot describe how amazing this is. I am literally a superior human being for having played this. Not just culturally, but morally and physically.11/10. "

												Mountain is an interesting game to say the least. You have very minimal interaction with a mountain that is completely cut off from the rest of the world stranded in space. Despite only being able to move the camera and rearrange the space junk (That consists of horses, arrows, and trash cans) you find yourself attached to your mountain. The little comments that it writes giving the inanimate object a personality. Eventually you bond with mountain, realizing that there is more to mountain than your first thought. You bond over your mutual enjoyment of the weather. You help mountain rearrange its space junk, or treasures as you call them. Eventually an old music box is given to you from the space trash man and you begin to call it your precious. The voices whisper to you. They tell you how Mountain isn't has nice as it seems. But precious plays music that soothes you, it counsels the inner voices. But the inner voices start yelling instead of whispering to be heard over the voices. They tell you what mountain is planning. Mountain wants your precious. You know you can’t stop Mountain. In a futile attempt to halt the hand of fate you hit every key until it all stops and you have no control. A wild dwarf star approaches. In what feels like an eternity but is only a few seconds your friend is gone. Forever lost to the cold void of space. And you feel guilt. You mourn Mountain. This game took me through an emotional rollercoaster. All and all worth the dollar.			"

												Mountain is just one of those games that every person should own. Great fun and replayability. Just a little bit of an emotional rollercoaster ride though; It's amazing how blessed I feel when I've returned from a trip to the supermarket to find a gigantic wooden horsey on my mountain, and after examining it for a second and accidentaly dropping it into outer space I'm just torn with sadness and anger because my wooden horsey has decided that his people need him more than my mountain does. I love it though, makes me feel alive, the joy and sadness I'm experiencing in one hour of playing, wow! 8/10			"

												If you ever wondered what it would be like to be a mountain, this game is for you.  Its by far the most intense mountain simulation on the market.  They really went all out with the fundamentals that make being a mountain so much fun.  Its a perfect game with out the clutter of player interactions.A must have for any mountain fans.			"

												Mountain is like buying an thought provoking, ever changing, screensaver. It can be insightful, despressing, inspiring, outragous or simply Poeish in nature. Mountain, is a game without being a game, I bought it for 99 cents, and I spent another 5 dollars buying it for my friends. Discussing the objects logded in our mountains and talking about wether our mountains are jerks or clinically depressed. The mountain can be ""played"" during anything or anything. My 80 year old grandmother even found it amusing and it was the perfect gift from my brother for Christmas. This game is hours of thought provoking, relaxing gameplay. Games can be whatever they want to be, screw strict construction, go indie!			"

												Mountain is an interesting game to say the least. You have very minimal interaction with a mountain that is completely cut off from the rest of the world stranded in space. Despite only being able to move the camera and rearrange the space junk (That consists of horses, arrows, and trash cans) you find yourself attached to your mountain. The little comments that it writes giving the inanimate object a personality. Eventually you bond with mountain, realizing that there is more to mountain than your first thought. You bond over your mutual enjoyment of the weather. You help mountain rearrange its space junk, or treasures as you call them. Eventually an old music box is given to you from the space trash man and you begin to call it your precious. The voices whisper to you. They tell you how Mountain isn't has nice as it seems. But precious plays music that soothes you, it counsels the inner voices. But the inner voices start yelling instead of whispering to be heard over the voices. They tell you what mountain is planning. Mountain wants your precious. You know you can’t stop Mountain. In a futile attempt to halt the hand of fate you hit every key until it all stops and you have no control. A wild dwarf star approaches. In what feels like an eternity but is only a few seconds your friend is gone. Forever lost to the cold void of space. And you feel guilt. You mourn Mountain. This game took me through an emotional rollercoaster. All and all worth the dollar.			"

												The future of mountain simulation and, quite frankly, the best Mountain Simulator I've ever played. The sound is the standout feature, but everything else is great, too.A true revolution in the genre with that rare universal appeal nearly gone from modern life and rarely even seen in video games - a kind of appeal that only Tetris, the Beatles, or Jesus Christ could even hope to rival. There are only two groups of people who won't like this game - terrorists and pedophiles.Ratings cannot describe how amazing this is. I am literally a superior human being for having played this. Not just culturally, but morally and physically.11/10. "

												While many games brag about their massive scope and seemingly realistic environments, no ""game"" has ever changed the way I live and think like Mountain has. This celestial screensaver has connected with me on deeper levels than other video game character, and possibly even another human, has ever done before. When the mountain was bored, I was bored. Never has a connection been so parallel and perpendicular at the same time. That doesn't really make much sense, but neither does Mountain. Before you buy, ask yourself : ""What is a lonely space mountain to do?"" This game will answer that one question.			"

												Mountain, a brilliant game of unprecedented architecture. The game is widely known as a so-called ""Mountain Simulator,"" but it is so much more. I remember the day like it was yesterday, my wife had left me and I had nothing but a dollar, a laptop, and my Steam account. I drank so much back then, shot after shot, it did nothing. While drunk, I pulled out my phone and bought this game which is called Mountain. Once sober, I opened my computer to see that I used my last dollar to buy a stupid game. I was ashamed, this led to more drinking. It eventually led to more than the hard liquor. I stole Cocaine, Valium, and Vicodin. I was addicted. I didn't know what to do. I finally opened Mountain after a long line of Coke. Then it hit me. The game was speaking to me. Not literally, but almost telepathically. After a couple of weeks, I sobered up nicely, got a job, and finally lived in a place that I could call home. I owe everything to Mountain. I give it 0/5			"

												At first sight, this game may not seem all that interesting (and I do have to say it can be lackluster at times), but for the price of 1$ it is a solid deal. If you want  something to occupy your time while doing nothing, then shoot for Mountain, but do not buy this game thinking you will see action every second.			"

												This ""Game""  gets♥♥♥♥♥♥on so much, but im gonna tell you why you should watch it.If you love playing hardcore games and being better than everyone else, but that time comes when you feel like you want to  be a mountain,  then this game is perfect for you, You get to watch a beautiful majestic mountain, spin and twirl, the mountain gives you the ability to create your own stories with it, imagine it, to be it. this game is about patience, wich some of you need to get, and also about learning the ways of the majestic mountain. However, being bored of mountain is ok, because sometimes mountain gets bored, of  you .Pros- Relaxing- Majestic- Beautiful- ImaginativeCons- You dont actually get to be a mountain- clouds clip through the mountainIf you want to try something new, pick this up, it is only a dollar, you cant really go wrong. #BeTheMountain2017  "

												this isn't really a game but its very good to get you calm down. You haven't to do someting and you should only enjoy the atmosphere. I don't think you are the mountain, you are the god of the mountain and can watch the mountain from every reach. It's not some you can make for hours, but when you like meditation, you will can enjoy this. Try to meditate without and with the mountain, but you will find out that it is hard to meditate without because you can't concentrate yourself. When you have a picture in youre brain you can concentrate better. And what is the aim of this. I will give you an answer.could you live a life without doing someting. and can you see the little happy things in live. Would you say a live only in one mountain where every thing happen again for 100 years is worthless. Or would you say it was the best time I ever had, because I understand whats important. And this is a good test about the own thinking can I really rest for a long time without thinking something. When you would have the choice between this live or the lonely life at the mountain what would you decide. and how must feel god, when he have to see the things again and again for ever. Did we learned someting or do we walk in a circle like the mountain. Or did we understand the mountain and the mountain will understand us. enough answer why the game is good and why does it needs a big history when you can create youre own thinking. Try this game before you go to sleep than you sleep very well (:			"

												When I read about the concept I was really excited as it sounded intriguing and different. The game graphs were simple but nice, the melody-actions were cool (but I found the keyboard notes a bit restricted). I enjoyed the first hours of gameplay, even when there´s not much real gameplay at all: You basically watch your mountain. After a while I started losing interest, basically because I didn´t feel the thoughts the mountain shared had anything to do with the events happening (either triggered by the melodies, or by the supposed time of day or season, or by whether I was keeping the mountain open or not). Then garbage started falling on my mountain, garbage that apparently from falling on again, had no purpose and couldn´t be removed. I really disliked this. Eventually I left the game running to see whether the mountain would suffocate in garbage (if so, I really hoped it would happen soon). It did. This morning I found a message notifying total destruction (no further details, no final view). The concept is sort of different and I don´t consider the money a complete waste. But I wouldn´t really recommend this.Maybe if I had looked more into forums I would have found more things to do. Maybe I didn´t play this as it was supposed to be played. But right now I uninstalled the game as I don´t really feel like playing it again. When it was peaceful and clean it was ok. When garbage started falling, it got as stressing as dealing with a Tamagochi who demands care while all you´re able to do is watch it die.			"

												This game is a brilliant satire of art games. There's no control over it, no objective, nothing. Your mountain ""thinks"" out nonsensical lines of text pieced together by an RNG. This game tries really hard to feel ""deep"" but makes it very clear that it has nothing to say, and that's the joke. What's sad is that the sheer number of people who think this game is legit kind of shows how far art games have fallen.			"

My mountain, without me, is useless. Without my mountain, I am useless. I must watch my mountain true. I must watch fonder than my fellow gamers who are trying to out-feel me. I must out-feel him before he out-feels me. I will...My mountain and I know that what counts in life is not the weather we endure, the noise of our rain, nor the fog we make. We know that it is the feels that count. We will feel...My mountain is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its landscape, its environment, its foliage and its weird crap that gets lodged in it. I will keep my mountain game installed and open, even as I am installed and open. We will become part of each other. We will...Before God, I swear this creed. My mountain and I are the things that exist. We are the masters of our existence. We are the saviors of my life.So be it, until enlightenment is everyone's and there are no console scrubs, but Mountain!			"

												When I read about the concept I was really excited as it sounded intriguing and different. The game graphs were simple but nice, the melody-actions were cool (but I found the keyboard notes a bit restricted). I enjoyed the first hours of gameplay, even when there´s not much real gameplay at all: You basically watch your mountain. After a while I started losing interest, basically because I didn´t feel the thoughts the mountain shared had anything to do with the events happening (either triggered by the melodies, or by the supposed time of day or season, or by whether I was keeping the mountain open or not). Then garbage started falling on my mountain, garbage that apparently from falling on again, had no purpose and couldn´t be removed. I really disliked this. Eventually I left the game running to see whether the mountain would suffocate in garbage (if so, I really hoped it would happen soon). It did. This morning I found a message notifying total destruction (no further details, no final view). The concept is sort of different and I don´t consider the money a complete waste. But I wouldn´t really recommend this.Maybe if I had looked more into forums I would have found more things to do. Maybe I didn´t play this as it was supposed to be played. But right now I uninstalled the game as I don´t really feel like playing it again. When it was peaceful and clean it was ok. When garbage started falling, it got as stressing as dealing with a Tamagochi who demands care while all you´re able to do is watch it die.			"

With my new found manhood i decided it was time for a girlfriend so i went out found a suitable mate (current girlfriend ;) ) told her about my huge sword. she came back to my place to see the sword. i turned on my pc booted up mountain to show her. i dont think its wat she expected, but it we started talking after a few weeks we ending up going out. moral of the story, GET THIS GAME, GET A GIRLFRIEND!!

												Best game ever 2016!!!!!!!!!11111111111oneoneonetwoCampaign-Very rich storyline with a very complex backstory that can take up hours of your life while you try to figure it out. While I'm falling asleep, in the shower, on a long car journey or simply on the toilet I like to think about the story of this game. There are many different decisions for you to make in this game leading to 7 possible endings.Multiplayer-All diamond SMGs now, working towards my shotguns, very unique gamemodes and killstreaks make for an exciting and different style of FPS. The devastator mech does seem to be a little OP and should be nerfed as it seemes to obliterate anything within range.Co-op missions-Over 50 different missions for you to try with up to four friends that can be replayed on 3 different  difficulties. The levelling system carries over from multiplayer (100 levels, 10 prestiges) each mission gives you around 100,00xp which can get you from level 1 to level 5 in one game but it's likely you won't complete a mission until you're at least level 30.Raid bosses- The raid bosses in this game are possibly my favourite part. They can take up to an hour if you trying them at the recommended level but rarely defeated unless you have a full lobby of prestige 6 or aboves. The final raid boss still is undefeated by me as I'm only presige 9, level 20. Getting pretty close though.Zombie survival-Most violent thing I have ever seen. Must be 18.In conclusion this game is incredibly violent but very enjoyable. I highly recommend that you buy it even if you're not normally into strategic first person shooters but I do have one more warning:strong sexual themes and constant nudity.99/10			"

												Mountain isn't a game, it's an expierience. Don't buy it expecting hours on end of exciting gameplay. There is no gameplay, only a surreal atmospheric simulation mountain experience. Leave mountain running in the background when you play other games, or as a screensaver, and switch back to it and play whenever you feel like. See how your mountain changes as you leave it to discover itself. Come back and observe all the little details. Play with the music keyboard and create an atmosphere for you and your mountain to enjoy. Learn things about your mountain. Learn things about yourself. Become your mountain.			"

												A really short but atmospheric game for sure. Don't rush, you have to experience the surroundings to get clues about the story and move forward. Yeah it's a walking simulator but also a good thriller/detective story. Some clues are more obvious than others but in the end, if you reach the final point in the story, you will even get a help (literally). I can't really talk about the story because... there are so many questions. Also it's really easy to spoil everything. If you like movies/games where you left with several questions in the end and it's up to your interpretation what the story was about then I recommend this game because you will enjoy it.Also it's not a horror game even tho it has a cold and dark feeling. There is only one scarry part but even that can be avoidable if you aware of your surroundings.			"

												This game is a brilliant satire of art games. There's no control over it, no objective, nothing. Your mountain ""thinks"" out nonsensical lines of text pieced together by an RNG. This game tries really hard to feel ""deep"" but makes it very clear that it has nothing to say, and that's the joke. What's sad is that the sheer number of people who think this game is legit kind of shows how far art games have fallen.			"

												I usually don't write reviews for games but considering what this is I feel the need to review this masterpiece of a game.For several weeks now I have always had the same routine: Turn pc on, go to my steam library, open up muntain and reflect on the choices I've made in my life and what choices I will make in the future.For most this is just a screensaver of a lonely mountain, but for me it's a phychological look at the human mind and the many questions surrounding us. ""What are we doing?"" ""What do we do?"" ""How do I do it?"" ""What is the point of all this?"" All these questions have been in our heads at least once in our life and never have we had answers to them.The interaction we have with this mountain may be minimal, but the same applies with us and the outside world. We can't change nature. Life goes on and we live to see that, and in mountain we see day turn to night, leaves on the trees fall and snow falling on the mountain. The world around us changes regularly but does the mountain change at all?The only possible interaction we do have with the mountain is pressing keys to play tune to make time go fast. This touched me emotionally. As the saying goes, ""Life goes by when you're having fun"" and mountain conveys this perfectly.This game is the most deep, phychological game that I've had the pleasure play.10/10 David OReilly needs to make more games like this.

												Mountain is, as many have pointed out, a screensaver. However, being a screensaver is not necessarily a negative thing. Initially, I was intrigued at the idea of having a sort of ""passive"" experience in gaming, one where I take on the role of observer and watch something grow and change with only minor interference from the player. Mountain is very much a good concept; it can be played in the same style as games like Cookie Clicker (that is, with minimal attention and concentration) and offers some small amount of creative outlet without being demanding. Unfortunately, Mountain's execution falls short of its potential.Users begin Mountain with a blank slate in the form of a grassy green hill. Interactions with the mountain are limited to a button used to coax a thought from the mountain, a click of of the mouse that lets you rearrange objects on your mountain, and a set of keys on the keyboard that act like the keys on a piano, allowing you to play cute little melodies that can speed the changing of seasons for your mountain. Leaving Mountain on in the background will cause procedurally generated objects to sprout on  your mountain. My mountain quickly gained a gramophone, a traffic cone, a chair,  and a paper airplane.Subsequent hours added more items, each one random and briefly curiosity-provoking, but not quite as exciting or as thoughtful as I had hoped. Despite the new items and the changes and season and weather, I never found myself all that interested in what was happening with my mountain. When I finally came home from work one day and found that my mountain had perished to some cataclysmic event, I was momentarily frustrated that I hadn't been able to see my mountain's demise. After that moment passed, though, I almost felt something akin to relief.What I had expected out of Mountain was something the game fails to deliver: a sense of fondness for my mountain. While the mountain's charming little thoughts and quips often made me smile, overall I finished the lifespan of my mountain with a sense of non-tragic boredom. I had hoped to start with a small little hill and watch it grow and shift and change into a fully functional, planetoid mountain. I thought perhaps I would get to see lakes form and forests grow and maybe even a species or two develop. I had hoped I would fall in love with this little screensaver. Instead, all I got was a mountain that never changed its shape and whose various objects held only a very brief passing fancy.			"

												This is more art than a game but with that out of the way the game is still enjoyable. You build your mountain by drawing three random things from a list. The mountain generates and you watch it spin. Seasons pass and the mountain changes. You can play music while watching the mountain do it's thing. Playing certain music allows for things to happen. You can make fish rain down or a mystical glowing light destroy the mountain. For 99cents I suggest anyone who is a true fan of games should pic this up.			"

It's missing two things in my opinion:The fact that it can't be made into an actual screensaver.And the fact that I can't set it to fullscreen on my second monitor, let it run, and do stuff on my main monitor.If either of those were to be added, I'd recommend the ""game.""EDIT: I feel that I should point out that it is cpu intensive and that there's really no reason to buy it unless you're alright just letting it run in the background or off to the side.

												I would recommend this to anyone who needs a moment of peace in their life. If anything, this a tool for personal reflection. You won't find any complex puzzles or thrilling action here. It's just you and your mountain floating in the abyss in perfect tranquility. Take the time to enjoy your mountain and realize that it is a reflection of yourself. Only then, will you unlock its secrets :)			"

Product received for free
												I received this game for free as a bonus for buying another game at another site.Everything about this ""game"" screams ""I am an artist! You must appreciate my art!""People may praise this game, but I suspect a case of The Emperor's New Clothes. There is nothing here of note. It's an EXTREMELY simple program that has an inflated sense of worth because the creator told you it had worth. Then reviewers told you it was amazing, too, because they were worried about being seen as ""not getting it"" or ""not being smart enough"" or ""not culturally inclined.""It's a boring, simple simulation and I have no idea why people would pay $1 for it.

												This game was amazing, I was addicted to checking on my Mountain to make sure it was okay, to read my Mountains thoughts, this game became my life, but one fateful morning after 10 hours of dedication, love, getting to know my Mountain on a personal level and connecting with my Mountain it was all destroyed. MY MOUNTAIN DIED, I tried to restart, but it wasn't the same, it wasn't my mountain anymore the one I had grown to love.This game is amazing, but after the death of my Mountain it wasn't that same :( If you want love and a friend when you feel alone buy this game, just be aware heartbreak may be in store.10/10 would recommend for 99 cents you can't go wrong : - )			"

												Mountain is a metaphor for life: barren, purposeless, spinning around in circles. That's how Mountain looked like at first but look closer and you will see all the trees, rocks and flowers growing around it. And isn't life just like that? We often neglect things that we already have.We sometimes feel stuck, with nothing good happening in our life. Every day is the same as the day before it. That's how Mountain is like as well if you just keep staring at it. But go back to it an hour or so later and you may be surprised to find a giant dice has landed on it. Doesn't life surprise us much in the same way as well?And the mountain's incline? It represents the challenges that we have to overcome to reach the peak of our potential. Often it may seem unreachable, just like how the peak of Mountain is usually covered in clouds. But at the perfect moment, the clouds pass by and you can see the beautiful future ahead of you.If you zoom out far enough, you can see Mountain covered in bright light, and the entire universe surrounding it. This implies how small we are at life and that there is an entire universe out there to explore and experience. Mountain is imploring us to go out there and make the most out of the short time given to us.As I close this game and go to sleep tonight, I know deep in my heart that I have grown to be a better man. Thank you Mountain for making me realize life's true meaning.			"

												Giant pie smashed on my exclusive mountain, I bet it won't happen on mountain everest. First off, Mountain has nice graphics overall, you own a mountain that probably, or probably not, will be based off how you drew several words such as: illness, your childhood, mom, etc... Your mountain can talk to you and you discover Some new types of things that drop from the sky, or at least the clouds, by guessing types of melodies. After a while, you start to get some objects that fall from space on your mountain, and you can move them and create your creative mountain you have always dreamed of!It might sound boring, but it isn't, and for 99 cents you are promised to buy lots of fun and quality time with your mountain from time to time.8/10 Needs more content.

												If my mountain is truely unique from other peoples mountains, and not a super duper long video then I think this game is a success, It is like having a tomigotchi you do not have to feed. I realize I've only observed about 30 Minutes of mountain growth, which is not a lot. I have seen the seasons change, fireflies, new plant life, etc. Nothing too crazy (yet.) It has some calming sounds and ambient music, which somepeople could even fall asleep to, if you are into that sort of thing. Zoom in or out, I actually like look at the underside of my floating mountian. Doesn't use too much ram to run so it could be left on while doing other things.

												Finally the time has come to review this amazing game. I have spent hours after hours with this game and I have loved every second of it. Mountain has unparallel storytelling that immerses you into the highly detailed story. You will surely spend hours just admiring the complex but interesting storytelling. I'm guessing that it is written by really talented writers and it has taken a long time.The voice acting in this game sounds really natural and it fits really well into the theme of the game. The graphical quality is top-notch, but you can easily get reasonable framerates with an older CPU and GPU.  I would definitely recommend playing in 4K for maximum enjoyment. The audio quality is eargasmic when listening in 7.1 or even 5.1 surround sound systems.Would definitely recommend trying Oculus Rift and if you like using a controller, no worries since this game has it covered.The multiplayer is something you should try, but I feel like it has some polishing. For me there have been no network issues and bugs have been minimal.My personal score is 9,8 / 10You should buy it, you won't regret it.			"

												Finally the time has come to review this amazing game. I have spent hours after hours with this game and I have loved every second of it. Mountain has unparallel storytelling that immerses you into the highly detailed story. You will surely spend hours just admiring the complex but interesting storytelling. I'm guessing that it is written by really talented writers and it has taken a long time.The voice acting in this game sounds really natural and it fits really well into the theme of the game. The graphical quality is top-notch, but you can easily get reasonable framerates with an older CPU and GPU.  I would definitely recommend playing in 4K for maximum enjoyment. The audio quality is eargasmic when listening in 7.1 or even 5.1 surround sound systems.Would definitely recommend trying Oculus Rift and if you like using a controller, no worries since this game has it covered.The multiplayer is something you should try, but I feel like it has some polishing. For me there have been no network issues and bugs have been minimal.My personal score is 9,8 / 10You should buy it, you won't regret it.			"

												If my mountain is truely unique from other peoples mountains, and not a super duper long video then I think this game is a success, It is like having a tomigotchi you do not have to feed. I realize I've only observed about 30 Minutes of mountain growth, which is not a lot. I have seen the seasons change, fireflies, new plant life, etc. Nothing too crazy (yet.) It has some calming sounds and ambient music, which somepeople could even fall asleep to, if you are into that sort of thing. Zoom in or out, I actually like look at the underside of my floating mountian. Doesn't use too much ram to run so it could be left on while doing other things. Or Watch your mountain and pretend you are god.			"

												Hill name suggests, a natural environment, geography outlook. This game is very slow-paced, no strong targeted, is looking at you full up hill a little bit, but I think this game is not simply bring us joy +1.Perhaps the content from the game point of view, this game is very simple, hook watching the scenery change, wait for different objects, and then let the world under Input cheat hearts like ...But I think that the most critical part of this game is to start to make you draw three pictures on!If we say that the human mind is the source of creation, that is actually what you call these ideas, but also inseparable from your own saw and heard, and infinite divergence.The impact caused by this game, is implied ...The pattern suggests that you draw with the mountain structure, the kind of object inseparable; implies everything happens for a causal loop ... now called Dawson one, one two, two three, three things are much better than this. Three figures shaping the development of the mountain is no longer seemed so abrupt.It was also the God of the game up to the level of brainwashing, I think how to say, very little of this type of game, we like to like, if the mountain will become a pure land in your heart, what is not? !People have just been brainwashed me teach mountains, so that is not Meng Meng Da, we do not mind! ! Ho ho ho ho, therefore, in the light! My conclusion is to buy! Buy! Buy!			"

												Please listen, this is NOT a game. I REPEAT, THIS IS NOT A GAME. Stop calling it a game, thank you.Do not purchase it thinking that it is a game because it is not. My friend got this for me and I did not expect much. And most of what I did in the first 20 minutes is basically stare at a rotating mountain. That is basically what you do and this is something to relax. Reading a guide I found out about some pretty cool things which were nice and I want to go back and check it out more but I have to write this review because this recieves undeserved hate from people who believed it was a game. Most I can say honestly is that this is something to relax and think. It's hard to think of things to describe it and I am not the best person to do so but as of right now this is something I do recommend BUT to only a certain group of people. I legitimately can't recommend it to a large group of people because chances are, they expect something more and that's not how this is meant to be taken. If you enjoy pondering about the world and anything philosophical or something of the sorts then I think you should give it a shot. Or if you want to just gift it to a friend for the hell of it then I think the asking price is worth it.			"

												I tried to stay open minded with this game but in the end I found it impossible. It seems like a game that was designed to trick people into thinking you were getting something by calling it creative or innovative. Not saying that the actual description was using these words but that is the image i got when buying this game. Instead I found myself wondering what I just paid for. And the low price is no excuse for the lack of content or design because again it is there to convince people to buy the game while the creators get lots money because people are willing to take a risk because of the low cost.

												While I am all for creative ideas in game design that are often bizarre, experimental or would only be executed by independent developers, Mountain is a clear cut example as to why not all ideas should have a price tag put on them.I have spent almost four hours 'playing' Mountain, though that clocked time was mostly me doing something else while the game ran off to the side. That's because Mountain is an interactive screensaver. Nothing more, nothing less, even if the genres on its Steam store page incorrectly label it as a 'simulation' and 'RPG'. Mountain does attempt to foster actual interaction by allowing you to play musical notes on your keyboard which when a correct sequence is played (Hot Cross Buns, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, etc), you can cause various effects to rain down on your mountain, like hearts, fireballs or in morbid manner, blood. These effects are only visual, unfortunately, and gameplay in Mountain doesn't improve from there. You can use your mouse to look around your mountain, spin it or zoom in and out for a closer and more distant look, and cleverly enough you can briskly shake your mountain to clear away clouds if you want a clear look at your personal piece of rock (despite the trees and other textures looking incredibly poor). Oh, random space debris will also fly in and crash into your mountain, like a traffic cone, a child's toy block, a futuristic sphere and other oddities that you can then move around or throw away. Why? Video games!Mountain falls apart at the seams once you realize you've exhausted these gameplay elements (and I use that term loosely), since the only progression in the game is the passing of time, the weather and seasons in your little bubble of an atmosphere, since zooming out will reveal your mountain is floating in space for reasons I still can't figure out. Apparently your mountain has emotions and sentience, since every few minutes it will make an observation or statement about the current weather, time of day and how it feels, even if during the night it will claim to be nervous one minute, and then another claim it feels bold from the darkness. Another 'thought' your mountain can have is some kind of existential question or statement regarding its existence, why its out here in space, if the player is a voice inside its head, why is it alone, are there other mountains like it, etc. and so forth (you can also press period to force one of these thoughts if yo﻿u don't want to wait). Apparently this is what has attracted players and journalists to the game, supposedly eliciting emotions and 'feels' from your mountain having a crisis of its own sentience and having to cope and adapt with the bizarre circumstances it finds itself in while 'living' day by day, season by season.﻿The glaring flaw in trying to stir thoughts in the player this way is that Mountain is still a screensaver. Nothing more, nothing less. I've tried to find something positive to say about Mountain, but excluding being able to shake your mountain to clear the clouds being clever, I have nothing. Mountain feels like it's trying to be something unique, but it ends up looking utterly ridiculous and full of itself in the process, and the fact that it carries a price tag doesn't help its case. Yes, ninety-nine cents is a piddly amount which could easily be raised by selling Steam cards, but charging money for screensaver under the guise of an 'ambient procedural mountain game' is an absolute joke, where the punch-line is on the consumer.In no way can I recommend Mountain, even at the price of being a penny shy of a dollar. It is a waste of time, money and patience from the four hours I burned away on this game, trying to make sense of it and realize what the positive talk of it was about.﻿			"

												This Isn't Really A Game Yet It's Not A Glorified Screensaver. It's A Exprience That Can't Be Explained Properly Which Will Explain Why The Number One Review On This ""Game"" Is Just The Word ""Good"". It's Like Looking After A Pet Rock But It's Bigger And Makes You Think. Through Most Of The Negative Reviews May Pass It Off As A Horrible Cash In Or As A Bad Simulation, It's Because They Don't Think. They Just Pass Through Life Without Considering The Effics Of Their Existence And This May Sound Stupid From A Guy Who Calls Himself ""Boobs DxD"" But I Use The Name For Irony's Sake But I Digress. The ""Game"" Will Prompt You To Read And Think Time To Time With Obervasations Of The Current State Of The Mountain And Ask Questions That Question It's Existance And Loneness Which In Turn Connects With Me. As Someone Who Suffers From Social Anxiety And Depression, This ""Game"" Made Me Think Why I'm Like The Way I Am. Apart From That, Debris Will Crash Into Your Mountain Such As Hearts, Planes Or Horses. My First Debris Came An Hour In As One Of Those Early Phones And More Comes In By The Hour. You Would Eventually Have Your Mountain Covered In Debris. You Can Play Music On Your Keyboard Which Can Be Used To Stop The Murdurous Dwarf Star From Destroying Your Mountain And Making You Restart.I Would Describe What All These Things Stand For But I Think Its Better For You To Get The ""Game"" And See What You Get As Everyone Has Their Own Thoughts And Perspective On Life. It's Only 99c Which Is A Good Start But It Needs Help On Finding It's Target Audience Since It's Not Really Suited For Steam Where Most Games Are Action Based. Before Leaving This Review Here, I Want To Ponda On One Last Thing With You. This Game Has A Season And Day/Night Cycle. It Goes Through This Without Stopping And The Only Way To Truely Stop It Is By Entering The Option Menu. This Can Have Many Different Interpatations But Mine Is That This ""Game"" Is A Metaphor For Life. It Acts Like A Wake Up Call And With It's Simple But Beautiful Art Direction, It Kinda Prompts You To Leave Your Computer And Explore The Outside World And This Is Why It Appeals To Me. In Conclusion, This Is A ""Game"" That Provokes Discussion. I Usually Buy Games For My Steam Friends For Christmas And This Year, I'm Going To Send Them This Because It Would Be Nice To See How Other People See It. Games Allow Us To Escape Reality With Examples Like GTA's Gangsta Lifestyle Or With No Man Sky's Space Exploration And This ""Game"" Is Something That Pulls From That Reality And Makes Us Think About The Real Life We Have Been Given Before Us, Make Us Go Back In Time To A Time When People Only Had Nature To Entertain Them Nad When You Think About It, Nature Is One Of The Reasons Why Evolution And Our Pursuit For Techlogy Lead Us To Where We Are Today. In A Simple Statment, It's Just A Nice Little Tool That Reminds Us There's More To Life. Now Excuse Me While I Go And Play Painkiller.			"

												Firstly, I feel I should point out that I don't hate this. This is exactly the right price point for this sort of thing -- ""Hey,"" it says, ""you can buy that soda, OR you could buy an almost non-interactive experimental existentialist experience that might stick with you for a while, like an ant farm that occasionally sprouts a keyboard from its side and asks you whether this is truly all there is to life.""It's not something I can in good conscience recommend that another human being PURCHASE, mostly because I'm an adult and I can be haunted by existentialist concerns for free whenever I feel like it, but if you want to put something surreal and vaguely upsetting in your life, you can do worse than Mountain.

												The game's description:""Leave it open - it's designed to run in the periphery of your life. Only interact with it when you feel like it. You can play Mountain while playing other games. If you are not playing it, it will play itself.""It's not a game, it's a screensaver. Leaving a mountain to like have like plants grow on it, people build things, animals do things, etc. and checking back every so often to see what cool things have popped up would actually kind of be a cool concept.Left it running for 8 hours. The mountain currently has some mushrooms, a tennis ball stuck in it, a ball of fire, a gramaphone, a pitchfork, an arrow, and the earth.I had more fun drawing three things at the beginning (determines the seed generation or something).0/10 DIY ""Mountain"" guide: draw a mountain in MS Paint. Leave it running. Come back and gawk how this ""breaks the mold of video games""			"

												Hello, my name is WoozieMoo, I am a fairly avid gamer, though not on Steam. I mostly play League Of Legends, which is not available on the Steam network. But, I'm not here to level us on a first name basis, I am here to announce a surefire 2015 Game of The Year award winner. Truly, nothing has been more deserving in the short history of gaming to win this prestigous award; The Mountain, at first, seemed like a waste of money. Never again will I question the amazing experience that is this game. The Mountain has successfully changed my entire view on life, this Mountain is my compainion when I feel alone, it's the light in the dark, it has guided me through some tough times.Do not believe those who say this game is merely a screensaver, this game is much better than any game on the market for a much better deal. Denounce Far Cry 4 from your Christmas list and instead buy at least 50 copies of Mountain and gift them to everyone you know so that this existential experience may be shared with more than one person at a time.10/10, must, must play again.

												The game's description:""Leave it open - it's designed to run in the periphery of your life. Only interact with it when you feel like it. You can play Mountain while playing other games. If you are not playing it, it will play itself.""It's not a game, it's a screensaver. Leaving a mountain to like have like plants grow on it, people build things, animals do things, etc. and checking back every so often to see what cool things have popped up would actually kind of be a cool concept.Left it running for 8 hours. The mountain currently has some mushrooms, a tennis ball stuck in it, a ball of fire, a gramaphone, a pitchfork, an arrow, and the earth.I had more fun drawing three things at the beginning (determines the seed generation or something).0/10 DIY ""Mountain"" guide: draw a mountain in MS Paint. Leave it running. Come back and gawk how this ""breaks the mold of video games""			"

												This Isn't Really A Game Yet It's Not A Glorified Screensaver. It's A Exprience That Can't Be Explained Properly Which Will Explain Why The Number One Review On This ""Game"" Is Just The Word ""Good"". It's Like Looking After A Pet Rock But It's Bigger And Makes You Think. Through Most Of The Negative Reviews May Pass It Off As A Horrible Cash In Or As A Bad Simulation, It's Because They Don't Think. They Just Pass Through Life Without Considering The Effics Of Their Existence And This May Sound Stupid From A Guy Who Calls Himself ""Boobs DxD"" But I Use The Name For Irony's Sake But I Digress. The ""Game"" Will Prompt You To Read And Think Time To Time With Obervasations Of The Current State Of The Mountain And Ask Questions That Question It's Existance And Loneness Which In Turn Connects With Me. As Someone Who Suffers From Social Anxiety And Depression, This ""Game"" Made Me Think Why I'm Like The Way I Am. Apart From That, Debris Will Crash Into Your Mountain Such As Hearts, Planes Or Horses. My First Debris Came An Hour In As One Of Those Early Phones And More Comes In By The Hour. You Would Eventually Have Your Mountain Covered In Debris. You Can Play Music On Your Keyboard Which Can Be Used To Stop The Murdurous Dwarf Star From Destroying Your Mountain And Making You Restart.I Would Describe What All These Things Stand For But I Think Its Better For You To Get The ""Game"" And See What You Get As Everyone Has Their Own Thoughts And Perspective On Life. It's Only 99c Which Is A Good Start But It Needs Help On Finding It's Target Audience Since It's Not Really Suited For Steam Where Most Games Are Action Based. Before Leaving This Review Here, I Want To Ponda On One Last Thing With You. This Game Has A Season And Day/Night Cycle. It Goes Through This Without Stopping And The Only Way To Truely Stop It Is By Entering The Option Menu. This Can Have Many Different Interpatations But Mine Is That This ""Game"" Is A Metaphor For Life. It Acts Like A Wake Up Call And With It's Simple But Beautiful Art Direction, It Kinda Prompts You To Leave Your Computer And Explore The Outside World And This Is Why It Appeals To Me. In Conclusion, This Is A ""Game"" That Provokes Discussion. I Usually Buy Games For My Steam Friends For Christmas And This Year, I'm Going To Send Them This Because It Would Be Nice To See How Other People See It. Games Allow Us To Escape Reality With Examples Like GTA's Gangsta Lifestyle Or With No Man Sky's Space Exploration And This ""Game"" Is Something That Pulls From That Reality And Makes Us Think About The Real Life We Have Been Given Before Us, Make Us Go Back In Time To A Time When People Only Had Nature To Entertain Them Nad When You Think About It, Nature Is One Of The Reasons Why Evolution And Our Pursuit For Techlogy Lead Us To Where We Are Today. In A Simple Statment, It's Just A Nice Little Tool That Reminds Us There's More To Life. Now Excuse Me While I Go And Play Painkiller.			"

												This is a game where you stare at a mountain. It sometimes talks to you, and you can play the piano with your keyboard and some notes do different things. Leave it on overnight, and some random stuff may just randomly collide into your mountain. Maybe a sword? An egg perhaps? Why not an airplane?It's a pretty funny game. Worth picking up, because of the stuff coliding into your mountain is entertaining to see.			"

												This game brought me out of a dark time in my life. Early on as a child I had a bad experience with a mountain. One time I was hiking and then the mountain took everything I love, my life was gone in an instant. I had been traumatized ever since. For years, my friends, family, even teachers mocked me. I was ashamed to be who I was, to express my feelings. I hid under a cover of darkness. Everyday I'd try not to be seen, but my actions only ended in more despair. I wished for someone, something to help me. Then I found this game. My life turned around. I overcame my fear and took life into my own hands. I had come out triumphant, victorious in a way of life. I was the mountain. The mountain was me. And I was happy.			"

Product received for free
General ImpressionsMountain is a $0.99 experience that you can get as part of the E3 2016 Humble Bundle Experience, and stands at $0.99 on a usual day. The program features a low-poly mountain, some trees, and some ambient noises to set the mood. You are able to make some sounds from typing on your keyboard, but you get what you paid for. I would not purchase it for gaming though.			"

												First off, if you see any review that has a playtime of less than an hour, ignore it because it's more than likely a child crying in impotent rage about how ""dis game dum"" simply because their feeble brain can't handle a concept like this.With that being said, this isn't a game in the traditional sense. If you're expecting exxxtreme mountain action, well, you won't find any. I think calling it a game is rather inaccurate but, that's still okay.However, this is still a pretty neato piece of work. When you start the program, it presents words or questions to you and then has you draw something. The drawings are used as seeds to generate your mountain, to make each mountain unique.The idea is to just leave it running all the time, and you check on it whenever you want. I leave it minimized or off to the side, and then just completely disable the noise if I'm going to play another video game. The ambient noise the program makes is also very pleasant for general computer tasks. You can control the type of ambient noise by zooming in or out of your mountain, to get rainy/windy noises to a tao/zen like sound for outer space.As you check your mountain, you'll find more and more items piling up on it. As of this writing (and leaving it running for 12 hours), I've got a clock, a top-hat, a barbell, a biplane, and a cement brick. You can interact with these by clicking on the object and holding it down, and you can either toss it back out to space or redrop it somewhere else on the mountain.Various things will grow as well, and so far I've got various kinds of oakish and pine type trees going. You'll also get different kinds of weather going as well, depending on however the hell your mountain feels.There will be an audio cue at random, at which point a ""thought"" will pop up. The thoughts oddly put a smile on my face :). You can provoke ""thoughts"" as well by hitting '.' (the period key).So in summary, it's a really weird concept at first, but the key really is to just leave it running all the time. This piece is totally worth a dollar, maybe even more than that cause of how cool it is :)			"

												This game will leave you with a profound sense of zen.Although there is little you can do but observe for the first few minutes, it's still a fully immersive experience. When you're bored, play around with the musical notes and see if you can unlock the different modes. Turn down the graphical settings (to avoid overheating your GPU/CPU) and leave it to run while you're away. You'll be pleasantly surprised at how different your mountain is every time.Well worth the money. I would highly recommend this. "

												If only it had a fast forward button. Look this is not a game. I love these kinds of simulations in general but as it stands the progression of time is too slow and the point of the ... thing is lost on me. This was disappointing, I was looking forward to this game. If you like watching dull mountains then this ""game"" is perfect for you, but I'm sure you'll be happy that you can skip the video forward at least.

												I swear, game critics are becoming more like film critics every day. That makes me sad. Don't dig too deep here. Mountain is the epitome of nonsense. It's an existential foray into ""it means what you want it to mean."" I can get the same experience staring at the pile of dirt in my neighbor's yard.Don't cave to curiosity on this one. If you want a pointless game then go get Dear Esther. Or Thirty Flights of Loving. Holy crap I can't believe I just suggested that.			"

												Mountain... where to start? It's a screen saver that changes over time.  You can save the state, and interact with it.  Your interactions result in feedback.  And, the experience is a mildly entertaining one.  There is a definite end to the game, if you can call it that.  The graphics are pretty, not horribly advanced mind you.  It is a computer hog and will use a decent amount of resources.  Overall, I would rate it Game/10.  I would say this 'game' is worth the $0.99 that's being charged, if nothing else, for the experience.			"

												My Mountain died multiple times w/o any interaction.So yeah after 40+ hours of letting this run and streaming it, I will try to give a better review of what this title is.It is a screensaver that is claiming to be art, while titled a game.The game itself is labled with features such as no controls. This is false, the game will trigger events that can lead to mountain death, and there are interactions that you can take with the Mountain, and the objects that it attracts.I am sorry but text input is a control and affects how you ""play"" this game.This is truly a mindless screensaver that is a scam. This is a sad attempt at art and should not be taken seriously.If you want a screensaver that will crash, and requires user input, then sure, this might be the right thing for you.  If you really expect anything more than that, avoid this title.			"

												Those games that are fun because they're odd and quirky? This isn't one of them. The hype surrounding Mountain is that it's an anti-game, or un-game. ""You were expecting to DO something? That's not what this is! You don't get it!"" Well, great. It's a virtual snowglobe with a cloak of gratuitous inscrutability and whimsy, riding on the coattails of the film 'Her'. You can get the gist of Mountain from a five-minute YouTube video.There are other developers on Steam who've put serious time and effort into making their one-buck games entertaining. Go support them instead.I do enjoy leaving it running in the background as a white-noise generator, as the weather effects and ambience are quite well done.			"

												This game is Bliss, Peace, and Tranquility.  Essentially $0.99 therapy...  Anyone who cannot see that this game isn't and will never be anything heart-racing or exciting should never have considered this game.  The game itself shocked me, for I've never experienced something of this sort.  Additionally, yes, I do consider this a game, not a ridiculous but interactive screensaver.I'm not going to get into philosophical things about how this game ""mirrors the Soul"", but I will say that I had an interesting time.  I WANTED to watch my mountain, I wanted to see it exist and  experience the simulation.  It isn't that it was exciting, but it was more so mezmerizing.  When the mountain had a thought, I was there and comprehending.  It's like watching a baby take it's first steps, beginning its journey through life.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, unless you have ever felt alone or bored will sitting in your computer chair.  I get a feeling that I'm accompanied by...another entity while playing, or rather leaving it open in the background.  But there is definatly only a specific variety of people that could enjoy this simulation to the fullest extent.			"

												Those games that are fun because they're odd and quirky? This isn't one of them. The hype surrounding Mountain is that it's an anti-game, or un-game. ""You were expecting to DO something? That's not what this is! You don't get it!"" Well, great. It's a virtual snowglobe with a cloak of gratuitous inscrutability and whimsy, riding on the coattails of the film 'Her'. You can get the gist of Mountain from a five-minute YouTube video.There are other developers on Steam who've put serious time and effort into making their one-buck games entertaining. Go support them instead.I do enjoy leaving it running in the background as a white-noise generator, as the weather effects and ambience are quite well done.			"

												Probably the most accurate mountain simulator i've ever played.  The best way to 'play' Mountain is on your second monitor doing other things.  It will keep you serenely in context of the imperceptible slippage of time with occasional comments about the shifting weather over the days.  Will work your CPU processes though			"

												If only it had a fast forward button. Look this is not a game. I love these kinds of simulations in general but as it stands the progression of time is too slow and the point of the ... thing is lost on me. This was disappointing, I was looking forward to this game. If you like watching dull mountains then this ""game"" is perfect for you, but I'm sure you'll be happy that you can skip the video forward at least. I'm puzzled how it got so many positive reviews here.Subjective: 3/5Objective: 3/5 Graphics: A Content: C Handling: Bhttp://localhost/playedtoday/build/mountain.html

												I swear, game critics are becoming more like film critics every day. That makes me sad. Don't dig too deep here. Mountain is the epitome of nonsense.

												Я не думаю, что многие люди не видят ценность в Горе, и когда люди делают, они стремятся просто усложнить игру так, как она есть. Это не значит, что это «игра». Разработчики игры целенаправленно говорят об этом изначально: «Оставьте это открытым - оно предназначено для работы на периферии вашей жизни. Только взаимодействуйте с ним, когда вам хочется. Вы можете играть в гору, играя в другие игры. Если вы не играете Он, он будет играть сам. "". Снова гора просто означает оставаться открытой, и вы можете вернуться к ней, когда захотите. Возможно, вы не сразу заметите его внешний вид, но вы можете найти его позже ... надеюсь. Но опять же, каковы стандарты «игры»? Должны ли мы просто отделять гору просто потому, что это возможно вне нормы? Напротив! Различный опыт приводит к различным точкам зрения, которые делают вас более открытыми. Так могут люди действительно заявить, что Гора - не игра, а скринсейвер? Существует множество способов просмотра горы и ее просмотра, поскольку скринсейвер - одна из наиболее популярных деморализованных точек зрения, к которым многие так привыкли. Поэтому можно рассматривать гору просто как автономную, а не сравнивать ее с более современными проблемами. Или можно сравнить, но тем самым теряешь номинал самой игры. Я думаю, что теперь я решил, что эта «игра» может быть скринсейвером или просто не «игрой» вообще.С другой стороны, разработчики заявили следующее: «Если у вас неприятный шторм или скучная ночь, сыграйте мелодию (используя клавиатуру), и время ускорится». Гора там для вас, когда вы решите вернуться к ней и сыграть ее. Я думаю, что это распространенное заблуждение. Это не столько игра для вас, сколько вспомогательная и поддерживающая игра рядом с вами. Тем не менее, есть много способов увидеть Горы, как с любой формой проблемы в жизни. Но Путь Гора был построен, порой непривлекательный для глаз, позволяет ему показать вам другой путь и, возможно, тот, который вы, возможно, не видели раньше.Но вам не нужно следить за тем, что говорят разработчики. «Игра» должна воспроизводиться в зависимости от того, как вам это нравится. Если вы чувствуете, что вас обманули, купив эту игру, тогда сделайте два шага назад и подумайте об аспектах этой «игры» и элементов. Возможно, вы начинаете замечать замечательный окружающий звук, который играет среди ночи, или, может быть, вы влюблены в то, как полосы солнца касаются вашей Горы. Но вам может не понравиться все это, чтобы по-настоящему насладиться игрой. Возможно, у вас есть все эти игры, и у вас появилась любовь к игре. Или, может быть, вы пытаетесь насмехаться над игрой, но в свою очередь вы уже привыкли к игре. Я, например, не могу ответить на этот вопрос о том, понравится ли геймеру это или нет, но все зависит от того, кто его покупает, и готов ли он открыть свое сердце и ум.Теперь Гора действительно ваша гора и ваша собственная собственность? Я думаю, что в концепции только геймера для геймера можно составить представление о том, действительно ли Гора является само воплощением, или игрок действительно управляет Горой. Гора не говорит с нами и не рассказывает нам о ее мыслях? Или это передача скрытого сообщения туда, где мы могли бы быть его собственным порождением, и это - мастер. Каким бы способом вы не сочли нужным, существует достаточно много способов увидеть гору, как в любой игре. В горах может не быть сюжетной линии, не стрельбы, не любовного треугольника (если только вы не начнете что-то делать между вещами, Горой и небом, и в этом случае вы, возможно, пошли слишком далеко), но в Горе есть Момент одиночества, в котором вы можете заметить вещи в играх, которые могут повторяться в горах. Возможно, Гора может содержать все эти элементы, в которых вы создаете историю. Гора всегда может быть сюжетной линией, в которой вы, геймер, идете по дорожке с Горой к месту назначения в ваше подсознание. В горах многое предстоит сделать, и ваше воображение будет блокировано, а логика только помешает этому. Но если вы так решите сделать это, вы не обидели никого, кроме себя, в отрицании возможных сил в самой игре. Этот обзор не может показать мой нейтралитет по отношению к игре, но я только хочу объяснить геймеру, что гора может быть акцентирована только игроком. "

												I want everyone to understand... this isnt a game.... this is life.You are not meant to ""Play"" it... there is no set story, there is no ""amazing"" over advertised gameplay. This is a new type of art.this is an Ambient game. you let it run while you do other things, if you get bored and have nothing to to, go play on the mountain. play some music, name all the flora.I have a bush named Tim.... did you know Tim cant talk?aaand Tim... jsut dissapeared? :C bye Tim, i wish you a safe journy wherever you may have gone!anyways. sometimes a thing will happen, and you will have that thing for a while, and then the thing will be gone. some things stay longer than others... you grow attached to your mountain like you might grow to love a small fuzzy anim-Tim just came back...? and... he's a bigger plant now? Good job Tim! i knew you could grow up into a big bush if you ate all your vitamins!But i digress, you ARE the mountain, and the mountain is you, you make friends with the all the nice things that grow on you! like Tim! Tim is by far my bestest friend yet! and i've only owned the game for an hour! soooo a Miniature planetoid just landed next to Tim... Im going to name it Karin... Hello Karen!This is my final Message to you all. This game is better than browsing tumblr for hours on end, its better than checking facebook. you can actually just open up your browser and do all those things, and you can go check on your mountain, and see ALL the new friends you've made. It might be the past midnight tiredness, or the fact this game is like being stranded on a lone island in the middle of a vast nothingness, where you feel so alone you have to name inanimate objects so they can me your friends, but its alot like life. Some things happen that you like, some things happen you dont. rarely does anything last permanently, but the things that do, make the best friends of all...-TyirelPS: I am not Crazy... i am MountainPSS: I AM MOUNTAIN....

												Have you ever wondered how it feels like to stand still for millions of years? Me neither. This game is the most realistic simulator out there. All you do is stand still and wait for time to pass - just like a mountain! You can also, for some reason, play music with your keyboard. I can't imagine a better way to spend your time than playing happy version of Freezing Moon to your mountain. Unfortunately there's no grass in this game so I can't combine this realistic experience with my favorite hobby; watching the grass grow. Hopefully we'll get a grass DLC soon!This game also has a psychological test when you start to play. I in fact had to rely on a walkthrough to be able to pass this part of the game. I really like this feature - keeps adhd kids away from the game. The roleplay feel in this game is immersive! You can identify yourself as whatever mountain you want to be! Stone mountain? Sure! Grass mountain? Sure! Feminist-bipolar-misandric-racefluid-tumblr-mountain? Yup!I'd like to end this in-depth review by mentioning the insanely realistic weather system! Rain doesn't go through any roof! Mountain - 1, Skyrim - 0A rock solid 8/10 because it lacks grass. "

												To be clear this is more of a screensaver then a gameAnd let's be honest, its basically a screen saver that has a piano you can playHowever it is only 99 cents, so is it worth it? In my opinion it is, but is this the game you'll spend 20 hours with? Well most certainly no, this is a game you leave running while you're off doing something,and you can come back to an amazing environmentThe game is beautiful, and the piano is a nice touch, it speeds up the game when playedYou should really only buy this game if you want to explore the many proceduraly generated environments,because you won't find yourself playing the game, just enjoying the sight of itBefore you jump at the chance to get a very cheap game you better ask yourself if you want itfor the graphical effects, because if you don't you should probably just hold your money.But if you can get past that fact it is certainly worth the money			"

												With Mountain, you can simulate the feelings that come from being a mountain. This game isn't a game. It's an experience that you'll always remember within yourself. You will experience the sensation of a solitary existence in a vast empty void accompanied only by assorted objects and the weather. The days will be bright and warm. The nights will be gloomy but beautiful. The rain will make you feel cold but will bring a sort of comfort. The cold, cold snow will freeze you but you will feel an inner warmth. You will begin to accept your new life as a mountain as you transcend your mere mortal existence. You will become something much, much more. You will become a mountain and a god. Buy Mountain today.			"

												They are not even trying. That's what bugs me the most about this conceptually interesting screensaver. If there were attention to detail. If it were beautiful to look at. Instead, we get a bland-looking mountain, with clouds that pass right through the rock and the occasional piano track that wasn't even played on a real piano. I realize this is old software but it's not like you couldn't precompute wind patterns at the mountain top or like there was so much interactivity to program that there was no time to put a bit of smarts into the physics. You basically had one job. Also, how hard can it be to get someone to letting you use their piano for like ten minutes?			"

												I'd like to begin with pros and cons. Pros ;; The whole concept was creative, to say the least. Song codes tomake things rain, brilliant! It was fun watching objects fall from space and crash on your planet (while chatting about it to my girlfriend) and readingyour mountain's thoughts.Cons ;; I couldn't pick up a few objects, and it was very bothersome to seeobjects miss your mountain, though I guess it's not the game's fault. It wasdifficult to find the exit game button, which was not inside the menu. I hadto figure that if I could shrink the game, I would get out. Overall, it's a very nice game which tests your ammount of patience.			"

												Okay, lets get one thing straight, this is a game in which you, The Mountain, don't do anything. You're supposed to let nature take it course and eventually stuff will appear on your mountain. For all the people who want to play some sort of God-Like role where you can do anythingt, that's not the case. You can't control nature, nature is unpredictable.For all the negative reviews it gets for being a ""Screensaver"" is completely irrelevant. It's a game in which you leave open while you play another game, browse the internet, or even leave the game running while you go to bed and in the morning, you can see how much stuff your mountain has when you wake up.It's a fun, cheap game that I sure will put tons of hours into.

												First off, complainging about a $.99 game that clearly shows that it is not much more than a random event genorator is kind of sad. That being said, I do quite enjoy this ""game"". Great ambient sound effects make it calming to play in the background of my daily tasks. Compairing mountains with a friend is also quite enjoyable. I feel that the best part of this game is the fact that it can make you feel emotions. Thats right. A simple mountain with ramdom objects that gives text prompst every one in a while can make you feel. You can feel the lonleyness, or the joy of a nice day. Buy the game, its cheap and enjoyable to a certain audience...			"

												Pro-tip: typing 'as,zb' (minus the quotes) makes it more interesting.The game is essentially a simulator of life in a sense. It is about a mountain that is floating in space- yeah, you heard me, SPACE!- and has random things happen to it. It conveys its feelings sometimes and can be mildly interacted with by the player.It is basically a game that, as said on the store page, should be run in the background. It isn't something you're supposed to sit and stare at and wait for something to happen (I mean, you can if you want, I wouldn't recommend it).You can play piano notes on your keyboard by hitting the A-K and Z-,(comma) keys, supposing you use a QWERTY style keyboard. Hitting some combinations will unlock different modes such as blood rain, fish rain and constant snow (those are the three they give you on the store page). There might be more, I have no idea really. Hitting these keys can also change the speed of rotation of the mountain.Randomly, objects such as bowling pins, crates, hearts, steel girders, etc. will fly from space into the mountain. You can click and hold on these items to drag them around the mountain and move their placement. As stated above, your mountain apparently can die. It is dramatic and depressing, because mountain is love, mountain is life.Lastly, if you hit .(period), the mountain will say random things to you as if it is expressing its feelings. Along with this, it will randomly say things if just left alone for periods of time as well.Over all, if you're expecting a very interactive, hands-on game, then this isn't the game for you. This game is meant to sit there and essentially just be for random events / fun, as if it were a screensaver. I believe it was made for the user to ponder life and their own existence based on the feelings and events that occur to / with the mountain.			"

												OKAY OKAY OKAY, so when I saw this game at first I thought that looks a bit crap, but then my ""friend"" talked me into it. My God what would I have done my life if I had not reconsidered? I would have missed out on this coming of age story. This game chronicals, In real time, the trials and trivulations of life as a mountain. It covers both those first few hesitant glacial gouges and contental plate pushes and even continues on to depict the effect of the spacial void on the later stages of this beautiful mountain's life. I think the developer has achieved something truely amazing here they not only borrowed money from my debit account but in the same foul swoop they also filled my mind with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t as well as a keyboard for some reason.

												Looks nice and creates a meditative setting. However, there is not much you can do. You can watch your mountain (what you're doing most of the time) and play tunes on your keyboard. Occasionally your mountain will express a thought, which are mostly generic, like ""it's cold outside"" generic. (Well, it's a mountain after all...) Rarely some items appear. In ~2h running, all I got were some extra plants and a random crowbar(?).It's meant to be run in the background. There is a problem with that:When you run this game in window mode, it demands ~30% of my CPU (Core i7). The problem is: That costs money. For both, the power of the CPU and for fans required to cool it down. So ""playing"" this ""game"" is rather expensive, even if it costs only < 1€. Instead, if you play in fullscreen, you don't get event notifications. It's hard to tell if the game is running at all.I can't really recommend this game. Not much happens. Instead, it (indirectly) contributes to the pollution of the environment. 4.5/10Constructive criticism towards the developers:Please add some more things players can do instead of just watching. Preferably something the can change the development of your mountain. And please find a way to decrease CPU usage.			"

												i'm just gonna write a short review, as i don't wanna waste much time with this game.i kinda like this but i don't have the patience to wait for items to come.it's a great screensaver, but it would be much more fun to have more freedom in the game.for example you could spawn stuff, zoom further out, get free camera. that sort of stuffmaybe control the weather, so you can affect your mountain, and if you don't do it correctly. something happens?i don't know, it just feels empty, but maybe that's just the way this game intended to be.i do recommend it tho, while i still regret buying it , as i don't use it as muchwouldn't recommend to any of my friends, but i see why people would like it so a positive reviewTL;DR- not bad screensaver			"

												This game, although I only have 10 minutes on it, has changed my life.This is not a game.This is a life story, of a mountain.This is your mountain's life story.You must watch it.Watch it until you can watch no more.But even then you must watch on as you may miss something in this mountain's life.This game teaches users to watch what happens in life closely.Otherwise, you might miss something important.This game. No. This life event. Is something users must cheerish and hold dearly for it has taught life lessons.Life lessons that will be needed for the rest of ones life.You may say, 'But it is only game?'And I say, 'It is not game, it is way of life.'

												Greatest screen saver of all time. I'm going to do as suggested and just leave it on in the background to suck up my CPU and memory so I can't play real games. I'm just kidding. You should totally get this. You see, it's this thing...and you draw some things, then there's a mountain..and you just leave it there. That's how mountain works. Remember screen savers? In the days when those old CRT monitors with Windows 3.11 would get super bad screen burn that would never go away? That's what this does, only with a quad core CPU and memory. And you draw pictures to tell it how to procedurally generate. I guess. Yeah. 10/10 best screen saver simulator EVER.			"

												A game that by most reviews seem to be fun, isnt. You stare at a mountain. You could do much more productive and enjoyable things than stare at a cgi mountain, given Ive only wasted half an hour of my life on this, I dont have much of a say, but thats long enough to realize the stupidity of the game.

												Honestly this game was fantastic. Act 2 was where it really got good. Once Benjamin relayed the message to the resistance, things got INSANE. One thing I didn't like was when he shot Anna but she had it coming, as we all know. If you haven't finished the game yet I would highly recommend it, there's a lot more to the story than you think. It tackles various meaningful messages such as love, loss, virtue, and the ever so important honor. Do yourself a favor and take a journey you never thought could exist on any platform of media. I know the beginning is slow, but please keep playing, you won't be let down. One thing I would have changed about the game would be how the control scheme is set up for switching weapons from the backpack. It took me forever to master it and once I did the game was about over. 10/10 I would recommend Mountain to anyone with a pulse.			"

												This will be my first review. The moment I started this game, I suddenly had this strong urge to submit a review.I saw this in a bundle and was skeptical at first whether I will enjoy it or not. It was the former. It is true that I merely have a few minutes clocked but, it felt as if time have slowed as I watched my mountain and played with the keys (which was purely accidental)-- from A-K and Z-M--. Go ahead, try playing calming tones while watching your mountain face the seasons, grow reeds and vegetation, and among many others. As an aspiring programmer, this is an absolute lifesaver because of the stress that piles up whenever a deadline approaches.  This is not for everyone, that I say. I have a few says about the menu but only minimal. If you are seeking a game where your stress is calmed by beautiful music, sweet tones, and watching the nature take it slowly, then this is an absolute must for you.			"

May as well let your dog (or cat) play on the piano and watch NEwton's Cradle for a few hours.Now why I reccomend this...Great gift for family and friendsGreat way to pass the timeGreat way to overheat you PCGreat way to lose 95mb and 99cents			"

												If this game cost more I would have an even longer review; it is not a game. If you want to say that ""It's supposed to delve into philosophy and expand the definition of a game"" thing, fine. good for you. but don't put it on steam. This is literally nothing more than a rotating entity with changing backgrounds. I don't want to be to hard on it (Because it's only a dollar), but it has no purpose other than to waste your time. I could hop onto Netbeans and code something like this in under an hour, and this really worries me about the gaming market. With all the press that this game is getting, and amount of copies sold of this tiny game, some people will start making games like this simply to make a quick buck and write them off as games that ""delve into philosophy and expand the definition of a game"" to cover their greed. I don't understand why so many people give this a positive review, as it doesn't deserve it and only encourages people to make clones of it.			"

												I feel as if I am an actual mountain. I can't explain it, but it's the most beautiful thing that I've ever done in my entire life. I would rate 10/10 but I don't feel as if that does this game justice. If I could get rid of every other game and only play this one I would. Actually I think I will. This is game is full of surprises, it is both shockingly entertaining, and very emotional. I have never cried, or laughed more in my entire life. This game is the best thing that has ever happened to me, and if you don't get it then we can't be friends.			"

												This is an interesting concept.  You play as a ""God,"" over this piece of land.  You can't really do too much with it though.  Its a nice little idea I suppose.  You get to play some melodys though which speed up o slow down the time on the mountain.  It will continue to progress even if you aren't playing with it.  I bought it because I had a dollar left on my steam wallet soooo...yeah..I think it is semi entertaining.  I don't understand the complaints and downvotes being given for this game due to ""its not a game,"" or ""its a screensaver.""  It literally tells you in its description whats going to happen when you play it and what to look for.     Its a nice, peaceful thing that can be a positive experience.			"

												I never like to say bad things about other people's work as i am sure who ever put this together must have spent some time and effort on it. But honestly save that 99p and put it towards buying a leadless pencil or a decaff latte or an inflatable darts board or alcohol free beer or an extra long bungee cord or see-through curtains or a sponge knife or chicken McNuggets or really, absolutely anything else whatsoever. Its really not a lot of money but I do feel mildly offended that i no longer have it. As a matter of fact I would feel happier if I had simply just lost a £1 coin down the back of my sofa, at least that way I would have the joy of maybe one day finding it again.I am tempted to email steam and offer them another 99p to permanently remove this ""game"" from my account.If you feel the need to play this, go to youtube and watch any gameplay video of it, its free that way. I have never reviewed a game before and I believe I have taken more enjoyment in writing this than I did witnessing this waste of computer code. DO NOT BUY. I honestly wish software was tangible enough to set on fire.			"

While you listen to the piano chords linger through space you sit and think about life. Watching this mountain spin. you think about all the important things, you rethink many important issues. This Game is literally refreshing even though you dont really ""play"" a game you still experience something new. its only 99 cents Buy this game watch the magic happen and feel refreshed.			"

												I love the concept. It's a neat little application to have idling while you're doing other things. However, it's far too resource intensive for something that is meant to be running in the background. If left alone, with no other games or applications running, Mountain causes my GPU to heat to an upwards of 50 degrees celsius. That is absurd. This is a sign of shoddy programming. Please clean up your work, I'm very surprised this wasn't addressed before release. Did the developer never run the game themselves?			"
