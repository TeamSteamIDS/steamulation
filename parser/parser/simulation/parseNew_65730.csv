												video of me doing one of the extreme time trials in this game:


YouTube™ Video: Take On Helicopters: Noisecontrollers Time Trial - 'So High' in 03:33 

			Views: 2,001		

			My best time trial run - in 3min 33secs, beating the gold and special noisecontrollers time. This was about my 10th attempt and half of them resulted in fatal crashes.		

Take On Helicopters has similar strengths and weaknesses to the ARMA series, only more so. It tries to bridge the gap between simulators and conventional video games, which it does with some success. There are few niche games like this, so it is good when one shows up, even if it is not perfect. It reminds me a bit of SimCopter from 1996.Realism and flight physics are very good but not perfect. There is a start-up procedure, but it is simplified. There is no autopilot but there is an optional auto-hover helper. The controls have the same kind of problems as in ARMA, and I had to spend a long time tweaking them. Unlike most sims, you control a human as you would in any shooter game, who in turn can board and pilot helicopters realistically.There is a career mode that has interesting missions and a decent believable story. It takes 10-15 hours but I wish it was longer. There is also a small management aspect - you can buy new equipment, inspect your helicopter, and pay for maintenance to prevent breakdowns. While the voice acting is good, it does have a low-budget / mod feel with crude character animations etc. And as with ARMA, some missions were a bit difficult, and had unreliable scripting, forcing me to retry a few times. Overall, I still enjoyed it.Then there are the more challenging time trials, where you have to fly as fast as you can through virtual hoops placed between buildings and under bridges etc. The courses range from moderate to insane - these are awesome, but require you to have mastered the helicopter controls . They are probably the most intense and challenging races I have tried in any game, partly thanks to the additional vertical dimension - car racing games are so 2-dimensional by comparison (pun intended).Contrary to what most say, the graphics look good and I get a decent 60 fps with only ocasional slowdowns to 40 fps (with an i5-4570 and overclocked GTX660). The Seattle environment is detailed and beautiful. I did have to carefully tweak the video settings though. My youtube video stutters a bit but that is just youtube, the game was smooth.Sadly multiplayer does not work, due to the gamespy server shutdown. While you can just about play with a keyboard or controller, you really do need a '3-axis + thruster' joystick (about $30).Despite its flaws, I would strongly recommend this to mature patient gamers willing to try a flight sim.

												I own this game quite a while, occasionally taking free flights in Seattle and i must admit - level of detail in envelopment is far beyond for any flight simulator game even today. There is probably thousand of different models for buildings, not only for landmark, but any major building have it's own model and detailed texturing. Those also all collision enabled, meaning you can crash or land on. Even trees are crashable 3D models. You can even land and get out of your bird and start playing ARMAII in Seattle. Or in normal ARMAII maps - if you own it in Steam.I was so looking forward to start playing single player campaign, imagining limitless country of fun with all goodness above combining with full range of civil helicopter's activities, starting with simple taxi missions and ending with sling load operation and search-and-rescue mission using FLIR (thermal vision camera).To my very disappointment there is - as we russians say - one spoon of♥♥♥♥♥♥in barrel of honey. And it's flying itself. I'm not IRL pilot so i can't explain things in the right worlds, but i own (and fly almost daily) DCS UH-1 and X-Plane 10 with some payware helos, so i guess i know that is right and that is wrong. And TKOH helicopters are behaves wrong. More of that - they all share same dynamics, just with different coefficients. For example all of them have same speed. It's not like i didn't notice that playing free flights, i just thought i could deal with slow response, overreacting titling and nonexistent transition on lightest bird in campaign.Turns out what with adding more power by coefficients thing only becomes worse, so heaviest copter not only overreacting inputs (but still slow) but tends to get lift with smallest lateral movement and suddenly drop it then you manage to get steady. Combined with oversaturated (remember - we have add power) tendency for forward movement (you need a several degrees of back pitch to hold it in place) makes most docile and presumable easy to hover craft unmanageable. So on second container in 7th mission of campaign i ragequit.Speaking of campaign - in 7 (+2 sidemissions) missions i did, there was only two civilian missions. Three if you count whale seeing mission, but single engine helo without emergency water landing equipment not sounds like civilian job for me here. And there is more of such nonsense. Why two-engine helicopters goes down after one failed? Yeah we have two turbine for fancier look. Why we need rope insertion on flat roof in heavy wind, especially after i perfectly landed before mission marker even appears.Concluding, i wouldn't recommend this game to any flight sim enthusiast. Despite perfect envelopment flying itself is unbearably broken and won't be fixed because of 3rd party component BI have to rely here.			"

												CAUTIOUS THUMBS UP:  *THE FREE DEMO HAS VIRTUALLY THE SAME CONTENT AND ENTERTAINMENT VALUE*I DO like it, but wouldn't buy it until you try the demo first.But its saving grace is the ""Reloaded"" update in the full game which means you can fly around in maps from other BI games (Arma1, Arma2 chernarus, tavania etc), which makes it cool and worth the money if you have some other  Bohemia Interactive Military Sims already (the demo can't run mods and add-ons)Unless its in a Steam Sale I wouldn't recommend this as a heli-sim by itself when there are far better (and free) flight simulators out there with a lot more content.But if you just want to chill out flying an easy helicopter around, the sound effects are ok, the missions are fairly simple and basic, but at the end of the day most people will have to leave the graphics on medium and probably just fly around a bit in free flight while they're waiting for dinner then put it down and forget about it for a while.on a scale of 1 to 10 for being memorable:   4TL:DRMaybe I missed the point of this game - But it doesn't seem to have a unique selling point or do anything particularly well enough to make you come back to it very often			"

												I don't really recommend this game to 1) people who consider themselves average helicopter pilots in arma 2/3 because the learning curve requrired in this game is much higher and you need a very good understanding of helicopter physics to jump into this game.2) people who seek a high fidelity, ultra realistic helicopter flight simulation. VBS3.0 or DCS UH-1H Huey gives budding pilots a much better benchmark for those who want to see how helicopter perform in real life.3) people who don't have joysticks/pedals/throttles/TRACK IR's- as soon as I jumped into the game, it just felt wrong trying to fly with a mouse and keyboard. Like with most sims nowadays, it's not so much the game, it's the hardware you use on the game. So consider trying the demo first with your current setup, and ugrade as neccessary if you feel the need to.Hope this helped anyone.			"

												Definitely the most relaxing flight simulator I've played.  It's very good to play while trying to chill out.  Joystick highly recommended, as is a TrackIR or FreeTrack (or Oculus Rift hopefully one day), so that you can sit back and enjoy what helicopters do best: cruise.The Armed Assault engine makes the helicopters fun to control without overly complex controls, and the skill envelope is just high enough to make it a fun game.  Bohemia Interactive surprised me with this one.The campaign is fun, too.  Mechanic mode minigame that saves your company money, while immersing you in a small-business feeling.  Every mission really adds to that feeling, as well.4 / 5			"

												A very unique kind of balance between a game and a simulator, that certainly won't fit anyone. I review and rate this game as it succeeded as a flight simulator to me, a flight simulator ethusianist.If you haven't noticed already, this is Arma. The same engine, only with upgraded visuals, picture-in-3D picture availability, and a highly realistic flight model for helicopters. It also works like an Operation Arrowhead, that you can mount all Arma 2 DLCs into this, plus some ToH-specific expansions (yeah, you can play the normal Arma at this, with tanks, Chernarus, guns n stuff).The main feature of this game, it's flight engine- it feels pretty damn realistic, even when compared to FSX or other simulators. I've spent some years on FSX and had no problems in X-Plane, but this game still needed some balls to master on the most realistic difficulty.Do not play this game without a joystick, you're gonna miss a lot or not even be able to fly at all. I don't know if it's even possible to handle the helicopters safely at the most realistic setting, without majorly using the auto-hover option, flying only by mouse or keyboard. Joystick settings provide all forms of options, such as rebinding some axis, deathzones or individual sensitivities. Controls use the classical, Arma style of options, which was already confusing enough at Arma 2 but copied all the controls over to here and added several more to that, to make it even harder to navigate.The campaign is quite fun and challenging. Between each missions, you're able to dwell around on the helipad, check your helicopter for issues, upgrade or repaint it and also buy a different one (for an ammount of cash that takes some time to get. By upgrades I mean usually mission-only equipment, such as a camera or a hook, but you can also buy doors, seats or a rear mirror which might come useful sometimes. It's not much of pimp yo choppa, and could be a bit more extended. But rather than that, I would have more than just three god damn machines, it also has no unique rideable planes. The description is kinda misleading in here:WHAT IT SAYS: Three classes of helicoptersWHAT IT MEANS: Three helicopters, each with many different liveries or custom one-color RGB paintingCampaign is easy to screw up by selling a wrong helicopter and if you do so, you're bound to doing extremely tideous mission which self-repeats itself and takes even from 30 to 60 minutes (by adequately using the time acceleration), dozens of times. Asked other people several times but noone replied, because the community for this game (on both BIS forums and here) is probably dead.The multiplayer is also dead. The server list is not working and ToH did not receive it's own server list hosting, like other Arma games did. The multiplayer mission making of this game has a high potential, but nobody apparently used it, as the community also doesn't care much about this thing (but you can still fly n fight around with friends if one can host). The new maps are HUGE, the Asia is like several kilometers across (expect a lower ground detail aswell, but it has one very large city full of accessible buildings, several times bigger than Chernogorsk), so flying in the asian map wouldn't feel ""small"" at all, even with a C-130, where amazing missions could be created. But my goal is to rate this game for it's realism, not for how much armaish flaws or bad optimisation it has. And if you're a flight sim lover looking for challenges, I can't think of any harder helicopter flying experience. But if you expect a good combat experience as in Arma, lots of multiplayer action, detailed terrain and can't run Arma 2 decently with full settings and 3000 - 4000 visibility, you should rather leave this game where it is			"

Posted: February 3, 2015
												I don't understand why there are so many negative comments on the game, I've played Microsoft Flight Simulator X and Longbow II as well as Take on Helicopters, and all have their strengths and weaknesses, but this game felt like I was actually learning to fly a helicopter as some of the fast paced missions stumped me for a bit, but with persistence and saving at key points, it has been a very good experience.Should I play this?:If you enjoyment of being immersed in a good story, and upgrading the various helicopters to take on more missions, this will not disappoint.  The military sims are enjoyable, and definitely challenging, but seem to hurry past the learning to fly and focus more on combat.  There is a good mix of civilian, transport, and law enforcement/military missions which allow you to earn money and buy all the upgrades, there can be an issue if you sell a helicopter you need, so picking up extra missions is helpful.  I would do often walk around inspections of each heli before taking on a mission to significantly lower the repair bill.Realism:Without a doubt, this is the most realistic feeling physics in a flight simulator I've played to date.  With flight Simulator X I almost feel the helis were an afterthought addition because it lacks certain flight physics that require the constant adjustments required to keep the helicopters in flight.  In Take On Helicopters, the wind and added weight of personnel and cargo changes how the helicopters fly, the copters accrue damage and can feel like a rickety bucket of bolts, giving an impending doom feeling before they ultimately reach maximum entropy and fall out of the sky.  I had more than a few instances where I killed the Huey because I failed to properly finesse them through the trial without burying the throttle and burning out the engine.Bugs:Every simulator has it's glitches, I've seen more glitches in Flight Sim X than I have in TOH.  Only one instance have I seen a glitch and pressed escape, then selected skip in the menu.			"

												Take on Helicopters is fairly accurate simulator for helicopters, although some aspects could use some improvement.  But TOH also is a vehicle simulator.  You can do dough-nuts in a Hummer if you like, or jump hills.  It also models bullet trajectories pretty good.  TOH is more than just a helicopter simulator.  It is a gaming platform for player made missions.  Single and multi-player.Flying Helicopters in accurate flight models has a bit of a learning curve.  This is what makes TOH good and bad.  Good for hard-core simmers, bad for the kids that just want to shoot something.  Career mode is just training to teach you to fly and get used to what the game offers.  Player made missions is where the real action is.  Well worth the money.			"

												If you're looking for a semi-realistic civilian helicopter-simulation, this is it. Some might be turned off by the the lack of things you can do in the cockpit. However, I think that you can do JUST enough to make it fun, without being forced to read a manual at the same time. You will need an above-average computer to even run this game, since the engine is.. Well.. Poorly optimized. Sit back, take off, fly civilians around, take pictures of whales and listen to your favorite songs while enjoying a glass of whisky - that is what this game is about - and it does JUST that, pretty darn good.

												This is not ""brand new"" in any way. It's just the arma2 engine with almost all aircraft removed and some of them now sold back at half the game price each. It's like they're mocking us. Such dishonest advertising is immoral.+ Helpful basic flight instruments at the bottom of the screen+ The one big-ish heli they saved is a good looking one.+ Felt really good to beat the task ""Ride as passenger"".+ Nice screenshot potential from the engine being made for ground battles and processor torture and implement more detail than a copy-paste of google earth.- The AI shows how jerky the flying is, and this constant state of parkinsons is even more apparent when you get out of the helicopter in the first mission and have motion sickness by the third step, while the heli you just got out of crashes into the water.- EVEN dodgier physics than arma2 (the one thing they should have put in some effort to fix)- If you have the hardware to make this game half playable you are way out of it's leauge and wouldn't even consider it.-The way the collective works is just... Hold half a second too short and it won't even move, hold a second too long and over torque is likely. Had vortex ring state conditions been possible then this game would have been a nightmare.- In real life a slight push of either pedal wouldn't generate turn sufficient to sever the tail boom.- Every other mechanic that makes flying annoying in arma2 is still there (Especially camera control)- The music and ATC 'things' are just bat♥♥♥♥♥♥ All genres awkwardly out of place. ATC only mean the random unreadable radio chatter like that which you usually can't turn off in flight sims with an actual game engine for it. Yes, they had to add that. Also, like in arma, every single radio transmission is a 2/5 at best and sound like they're on the LF band.If this was a community mod I'd think it was cute, but it's not and not.I went in with hopes of a refined game focusing on helicopters, but was disappointed since it is completely based on an (basically unchanged) ancillary game mechanic from a complete game.Final score: God damn it			"

												I have to make this fairly simple and straight forward instead of a lengthy review.Overall, positive head nod to Bohemia Interactive in this now aging title as in the words of Monty Python, ""and now for something completely different"".IMPORTANT Point:I predominantly have played this game ""offline"" as Steam does not detect the game activation if you modify some of the game files and I bypass the standard Steam startup, which I did so in order to ramp up the difficulty to give the flight modeling a much more realistic feel and activated the ArMA 2 modules I WANT TO RUN.I have easily logged 300+ hours on this game.Key Points:1)  If you are looking for a hardcore ""simulation"" this is NOT your game.2)  If you are looking for a ""light"" simulation game with PASSABLE aerodynamics physics for the starting helos this works.(but NOT the medium and heavy helicopters who FMs are skewed),3)  If you have ever wanted to fly over the Pacific Northwest and Puget Sound with a helicopter, you will like this game immensely, the modeling and collison detect is better than most modern flight simulations.4)  If you are interested in learning about the basic functionality of helicopters without flight manual complication, this is YOUR game.Bottom line, the game itself is entertaining, the plot is a little ""tired"" but still fun.The Seattle map region is EXCELLENT, with all the actual landmarks noted.However, if you want to run this game REALLY well, you are going to need a beast of a gaming system, and not because the game is overly ""complex"".The ArmA 2 game engine just was never that well optimized for this kind of ""simulation"" and the overall graphics close to the ground can really get ugly, and SO WISH the engine had been optimized because the modeling and collision detection is GOOD.Never was flying a ""little bird"" over Seattle so much of a small guilty pleasure, especially for cheap the game is now with all the DLC packs.You are going to need a flight control system in order to get the most out of the game.In a pinch, you can use a Xbox 360 controller, but that unprecise when playing at difficulties at veteran and above.

												I got this game for $1, and it is worth more than that without a doubt. If you enjoy flight simulators, you can certainly enjoy this. Bohemia Interactive tries to open this story up to a broader audience by implementing a story that could possibly hint at some important concepts in ARMA 2 and 3 (oh sorry, did I spoil something?), but doesn't do a good job at it. Also, the ingame music is very familiar to those who have played many of Bohemia Interactive's titles, for example, Operation Flashpoint or what we call today, ARMA Cold War Assault.

												Take On Helicopters, another great game made by Bohemia Interactive.Rating at the moment: 7.5/10Take On Helicopters(TKOH) is a semi-realistic helicopter simulator based on the Arma 2 Real VIrtuality 3 engine, which also runs DayZ standalone, an insanely popular game. As you fly around cloudy morning Seattle, you listen to nice music on your phone, and attempt to deliver cargo, passengers, give ppl joyrides, etc... On full realism, it gets tougher to fly, adding to how fun the game is. The atmosphere of the game is great, and it just feels amazing. What could be wrong? Well, the controls are clunky, and the game gets very repetitive. The game is very badly optimised, and even clocks 20 fps average on my 2k workstation rig. Close up, the map looks awful. This takes away hugely from the game, making my rating plummet. Sound: epicVisuals: good enoughBugs: not very manyReplayable: I doubt you could finish the story without dying of boredom.Content: Considering that the map is 3.8k square kilos, the map is quite nice, however close up, not really.Developers: Game is quite old, doesn't have many updates.Voice acting: Bohemia was never good at voice acting, and this is no acception.What is Needed:More content (music, helos, a little more map detail)More players (which they can't really change :/)Better MultiplayerOPTIMISATIONIs it worth buying? That would be your choice. The game is epic, but has many flaws. I would suggest getting it on discount.			"

												So.... this game is hard to make a review.I would recommend it to people that REALLY like making missions with a helicopter... its not like a Tycoon... but its got some of the aspects like buying new choppers and customizing them, but it doesnt feel like one at all. so scratch any tycoon feeling out of this game. this is a linear story game that just happens to let you customize and buy your choppers when you feel like. one BIG downside of this game is the character dialogs. they are incredibly boring and monotone, even the ones that you think should make mode of a impact, more feeling... anything! but it doesnt... its monotone and doesnt make you feel anything. the voice acting in this game is really bad.Should you buy this game? only if you're a heli enthusiast and got the money laying there. many of the game features if not all are present in Arma II/III, a little browsing in the steam work shop with Arma III and you'll have more Heli mission content then present in this game, BUT, the MAP in this game is really good. and when I say good... i mean its HUGE... so theres a lot to see and do/redo... and even create, BUT, again... BUT, in Arma III you can import a lots of maps now and they have higher visual quality. The map in this game has very little detail in buildings... and roads, streets are not even present. they are part of the ground texture... if you're looking for decent graphics, this is not for you.The missions and story are decent. but the voice acting takes off part of it.To make it short.Bad voice acting makes the game not as intriguing as it could be. recommended only if you're REALLY into helicopters and want everything out there.Pros:- Decent engine (Arma II) 9/10- Decent story line / missions 7/10- Map Size 10/10Cons:- Map detail is horrible 4/10 (excludings building density)- Voice acting is laughable 2/10- Lack of indepth helicopters courses to improve flight 4/10- my bad english in this review.

												Helicopter games are so hard to find, you should get it if choppers are your thing. The game is not bad at all, the graphics are nice and the physics is decent enough. Although, at this day and age, Arma 3 does a much better job on physics. Both are, still, light years behind DCS helicopter dynamics, but more or less on par with FSX and Prepar3d default stuff.			"

												It looks so good to fly! It feels so real! And it can hurt so badly!!But don't let this fool you. The game is a simulator, so the controls require a skill set between med to high respectively. If you can't fly an aircraft in Planetside 2 or BF4...stay away from this game. But if you have strong air superiority in these other titles, then prepare yourself for a sweet treat.			"

												Bit of a cautious thumbs up, I got this game really cheap in a bundle quite some time ago. Played for a few mins, had awful performance issues and the controls were abysmal on a 360 pad...Fast forward a little while and I bought a HOTAS stick and throttle along with a better graphics card. The difference was astounding. There was still another little issue though - using the hat switch for headlook is horrible. Fast forward a little more time and I got my hands on an EDtracker head tracking device. This was the final piece of the puzzle! With reliable head tracking and a half decent stick setup the game really begins to shine and also opened my eyes to a much more immersive experience in Arma 2/ Day Z mod.Anybody familiar with BI games knows what to expect, a diamond with little bits of♥♥♥♥♥♥on it :D TOH is no exception, god awful voice acting and the usual performance issues on lower end hardware but with a little forum scouring you can maximize the experience you will have with a bit of tinkering.*For anyone using high DPI settings in windows you will have end up with the missing mouse pointer bug. THIS is what completely did my head in with the game for a looong time, persevering with the methods needed to do any menu clicking (like starting a damn game session) especially graphics setup was a royal pain in the ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥ I found the solution to this from a completely different game but the solution works here also. Turn your DPI from 150 to 149 and your mouse will magically reappear :)			"

												Take on Helicopters is an attempt to prove that civil aviation does not have to be boring. The problem of this game is that it sits on a fence between mass accessibility and hardcore simulation. It's competent in both cases but I'm not sure it can win over either group of players.This game will satisfy those eager for aerial simulation, but will result in a little approachable game for the rest of players, if not just plain boring. It is a good simulator, very demanding and with plenty of content to enjoy for hours. However, its poor narrative and lackluster optimization let mixed sensations.			"

												Bohemia Interactive have opted for a simulator-style flight model that has more emphasis on enjoyment with a 'feeling' of realism, rather than a full-on realistic helicopter simulation. This was a good decision, as helicopters are inherently difficult to fly. For the average gameplayer, this would almost certainly lead to frustration... Not a good recipe for entertainment.The flight model they have opted for takes many of the helicopter's tricker flight dynamics and tones it down to a more manageable set of rules. There are three different difficulty modes, each offering more than enough of a challenge. The easiest mode adds a generous level of automatic corrections to flight, as well as a few extra navigational aids etc. while still maintaining a challenge. With an added storyline to follow to spice things up, Take On Helicopters is a refreshing addition to a stagnant flight sim market and one that I highly recommend!			"

												This game is fun to mess around with, but it's extremely hard to get control of the helicopter, and it's not well documented on how to do certain things. For some tutorials, you will be drilled to the last click, but for others, they give you a vague statement such as slowdown, and then you're on your own. A training system that went into detail into the tiny bits and pieces that make flying easier would have been nice, and as such I'm stuck forever trying to land a damn helicoper correctly.			"

												I got this game from humble bundle. In fact, I bought that boundle just for this game, because I love helicopters and BI, so I thought: what could go wrong? Well, the game mechanics are fine, and feels like a real chopper for me, because you can adjust a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of things druing the flight, so that's okay. The variety of helicopters is OK as well as the graphics. But I tried to play the campaing. Oh god the horror. The whole story feels like a spiderman thread. It starts off naturally, but suddenly you feel your brother's hand on your leg, and everything goes homosexual. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with gay people, but in a videogame like this, I think you should not have the option to molest your brother, or worse, have sex with him.I know that the BI games are open minded, but it was too much for me. Here is an example: I was sitting at the car with my brother. He's keep telling me how he missed me and such. Then, he suddenly goes off the road, behind a huge bush, and kisses me on my lips, and the animation goes on AND ON AND ON, AND YOU HAVE NO OPTION TO STOP IT. Next example, after the third mission, when you fly back at your base, and no one is at the ground. Everyone disappeared. Well, turns out, that they were having a gay gangbang at the back of the hangar. I wasn't surprised.And there are numerous examples like this in the game. And I ask: why? This could have been a great game. But they had to ruin it with gaysex.  "

												Disappointing flight models. Even on 'Veteran' difficulty... It shouldn't really be advertised as being advanced.I had sort of suspected that this would just be the helicopter parts of Arma, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, and to be fair its a little more than that. The flight models are more realistic than Arma, but they just still aren't that good.You're able to make violent changes to the collective without any consequences. In a real helicopter, ANY change to the collective requires changes to the other controls.In an out-of-ground-effect hover, the chopper behaves ok at first, collective needs to be higher than in forward flight, it wants to yaw and drift so you need to compensate, but you can then raise and drop the collective very quickly and ascend/descend as if on a ladder, with virtually no risk of a vortex ring state.The cyclic and pedal response is far too instantaneous to be believable, the sheer speed at which you can change direction and attitude removes any illusion of weight and inertia. It never feels like a heavy vehicle hanging under a rotor system, but more like a go-kart driving on an invisible 'track in the sky'.Although I've not spent much time looking, it seems that the cockpits and avionics are also very simplistic and startup procedures are not very authentic.It kind of feels like an Arma 2 mod, rather than something thats supposed to be a flight simulator. Oh and the music is apalling.As a game, its quite pretty, seems fun enough and would be interesting to flight enthusiasts, but as a simulator it's quite poor. If realism is important to you then DCS UH-1 is an infinitely better choice			"

The menus are awful, the game looks awful, feels awful, and doesn't run as well as it really should.For people who are familiar with the ARMA engine, I only leave you with one warning: this is ARMA, but with more helicopters and none of the fun of ARMA.

												I can't really say I'd recommend this game. I've read that it's fairly realistic, which is cool, but it gets to the point where trying to fly gets too tedious to be fun. I tried for an hour to do my first flight and never got off the ground. YOu are forced to go through a ground school of sorts. THe controls were clunky and unclear as well. But at $5 I suppose you get what you pay for.			"

												The game is terrbile. Its just like arma 2 and 3 but with more helicopter controls.. Listen to me and just do this. Buy arma 2 or 3 and just download the helicopter/jet controls. This will give you more controls on the helicopter or jet. This will also give you a fun military game.   This game, was just a joke on Bohemia Interactive part. I did find the seattle map interesting but the graphics are just outdated and ehhh.ProsCan fly helicopters on arma 2 maps!!okay selection of helicoptersConsGraphic ugly "

												While the flying mechanics are pretty impressive, everything else about the game really let me down. The story feels so half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that it took all the fun out of the flying. I bought this game hoping for an immersive adventure as an owner of a helicopter comany but all I got was a bunch of glitches and a really bad tour of Seattle. Again, I will say the flight mechanics are impressive but that to me is the basline of the game. Building great content on top of that baseline is what I was interested in and that underdelivered.

												For a sale price, sure grab it and have fun with it. For the regular price, I wouldn't recommend it. It looks and feels like a big mod for Arma, not a brand new simulator. The details in the helicopters cockpits are far from being hight quality and kills the immersion for me - especially in Hinds DLC. You only have some basic controls over the inside switches and functionality of your helo - far far from FSX, X-plane or DCS sims - there are freeware mods for those sims with more details.So, no I would not recommend TOH if you are looking for the full helicopter sim.

												THIS HELICOPTER HAS NO EJECTION SEAT!I've almost been in car crashes, and my most constant thought was not my life flashing infront of my eyes, it was a desire for air bags, my last thoughts would have been ""Get a car with air bags.""Flying Take On Helicopters; Hinds, I had a very similar emotional sensation after my glorious Hind was hit by a surface to air missile and I plummeted towards the ground.Earlier, I had been thinking to myself this flies like an old bird that's been around for years, shaky and slightly not perfect.Take on Helicopters is a very good simlite simulation, the addition of an auto-menu for turning the engine on, and auto-hover, make taking off and landing with computer assistance considerably easier, but it's a real thrill to master landing without computer assistance, and one of the many joys of the game.I've really enjoyed this game, coming from an OpFlash/ArmA/ArmA 2 and Battlefield Desert Combat helicopter flying background, it's not an incredibly detailed sim except maybe in flight model, but I find too highly detailed sims boring, so for me this game works real well.I can see why people who are masochistic and want the super-real sim experience might not feel satisfied, or have a lust for multiplayer, if that's the case, try DCS World, or ArmA 3, and otherwise, enjoy this :)			"

												Probably on of the best flight simulators.If you have played Arma2 you will love this and this is still better than Arma3 Helicopters DLC. Sad that there arent so many players because you also can normal Arma2 in the game on maps like seattle... and there are hundered of new units and old units from arma2. the editor is the same like in arma2. its like a big arma2 dlc. TOH is maybe the first flight simulator where you can swim as a whale:) and the story is so good that it feels like gta or something... if you dont want to fly just steal a car and a ak-47 and have some fun:)			"

A good selection of choppers.  I can only run the graphics on a low setting, I'm sure super PC's can get the amazing screenshots.  It's still a ton of fun.  I have always wanted a helicopter sim and I'm glad I got this.  Lots of people are having problems and it does show 'mixed' reviews, but I believe if you are fascinated enough by the idea of flying a chopper then you'd like this.			"

												This game is a entertaining game that you can play for about a hour then get a bit bored. This game runs on the same game engine that arma runs on so you still can  look in your inventory and drive cars while still being able to drive heli's. Sadly the multiplayer is dead just like arma gold edition so unless you know somebody else that has the game you will not be playing multiplayer. Overall the game is fun and challenging, it gives you freeroam ability, and just is overall fun. However you need a pretty powerful pc as my laptop (8gb ram, nvidia geforce gt 740, intel i5 4200 u) cannot run this game on high settings as  it will only get 15-20 fps.			"

This is a remake of Arma 2, and uses the Arma engine with upgrades that found their way into Arma 3. The community is less active than it used to be, and has a lot less users than the Arma games it was born from. You may or may not be able to play it online, it used Gamespy for its multiplayer server client.			"

												Very fine rotor-wing realism.I'm a skilled when it comes to flying helicopters from Arma 2 and Arma 3, the game developer's 2 other very famous games. I thought i'd be good at this one too, turns out i was wrong.RotorLib everybody, realistic realism.I'd recommend you get some flight gear, such as VR goggles and a flight stick.Otherwise, thanks to it's great graphics, you can actually play Arma 2 and Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead missions on this game when merged, this makes the game pretty much the same but much more graphically realistic.Pros: - Realistically hard to fly. - Good graphical quality. - Ability to merge with A2 and A2OA, providing a more graphically enhanced platform for the games. - It's realistic?Cons: - Realistically hard to fly, no really, maybe you really should at least get a cyclic stick or throttle. - With good graphics comes good hardware requirements.

												Unless you have a Joystick or pedals don't bother. I bought this game over a year ago and haven't played it since. It is based off of the ARMA2 engine. Maybe if you like ARMA you will like this. But KBM is impossible. It is also a hefty 18 GB. If you have slow internet find the box copy if there is one.			"

												This is great for a Helicopter sim, but the price is a bit crazy especially considering this is not a lot more then an Arma 2 mod. The menus, the map, the options and most everything else is not ""new"" it's all reused sources from ARMA. Very little attempt to even hide it. That's quite sad IMO to create something and call it BRAND NEW with so many reused assets.			"

												This game was ditched by the makres, could have been one of the best Helicopter sims around but they just left it...the game itself is good,  and with a joystick its really fun, when I got my joystick I starting playing this again and it was ok, but some of the game play issues where still there, (YOU can play this withouth a joystick,) the game is not that hard, but its over all issues with controls and map design does show simply if you look closer into the game, I would say just geting ARMA Combined ops would be alot more fun rather than spending any money on this game3/10			"

												Okay, inherently, there's nothing wrong with this game. However, unless you are really into non-combat helicopter missions (flying point A to point B and dropping people/cargo off or picking people/cargo up) its not a particularly exciting game. All the military choppers can be found in Arma 2, and the flight dynamics are largely identical to Arma's comparing both simple and advanced flight modes, save for the fact that ToH is slightly more manual.Again, its not an awful game, just not worth my HDD space or the money I spent on it.

The WAC aircraft mod for Garry's Mod is better at helicopters then this. I recommend you go buy Garry's mod before you buy this ""Arma meets terrible simulator aspect"".			"

Infuriated with Bohemia Interactive because Arma is like this too, all their games are so user unfriendly. Impossible to play any of their games unless you write the controls on a piece of paper or something. Complete garbage. Don't ever buy this game or even play it. Also Tom's voice actor is so bad			"

												This is a good lesson. It's a lesson in why an engine built for an FPS is not the best for a flight sim and it's a lesson of what great fun can be had if flight sim's had a narrative or even more of a goal oriented campaign. This will be a fun sim for hardcores to pick up and a great beginning sim for those looking to get into it. Aircraft are modeled meticulously, handle wonderfuly, and flying is just plain fun. It's clear that BIS went to great lengths to get the feel down and they succeeded. I recommend, however, mastering the basics of the light (MD-500) model before moving on to the others.Highly recommended.			"

												I bought this game on sale for two reasons. Playing the demo I really enjoyed flying the heli over the absolutely brilliant Seattle map. Secondly if you own Arma 2 and Arma DLC than you can create missions using the Seattle map. It is more involved than I thought but seeing Hinds buzzing the Sky Needle and russian armour running down the freeways is pretty cool. Arma 2 is also a lot cooler than I thought. Kinda missed it when it came out.			"

												This game is like your Grammy buying a COD flash drive at Walmart and giving it to you as a Christmas present thinking she just bought you Black Ops II and a custom build super streamlined gaming rig to play it on! In other words, not even close.The game is terrible across the board: graphics, game play, sound, missions and perhaps most importantly, flight modeling. Honestly I think some of the screen shots on the store page are rendered or highly manipulated because absolutely nothing in the game looks that good.I wasted $2.50 on this rubbish and only hope it doesn’t nerf my ArmA II and DLC installs.

												This is one of the worst games I've ever bought, and I'm a big ArmA player and fan. It's amazing to me that this game has been out since 2011 and it's clearly unfinished. Let's start with the Seattle map. It's a screen print from Google earth with a few hills and buildings. On one mission for the campaign you have to fly to a number of golf courses; one of which has a flat, screen print club house! The AI cars driving on the map are non-collidible. You can drive through all of them. The motorboat has no engine sound. The fps is absolutely appalling - even worse than ArmA 2 OA... The campaign script is naive and poorly written, the characters laughable and badly acted.The flight mechanics are reasonably good. It's quite like ArmA 3 advanced controls. You don't fly around with your finger firmly pushed on the collective like in ArmA 2. You have to add and subtract torgue or lose control. This I rather like.The buildings, as one can expect are mainly from ArmA 2 and A2OA.If only BI knew how to optimize and game engine or would at least employ some people who did, this would be a start.I can not recommend this game, I'm afraid. It's just too shoddy and unfinished.			"

												I had high hopes for this game, but while the flying is initially reasonably fun and challenging, I found that I got annoyed really quickly with the overall game.Firstly, the graphics in game are nowhere near like the screenshots on the store page.  I've maxed out all the settings and it still looks bad.  (I cannot increase the terrain detail level above 'normal' even with my pretty beefy PC).  Everything else is on 'very high'.Secondly, the menus are badly designed and it's difficult to figure out where options are configured.  For example, how to repair the helicopter.Thirdly, even flying with a Logitech Dual Action Controller (similar to XBox), it's very difficult to accurately control the collective and cyclic while selecting options on the keyboard and mouse at the same time.  I think this game requires a proper pilot controller with pedals as well as track-ir to be able to look around the cockpit at options etc.I will probably continue on with the career mode for a little while, but I am very disappointed overall.

												This game is one of the true games bearing the title simulator and I like it very much indeed. Graphic is fine, career mode is very interesting and makes you curious about next mission everytime. But there are some conditions upon which I would recommend this game:First. This game is for those hardcore simulator players who grow up with games like Flight simulator series. For player with no simulator or real flying helicopter background this game will be very hard and often frustrating. Second. You need a joystick for this game for sure. Joystick with trottle and twist function is minimum, pedals would be even better, but twist function do just fine. Me myself I have a Saitek Aviator and it is perfectly OK.Third. Lot of freetime and love for helicopters.So all in all this a very good game for those who really knows something about helicopters and are willing to buy/have a good working joystick. I wouldn't recommend this for those who don't know what cyclic and collective is.Very good game for me and as Arnold likes to say: Intu da choppa!!!			"

												This game is great! I am admittedly having issues early on with a challenge - hover over a spot over the water - without and visual references besides the HUD spot and its distance from ya - yeah its tough - maybe a new track ir would help - even better... GROUND! lol - |I'm whining - that's my struggle - the game though? Well - considering I love simulators and often find myself not really having anything to do in them - ""awesome heli/plane - flies realistic - totally! .... ok - looks nice outside - ok - now what? it gets old! I use FSEconomy web site to make my x-plane and ms-flight sim more fun - as you then have passengers, people in the community own FBO's on airports all over - you can too - etc... fly freight, buy planes, fuel... makes it fun....Anyway - this game does that from the start. Voices sound drab or whatever? Dialog sounds ""c movie"" - I"" think its great. The fact that |I'm not reading subtitles and their is enough animation and stuff... well - keeps me entertained... and then the missins to go with the story - awesome! I think its better I'm stuck on a mission then ripping thru the game - if it finishes - I might be stuck without much to do - that would stink! I haven't got that far...so I don't know how this will pan out - but its a fun simulator/game hybrid - and I think most of it is all spot on flying wise - pretty much. It can be frustrating in any computer simulation to fly a helicopter, plane and whatever else because you want to turn your head all over all the time whenever and not getting that - well - even with track ir (which helps) its kinda trickier in a game they say - you can't feel forces etc... ) Anyway - moving your head fast, exact is as important as the controls - as the whole need for hand eye coordination is at a premium when you're airborne and dirt is racing by your shoulder only feet below! Moo wah hhahah Weed Whacking the lawn!  This game is a kick - I don't think you'll hate it if you like helicopters a lot, flying a lot, etc - but note this does kinda lean toward difficult to fly helicopter simulation - so - prepare to practice a bit and get a joystick and pedals if you can! Track IR even bettter! Maybe occulus workjs too - I dunno - but those shutter glasses on LCD screens... versus the tube kind - nope - yuk - don't bother! get a vr helmet first!Great Game!			"

												I had bought the DVD version initially, and ""right out of the box"", slow FPS rates were the first thing to attend. Being a virtual pilot for many years on the MSFS series, it was quite natural to give TOH a shot.   Right from the beginning , FPS rates had to be ""treated"" using the intuitive menu settings (video). Knowing all too well the finicky nature of FSX, and it's frequent CTD's caused by sliders too much to the right, and to the many checked boxes, this was all too familiar for me. The results of those major reductions in all of the settings, including clouds effects and desabling anisotropic filtering, were a big improvement. That was obviously predictable, at the cost of some eye candy, and very limited visibility. I can not tolerate bad FPS, it destroys the immersion completely, and flying becomes so much less enjoyable. I could not use my Thrustmaster T Flite Hotas X (PC), because the throttle was activated by a  toggle switch situated in the back of the T handle. It has a spring loaded return position that prohibits full idle control. Thankfully, my old Force 3D Pro was on stand by. Must inform all of you that sensivity settings must be all the way to the left, except throttle of course. Real life helicopter pilots, have confessed that flying heli's on home simulators with our joysticks, is actually harder than in a full size helicopter. The few inches of travel they permit, make them a real handful to control in TOH. You must have the steady hand of a brain surgeon, in many flight parameters. The default and add onHelicopters on MSFS, are much more easy to control, and less of ""widow makers"" in an instant...All this to say that I wanted to buy the ""Hinds"" add-on, but could so only if TOH was from Steam, instead of a boxed DVD. Taking advantage of the great bundle offer, I added it to my library. To my big surprise TOH on Steam became much less touchy with the video settings, and as big bonus, FPS improved noticably. Also, all my previous progress from TOH on DVD thankfully transfered to the Steam version, even though a message had advised to the contrary. Go check on the net for hints when stuck on missions or tasks.So long fellow virtual pilots.A.PS: A few hours after writing this review I was litterally stuck (as many others seeking a solution on the Bohemia's official forum site) on a mission called ""The hand that feeds me"" consisting of picking up a container on a cargo ship. Trust me on that one, a ""bug"" has been confirmed by the developpers. You will not be able to lift up this container from hell, without damaging it. Some say it worked after a dowloaded patch was used, but Steam has already included them all. The ONLY solution is a good old cheat, even suggested by Bohemia. It is the same for Arma 2. Press and hold the Shift key located on the left side of the keyboard, and then press the - (minus) on the numerical keyboard during gamplay. No menu will appear at all. Type blindly: endmission. A menu will appear and just end it there. Alleluia will be the appropriate exclamation.I have the chance to own many non-default helicopters on FS2002, FS2004, and FSX. It includes the Dodosim Bell 206, from Flight One Software. So in all modesty, I am a decent virtual helicopter pilot, and after numerous tries including all angles of approach, even resting a wheel on the container, the mission ends suddenly the moment the cables are barely moved. Again, a confirmed ""huge bug"" indeed. Don't be surprised that you might need that cheat again later. Landing on a cargo ship, a ""collision bug"" creeps in (again), big time. When landing very smothly, the helicopter melts into the ship, just like the floor would cave in...At least you will finish the game and enjoy it, not feeling guilty of using an emergency tool, to rectify errors that are beyond your control.
