												If we look at Verdun in the standards of modern gaming, it fails miserably.  Compared to triple A games and large developers, Verdun and it's developers fails in almost every aspect of game making.  No first day DLC save final updates. No microtransactions. No ""pay to win"" mentality. No unrealistic twitch shooting. No dodgy business practices.No massive failures on day one. No insane advantage for high level gamers. No false advertising. By today's standards, verdun would fail on the table of EA, Bethesda, CA, SEGA, Nintendo, and just about every single gaming company that is larger than, say, CD Projekt Red.  These failures, however, make this game the best FPS on the market as of now. These indie developers have crafted the most satisfying experience I have had in a first person shooter in a long damned time.  The game is perfectly digestable, the upgrades system is easy to get, the weapons are balanced and look and handle fantastically... The list of amazing acheivements this game has accomplished could go on for pages of writing.  Verdun created it's own version of FPS gameplay, taking us to an era most companies find dull and drab.  The trench warfare turn based attack gameplay is insane, as you see first hand the horrors of the First World War, which, by the way, is now 100 years past.  I bought this game in eraly access and was satisfied with it.  Now I can't get enough of it!I have been fed up with large companies coming out with garbage and selling DLC every five minutes.  Verdun's updates and new squards are being released free of charge over the next while, so this game will become even better and more varied than it is now.  Verdun is one of a special kind of game, one that requires teamwork to dominate the map.  While battlefield has become zany and unrealistic, Verdun forces you to play as a team, and unlike in battlefield, if you fail to do so, you will die again, and again, and again. I cannot recommend this game more to anyone.  The learning curb is massive, but you have so many classes to play as that are open to even the newest players.  Honestly there is something satisfying about having to use bolt action rifles in a trench that is captivating in and of itself.  It is insanly addicitive and the squad based gameplay is incredible.  Verdun is by far the best FPS I have ever played as I have put in so many hours of my life into it (roughly 10 hours alone in hte last few weeks).  I cannot recommend this game any more. SO GO BUY IT.And as for some advice, keep your head down.  This isn't Call of Duty.			"

												I'm crawling down in the mud among the dead men. We all signed for this, some of them added a year to their age to go here, to reach this hell. The bomb struck few meters away from me. Tinnitus in my left air. All I can hear is buzzing noise that drives me nuts. Our attack didn't succeed. Now we're defending this point desperately and I can hear enemy... I can FEEL enemy getting closer. Too afraid to raise my head, to afraid to take a look. I keep my head low. It might save my life. I've seen it before. Head goes above the sandbag line... Splattered brain showers the muddy trench. I can't move. My NCO told me to stay here. Moving away, progressing or backing up would mean I'm a deserter. And we all knew what happens to those poor souls.I see a sizzling bomb dropping a few meters away and suddenly, the trench is filled with thick green smoke. Mustard. Senfgas, as Germans call it. I feel like a trapped mouse. Panic takes control over my body. My hands are struggling to protect my face with a gas mask. I... I did it. I've started running away mindlessly from the deafening noise of shots.I feel the enemy getting clos...Bayonet strikes my chest and pierces skin, muscles and bones. The pointy, rusty blade exits through my back. I taste blood on my tongue. Thundering noise in my head, I raise it to see the eyes of my killer. He has the same eyes, just like me, hidden behind the gas mask, just like mine. He... he's me, the same frightened boy who will think of his mother the way I'm thinking about mine right now... maybe a bit later. Maybe tomorrow. Who knows... He's just been a bit more lucky than me at this moment. I can sense his misery and fear while he pulls the steel out and pushes me away. As I fall down, I see him going away. Leaving my body to be swallowed by everlasting darkness...This is Verdun.---If you like this review, feel free to join me for some more recommendations at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/libereviews "

								Fantastic game that really captures the WW1 Essence.The only thing that i think the game is missing is the ""ANZACS"" You need to add a Gallipoli map and Re-capture that horrific battle between the Anzacs and the Ottomons if you guys could create such a thing your Australian and New Zealand Community would be very thankful. Adding these Factions and maps would really thrive and push this game further then it already is. Anyway please take this theory in and if there are any Aussies or Kiwi's reading this please back me up on this idea we all know you want this just as much as i do :)			"

												I feel that after two years of playing this game both on browser and on Steam that I'm qualified to write a semi-intelligent review on this game. Verdun. A truly one-of-a-kind experience that blends the familiarity of standard FPS games, and the uniqueness of the World War One era. This is the only game that you will find for this time period and genre of game, and for there to be only one choice, Verdun fills the niche perfectly. The developers are active on the forums and after every major patch I can see implementations of things that were mentioned in the forums. As well as amazing devs, the gameplay is very immersive. Although I can only play on low graphics, the immersion in the game while running up to take a trench is mind-boggling. This game does what no other company has tried to do and has pushed the boundaries of what, by many, was thought to be an impossible idea. Most people assumed that a World War One game would be boring and have no playerbase. They were wrong. Kudos to Matt, Mike, Leo, and the rest of the squad for making a dream game come true.			"

												A very nice game.Pros:+ World War I theme. There are very few games set in this time period (at least vs. WWII titles);+ User-friendly & intuitive interface;+ Authentic trench warfare: covered in mud, crawling across bleak landscape... only to be killed with a single bullet from only hell knows where. Happy times XD+ Gas warfare. The only game (in my memory at least) where you can actually gas your opponents;+ Good selection of weapons and squad roles;+ Good servers; no lags / connection issues.Cons... well, only one and, unsurprisingly, it lies with the players' ""ingenuity"":- One-man squads. There are 4 4-man squads per side in the match, if 4 people create 4 different squads because all of them want to be snipers / machine gunners, they prevent new fully complemented squads from joining the match.

												Verdun is a timely homage to those who fought in the First World War, it's that good.An OverviewVerdun. A word that encapsulates the horrors of the First World War. For it was at Verdun where the belligerents to the fighting had to endure some of the most appalling living and fighting conditions during the course of the war on the Western Front. The incessant shelling had turned the once pristine land into a wasteland. The constant disturbance of the clay at Verdun and the driving rain caused the formation of deep craters filled with oozing liquid that could drown men if they were so unfortunate as to fall into the hell hole. The battle was so ferocious a man is said to have been killed every minute of every day for 9 months. A death toll of some 800,000 men. One infantry man wrote 'If you have not seen Verdun, you haven't seen anything of war'.Verdun the GameVerdun is not primarily focused on the 9-month battle of Verdun of 1916, but rather encompasses 6 intensively researched maps, each portraying a different sector along the Western front, in which the Entente and Central Powers fought so ferociously over between 1914-1918. Why Verdun SucceedsI don't think it is premature to state that the developers of Verdun, have made a tour de force in the form of Verdun. It is rare to find a game, that catapults you into an era in history with such an eye for detail, that you'll find yourself swearing that you are there. The immersion level in Verdun is what has kept me coming back to Verdun time and time again (286 hours on record). VisualsThe game runs on Unity 5, perhaps the most popular Graphics engine currently around. Having had the game for 10 months or so, I have witnessed the transformation of Verdun's art direction first hand. It is only in the past 6 months, where the visuals have elevated the production values of the game to stratospheric heights. Notable visual details include:-On ultra, the deformation of No Man’s Land is a feast for the eyes. However, even on low the game looks good.-The character models have been researched to a very high degree, with excellent texturing.-Artillery shells impact the ground as you would expect. Showering men with debris and sending intense plumes of smoke high into the air.- Water logged craters, reflect the environment and character models.-Those trees not victim to shelling, look accurate.- The mud, especially on the map 'Artois' and 'Flanders' look photo-realistic.-Gas obscures your vision as it should, and the way it slowly creeps through the trench systems is impressive looking.Ambient SoundsFrom the whistling of bullets over your head, to the dull thud of shells in the distance, Verdun shines in depicting the sounds of the Great War. Rifles from the Entente and Central Powers make distinctive 'cracks', whilst the man suffocating from a gas attack near you, gasps in desperation. Other ambient highlights include:-Voice commands by fellow players which can be entered using the X key. There are over 20 instructions/emotions you can use. The most commonly used is 'Take Cover' and 'Retreat'!- Mud squelches beneath your feet, when running in poorly irrigated battlefields such as Flanders.-Officers (NCO's) can use their whistle to direct where their squad should position themselves.-Reconnaissance aircraft can be heard (and seen) meandering their way above the frontlines.Squad progressionProgression in Verdun is unlike anything you’ve seen before in an FPS. Verdun relies heavily on the use of squads. A squad comprises of 4 men each and there are 4 squads in each team. Each squad brings a unique role, uniform and weaponry to the battlefield. If you are in a match with certain players often and they are in your squad, the game will automatically track and save your progress (xp) with those people. Overtime, building enough experience with these players will elevate your squad rank which in turn unlocks a plethora of new abilities. These new abilities include the use of mustard gas and artillery barrages! Personal progressionVerdun of course also tracks your own personal growth within the game. There are over 40+ unique roles to unlock during the course of the game. Reaching the rank of level 100 is a bruising yet satisfying experience.Battle ModesThere are battle modes in Verdun. Frontlines and Deathmatch.Frontline modeThis mode tries to depict and simulate the mainly futile efforts of soldiers to try and take trenches on the Western front during WW1. It is almost flawless in design. A frontlines battle usually lasts 25- 45 minutes depending upon which map you’re playing on. When a game begins you’re either authorised by the game to ‘attack’ or ‘defend’. Once the initial attack timer is over (usually 5 minutes long) and provided the enemy have not achieved a foothold (whereby extra time is afforded to the attackers if they are able to place men in the enemy trench before and after the initial attack timer has needed) then it is tasked with the defenders to attack. This counter-attack and defend system really forces squad collaboration. It is imperative that squads cover the entire length of a trench system, if they are to avoid being overrun and their trench taken. However, once the first line of a trench is taken the defeated team ‘fall back’ to their prepared 2nd defensive trench line. Thus, even if you lose a trench, you can always take it back.  There can be as many as 3 trench lines on a map. Some 32 players (16 vs 16) can fight it out in total on any map. Death Match ModeThis is by far the least popular of the 2 battle modes. This mode sees you enter into a rifle death match to kill as many players as possible. There are no teams in this one, which forces players to rely on their marksman skills. The maps in this mode, whilst identical to those of Frontline mode, are far smaller.OptimisationThe level of optimisation for PC and Laptops has improved vastly during Early Access. The developers have spent a considerable time optimising the game. It now runs at almost 60fps on ultra for me, where before it would run at a mere 12fps.Future contentWhilst Verdun is being released tomorrow (27/04/2015), the developers have expressed their desire to keep supporting the game post-release. They have hinted at possible new squads such as the Americans and the German pioneer squads. New maps have already been made and shall soon be ‘updated’ in the game. A developer has personally hinted to me that there will be a hard core mode in the near future, which will focus on even greater depth of immersion.Final wordVerdun caters towards an audience who appreciates a squad-based World War experience . From the person who wants that feeling of cooperation with their teammates to the player who wishes to be immersed in a WW1 FPS, you can’t go amiss with this title. The visual fidelity is impressive and when accompanied with the ambient sounds, Verdun surpasses most FPS shooters based in war time. The Frontlines mode whilst simply executed is genius. Never before has defence or counter-attack been as exhilarating as this. As a young man, who lost both his great great uncles to the First World War on the Western Front, Verdun for me bears testament to the sacrifices made by all the men, from every nation involved in the ‘war to end all wars’. M2H and Blackmill Games have brought WW1 to life, like never before and for that I am eternally grateful.I score the game 9.7 out of 10. My only criticism is that I don't ever play the deathmatch mode.Thanks for reading this.Note: Since this review the developers have confirmed in their 'Road map' for Verdun that many more squads, maps and realism modes will be included to the game in the coming months. A new gore system is to be added, complete with shredded limbs. The 'Road map' demonstrates the developers true loyalty to their fan base.			"

												GREAT GAME... if you can appreciate it.It's an innovative FPS because kicks away annoying players who cannot stand the way it's played, but attracts the gentleman players, those who you totally want to play with.It's totally old fashion with nowdays tech, and that's very attractive for the kind of players does not feels comfortable on Call of Duty-like games. Why? let's see:It's WW1 reallistic, so:1.-One bullet, you're dead.2.-You're going to die a lot. There's no other way to play, so if you think it's all about getting frags and firing alot, stay away (your semi rifle has 5 bullets). This is totally like the Great War, you are just another soldier between millions and you have to run to the trench crossing no mans land, that's like 70% chances to get shot, fall into artillery fire, or taste the barbwire. If you reach the trench, alone will do nothing, can kill some but you need your team to capture it. If you can conquer it, congratulations, hold it because the enemy is counter-attacking. If you fail, get back to your trench, it's time to defend against the enemy... Also, usually you don't know who or what killed you or how... so you need to relax and be patience on this game. That means all the kids, trolls, frenetic players and mainly all kind of online players you usually hate will leave soon, and only fine players willing to play properly will stay... and this is such a HUGE reward!!!If you are one of them, you'll find many good times playing in squads, with old fashioned weapons in the WW1 warfare and it's own strategy, you'll find very find people in Verdun.Bad things? Servers aren't as good as a major company, so you'll get lag many times, the technology and graphics are OK, the needed to play, and still there's some bugs... BUT, if you like reallistic games, historic warfare, and the long-forgotten sensation to play just for fun and really getting it from being part of a well made assault and get your objective in team play... welcome to the community of Verdun.

												We were sitting in this trench shooting at the people trying to take our trench, the guy next to me gets hit, i look at him, he falls down while grabbing his shoulder. He screams in agony but i try to concentrate on my aim, after a while the screaming stops and i hit a guy who was a about 20 meters away from our trench. Seconds later we get the message that we repelled the enemy attack, and we must try to take their trench now, Me and my squad jump over the top and start running.We are lucky, their machine gun saw another squad first, so they are the ones getting mowed down, I run past the guy who I shot earlier, he lays there in the mud, drowning in his own blood, I must have hit him in the throat.Suddenly our officer gets hit, their machine gun had chosen their next prey, me and our gunner jumped in one crater, our rifleman jumps in the crater next to us. we stayed in our craters untill the MG had lost intrest in us. the moment we decided to crawl out a mortar lands right into the crater next to us, i catch a quick glance of the burned torso that was once our rifleman. The gunner and me (grenadier) continue our run trough No man's land.We finally arrive at their trench, the Gunner sets up his MG and waits untill the enemy shows up, I watched his back.After a while we hear fire. I turn around, and see my gunner just before he gets taken by the Flamethrower of the enemy, I manage to get around a corner and throw two of my grenades in the trench were my gunner got killed. The explosion took two of them, I see a leg flying out of the trench.I'm now alone, i retreat from the trench, and when I'm out we get called back, our attack lost its momentum. I make it back in our trench. And it all starts again. nobody lost, nobody wins.And this my childeren is your average match in Verdun.11/10 A true masterpiece.			"

												Death is an extremely complex theme, with a lot of meanings depending on your cultural background. But in Verdun, it becomes almost meaningless, and given that its objective is to loyally represent the memory of World War 1, I'd say mission very well accomplished.I won't lie, you will die A LOT, especially in the beggining. And even that is an understatement: if you poke your head out of the trench for more than 2 seconds, you'll promptly be sniped by a top level guy; if you charge the enemy trench, you either get sniped by said guy, or get stuck in barbed wire only to be sniped by said guy; and if you lie down in your trench, trying not to get sniped, an enemy will breach your trench and stab you in the back while you were trying to counter-snipe the original guy.That said, it is still very cathartic, especially when, after dying A LOT, your team manages to grind its way into taking the enemy trench, which depicts the memory of the war it's trying to represent a whole lot better than many triple A games out there (no finger pointing).And from time to time, you'll get one of those breakthrough moments when you save the entire team from being flanked because you threw a grenade that killed 5 guys trying to force their way into the trench. And those moments are so satisfying that you'll spend the entire conclusion of your review of this game bragging about it.But if you tire of dying, you can always flee in the opposite direction to hear your Scottish officer angrily telling you to ""GET BACK IN LINE, LAD!"" and be executed for desertion.

												Verdun has excellet gameplay and graphics and all that, but what I don't see people talking about a lot is how Verdun goes beyond the screen.  The gore, for example, is not really meant to awe at.  When you shoot someone and blow their arm off, or you shoot someone in the gut and have to listen to their screams for a minute or so, you actually kinda start to feel responsible.  Seeing all the explosions, experiencing suppression, seeing the gore, and experiencing the dark and depressing atmosphere can really sort of open your eyes to what the war was.  It's not like killing evil nazis or crazy zombies.  It makes you realize that you're killing a living, breathing human being, and that's something that no game has ever made me feel.  It can make you realize that people were actually doing and seeing all the same stuff in real life.  Verdun is the most respectful and accurate portrayal of warfare that I've ever experienced.			"

												I personally don't think this game can be simply recommended or not recommended; if you are interested in an authentic (key word) WW1 shooter, then absolutely purchase it. If not, then stay far away. This game takes authenticity very seriously, and there's very little room for standard FPS characteristics. You will almost always die in 1 shot (90-95% of the time), you will die very frequently (particularly in No Man's Land), and you will get frustrated. It is undeniably rage-inducing to spend what seems like an eternity sprinting from crater to crater in No Man's Land to finally get to the enemy trench and then as soon as you hop in you take a bullet to the face and have to start the journey all over again. This will happen a lot, so unless you're in it for the historical thrill (if that makes sense), prepare to scream at your computer screen. Another major aspect of this game that gives it such a high level of authenticity is the outcome of matches. True to WW1, a majority of matches will end in a draw, with no team getting a victory, and a nice death toll at the end to remind you that all those hundreds of deaths were for absolutely nothing. Somehow, though, 45 minutes of back-and-forth trench assaults just doesn't get boring, since you always have that hope that you'll get lucky enough to make it safely to the enemy trench and root them out. Normally, that hope is followed a second later by a nice bullet to the face from sweeping machine gun fire. I definitely believe this is one of the best shooters I have ever played. No other FPS will make you hit the dirt as fast as possible than Verdun when you hear machine gun fire whizzing over your head. No other FPS will make you as terrified of sticking your head out for even just a split second than Verdun. No other FPS will make you tense up and grimace as much while you're running across a muddy field than Verdun. This game is totally incomparable to any other game I've ever seen, and that's what makes it so good.  "

Early Access Review
								This being a WW1 game and that I have a keen interest in it's history, I was determined to look for any historical flaws or gameplay flaws that contradicted anything from WW1. Well I have to say, based on those factors and the gameplay itself, I am very impressed!The maps are designed in a way that would either mean the player has to resort to trench warfare, long distance warfare or even a mixture of both, getting the player to adapt to their surroundings and making them become more tactical in their decisions and how they would approah the enemy, which is an excellent feature! The maps also contain a lot of hidden elemnts and restricitons that relate to the kinds of conditions of WW1 (e.g. barbed wire hazards and execution for desertion), which make the game very knowledgable to its historical context as well as adding challenge for players.The weapons are also historically accurate as they should be and although there is not much variety in weapon types (5-7 rifles, 1 pistol type each team, 1 MG type each team), there is definitely a sense of competitivity through its ranking systems for weapons, classes and overall all personel rank. This makes the game a hell of a lot more addicting and can make players determined to reach target ranks to unlock more classes for frontline gameplay and unlocks for more rifles in deathmatch gameplay. Although most weapon damage is quite powerful since most rifles tend to kill either instantly or sometimes after 2 shots (depedning on player distance from target), they do allow the player to experiment with different fighting tactics in which pistol classes can be used in trench combat and MGs for defensive purposes as examples.Squad systems are also a good element which gets the player to think greatly about his fellow team members rather than his own killstreaks. Squad ranking is used in each game and the more experience points recieved together as a group, the more bonus perks can be used to give them greater advantages in frontline combat. There are also a set of 4 classes in the squadron which each have different roles and weapons like the commander, who can give movement orders, mortar strikes andrecon planes but is only equiped with a pistol and binoculars. These types of loadouts in squads allow the player to think more about their class role and how they assist their team members in different situationsAll these features do make quite an interesting game on it's own, however it is an early access game and it of course will have its flaws. Aside animation errors and sudden lags during or other glitches during gameplay, the game itself does not offer you much choice as to what game modes you can play or how you can play. A the moment, there are only 2 game modes, both of which require many people to just run around and shoot people. That's more or less it. Even objectives in Frontlines is obtained through killing players, it doesnt allow player much to do and can easily become quite a boring process for most. If it were to add more game modes with extra objective features that require players to for example arm bombs, use artillery equipement or maybe even use chlorine gas artilery to get players to use gas masks or avoid certain areas of the battlefield. It could do with graphic improvement and model improvements to, but like I said, it is an early access. As far as I'm aware, apparently a free download of the game can be aquired legally on the internet somewhere, which leaves reason to suggest why they would con people to pay money for a free access beta.All things aside, this game has definitely been through a thoughtful and well put development process and is generally a great war based game. We could do with more WW1 games, and this seems to pull of it's aspects brilliantly.[EDIT: Just note that this review was written before the game's more recent major updates. Things like graphics and other features are being improved even more and the game looks more smashing every time there's a new update. Also, I doubt it was influenced by me but I made a suggestion in this review to add a gas bomb feature based on the realities of WW1 and I couldn't believe it when they actually implemented a feature like that! All said and done from this review, it constantly improves and it begins to feel more and more like a true WW1 game!]			"

Early Access Review
								What is Verdun? TL;DR - an engaging, WWI trench warfare, attack and defend style FPS game. From my own research it's pretty historically accurate too, regarding uniforms and weaponry, and the different nations' units that fought in the European theatre.- - - Not every FPS-er is going to throw down their Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare or CS:GO for the chance to go ""over the top"" with low rate of fire hundred year old Lewis machine guns or bolt action Enfield rifles, but if you're a military history buff like me who likes the occasional FPS romp (but, honestly, are sick of all the WWII games) then switching gears to The Great War is a refreshing change. Expect to spawn in, go over the top to attack, and immediately get K98'd in the face a few times. It's unforgiving like that. But then in the same match you might lead an attack on the enemy trench and clear the whole thing, racking up kills and feeling ""some type of way.""Verdun tries to emphasize squad-based tactics and operating with your squadmates by granting you perks for staying within your CO's command aura, and xp bonuses for fighting alongside your squad. There are 4 positions in each squad, always a CO, usually a rifleman, a machine gunner, and a fourth specialty class like grenadier or sniper. Not every squad's job classes are cookie cutter versions of the same thing just renamed, there is enough variance in all the different loadouts (you get better weapons for the different classes with xp/leveling, as in CoD) that most players should find something they like.  I quickly found I don't like the French squad much - their weapons are great, jobs are pretty well balanced but those damn bright blue uniforms stand out! I usually play the Tommies, British infantry, as a Lewis gunner. It's heavy, wildy innacurate when not deployed on its bipod, recruit-level slow reloads, but when I catch the enemy on the offensive and I'm prone with the bipod deployed I can cut down several squads' advances if they aren't covered properly.There's so much more I could ramble on about, but I think I'm just gonna boot the game up now! Check out some gameplay videos if you're on the fence about buying this. I also have a growing collection of screenshots ""for ze lulz"" you can glance at. I highly recommend.			"

Early Access Review
								8.7/10+Unique Gameplay+Very well thoughtout+Dedicated/ Receptive Creators+Helpful Communtiy-Few Bugs-Weird animations-Some Maps are clutteredLook, the word ""indie"" I feel has a more negative connotation. Especially when you learn about an ""indie"" game that has only a handful of developers. At that point you might start to think that the game will suck because it isn't AAA or owned by a major company. Well, this game will change your mind. It is an indie game being developed by three individuals, and their work thus far has been amazing. Verdun is a WW1 game set on the Western Front. Think of it as a mix of Battlefield, and COD with old weapons and trenches. The gameplay has some bugs, as I am writing this while the beta is out, but it hasn't affected my experience. You play on servers with up to 24 people, in squads of 4. These squads serve different purposes and have different traits. You pick what you want to play as and have at it. The maps are well designed and thought out. The community is small, but very dedicated. This game deserves to be experienced, because it is unique in itself, and very fun.Don't pass it up because it is ""indie"". Go buy it and enjoy!			"

												This game is for proper war game buffs. It gives me the same tingles as COD (the first one) and Mohaa. It insists you play as a team, otherwise you quickly become alone, exposed and as a team, fragmented and ineffectual. It is a superb game in many ways, but most importantly having played it since it's Alpha phase inception, it does one major thing right - it does not allow spammers, sprayers or any selfish people to win simply by fluke. It tells you a proper story about trench warfare; you fight together or die alone. The graphics are now great, the immersion is fantastic. Deaths are brutally quick and soul-crushingly quiet on occasion; one minute your pal is there, the next he is in a shell hole face down in the mud. Alternatively the crack of a sniper bullet suddenly halts your next step, or a shell explodes and all that is left of you is pink mist. This game brings the trenches to your computer and genuinely tries to demostrate that war is not glorious. It is sad, poignant and utterly maddening. You will care about your life. You will care about others' lives. You will hate dying and you will die over and over again. Practice hard, play hard, and you will be the one whislting ""come death come"" as you silently end life.			"

 This game is a masterpiece! I personally recommend you to get this as fast as possible if you are into history or just like FPS shooters like me (I like both of those)   Positive: + Good maps+ Somewhat friendly community+ Several classes and skills to obtain+ Challenges+ Good graphics+ Based on realistic history events+ Several weapons to choose from, from bats to mustard gas...  Negative: - Not really good animations- Glitchy & Buggy, very annoying sometimes- Sometimes makes huge FPS drops from 60 to 5, and no this has nothing to do with my computer, its the game  What I would like to see in future: (!) I'd like to see even more weapons and maps(!) I'd like to see maps where there could be small events such as passing tanks but with a rule, you can't interract with them in any way(!) Bug fixes(!) Smoother and better animations  I will give this game a neun/zehn  "

												After spending some hours with Verdun one I can definitely say that the game is very refreshing and a it feels like a new breath after playing Battlefield and CS: GO for years. The “Frontlines” game mode is probably one of the best modes I've played on a FPS in late years. Basically, in this mode, each team has a certain amount of time to either attack and capture the enemy trench or defend their own. Capturing a trench works like pretty much any conquest/domination mode in any other FPS on the market, get someone near the capture point to capture it ( I’m not sure if having more people near the capture point makes it so that you capture it faster). Defending a trench is pretty basic, you just need to stop the enemy from getting into your trench and capturing it. To be honest I believe that defending is always easier because you're supposed to be inside a trench, and because of that, it's harder for the enemies to spot you and kill you while, on the other hand, it's far more easier for you to kill them because they pretty much have to get either inside or really close to your trench in order to kill you, or, the enemy can just call an mortar strike or some gas to force your team out of the trench. The only gripe I have with the “Frontlines” mode is that there is no penalty for camping and not pushing towards the enemy trench when you’re supposed to. Besides the main game mode, “Frontlines”, you also have “Rifle Deathmatch” which is a Free For All mode and a recently released mode called “Attrition” which is just a fancy name for Team Deathmatch.Of course it's not all that simple. There's two teams and each team is divided into various squads and in each squad there's 4 slots, each of those slots represents a different ""class"" or ""role"". From the top of my head I can say there's the equivalent of the Sniper/Marksman on both teams, the Machinegunner, the Grenadier, the standard grunt and there's also two classes which I like to call ""The Officers"". These ""officers"" have the ability to request mortar strikes and gas on where they see fit, you just need to aim where you want and press the designated keybind. Do you see a bunch of enemies holding up on one spot on their trench? Just call in a mortar strike and in a few seconds they'll go sky high or, if you prefer, call in for some gas and you’ll either see the enemy flee from their trench or they’ll have to put their gas masks on and by doing that they’ll get a very reduced field of view. If your target is far from you and you can’t really see that well, you can also call these strikes with the help of your binoculars . The ""officer"" can also give move/attack orders that designate waypoints that serve as a ""guide"" to where the other players on the team should move. Verdun also introduces the typical multiplayer progression present on many online multiplayer FPS. As you play you'll gain experience that will increase your account rank and that experience will also increase your class rank, the experience that you gain only counts towards the class in which you're playing at any given moment, each class has it's own rank/level. Each individual class has it's own milestones for unlocking more gear and weapons. These unlocks consist of bayonets for your rifles, grenades, pistols, machineguns, rifles or scopes for a certain rifle. I feel like this is a great way to reward active players by giving them a little advantage. In each game your squad will also level up the better you do and leveling it up will unlock passives for the squad members, however the squad level doesn't save, in the next match you play your squad level will be reset.Graphically, I think I can safely say that Verdun looks pretty good, of course it doesn't look as good as other FPS such as Battlefield or Crysis but for an indie development team I think that it looks pretty damn good, however I'll say that one of the few gripes I have with the game is the animation quality, sometimes it looks pretty good but every now and then it looks to me like the animation doesn't match the speed at which a player is moving, perhaps it's just me being weird. Now, something I really like in Verdun is the music, from the main menu track to the ones played in game, for me, they hit the perfect spot in setting myself in the mood, they're really immersive and sometimes I find myself waiting for the track to kick in so I can launch myself to the field and run towards the enemy trench.Still, there's something that always bothered me about Verdun, even after it's official release, and that is the hit registration. Sometimes a part of me feels like it's my connection that's just bad but there's some times in which I'll be shooting people running across the fields, or inside the trenches, and I'll be getting a kill with each shot, and then there's sometimes in which I can shoot someone who has their back turned against me and there's no hitmark or anything and they just turn around and kill me. I don't know if it's the servers, the game or some issue on my end but when it happens it tends to be very annoying. Still, all credit to the developers, it's not as bad as it was during Early Access and I'm pretty sure they've done alot to improve this and try to resolve this issue.Then there's another separate issue entirely, which is the overall game performance. Regarding this I believe it's some limitation of Unity because there's been patches and patches and overall performance stays pretty much the same, atleast for me, even though there was a significant performance increase after the upgrade to Unity 5. With a i5 4460 running at 3.2Ghz, 8GB 1600mhz ram and a 970 running at factory clocks I'm averaging between 50-70 with everything maxed out with the exception of stuff like lens flare, depth of field, HDR and stuff like that. I mean, 50-60 fps is pretty acceptable but for a FPS I tend to find more confortable playing these types of games with abit higher FPS. Like I said, I believe it's a limitation of the engine itself and that the devs have done everything they could to improve it, still, I believe it should be taken into account.The developers have certainly listened to the community during the whole development process and I believe that is to be praised. The developers took into account many suggestions made by the community and adressed various complaints and added things such as a mute/block option, bullet drop and team balancing.Overall, Verdun is a great game, if you can get past the lag and performance issues, and I believe that is mainly because it brings a fresh type of experience for an online multiplayer FPS by taking place in WWI and by taking a great and well done approach to the trench warfare since most FPS out there are pretty much taking place in a modern day setting. Most of the problems I had with the game during Early Access were fixed or greatly improved and I believe I can say that Verdun is of the best FPS I've played in recent years. Verdun is certainly an example for games to come on how it is possible to make FPS games on other time periods other than WWII and the modern era and, as I've said previously, the trench attack and defend mechanic is just so well executed and it brings a whole new dynamic to this kind of game.

												Verdun, simply put, is one of the most ambitious and fully realized first-person shooters that a lot of similar games never come close to achieving.This game literally bleeds with passion for recreating one of the most horrifying chapters in human history. From the ambient WW1-era music in the main menus to the sprawling trench-lines on the battlefields to even individual soldiers' uniforms this game is truly the product of a dedicated team.The core game mode of Verdun entails capturing and holding trenches of course. The Entente and Central Powers take turns attacking and defending until time runs out or one side captures every line. Many other games have a similar ""capture and hold this area"" gameplay mechanic but Verdun takes a different approach. Soldiers can establish footholds in a trench so that their teams' overall attack can continue, and if enough defenders are killed momentum can swift in the attackers' favor by giving them more time to take the trench. The defenders can however take back the initiative by pushing all enemy players out their trench and preventing any more players from entering until the attack phase ends.In order for your team to be able to successfully attack and defend their trenches, working with your squad is an absolute must! But what is great about Verdun is how squad gameplay feels natural and fluid unlike other games that use a forced squad mechanic. Squads in Verdun are compromised of four men each assigned a role within a overall squad type. As of this writing, the three squad type include line infantry, recon, and assault squads. Line infantry squads can call in artillery strikes, have machine gun capabilities, accurate rifle fire and access to grenades. Recon squads are fast moving, highly accurate riflemen that can use a recon plane to reveal enemies positions to the squad. The assault squad is able to call in gas to harass the enemy, can be equipped with melee weapons (think trench clubs and shovels) and have access to advanced weaponry.While these squads on their own can be rather deadly, they can get much better through squad experience points you earn when you play with the same players repeatedly. As your squad levels up, each squad role will get access to better skills such as the ability to hold your breath longer and upgraded capabilities such as improved artillery strikes or a recon plane bombing run depending on what the squad type is. As you individually level up, you will unlock career points which can be used to purchase more loadouts for each squad role. This can all sound a little intimidating at first, but everything comes together seamlessly creating a highly customizable playing experience that caters to individual players' tastes.So after spending more than 300 hours in Verdun since getting the game in October 2013, what makes me continue to come back to the trenches? Every time I play the game feels fresh and frankly just plain fun to play. One of the best mechanics of Verdun is how well paced the overall gameplay is. You can easily have a slow moment in the game where you are hanging back in the trenches waiting for the the enemy to come. Next minute, artillery is raining down all over the trench-line, gas is quick seeping in creating a deadly and terrifying sensation as you quickly dawn your gas mask. You look to your side as some of your unfortunate teammates asphyxiate to death on the fumes since they were too slow to equip their mask. Suddenly you hear a shout and see enemy players charging over the top of your trench bashing in any your teammates they see leaving you only seconds to fight them off or face certain death.It's these little experiences in Verdun that really make the game worth coming back to again and again. The only real complaint I had and still somewhat have with Verdun is the thorny issue of optimization. Ever since the game was moved to the Unity 5 engine, it has always been difficult for a fair amount of players including me to get a consistent framerate with the game. The issue seems to be irrespective of what your hardware setup is, as I meet the recommended system requirements and I have seen users who more than meet recommended get a paltry FPS. However the developers to their credit have and continue to release numerous patches that have addressed optimization issues. There are sill annoying micro-stutters in framerate I encounter from time to time, even when there is not too much action onscreen. But again recent builds largely created a highly playable game and I am confident the developers will only improve the game further.All in all, I cannot highly recommend Verdun enough. With exciting new squad types, game modes and maps in the works and the possibility of expansion packs in the future, Verdun has dug its foxhole and is here to stay! With that then, see you in the trenches!			"

												I'm crawling down in the mud among the dead men. We all signed for this, some of them added a year to their age to go here, to reach this hell. The bomb struck few meters away from me. Tinnitus in my left ear. All I can hear is buzzing noise that drives me nuts. Our attack didn't succeed. Now we're defending this point desperately and I can hear enemy... I can FEEL enemy getting closer. Too afraid to raise my head, to afraid to take a look. I keep my head low. It might save my life. I've seen it before. Head goes above the sandbag line... Splattered brain showers the muddy trench. I can't move. My NCO told me to stay here. Moving away, progressing or backing up would mean I'm a deserter. And we all knew what happens to those poor souls.I see a sizzling bomb dropping a few meters away and suddenly, the trench is filled with thick green smoke. Mustard. Senfgas, as Germans call it. I feel like a trapped mouse. Panic takes control over my body. My hands are struggling to protect my face with a gas mask. I... I did it. I've started running away mindlessly from the deafening noise of shots.I feel the enemy getting clos...Bayonet strikes my chest and pierces skin, muscles and bones. The pointy, rusty blade exits through my back. I taste blood on my tongue. Thundering noise in my head, I raise it to see the eyes of my killer. He has the same eyes, just like me, hidden behind the gas mask, just like mine. He... he's me, the same frightened boy who will think of his mother the way I'm thinking about mine right now... maybe a bit later. Maybe tomorrow. Who knows... He's just been a bit more lucky than me at this moment. I can sense his misery and fear while he pulls the steel out and pushes me away. As I fall down, I see him going away. Leaving my body to be swallowed by everlasting darkness...This is Verdun.			"

OverviewVerdun is supposedly the first WWI FPS. Made by two indie companies with a total of three developers, while many think such low development wouldn't be successful, the game proves them wrong.PresentationGraphics in this game are superb, not many people expect much more out of an indie company. There are some graphic options in the menu however I wish there was just a bit more. Currently there are no sound controls, but the developers said they will add it in at a later date. As far as the battlefields go, they are rather spectacular, however somewhat bland. There is detail in every little part, with huge craters in no man's land, dead animals in the middle of no man's land barbed wire all over, it gives the player a feeling like they are actually experiencing WWI. Currently there are three maps, but I believe that they are working on adding more, all three look authentic and believable. However there are some drawbacks. Low frame rates haunt almost every player in this beta, while not unplayable it's more annoying, especially when you get killed because your fps dropped during the action. Hopefully this can be fixed before release. (UPDATE: Devs have released an update, upgrading their engine and fixing some lag, while I still experience some, it is minimized.)  The menus are a bit buggy, but overall the devs have done a superb job on the visual side.GameplayGameplay is supposedly centered around you squad and your role in it. Yet with no current voice chat and little incentive to stay with your squad, your officer could be on the complete other side of the map and it would have no influence on your gameplay. However if you play with your friends and you really drive your squad based gameplay, it can actually help, turning your squad into a cruel fighting machine. This game has a leveling up system, your squad levels up with new uniforms and tech, and you have your own level, aswell as your rifles get leveled up. The leveling system needs some work as it doesn't seem like it is that responsive or effective. The main mode (or atleast what I presume is the main mode) is what their version of what the western front is. You get a set amount of time to storm the enemy trench with your team. If you can kill everyone in that trench and hold it for a set amount of time that is now your front line trench and you have to defend for the same amount of time. However if you are unsuccessful in storming the trench, you have about 30 seconds to retreat back into your trench and defend. If you don't make it back in 30 seconds you're deemed a deserter and are killed, but more on that later. I assume the gameplay is actually decently realistic, removing some factors, but is pretty fun. The other game mode is a rifle deathmatch. Basically it is a free for fall across the entire map. This is a great way to work out the maps and practice your rifling skills. One of the problems with this game is that you die way too much. It's easy to die in a normal game 30+ times. Some would call this being realistic and I get that, but at points it can just be annoying. Another aspect mentioned earlier is that if you go outside the area of the map the game wants you to be in you can be killed because you're ""abandoning"". If you go behind where you're supposed to, you are killed. If you leave you're trench and go forward when defending you are killed. If you're attacking and you go past their trench you are killed. This can get annoying, however it does push the WWI playstyle so it is not such a madhouse. Another annoying feature is how deadly the barbed wire is. One can simply run into them and die a few seconds later, I don't know how realistic this is, but it sure is annoying if you don't see it. The gameplay is fun, although I hope they optimize it more to make it a great game.MultiplayerThis game is currently solely multiplayer, however the devs had mentioned in the forums they are looking to add a multiplayer mode with bots, which I really hope they do, just incase I can't play online. As far as online goes the players are actually extremely nice. The players on this game are no Dota players, they actually help you out, even if they are on the opposite team, and I've seen that the teams have joked around with each other creating a great environment. Most everyone in the forums are nice aswell, answering my questions and inviting me to play with them when I didn't even ask. I hope that this can remain true beyond it's release.ExtrasThe devs are working on many things, they just released a nice Christmas update where there is a new Christmas map and you can throw snowballs at one another. This is a nice little addition, and unneeded, but it was nice of them to add it. The devs say that they will add more before release and I hope they can come through, The game is really spectacular for just three devs, and I look forward to more.SummaryVerdun is a unique WWI first person shooter by a dedicated indie team that pulled it off with a great dynamic gameplay and different game modes. With a few minor drawbacks this is a great experience any first person shooter or history fanatic should checkout, and I know I'll be playing for awhile..			"

												This game is nothing like call of duty. That should be the seller right there. But anyway this game is purely based on teamwork. Not one single person can singlehandedly take out al of the enemy team and capture the trench line. Its teamwork. And When ever you see gas dont take the chance and try to charge throught it because that one time you think its Bromide gas its actually Mustard Gas and its all to late for you my soon to be ded freind.

												This game is literally the reason I still have faith in 1) the indie gaming community 2) the historical community 3) the world at large. Thank you Verdun devs, thank you four-player based squad gameplay, and thank you Verdun community - never change! 2000+ hours since Steam Greenlight, and it's only getting better: love the free content, the gore update, the meticulously beautiful maps, the personal touch of the three core developers, the surreal weirdness, and most of all the constant attention to ""realism"" (whatever THAT is) that has been a priority since the beginning. It's gritty, and that's how war is too, as I understand from a distance. Keep it that way. As a PhD student in history, I could not support this game more. Thanks for making it Linux friendly - and bugs be damned. This game comes 100% recommended.			"

												You stand in a hole, created from what you can only guess is a bomb. Next to you is a dead soldier, his body half buried in the mud. His body is in such a bad state that you cant even tell which side he is on, or well, used to be on. Suddenly you hear that you need to push up and attack the enemies trenches. Being a soldier you emerge and blindly follow the orders given by your squad commander who is 50 meters back safe and sound with his binoculars, calling in mortar fire and is hardly in any danger at all.After setting foot in the mud above the hole you get a second to look around. Fallen comrades everywere, half of them are still alive screaming for their moms and others just screaming from the pure terror of looking at what used to be their leg. It doesn't take long for you to realize that you are all that is left from your wave of soldiers. You somehow managed to survive. After running about five meters and taking cover behind a pile of dirt you look behind yourself and see the faces of the new infantry wave starting to take their first steps out of the trenches of safety towards the fields of the battle. You feel happy for a moment thinking ""yes! reinforcments! Now I might be able to get som help and take this trench once and for all."" The happiness is soon shattered as you hear heavy enemy gunfire from a machine gun and seeing the new wave of reinforcments being slaughterd and torn to shreds from the hail of bullets. A spark of rage reaches through your body after seeing your comrads die and all you want to do is kill! Kill these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that mowes down a friend after another without any remorse. After realizing help isn't comming you think ""To hell with it!"" And with your trusty rifle and bayonnete you charge the enemy trench and somehow manage to jump down and enter it without taking a bullet in the chest. ""Look to the right and then left."" you think for yourself. The right side seems clear but there is a german soldier on the left facing away from you. And before you know it you pull the trigger, out of pure reflex. The recoil of the rifle shocks you almost as much as it shocked the german. And after realizing that he was shot the german soldier falls to the ground, screaming and crying. You hit him in the chest and it's almost like you can hear his lungs collapsing as he is gasping for air, still in shock from the extreme pain he is experiencing. The guilt starts to rise as you realize he is not much older than you are. Perhaps even younger. Immedietly you start making excuses in your head as if anyone would judge you for shooting the enemy. ""It's not my fault"", ""This was self defense"", ""I didn't mean to...."" And somewere between all of these thoughts you realize that you are no better than the people that are mowing down your comrads. You pass the young german who has now gone silent but is still moving around in pure agony. ""Another one! Another german is less than five meters away!"" you think. But it is to late. He already has his sights aimed in at your heart. And suddenly you start to fall. While you are falling you see anger in the soldiers eyes. ""Perhaps it was his friend I just killed."" But it doesn't matter. Even though you can't feel the pain you are coughing up blood. You take your final breath and a small one at that. And then you die.      In short this game is kinda cool			"

												Verdun is a game that (I think) you will either love or hate. You will die. A lot. You will fight over and over for the same stretch of land, again and again. Did I say you will die a lot? You will. A lot.Being a veteran of the Red Orchestra 2 and Rising Storm games, dying a lot is not necessarily a bad thing to me. If I take a bullet, that means that one of my squadmates didn’t. Maybe one of them was my squad leader. Now I can spawn closer to the enemy trench! I love dying in the mud of no man’s land.There are two game modes, but you will most likely only play Frontlines. In this mode, you fight over a small section of the Western Front where the goal is to advance and capture sectors, or defend those sectors from being captured. If an attack loses momentum, melts away in machine gun fire as it were, the roles are reversed and the defending team goes on the attack. Sometimes a team keeps on advancing, but mostly the teams go back and forth over the same stretch of bloody mud until the match is over.The game is at its best with a full server. The maps are fairly small, and the fights are intense. It’s probably not that realistic, but it’s gritty. On of the best (and scariest) moment so far was when I had just fallen back from a failed attack and was back in my trench. I got up on the firing step and aimed my SMLE at a green cloud of bromide gas. Out of the cloud came three gray-clad Landsers in gas masks, rushing my position. I managed to take one down, but the others jumped into the trench and shot me in the back. Damn.Are you on the fence about this game? I can’t tell you if you will like this game, I can just tell you that I love this game. Have you played Red Orchestra 2 and/or Rising Storm and liked those games? If yes, then you’d probably love this game.			"

												Tired of fast paced first person shooters? Need more tactic based movements and strategies? Remember playing CoD 1 or MOHAA/SH/BT? Then listen up:This game literaly blew my mind and took me back to my experience with MOHAA. Bolt action rifles, peering around corners, afraid to move an inch to your left without exposing yourself too much. AHH my blood is pumping agian and not from a rage endused heart attack that im used to from newer FPS games. This game has alot of balance to it, i dont even know where to begin. Imagine fighting for domination over a trench line only to get overrun and forced to retreat back to the previous line of defense. Imagine pushing forward and taking over the trench you just lost whilst shooting the retreating enemies back to the the crap hole they came from. Its simply just a great game. I would say a hefty learning curve at the begining, with no room for tactical error. Meaning, you will spawn, and then move, and then die. Lucky for you, you get to come back and learn how to manuever around in the cold, muddy, and poissibly gas filled trenches as you fight your enemy tooth and nail for the very ground you stand on.Keepin it Real, Reign			"

Early Access Review
								**updated review****posted 2014**As an early access game with a relatively small server population and only 3 developers, Verdun continues to impress me. Verdun being one of a handful of playable First World War games in existence, I was eager to fork out the $15 for the Steam beta. That was around the time the Picardie update was implemented, and I was happy to find that Verdun ran just fine on my laptop. After putting 50 hours into the three maps and finding my niche in the squad system, I can say that Verdun is only getting better. Verdun offers unique challenges and experiences that cannot be found elsewhere as a relatively simple FPS game. Currently, weapons are historically limited to bolt-action rifles, clunky machine guns, pistols, and grenades. The simplicity in weaponry helps level the playing field and keeps any one player from dominating the other team. Often when storming a trench I will cut down the first man in front of me and the man behind him will take me down while I re-chamber only to be shot by my squad mate that has (hopefully) followed behind. This unique nature of Verdun helps make it playable to most people even if they are bad at a traditional FPS, and I appreciate that. There are still things that frustrate me about Verdun. Things like prone blocking that keep me from taking cover when it is vital, inactive players blocking the trench, the multiple shots sometimes required to kill, and the inexplicable tendency for small pieces of wood on the map to get in-between my crosshairs and the enemy. I am sure any real problems will be addressed by developers because they are undoubtedly in tune with the dedicated community of players and any useful feedback given to them.To summarize, Verdun was worth my money and the positive trend of developer support and effort is showing no signs of lessening. **updated content, 2016**After a few years of playing Verdun on-and-off since my original purchase, I still recommend this game to any prospective buyer. My previous statement about the positive trend of development has definitely played out over these years. Content including 5 new maps, 8 new squads (with 4 new nationalities represented), nearly 50 new weapons, two new game modes, and an intense gore option have been added (for free) since I first reviewed this game. Lately, new content has been more rare mostly because the developers have been focusing on porting Verdun to the Xbox One (its already out for PS4). After this I'm not sure what will be added but I'm excited to see what it is. My old complaints are now outdated. Proneblocking does not bother me as much as it used to, whether that's because I got used to it or because they fixed it I'm not sure. The same goes for the multipule shot kills. I think sometime in the past few years the hit system was reworked so all rifles (plus the machinengewehr) are 1-shot kills while pistols/other LMGs are 1-to-2 shot kills. The whole thing about small peices of wood was just the past me being silly. New players will most likely experience a learning curve. Be sure to read the official steam guides on the weaponry and squad role/leveling system. Also, be aware that most people play the Frontlines gamemode (a trench-by-trench attack/defend match) and that the other three gamemodes are often mostly depopulated. Two things a new player should try to remember is that teamwork is not absolutely necessary but is always preferable, and that having a negative k/d is totally fine because you can still have a great match with 30+ deaths. Many people complain about aim-bots and cheaters, but usually these are just cases of very experienced players laying waste to less experienced/less patient players. If you get frustrated just switch lobbies, or, better yet, join their team.Finally, after playing this game for over 2 years, I've developed a deep respect for the tone of the game and how the developers have chosen to portray a ""generic"" soldier's experience of the Western Front during the First World War. Verdun avoids the dramatism and theatrics of most war films and other games like Battlefield 1 and Valiant Hearts (although I would still recommend the latter game). There is no attempt to personalize the player's experience by telling a story or by forcing the player to use charcters with detailed biographies. There are no emotional cutscenes or any dramatic music. This does not mean that Verdun feels impersonal or inauthentic. Verdun manages to respect the terrible reality that was the First World War by including details which are somewhat unnecessary to the gameplay (like the sheer choice of weapons and the level of uniform detail), heavy but realistic gore mechanics (lots of screaming and loss of limbs), and refusing to center the experience of the game around a handful of fictional individuals. I feel that Verdun's lack of storytelling and non-linear multiplayer allows my experience of the game to be more organic, and, as a result, it feels more authentic and ""real.""To summarize again, Verdun was totally worth my money and the game itself is set apart for its high level of histroically accurate detail as well as its dedicated and responsive developers. If its on sale and you are on the fence, go for it! It is much cheaper than BF 1 after all....			"

												Outnumbered 3 to 8 the germans advancing unto us with there rifles straight and spirits high. Unfortunately for the Germans the three men in the trenches were Canadian. (((Scroll all the way down for TL;DR version)))But in all seriousness this game is one of the best fps shooters I have played. I initially thought that a game about trenches would be fairly boring due to its natures of staying in one spot for most of the time. This game however is non-stop action from start to finish where at first you defend your trench and then proceed with an attack. there is so much thought that goes into trench warfare. For example: -Mounting MGs in the right positions, -placeing gas in the right places, -when and where to bomb,-when to cross no mans land,-How to fight in the trenches,and the list goes on.Pros:-Great Graphics-The sound in the game is amazing-instilled pride in me that i didnt even know I had-Gameplay is well polishedCons(minor):-Some servers do tend to lag but it is very uncommon and not that big of a problem-Learning curve is a little steep but once you get going you'll be goldenI would also recommend playing this game with a bunch of your friends on skype or what have you because I find it to be a way better experience.I highly recommend this game to anyone 10/10 would play again.[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[TL;DR]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]Game is Amazing expecially with friends. well worth the price offered.Press 4 to put on your gas mask.

												September ?, 1915""I have recently been stuck in an unknown bunker in an unknown trench with an unknown man. I have survived with the cartridges I found on my dead squad's bodies. The bunker has been encaved from mortar and artillery fire where I have survived several days by having my shambles of spirit and concrete keeping me company. The haunting laughs of Germans have become my dreams and nightmares, while hoping to survive. I would fight my way out and hopefully die as a hero...but sadly my leg is broken and my blood-dried clothes have given me false hope leading to me laying here for hours with the constant drips of blood and rain falling on my face. I dream about the warm fire and beds back home in my village near London, but what starts as a dream, ends up as a rude awakening with the moist mud surrounding me. Why was I here again? The constant pounding of fresh Earth and vibrations made me realize...Germans...Loos...a battle? Yes...a battle...Hill 70...i think? Why is this important...we failed and men are dead..why not me? Doesn't matter now, I have decided to use the broken rifles of my comrades to splint my leg, I have courage to kill any Germans I see...a couple of grenades? No problem. I see the yellow-green gas in the distance..coming to take me and be my guardian angel...10 shots in my clip...one bayonet...and enough courage to kill an army...Let's go Tommies, over the trenches again.""~Unknown Tommy, Unknown Regiment, Known Courage--Battle of Loos			"

In the Trenches, snipers shooting everyone who stands up, mortars and grenades going off in every direction. The game has a wide variety of weapons, armies, maps and many more pieces of content and is adding new content all the time.The Graphics are also wonderful, I have never seen less than 50 FPS, and I've seen FPS all the way up to 120.

								Good little game, great details was given to weapons, they look the real thing, uniforms and sceneries are ok. Could improve artillery, quite limited, only one player has grenades which is inaccurate for the days, no trench knife or club, limited use of bayonet, they could introduce tanks, gas, make the trenches more complex and have more than 5 players per side. There are hardly any games relating to WWI which is a shame considering it is a very interesting era, the end of a romanticised type of conflict with flamboyant uniforms and cavalry, lancers and swords, and the emergence of mechanised armies, modernised weaponry and for the first time use of camouflage. There would be more interest in the game if it was made more realistic also, anyway I like it, I recommend it and would like to see more people play it			"

												I'm a ww1 Australian reenactor and I love my ww1 history. This game has fufilled everything i could have ever wanted in a ww1 FPS. It feels like im in a genuine battle, you get mowed down by rifle and machinegun fire when sprinting across no-mans land. You get bombed to pieces by artillery and grenades. This is the genuine ww1 experience if you are looking for a game set during The Great War. The only thing i would like to see added to this game would be larger squad sizes. and possibly a larger player cap. Say 64/64 for example with 4 squads of 8 men. So 1 Officer/NCO, 4 Rifleman, 2 Bombers, and 1 Light Machine Gunner. It would just increase the realism and intese fighting that you see in pictures of ww1. Everyone almost shoulder to shoulder running across no-mans land. But apart from wanting to see that (only cause im a ww1 reenactor :P ) I give this game 10/10.			"

												“Trench fighting is the bloodiest, wildest, most brutal of all ... Of all the war's exciting moments none is so powerful as the meeting of two storm troop leaders between narrow trench walls. There's no mercy there, no going back, the blood speaks from a shrill cry of recognition that tears itself from one's breast like a nightmare.” ― Ernst Jünger, Storm of SteelThis is a damn well made indie game. While not as polished or smooth as other AAA FPS titles, this is definitely the best WW1 FPS out there, and will continue to be even after Battlefield 1's release. The squad system is well fleshed out, and doesn't leave out many major combatants(from the western front anyway), with great variety of different classes and tactics to choose from. The classes range from machine gunners, to officers that can call in artillery/gas attacks and add ""buffs"" to nearby team mates, to melee/ close range focused assault classes, to sniper units. The different equipment and class types make it feel like you need to ""roleplay"" your role, as that's what your equipment is for. Leveling up these classes through play adds a neat progression system that gives your character more weapons, more abilities, etc. In addition to class leveling, there is a very unique squad leveling system that makes it feel like you are part of an epic war, as they are persistent across matches. Teamwork is essential, and you really get the sense that your squad is its own self sufficient unit in a much larger conflict. The variety of squad types is awesome too, ranging from U.S. Doughboys to elite Alpenjägers, to the scrappy Belgians, to the rough and tough French Poilus. As your squad levels up, your player models become better armed and tougher looking, just like a squad would in real life. The ability to name squads whatever you want, from ""Donald Trump's Royal Guard"" to ""The Really Bad Marksmen"" or something adds a lot of personality and a feeling of pride as you fight with other players on your team. It's so cool to see so many factions represented in an accurate, respectful manner, I can't believe France is out of BF1 while the Americans are in, makes no god damn sense to me.Didn't play this much in Early Access, but now it's a fun, engaging, harrowing team based experience that anyone who has a passing interest in WW1 should try out!

Early Access Review
								The newer people will be impatient or naive, and crawl along on the dirt thinking they are hidden or charge gloriously with their comrades, only to be machine gunned down.After that, you'll will get a feel for the battle, seeing the shadows of enemy movements in enemy trenches, watching out for the flash of a rifle, knowing that the bullet sound that sounded a little 'too close' was indeed too close and that you should start crawling down for a different approach. Survival is important, leave forlorn hope to those who want it, you want to live right?And then whatever idea of self preservation will be thrown out a windowYour brothers in arms will start to swarm in, the enemy line reduced, dying by dozens trying to take one tiny foothold in the trenches. You'll see a teamate charge next to you and get sniped, and still, you'll get up and charge in, praying that the next bullet doesn't hit you. Because that trench has to be captured, even if you know it'll be hell. You'll hear the explosion roaring around you. You might see it happen in front of you, killing your squadmates. Bodies will be sprawled across the trenches, move cautiously to clear it out, The moment you take the trench, there is no reprive, only onslaughts of mortars and toxic gas, you can't see anything, you can't tell friend from ally. Shoot shots blindly into the gas, you could've sworn you saw something moving.Reload- no, he's in front of you now, charge him! Stab him! Hold the trench, you move next to an ally, popping shots at the krauts or tommies that are charging to quickly retake your position. Then a small clink, a bounce at your feet, and a spring in your foot would be an understatement of what happens to you and your friend.If you allow yourself the experience, you will receive it, every charge through no man's land, every euphoria of a shot knowing the enemy never knew what hit him, protecting your CO, even above your own life. Every moment of the WWI experience is here in Verdun, it is breath taking and glorious.			"

								Only game where you can nerd out in chat about WW1 history facts without being berated. Community is friendly and helpful, in my opinion, due to no in-game voip, which i am completely fine with.WW1 FPS that focuses on the squad and not because of your K/D or level. People who cry about dying alot belong in COD or world of tanks. Work as a team and you accomplish great things in the game.Death is inevitable in the game, only FPS game i've ever enjoyed dying. Haters have bad PCs and can't swing their rifles for the life of them. Check out the game's sponsored guides.11/10 would raid trenches in real life			"

								I normally don't write reviews but this game is really awesome!!It's very refreshing to have a fps game that is down to earth without this killstreak bs and creating icons.It is very fair balanced and both teams get their equal share of a chance to win the game and it's down to the teams ability to play as a team or at least play thoughtful and not selfish. When your team has its turn to attack, then attack and don't camp unless you give cover with an MG or mortar as NCO. When the enemy comes in numbers from the right, then tell your team mates. It's very unique and quite refreshing. Please do buy it and give it a fair go. It's already worth its price and can only go one way (better) from where it is now.  "

Early Access Review
								What do i think of Verdun?I think ti's a really good concept that they tried to grasp and make into a video game, you don't see many fps games during WWl or before so to see this out on the market really caught my attention by itself.I'll start by saying i got this game early december and there was a update or two but that was it, i began to think the devs just took my money and ran away. However recently they just had a update and i've gotta say they've improved the game a lot and it looks a lot nicer too.The game is unique in its own way because the fighting style is just like WWl and if you don't know what  i mean well then it's all pretty much trench warfare so close combat kinda stuff and it's a attack/defend style. So one side, ex. the germans, will leave their own trench and run across no mans land. No mans land is pretty self explanitory it's called that because no one wants to be there. It's covered in barbed wire (which if you run in will slow you down and kill you) and is just an open field, the only cover you can use to help yourself are the shell holes that are scatered around. While all this is going on the french are sitting in their trench with their rifles/mgs just mowing you guys down, and you're just praying that you'll somehow sneak into their trench and capture it.The game trys to make teamplay an important thing by giving you extra points if you work as a squad. There are 4 different roles in each squad that are all unique in their own ways. You have a NCO that carries a pistol and commands orders of where to attack or can place motor fire down on a positionThere's the classic rifleman you obviously has a rifle, pretty basicYou can be the Support role which carrys an old WWl mg (which is ♥♥♥♥ btw) and covers your teammates as they move up or you can be that badass mowing down the enemy as they advance forwardLastly there's the sniper which is pretty self explanitoryThe game is also somewhat active, you can find games to play in and have fun and even every now and again join a full game.The downsides.Even though you can find games like i just said it's also a down side because there are usually only 3, 4 at the most you can join.The lag can be pretty bad at times and you can't vote kick people out of games. For example i was playing last night and a guy on my squad had a ping of +650. He was making the whole game lag up and there was nothing we could do and he wouldn't leave so therefor i had to leave.They only have two gamemodes to play, The classic attack/defend and the other is free for all.Free for all is a lot of fun....IF you can get a game going. There's usually only about 2-4 people playing free for all so you're never getting the full expierence that they wanted you have with the gamemode. so you're always stuck then playing attack/defendThe other thing that's bad about this game is it's community. The people you play with are either a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to you or don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ they're doing and while they should b rushing and attacking they are camping in the back with rifles sniping so you never advance and you lose every match. Every time i've told my team to push up or ask them why they aren't helping me they all tell me to stop complaining.Over all i give this game a solid 7/10I think the price may be a tad bit overpriced, i'm not saying they are ripping you off, but if this game goes on sale you should pick up a copy of it for sure.

								UpdateAfter I played for awhile I realized that each Faction has different classes. There is classes that only have a pistol with a bunch of gernades. It totally depends on your play style and preference. I absolutely love that. My favorite class is the Flanker for the Canadians. The more I play this game the more I hope it grows. It is such a fantastic experience.

""Do I reccommend this game?"" not ""Do I like this game?"" This is one fits both.Verdun is a World War One trench warfare shooter. There is nothing like it right now. I hear a lot of my friends say it looks like a Red Orchestra 2 with World War One skins. That is not true for several reasons.There is so many unique things in Verdun that I can not compare it to any other shooter. As soon as you spawn you look out beyond your trenches and see fog covering No Man's Land [the area between the teams' trenches] with men running then falling down. Soldiers scream war cries and charge whistles blow. Bi-planes fly over head, artillery crushes your side, and Mustard Gas lurks ever so omniously. As you gaze at the breath taking sight...you got shot right in the face.You will then try to ""learn by doing"". This is where a con comes in. Just like every Multiplayer only game--you'll die over and over again before you learn how to play. This is fine by me really but in Verdun it's really bad. There is a rank system. At first that sounds fine. It sounds like Call of Duty or Battlefield. Let me tell you--I don't want to hear one person complain about starting weapons in a First Person Shooter ever again. In Verdun--you start with a pistol. I have been a Canadian on the Entente side the entire 2.7 hours I have so far so I had a Webley which is a six shooter. You start with that or whatever the Axis variant is.So here you are--not sure what to do or where to go and you are having to defend yourself with a pistol while opposing forces are sniping you from affair. You learn to bob, weave, and hide so you can pick off a few foes with your little potato gun. Don't get me wrong you can destroy with this gun.....once....you learn how to use it.You get your adrenaline pumping with all the booms and charge whistles accompanied by war cries. You start doing work--you follow orders, you get some kills, and hey look your team won.Next comes the XP screen and there it is--no unlocks. After awhile you realize guns are class specific. You have to level up the class you may not even realized you pick in order to get the rifles. Now it comes together.This is fine by me--it is trial by fire--but this is going to leave a bad taste in some newbies' mouth and may either go play the dry rifle deathmatch mode or just stop. Once I got the rifle I was doing even more work then I was doing. It was great.The maps are all trenches but man they are all different aswell. It's so weird really. Even though it's the same concept--charge and defend--each map brings a different element to the game. Speaking of maps let me bring up the visuals. This game in my opinion looks amazing just because of the detail. The soldiers are detailed, the maps are detailed, the guns are detailed, the bi-plane is detailed, the dead horse on this one map I found is detailed, it is just a detailed game and I love it so much. The accents are spot-on and the atmosphere just captures World War One as you have seen in pictures or in films. I got so immersed.One thing that would help the immersion is no hud but you kind of need it at times. So I decided to leave that out of the pro, both, con list. A lot of the cons like terrain walls I won't discuss in detail because this game is in Early Access and the Devs are doing a fantastic job of cleaning this game up. Updates are frequent and they contain so much content. Just take a look for yourself.Overall--I love this game. While I think it takes a required taste to be able to enjoy this game I have to recommend it because I want to see this game grow. Only a few hundred play this game--I hope for more.So if you are interested--go ahead and buy it			"

Pros:+ Weapons are accurate to the era+ Multiple different game options, including death matches or more realistic wave based trench warfare.+ Lots of squad options for both the Central Powers and the Triple Entente. These squads are also balanced out through unit variety, with different units fulfilling different, usually equally important roles. + The game is balanced well, with bolt-actions dominating the field. However machine gun and rarer sub-machine guns also make an appearance, and all weapons have their upsides and downsides such as machine guns being mainly sedentry making them easy pickings for snipers.+ A large variety of environments, including the bleak, barbed wire scarred earth of Champagne and Artois, to the wooded Vosges.+ High realism helps to create an amazing atmosphere for the game, with shells causing you to dive to the floor, and bullets zipping over the trench the game certainly feels very weighted. + Obtaining equipment is easy in this game, and you'll often find you have too many points to spend on weapons, this makes it very easy for new players to play what they want to play with, unlike some more recent historical FPS games. *cough* Heroes and Generals *cough* Cons - The high realism may leave some players -who are used to other FPS games- frustrated by this game, which is extremely unforgiving. Barb wire, machine guns and artillery mean you'll often find yourself sat in a trench for a large part of the game.- The game (trench warfare, the main game type)  is also very team oriented, the squad, consisting of 4 players, votes for the squad type and faction they want to be on and this means you could, as a single player end up in a scenario where you aren't playing what you want.- Some specific squad units I feel could have some changes, the Überwacher from the AlpenJäger  squad has a negligible effect, and binoculors seem pointless. Perhaps an idea would be to have binculors spot people on the minimap or on the hud (balance at the sake of realism?) however I am aware there are those that would disagree.-Finding servers with people on can be difficult, I know this is largely down to the game receiving less attention than it should but I also feel matchmaking could be improved to allow people to see what servers have people on them. As at the moment it's luck of the draw if you get into a match with a lot of people on it.-Glitches still exist wherein you get kicked out of the match whilst changing maps, and it's extremely frustrating due to the above point. All in all for those looking to purchase this game, I would recommend it, it has a lot of replayability, and if you've got a bunch of friends to play with it's even better for getting the real atmosphere.

												I launch into my first ever game. I arrive in a trench with a bolt action rifle and a gas mask. I notice a look out post just up ahead. I set up shop, aim down my sights and look into the wastelands beyond me. I see nobody. Then suddenly the sound of a small metal object flies up next to me with an abrupt stop. I look down to my right. My comrade is laying on the floor lifeless beside me. I panic. I take aim and look back into No Man's Land; I can't see anyone. Time passes; I am still alive. I decide this is it I must make a move. I find a nearby ladder and start climbing up over the edge of my trench. I'm still alive. This is amazing, I feel not only invincible but invisible. I run as fast as I can towards the enemy trench when suddenly I stop. I look down; I am stuck, my trousers are tied up in a mess of barbed wire. I try to move forward out of it but it is of no use. A brief small winding noise flies towards me, a bullet gets lodged in my head. I have died, my corpse stuck in a mess of barbed wire, my helmet a few feet away. I respawn and return to my previous post. I take aim and look out and there he is. A head just peering over a sandbag on the edge of the enemy trench. I hold my breath, aim the gun straight at his head and pull the trigger. I've never felt so excited and rewarded for getting a single kill in my life. I stop to celebrate for a brief moment, pumping my fist in the air, only to return my eyes to the screen and see I've been killed again. Damn this game is good.			"

								(REVIEW UPDATED 1/23/15)  Btw I died while playing as a Canadian soldier and screamed EH as I died. 12 out of 10 xD.________________________________________________________________________________  This game has gotten SO MUCH BETTER.  In December, I was really bothered by how the game didn't really feel like it was simulating trench warfare in a historically accurate way but the devs have recently added chemical weapons into the game.  This does SO MUCH for immersion because it forces soldiers to use gas masks and it's really terrifying because you can die with in 30 seconds if you don't use your gas mask.  Not to mention you can't see ANYTHING if the gas is in your area which makes everything so much more tense, realistic, and stressful.  The trench warfare is so much better too because when you invade another trench you are FORCED to run straight ahead into enemy lines just like real life soldiers had to do back then.  I forgot to mention that the graphics are 10 times better than they were originally and they just make this title shine like a hidden gem.  The only technical flaws with the game at the moment are that you will experience lots of bugs, lag, occasional crashes which will be dealt with in the future I'm sure, however, there are two things that I feel the devs can do to make Verdun an even more epic game.  The one problem that I have with the game on the whole is that you can make your own squad and let anyone in it be it your friends or strangers.  This sounds good but what REALLY ANNOYS ME is that if you leave your squad or quit the game, you'll see that random people have taken control of your squad and filled up all of the spots.  You can't really control what happens to your squad which is a real pain because your squad levels each round and basically YOU LOSE ALL OF YOUR PROGRESS IN THAT SQUAD because some random players have decided to take over the squad you made.  I WANT THE ABILITY TO CONTROL MY SQUAD COMPLETELY because it's my squad!!!!  I made it so my friends and I can play together but each and every time we play I have to make a new squad because some ♥♥♥ took my last squad!  M2H PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!!    The last problem that I have with Verdun is that I think the devs need to let players choose a secondary weapon like a revolver, pistol, and so on.  It might change the balance of the game a little but I REALLY FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT a sniper and machinegunner in WWI didn't carry a sidearm to help them in close combat should their trench be invaded.  I also think that the grenadier class as well as any other class that has just a pistol as a gun (excluding the officer class) should be given a primary weapon like a rifle.  I'm pointing this out because the pistol is horribly innaccurate and takes WAY TOO LONG to master, plus, the only close combat you'll experience is when you are invaded/invading another trench which makes the pistol kind of useless.  I'm not sure if any of the ""pistol"" classes were given rifles in real life but I think it'll make the game a little bit easier for new players and bring in more players for the game.  The last thing I'd like to suggest to the devs is that I think it'd be really interesting to let there be servers that have 32 players and then make servers that have 40 players, it'll add even more realism to the game given that the battles in WWI were gigantic, especially the Battle of Verdun  Verdun has always been one of my favorite games in general and I'm so glad that the devs at M2H studios are true to their word because they are making a really stellar game here.  ***THERE IS ONE DETAIL YOU SHOULD CONSIDER BEFORE GETTING THIS GAME BY THE WAY.****  Verdun is EXTREMELY TOUGH and you'll die more often than the times where you kill another player.  You'll be pulling your hair out at times especially if your new but once you get a kill in this game you feel like you've done the impossible and it'll moivate you to keep pushing forward.  I also love the fact that this game isn't like COD or BF where people get INSANE amounts of kills, the best players I've seen can get up to 60 kills tops but they're A VERY SMALL MINORITY.  Most players get like 10 kills or so on average because you and your troops are focussed on grabbing enemy territory which is EXACTLY what WWI was about.  Playing Verdun again has really just made me fall in love with it again and I can't recommend this game enough.  This is one of the best early access games out there and I PERSONALLY BELIEVE that this game should be in the top ten charts of best pc games AND I ALSO BELIEVE that the devs should try to get this game on consoles to further popularize this incredible title.My Score: 9.2/10			"

								So there I was. I had just finished smoking my pipe and replaced my wet socks for a dry pair. My day had started off as any usual day could be in the trenches; I shaved my face and had a hole in my pants patched up. Everything was exaclty the same as the day before ever since this bloody stalemate began. That was until the whistles began to blow. The enemy trenches echoed with chants and shouting as I peeked up to see silhouettes cresting the trench line. They were beginning their assault. Our squad leader rallied us all together to take our positions on the line. We fired shot after shot. Brass was beginning to stack up at our feet until finally, it seemed that the enemy had retreated back to the safety of their trench. They fell back leaving the wounded and dead to decorate the wasteland that lay in front of us. Our commanding officer began shouting orders but he was too far away to make out the words. Before i could catch my breath we were being signaled to begin our counterattack. I climbed over the wall and sprinted toward the enemy. I could see their line clearly now. I was getting close enough to see inside and i could see an opening that looked very inviting. I dove into the clearing and landed at the feet of 3 enemy troops. They had not seen me, so I opened fire! One down, two down, three! I had cleared the way for 2 more of my comrades to make it in. We began fighting our way down the trenchline clearing out our opposition. And boy was it a fight! We worked our way, foot by foot, deeper into enemy lines. Several of the men with me were taken out by sniper fire so I found myself alone yet again. I turned around to check my flank only to see gas billowing out toward me. I donned my mask as quickly as i could manage and hunkered down in a corner way. The glare from my mask lense, the crack of machine gun fire above my head, my heart beating so loud it almost drowned out the screams of wounded men. At that moment, I realized.... THIS GAME IS GREAT!			"

												I had been sitting in these trenches for what had felt like hours, maybe it was minutes, I couldn't tell. My squad and I were tasked with defending a spot on the German Third Line. I was with the French Army, I was only 20, dropped out of the University to join. I was waiting to spot something coming over those hills, anything at all. All you could see was the smoke on the horizon, and the distant sounds of gun and mortar fire. It was close to nightfall, all I had to eat was a stale piece of bread in the past 12 hours. It was almost pitch black when I saw something, I was almost positive it was something. I brought my Enfield up to my eyes to focus on that spot. My squad was spread to thin, I didnt know where they were, I was alone.         It had been 10 minutes since I heard anything. I was starting to think I was too tired, and was hearing things. Then I heard it again, the shuffle of something in the dirt, all my muscles tensed up. It was then when I saw the helmet, barely noticing it at all. The infamous german helmet, black and crowned with a spike. The man who came up looked as equally tired and hungry as me. I touched the cold trigger, it had been days since I last used it. The gun was loud, if I missed I would've died. I pressed the trigger, it hit something, he didnt go down. It hit the cannon behind him.         He looked up, right at my position. I went to pull my bolt back, and fire again. I knew I wouldnt miss again, the gun didnt fire it was jammed. I turned and ran, I had to get out of the trench. I turned the corner and stopped, I listened for any noises, I couldn't hear anything, I crouched and walked over to the ladder and climed out. I laid prone next to an abandoned wagon, it was destroyed probably by mortar fire. I laid there for the longest minutes of my life. My heart was still pounding and I thought it was screaming my position to the world. I saw the helmet again, around the same corner I was at just minutes ago. I waited for him to come around, I had a plan wait for him to pass, then shoot him from behind, he would never know, but instead he waited for hours. It was almost dawn, you could see the smallest glimpses of the sunlight.          I thought he left to report back to a much larger German force. I was ready to climb back in to my post, and write a report for my NCO. When he turned the corner, he just walked through, he was quiet, but seemed very unaware. He passed by, here was my chance to get him. I got up, and laid down, just then I felt a sharp piercing pain in my leg, I almost yelled. It was the barbed wire, it was everywhere in between trenches. He crouched to do something, he gave me time. I sat up to get my leg out, It was hard to get yourself out of barbed wire. I then got my arms stuck in it, I couldnt get my self out, I tried just pulling my limbs, It made my cuts deeper. I was quickly losing blood, I felt my life draining. I sat there staring at the sky, until death consumed me10/10, would die from barbed wire again			"

												The sirens call of the attack whistle. Constant volleys of artillery raining shrapnel and debris over your position. Gas obscuring the attackers as they flood into your trench. Your bolt action rifle only has three shots, but you face five Huns. Sound tasty? Verdun is for you.An extremely authentic and well done World War 1 shooter. Attention to detail is high and lethality is absolute. Work as a squad and defend your trench or attack No Man's Land under the cover of mustard gas and mortar fire. Extremely robust with lots of realistic handling weapons and high levels of historical research. It is fun? Yes. Is it for your average CODerper?  No. Grow some balls and fight the flippin' Kaiser.Game needs to be slightly more optimized, but other than that, its rock solid. "

												WWI quikscope simulator Early access done RIGHT. I purchased this game around November of 2014. I tried running it and my (now outdated) gaming laptop couldn't really run it at 30+ fps, which for me is a hard thing to get over. Well, they just released an update today with an engine overhaul and it is WAAAAY more optimized. I now can run it at 720p at 60 fps! It is really great to see a dev team put so much work into optimizing a title. As for the game, it is great, very similar to ""Red Orchestra"" in gunplay. Which is a good thing. Period correct weapons, realistic damage ratios, and great maps. I highly recommend it :)EDIT: Wow, it has come a LOOONG way and Verdun has officially graduated early access. Congratulations Black Mill!  You guys are a true shining example of dedicated developers :)  I think it is time I delve a little more into this one.  WWI is a war that is generally overshadowed by its counter-part WWII in the media.  There just really aren’t that many movies, books, and games about WWI.  “Verdun” aims to change that at least in the gaming realm.  The developers have done a lot of research as to accurately emulate all the weapons, battles, trenches, attire, and sounds of the Great War.  I remember the first time I pushed into the enemy’s trench, there was mustard gas everywhere we all had to put on our gas masks.  One player in our battalion told everyone to get on the ground as he hurled a grenade forwards.  We trudged our way through the bodies before us, now to defend the newly taken trench.  The combat in this game is SUPERB.  The weapons feel real and have a sort of realistic weight to them when firing and even moving.  Even the few sniper rifles in the game have the early period correct form of scope with a somewhat “fish eye” lens giving everything in it a bulbous look.  Honestly, I have no qualms about this game.  The engine is also GORGEOUS, I can't wait to max it out on my rig I will (hopefully) build soon.  Don’t expect your standard FPS game though, it is very strategic with periods where you CANNOT push and have to defend or you will be shot for desertion.  The times where you attack, are so exhilarating.  I generally avoid giving games a typical rating so I will just say this, BUY IT ALREADY			"

												Verdun is a unique FPS set on The Western Front. This game is all about skill and using your brain. No game I have seen quite captures the horror of warfare like this game. When navigating no man's land you stumble across mutilated blood stained corpses or dead horses. The landscape is horryfyinging beautiful, and you are constantly fearing artillery will blow you and your squad to bits or a machine gunner will gun down your team in a final attack. Almost everything about the game is unique about this game. In no ways is this game ""just another FPS"" it is one of the best FPS I have ever played. 9/10			"

Verdun is an amazing FPS shooter with beautiful graphics that goes back to warfare as it used to be and focuses on cooperative squad play.Verdun takes you away from what you seem to find in modern shooters and puts you back in good old trench warfare where you must rely on your squad-mates and teamwork to survive. Rather than gathering kill streaks for care packages and loading yourself up with perks you'll simply pick a position in a squad, adjust your loadout accordingly and you're thrown right into the trenches. Instead of an every-man-for-himself approach to things Verdun keeps the focus on teamwork and it achieves this by appointing an NCO (essentially a captain) to every squad who can issue orders throughout the game.The main gamemode of Verdun (and my personal favourite) is Frontlines where you'll find yourself and your squaddies playing tug-o-war for a long stretch of land, periodically pushing and attacking or retreating and defending. You'll find yourself dug into your trenches when you start and your first objective will either be repelling the enemies attack or attacking their trenches yourself. The attacking team will have strategic points along the enemy trenches which they must assault (the other team will be defending these points during this time). Your job as the attacker is to clear out the enemy trench claiming the land for yourself and once you do your enemies will be forced to retreat to a trench further back and hold that ground instead. On the other hand if the defenders succeed at repelling the attack they will keep hold of their land and immediately be able to launch an assault on the opposing team. This will continue back and forth until one team has taken all the land from the opponents and captured their HQ or until the time runs out in which case the win goes to the team holding the most land. Instead of rushing forward you'll have to plan your attack carefully, following any helpful commands your NCO may issue you along the way. Frontlines (like the rest of Verdun) rewards you for taking your time and scouting out your enemies and if you try to take a kamikaze approach to things you'll likely find yourself dying quickly and repeatedly. This is a major advantage to the game over many other FPSs as you'll find yourself learning to play properly and focus rather than hoping that a huge amount of luck will be on your side.There are other game modes besides Frontlines and these include: Attrition which is a team deathmatch style mode where you each have tickets which are lost upon someone dying. Once a teams tickets have been depleted the opposing team wins. Rifle Deathmatch is a free-for-all upon which you choose your weapons when you enter the game and can level those up by killing other players unlocking things such as bayonet attachments. The player with the most kills at the end is victorious. The last game mode is Squad Defense where you play single player in a squad and must defend against waves of oncoming AI enemies until you are eventually wiped out. Each game mode has it own allure but Frontlines is the most popular and you'll find the majority of players spend their time in that mode though you'll not have trouble finding games in the other modes. Squads are one of the main features of Verdun and there are 12 of these to choose from (if I'm correct). Squads have different perks and abilities which are unique to that squad and the same goes with the 'classes' you'll find within each one. Each squad is made up of four different 'classes' some of which include the Oberjäger or Guide, Scharfschütze or Tireur d'élite, Überwacher or Observateur and the Aufklärer or Éclaireur and each of these squads and classes have their own load-outs and play-styles. For example the Scharfschütze is a marksman class and prefers lots of distance between him and his unlucky targets, whereas the Aufklärer excels at melee and needs things to be up close and personal. Choosing which squad and class you play will greatly affect how your outcome so it'd recommend giving each squad/class a try until you find what is right for you because they truly all do play very different. Each squad will also have an NCO who will appoint attack and defend orders for the rest of the squad to carry out. Attacking/Defending these targets and/or remaining within your NCO's command range will award you with extra points and will help your squad level up unlocking various different things for you such as perks and even some additional classes. Although the desire to do your own thing can be strong the gameplay really is geared towards teamwork and you'll find very few situations where going solo reaps a better outcome than going as a group but the choice is still yours and you are not forced to follow orders. I think one of the graphics of Verdun are amazing and I find myself admiring them every time I play. The attention to detail and sparce placement of objects adds to the immersiveness in-game and together with the artillery bombing and rifles sounds going off creates a perfect war atmosphere. Also the in-game community seems to be refreshingly nice which is a rarity in most first person shooters I've played so that was welcome. Rather than abuse there seemed to be a lot of friendly interaction between people and players were willing to help when a question was asked.My only issue with Verdun is the fact it can be very difficult at first and some may find that offputting. It took me a good few games until I really felt comfortable and at first  it was frustrating feeling like I couldn't move without being killed. This quickly changes though if you're willing to take a game or two of hardcore defeat and soon you'll find yourself playing as well as you would in any other FPS.I can see why Verdun came highly recommended to me as it is a stand out game in the FPS genre. The gameplay, though challenging, is very rewarding and actually feels like a war game in terms of realism. Anyone looking for a realistic trench warfare experience with solid gameplay need look no further as this more than hits the spot. A must try for HARDCORE fans of the genre and those looking for a true challenge, immersive graphics and a great community. "

It's cold, I can't remember the last time I had a dry uniform. I haven't slept in days. I haven't fired my weapon in awhile. I'm not even sure if it works anymore, I check the chamber – unsure if the ammo is compromised from being saturated. I steady myself against a tree; just outside the trench to gain some purchase on the ground ahead. Everything is the color of dirt. I look down the sights just to see if I can even focus my eyes anymore -- waiting – watching for a silhouette to break the horizon. Unabated, unreasoning taut muscles, tediously straining to remain steady; lest my pack betray my position...  I just want to go home. For the sake of brevity..Genre tags: FPS, WWI, semi-realistic, Multiplayer only Value Proposition: A+, Unconventional yet familiar shooter BSERC - (Borderline Sardonic and Extremely Reductive Comparison): WWI version of The Red Orchestra 2 Concomitant Exposition and SummationVerdun is a rather remarkable game, bullets really count. You truly need your keep your head down, for there is no shortage of people ready to give you a premature haircut. There are only a few modes, the main one being frontlines. Wherein you and three other people form squads that will fill out your extended team, each with classes with specific abilities. Having a good NCO for example, marking where enemy emplacements are and calling in artillery strikes can turn the tide. There are also grenadier, scout and gunner positions. This mode is essentially endless attrition, constant turnover of taking positions offensively and defending them. It can be very frantic, it can also be very slow and methodical. The other modes are fun but less inspired. Free-for-all rifles only or full arsenal team deathmatch. Unfortunately it's rather often that these modes have a low player count. THE GISTThis game is likely exactly what you think it is from looking at a few seconds of screenshots. And that isn't a bad thing. Personally I feel like its got a ton of heart. Its got a groove to it's step. As long as the player count stays consistent and hopefully grows this game holds a niche FPS variant that I don't think is going away.Follow my curation page for more.

												At first:How the f*** did that guy shoot me with a rifle with iron sights from >200 yards???WHY IS THERE SO MUCH BARBED WIRE?!?!?!?!Why is artillery so freaking accurate?Now:Making head shots at >200 yardsClearing trenches with nades and spadesFeel like a badassAbsolutely loving it....BUT THERE'S STILL TOO MUCH BARBED WIRE!!!!This game is perfect for anyone who's wanted to experience what true World War 1 fighting is like (and how incredibly difficult it is for anyone to do anything without getting shot).

												Honestly, this is the only true ww1 game on  the market, but it has set the bar high. It is fun, atmospheric and overall an amazing experience. Here are the pros and a few cons:Pros:-Amazing maps, unique and strategy changing-Amazing gear, all historically accurate-Amazing progression system, makes you want to work for it-Amazing NCO abilities-Amazing Atmosphere-Amazing Free DLC-Amazingly Consistent UpdatesCon:-Small performance issues since update 200; not a big deal :PThis is a wonderful and amazing game, great for playing with friends OR random strangers. This game deserves more exposure, and even a console release to ease the console lover's desire for more world war games, which i know for a fact they want. :D Get this game if you enjoy shooters, tactical gameplay, camaraderie,explosions and more! :DDisclaimer: Has a learning curve,and you will die a LOT. It's WW1, after all. :P			"

												The game went from peasant to billionaire a massive improvement from early acess to official release . As for someone who bought the game the moment the tag world war one popped up upon the steam store seriously caught tons of attention what can i say about it first a glitch machine. Now this game is like butter on stove by far a smooth tasty butter. Now what the game has that you want - - Historical world war one weaponary rifles/ machine guns and statics- One and only stonelone trench atmosphere- Featuring Rifle Deathmatch- Beautiful Graphics with multiple options- Afforable price for a FPS on world war one- Timeline EncyclopediaThe feels and sound effects makes this game a master piece  and is very recommended for red orchestra fans :)      9/10 Tag - Historicans gamers must get !

												I have compared this game with Battlefield and would like to address why I favour Verdun, should I get a choice of which to play with a friend (and why I think you should pick it ;D) The main point is realism.Verdun and Battlefield 1 are both set in WW1, both with varying levels of realism. The better of the two in this case is Verdun. Verdun provides not only a more realistic array of weapons, but also sets up a more authentic atmosphere over all with the anxiety and discomfort everywhere within a trench (while BF1 uses hardly as many trenches as Verdun). The recently added gore and gibs and blood (lovely sights in battle) further add to this effect of the feeling that the player feels like they're actually in the war. In Battlefield 1, there is no such dismemberment and huge amounts of blood anywhere. Battlefield 1 also generally feels way too technologically advanced on part of any country at that time to actually fit it with the authentic WW1 experience.Bonus points go for: The price of this game (cheaper than BF1 for sure).A very ""historical"" community (a lot of people naming squads after those of their relatives etc.)An actual trench layout with No Man's Land guaranteed (and little cover for maximum decimation.Pretty darn good devs and community members in terms of helping you with bugs, for example. I hope this review helped YOU in making a decision on whether or not to buy this game :)			"

												Verdun....what a gameI was late to Verdun, after all my time I cannot consider myself a veteran yet and thats how strong the community is. Verdun is not a fad, it is something you stick to and never part from. Since reaching level 100 I may not play as much anymore but everyday I check the forums for the lively community.But the game, man the game is good... I have been to Ypres twice, seen the rows of tombstones and the fields of Flanders that saw some of the worst fighting in human history. Verdun does not glorify this, it is subtle in its ways yet it is also the best representation. When gas lands on top of you, you will panic to put your gas mask on as soon as possible. It's a game, the player in real life will not actually be crippled by the gas as its in the game, yet for a moment sitting at your computer you will panic and then think ""Man, people actually had to endure that"" The same goes for the sound of a well aimed bullet killing the man next to you, you hit the ground knowing if you poke your head up for a moment you will die. This is what I mean by subtle, it doesnt exagerrate the First World War, it portrays the war as it was, a war that coined the term ""Shell Shock"" Does it lack depth? Yes I wont deny the game has its limitation with it being an indie game but what it does have is amazing. The main mode you will focus on is frontlines, a turn based attack and defend mode which is hectic and brutal. you WILL be cut down by an mg as you advance on their trench, you WILL be pounded with artillery as the enemy attempt to dislodge your defence and you WILL be in for some close combat when you are clearing a trench. The best games you have ever played can be loses, as you push back the enemy from your final trench. It is beyond hardcore, my first game saw me getting one kill and around twenty deaths as I thought ""Hey I wonder if I just poke my head up above the trench quickly I might get a kill"" *crack* headshotted. Ever wondered what the bottom of a shell crater looks like? Well get ready as thats what you will see a lot of as a Lewis gun is pumping rounds over your head in effort to push you back. The greatest rush can be diving into the enemy trench alone and doing your best to hold the foothold whilst clearing the enemy out as quickly as possible, the greatest relief being the sight of a friendly reinforcements diving in to help you.Verdun is a game that is always changing, new FREE DLC has been teased for some time by a hard working team of devs who always keep the players in the loop regarding development. So watch this space EDIT: The new dlc dropped recently! Over a good number of weeks players were allowed to work on the beta for the dlc to help the devs iron out issues and that was a great idea! It shows just how enthralled the community is with this game. As for the FREE dlc its more squads and new weapons of war which add all new play styles, a new map and Squad Defence which is a wave defence mode against bots that you can play with your friends (Like Nazi Zombies, but WW1 and no Zombies and no stupid power ups...so its not like Nazi Zombies) There is also gore which brings the horrors of war to life in powerful, shocking and yet respectful ways. Another reason to get this game, there is still more to comeOne personal note for this game. I am a history nerd and the second world war is my area of expertise (I use that for want of a better term as I am no expert and to use ""Passion"" would be cliche). I played Verdun and became enthralled with the First World War. On that note do not expect Red Orchestra, two different wars and two different games and Verdun plays very differently as did the first world war. Verdun dares to be different and it pulled it off with the best historical shooter PERIOD. It is fun, it is real, it is historical and I cannot fault this game. Buy this game, die, kill, charge into hell and back and hopefully I will see you out thereGott Mit Uns			"

The ""Horrors of War""As the nations march bodily to war, springing from their age-old places in the rich, civilised continent of Europe, the clock ticks downwards for those on the front. Swept in a wave of excitement and fervour, the gullible and hopeful grab their best clothes, train tickets, pocket watches, running to jump into a place in the new armies... those wary, those intellectuals and pacifists those who thought differently, beaten up, trodden down, bullied by their own families into taking an ill-fated place in one of the most horrific, brutish and uncaring moments in modern human history.We know the outcome now... how many of them knew? And will you let it happen again?You say you'll ""never forget"". I think you already have.At this moment, 17:11 GMT on the 23rd March 2016, the gigantic free DLC ""Horror's of War"" has just been released. Dozens of new players that I have never seen before have crawled out of the woodwork in a flurry of excitement. Over the last nine months the developers of Verdun have teased weekly snippets of information, details on mechanical changes, new features and optimisation patches. A quick ruffle of clothes, digital shouts of excitements, and this Wednesday evening has been long awaited. Time to settle some old scores.It's also my one-year anniversary of playing the game.Restocked and RelockedThe number of squads has almost doubled, with the addition of US Marines, Doughboys, Belgian troops, German schutzen sentries, and German pioniers, in addition to the previous German Stosstruppen, Landsers, Alpenjaeger, British Tommies, French Poilu, Canadian Assault teams, and more. Forty new weapons have been added, including the ""Wex"" flammenwerfer, the G88, the Mauser C96 ""Broomstick"" pistol, the BAR automatic rifle, and the T-Gewehr with hide-out penetrative bullets. New squad abilities have been added, including Big Bertha, 340mm Railway cannon, smokescreens and White Phosphorus barrages.A Revival of the OldAlmost all of the animations in the game have been renewed; overhauled, they are smoother and more realistic than before; death animations have been added, each nation now has it's own unique gasmask.The most anticipated part of the update is the key ""Horrors"" expansion, replete with and stuffed with savage gore. This includes dismemberment, improved ragdoll physics, death animations, screams, bloody pools, skin melting, and more corpses. This is, however, purely optional; if you have little interest in such a grotesque paradigm, then the toggle button is in the options menu.New ObjectivesA new map has been implemented; in addition to the recent Fort Douaumont map, the night-time Champagne region, the most ambitious map yet, complete with underground tunnels, sandbags and trench walls is here to stay. Expect high volumes of shrapnel, machine-gun fire and keep your ears open for the sound of spitting fire.A new fourth gamemode has been added, a co-operative wave-assault online mode, ""Squad Defence"", where you and some sullen survivors of a forlorn assault attempt to survive against dozens of AI opponents rushing your position. They're pretty dim, and a bit buggy at this time, but they're still difficult to defend against. The Little ThingsWith all these gigantic changes, it's easy to miss out on the smaller things. Ten new gramophone songs have been added, rifles now eject spent cases, textures have been fixed.  New loadout descriptions, you can no longer sight down your rifle and jump, buffs for the terrible French Chauchat, an extra bullet for the Ruby in the name of historical accuracy, gas blinds faster, is less slightly less visible, slightly more lethal and makes a sounds upon impact... Oh, and it's on a new and updated Unity version too.With this nine-month in-the-waiting free expansion pack, Verdun is no longer the game it was; in a digital renaissance it has become much more, building anew on the ruins of the old.Verdun is the realest, dankest most bomb-diggity Great War game on Steam. So buckle up bros, grab your Chauchats chums, strap on your helmet homies, roll up your kitbag kiddos and ""Avec moi"", monseigueurs, 'cause swaggity swooty, we're going for all kinds of booty. Olé!As a forum member once said;""So, i own this bum game and i cant stand movements and recoil crap, but this is a lesser issue than that, i mean this game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Eterosexual bane, mostly cause every player is Male and they need to get rid of their sexual needs somehow, and that obiviously mean every player had an homosexual experience at least once. Im going refund this crap before homosexuality get me too. Whoever thinks this is a good game is clearly gay/lesbian as well.""Thanks for reading. As a reward, here's some music:

Early Access Review
								Developers offer great content all the way through. Since I started playing and bought the game in spring-summer the game seemed clunky, incomplete, laggy etc. etc. However, with gas warfare and new maps, new squads it all starts to take shape. Don't listen to people who say otherwise, take a look for yourself on the effort the developers put to make this a good WW1 FPS. It is the only one, but it's good for an entry into the field. Especially for an indie company.The gameplay reminds me strongly of Red Orchestra 2 mixed with Call of Duty and Battlefield-like mechanics, but with a trench twist. I have faith that the game will evolve. It definately feels right with that ""Nothing New on the Western Front"" touch. The Christmas Truce event is a prime example of the attention to detail. It is a game well worth investing into.Update 25.07.2016: refinements upon the original structure certainly polished this product and make it worthy for comparison in it's own way to the coming Battlefield 1.In the future more content is expected here for other fronts, crossing out DLC to the maximum. The most in not free content we can get is expansions. Recently included changes are:- night battles-- a cooperative stand off mode, like survival in Left for Dead/No More Room in Hell/Call of Duty World at War- overhauled sound design, music, sounds- changes to ragdoll physics- furuther bug hunting, adjustments, balancing  and et cetera...This is stil a vastly great game not constrained by narrow profit oriented goals in development, while still providing a WW1 shooter that can be enjoyed without extreme lenghs of deapth for core  players alike in ArmA. Though I think an additional game mode would no be objected to by anyone! The road to a true WW1 experience is not yet at its end.			"

												Verdun is both incredibly good and bad at the same time. The things it does well, however, outweigh the bad.Good:-Fear of dying leads to a very unique experience-Gamemodes don't get old very quick-Great for hardcore players-Community is generally respectful and just wants to enjoy the game as wellBad:-Optimization is poor (To run at 50 frames on my laptop, I need to lower the graphics so far that the game looks like Battlefield 2... speaking of which, I run Project Reality Battlefield 2 at higher frames than this game even though this game looks worse on low graphics...)-Graphics aren't the best even when turned up (Expect lots of clipping)-Movement feels extremely clunky and poorly done, and from what I've heard, it's been getting worse in each patchThe good things far outweigh the bad, in my opinion. You'll never find another game where you fear popping your head over the trench lines so much. Gas is also horrifying - if you stand in it for about 3 seconds, you lose your vision, fall to the ground, choke for a few seconds, and if you didn't put your mask on by this time, you die slowly. That leads me to the third point - the gore (While optional) should be turned to ultra while playing this game. Seeing people squirming and writhing really hits home with the point of this game - World War 1 was hell. People get their arms shot off, people choke to death on Cyanide gas, and people get entangled in razor wire all around you. Seeing all of this will make you really feel as if you ARE this poor sap on the fronts of Douaumont Fort or Ardennes. The shooting mechanics couldn't be better - this game is 90% one-shot-one-kill. If you are hit even once by a rifle round anywhere, you end up being part of the scenery. This just makes machine gun fire even more terrifying - and that's all the fun of Verdun! Verdun also has vehicles, however they are all non-driveable. Certain squads can, for example, call in a bomb to be dropped from a plane, however they do not drive the plane - they are simply calling in an AI, kind of similar to a killstreak in Call of Duty. Certainly this game isn't for everyone - if you want a reactive, responsive World War 1 shooter with vehicles and huge battlefields, look to Battlefield 1. However, if you want a terrifying, historically accurate, realistic, and exhilarating experience full of trench warfare, you should join me on the frontlines.			"

Early Access Review
								I've done enough hours to now provide an honest review. In a nutshell -well worth the money even though it's currently in Beta. There is a small developer team that are active and constantly improving  the gameplay. The community in this game is supportive and constructive as a whole. Having come directly from Rising Storm / Heroes of Stalingrad there are similarities; differences are evident in the weapon dynamics,hit location, movement and tactics. There are no tanks to help  storm through defences , disrupt and draw enemy fire. Verdun is a meat grinder where every trench held or taken is often paid for in lives.The battlefield terrain for each map is well researched, each map is a challenge in it's own right. The graphics now are more detailed especially in ultra settings. Rag doll physics lead to some interesting positions for the dead. Animations will likely need to be improved especially those poor devils hit by artillery. Currently they fly through the air intact.Each match is a battle of frontal assault in attack and defence with high casualty figures reaped from the attackers due to the channelling effect of wire, small arms, grenades,machine guns, artillery and gas. Weapons are deadly in their own right and it is easy to see why the Mauser and .303 SMLE were retained and improved. As you progress in the game in points you get weapon and ability unlocks according to the role you choose in each team you join. There are some very good players in the game and these may tend to pack together as team unlocks are much faster. Beginners can level these masters with one shot, team dynamics, positioning  and player ability are the deciders in both holding and taking trenches.The question is can you survive the fire get through  and make a breach in the defence? Once you are in the enemy trench start to clear it - exploit the enemy backs with your trusty weapon bayonet / melee weapon team while they face and shoot your side. Reducing the firepower at your team. As a defender can you drive the enemy away within your field of fire, do you need to move and protect another section of trench? All the while remaining situationally aware of a potential enemy invading your trench. In game smoke shells or poison gas plays a deadly role in masking both attackers and defenders adding to the claustrophobic condition of the trench interiors and no mans land where you must adjust to the fighting in a gas mask.There are some very good players in the game and these may tend to pack together as team unlocks are much faster.Achievement hunters and badge collectors will get plenty of mileage from the game. So far no hackers detected apart from a bug glitch / exploit that has now been corrected. My experience of game server activity when I have been on - the US  is by far the most active; Australian / Asia Pacific servers improve in the afternoons and Europe is fairly quiet due to the time difference (gamers are sleeping). I can say you will always get a game with the ping issues not too bad. Personally I have always done well either with low or high ping when the end game scores come in.Look forward to seeing you in game.			"

												Verdun is a realistic WW1 FPS. Unlike Battlefield 1 Verdun offers a more authentic ww1 experience ( fighting is basied off of trenches and not just running around willy dilly) with almost %100 historical accuracy. PROS:-Realistic trench warfare-Huge selection of authentic ww1 era small arms to unlock-Very emersive gameplayCONS:-Not a whole lot of active players-You need a somewhat recent GPU to run this (960+)-Can be very frustrating at timesConclusion: If you care about realism a all, this game is for you. If you like being almost fully emersed into games, this game is for you. If you like WW1 history, this game is defentely for you. Overall i would give Verdun a 9/10 for its amazing gameplay and historical accuracy.			"

								Verdun,This game has to be one of the first and only ww1 shooters out there as of right now.I personally have been waiting for a ww1 shooter such as this and it brings me great joy to finally have a game to review like this. So far from what iv seen the accuracy when it comes to the history is spot on, each weapon looks fantastic and almost identical to the service version issued at those times. Right now its generally Germans vs the French, but the developers have mentioned the canadians being added which is huge considering canadas roll in ww1.Another fantastic thing about this game is the way it structures the combat, making you take objectives and hold them rather than giving the player a sandbox unrealistic feel that most FPS allow. It only makes sense that once you have taken an enemy trench that you should defend it against counter attack before even thinking about assaulting the next objective. And with that being said Verdun gets 9/10 for original content and gameplayVERY promising future for this game, and is worth purchasing if your a fan of World war First person shooters.This game is worth buying, there is enough content to play this game for a long time			"

And what a christmas it became....TL;DRPros+Epic atmosphere+Great core gameplay+Authenticity (To some extent)+MUSTARD GAS+Squad based gameplayCons-Arcady BS elements (Such as hitmarkers, crosshairs, score/kill feed)(Disabling above mentioned BS (hitmarkers, crosshairs) will handicap you.)-No dedicated serversAnd for those who want a little reading..!-------------------------------------------------------------Verdun has a truly epic atmosphere and it gives the player a true trench warfare experience. The game starts you off with some classic music from the era, and right from the start puts you in the right mood to crawl in mud attacking... Or to bitterly fight for every last inch of your trench. So, instead of vague flags or areas, you're fighting for actual trenches and not just some 10x10 meter area on the map. The core gameplay is very simple and it WORKS. If you start off as the attacking team, your team will (hopefully) give its best shot at attacking the enemy trench and try to capture it. If the attack fails, you have to fall back to your trench and its the opposing teams time to attack. However, if you manage to capture the enemy trench, a counterattack will be ordered and you have to go from offensive to defensive really fast to keep it. In theory the whole match CAN be just one attack phase, if the attacking team is fighting fanatically enough, and the defenders holding ground steadfast.All those times you've been THIS close to capturing the enemy trench, but you run out of momentum and have to fall back, is just what trench warfare is all about. I cannot put in words how satisfying it feels when capturing the enemy trench after a long stalemate of neither side gaining any victories, but then... You finally manage to do it and prepare for the enemy counterattack. And it feels really really good to take the enemy trench and If all goes well and you repulse the counterattack, then its time to put your skills to the test on the next trench.However, the arcady crosshairs and kill feeds and all that scoregarbage eat this atmosphere away, but not enough to ruin the experience, atleast for me. Sure, you can disable the crosshair, or bind the whole hud under a button to show it, but this puts you at a disadvantage, so it would be just handicapping yourself. And for the love of god.... HIT MARKERS WHY???????? But overall, the gameplay is nice, it could be alot better if they had decided to nurture this atmosphere the game has AND REALISM, instead of the crap i mentioned just now.It has leveling and whatnot too, but you can't get a dramatic boost over a noob with just the unlocks.... unless it's the squad unlocks. Squad level can only be raised by playing with your friends, over and over again, which is nice. The squad level can basicly turn your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little mortars into a real artillery storm. Oh and you can unlock mustard gas, damn is that deadly.Overall i'd give it a 7/10. It's very fun, Best enjoyed with friends!See you in the trenches, comrades. And remember, Keep calm & STELLUNG HALTEN!I Might Write more to this review when i have the time :D			"

												Where to start?  There's only one way to describe the decline of this game. Tragic. Why tragic? I bought this game in January of 2015 and between then and May, this game was perfect. Hit detection was not too bad, Machineguns weren't so buggy and FPS was good enough to make the game playable. However, when the DEVs started to add useless eye candy, messing around with MG deployment, fixing the hit box, etc. the game was essentialyl ruined. Playing Verdun feels more like an obligation rather than an enjoyment since I'm in a clan mainly because the pure characteristics of the game prevent me from even playing it. Point blank shots to the chest don't kill people all the time, 5 stabs in the back don't kill people anymore, barbed wire can stop a bullet from hitting someone, the actual MG can block the bullets to protect the gunner and so on and so forth. My FPS dropped from 60 FPS back in April to around 15-25 FPS these days, on all low graphics. Picardie was by far my favourite map back in April and May because it was big and open and it was fun to play. Now that map is impossible to play and less enoyable than Flanders for me purely because the DEVs added useless eye candy like dead horses, cooking stoves, chairs, tables, etc. that lowered my FPS, decreased the amount of well-aimed shots that would get registered and overall just made that map incredibly laggy. The only reason why I say all this is because I care a lot for this game. This is one of my favourite games ever and I will continue to play no matter how much worse it gets. I go back to my original statement; the DEVs have managed to ruin their own game when it was so good. People don't care about the eye candy and the graphics nearly as much as they care about actually being able to play the game properly. The core community here isn't the new players who buy the game when it goes on sale, the core community is the people who have owned thsi game for a while and play it regularly. People from clans like KK, Pirates, Crossed Rifles, etc. are constantly complaining on the forums about problems with the game yet, instead of fixing the game the DEVs make it worse. The DEVs listen more to the new players who want this added and that added and that removed and hat changed and this improved, etc. None of our concerns have really been addressed. This games ahas just recently gone competitive with a Verdun League, yet we might not be able to continue with the league fi the game basically favour speople with a better computer. How is this in any way fair? When the Verdun League was originally conceptualised, the game was perfect, it coudl be played in a competitive environment. Now, I really don't think it can. Now for those of you reading this to see if you want this game, here's what I have to say. Even if the game becomes unplayable to the point where it's s truggle to get even 10 kills, I will still play this game EVERY day because it's one of a kind and no matter how much I hate the DEVs for ruinign this game, I appreciate the fact that they care about their game and even though they have released it they conitnue to try and fix their game.

What is Verdun?It's surprisingly difficult to find a WW1 game out there, and even more tough to find a good one. Verdun defies expectations with its historical accuracy when it comes to trench warfare, and its realism where one shot can be fatal.Verdun is a Unity-based game, and as such, it runs great and looks great. Battlefields are detailed enough to create a decent environment, however they still aren't as great as other games (such as Insurgency). You play as a soldier fighting on the front lines in World War 1, where much of the war is fought in trenches dug into the ground and gas attacks are common. You and your squad need to work as a team to cover all angles and play well. Here are some of the pros and cons.Pros+ Good community+ Team-based gameplay+ Few performance issues+ A different kind of FPS, not generic whatsoeverCons- Environment could be a bit more detailed- Few full servers- Lacks return-appeal- Multiplayer onlyIs it worth it? For sure. I would recommend buying it on sale though, you can snag a great deal.So, long story short:Verdun is excellent at bringing a long past due change of pace to the FPS genre, but has a few caveats which you should be aware of.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group "

The verdict:Very solid body damage & blood spilling (though not without issues), exceptional burning mechanics. The mess stays for a pretty long while, though not permanent. The best part is the exceptionally long death animations that function as a disabled state, which is a key part of the experience.All in all the experience is exceptional.			"

												A very good game, I really recommend to everyone who is interested in World War 1 the slightest.There are four game modes. Frontlines Rifle Deathmatch Attrition Squad DefenceNot going to talk about the gamemodes, they speak for themselves. There's a huge amout of weapons available in the game.The game's name is kind of misleading, it's not only about the Battle of Verdun, it's the Western Front. "

True Story- Joined a French squad called ""French Fries"".- We actually play as a team.- We start sneaking along the edge of the map toward the enemy Trench.- Our team fails to get a foothold and we have to retreat.- Gas kills one of my squad mates, his finals words were ""HOW 2 PUT ON MASK"".- We make a mad dash across No Mans Land, trying to get back to our own Trench.- Squad Leader is running beside me and he gets shot in the back, he falls over and writhes around screaming in pain.- Only 2 of us left.- I get back to our Trench.- I see my last squadmate running toward me, he gets within arms reach of me before being shot in the back of the head.- I feel the PTSD coursing through my veins.- Artillery shell lands right in front of my face and blows my left arm off.0/10 this game made me cry.

												Verdun is an engaging historical shooter that makes good use of its World War 1 setting. The central game mode sees each team starting in their own trench with one team attacking and one defending. If the attackers can't get a foothold in three minutes, they go on the offense while the other team switches to defense. If the attacking team get a foothold in the enemy trench, the time is extended. If the attackers capture the enemy trench, they must defend against a counter-attack before attacking the next enemy trench line. This is a great game mode that feels historically accurate and also means that if one team is struggling on the offense, after a few minutes they will go on the defense so it never turns into a frustrating meat-grinder for either team. Trying to get across No Mans Land as the attackers is absolutely terrifying, while fighting in the trenches is tense and exciting. Several historically pertinent mechanics like Gas attacks that force you to put on a view-limiting gas-mask, or barbed wire you can get tangled in instead of just being a wall, add to the atmosphere and the gameplay in a meaningful way. The squad system means that you are given access to a good variety of weapons and abilities, although you will need to enjoy bolt-action rifles to have fun with this game. Some rifles feel all-around better than others, which while historically accurate can lead to some frustrating gameplay if you get stuck with a class that uses one of the lesser rifles. While the game in its current state is totally playable, it would benefit greatly from some spit-and-polish. Ragdolls are jittery and can break immersion. Hit detection leaves much to be desired. The current system for joining servers has you picking a squad instead of a server, and you can't see what the ping is when doing this. However I seem to have exactly the same ping no matter what server I join, which makes me think all of the servers are centralized which is not ideal. Overall if you enjoy games like Red Orchestra 2 or Insurgency and are interested in the WW I setting, Verdun is a game I would highly recommend. The central game mode is excellent and the maps are generally well designed with one or two exceptions that have huge no-mans land zones that are impossible to make it across in the given time as the attackers.

								Pure trench warfare! Your fightin in the mud, clawing the ground, inching forward to take enemy positions, just to get caught in barbed wire. Lots of fun. I have fps issues, freezes and lag from time to time. You need really good rig if you wanna run it on high settings. There are a few buggy spots on the map where u can get stuck in places where you shouldn't. It also seems sometimes you get shot through areas you shouldnt. Could use a little polish, but i reccomend. Frenchies. ;)			"

								One of the best games i have played in a while. A WW1 FPS game is a must buy. The frontline mode realy displays the mass death and destruction of the trenches. The Rifle Death Match is a great way on learning the basics of the bolt action rifles and how to fight through both no mans land and the trenches. All i can say to the DEVS is keep up the good work this game should be a reminder tom future generations what happened almost 100 years ago which help formed the world we live in.			"

Early Access Review
								Excellent game about almost forgotten era in gaming. Been playing it about a year (i think) and while its still in early access, it feels and plays out as real and finished game- did so when i bought it way back. I honhestly hesitated to buy it when it was on sale, because while as history geek i always wanted ww1 game, i never tought it actually had potential to be fun. Well, i was wrong about latter part- this game is fun as hell!Graphics are great- maybe not best, but atmosphere they create is fantastic.Sound department is also great, as is weapons, squads (basically factions- currently it has 7 squad types (3 for central powers (i.e germans), 4 for entente (2 french, 1 canadian and 1 british) split in 2 factions (entente and central powers). Each squad type is split into 4 unique classes, so you got plenty to discoverHowever, if you expect fast-paced combat like call of duty is, you have to look elsewhere, as this game plays out bit more like Red Orchestra, though bit more arcade-y. You need teamwork to win- killing every enemy doesnt bring you victory or even most points. You have to defend when, well, you defend and attack when you (isnt it obvious) attack. Always try to stay in target trench thoughThere are still some faults however, such as some classes start with only melee weapon (and melee weapons are near useless in Verdun game), you can very easily get killed when completely in cover (according to devs, it will be fixed next update).What makes this game even better, however, is multiple experience types- each class has its own xp meter, 4 levels, each with unique weapon selection. Also you have personal xp meter, which ups your rank and also squad xp (to encourage you to play with friends), which gives you later war uniforms and better artillery.Basically there is so much positive about this game that few minor bad things are basically irrelevant. I could go on and on about this game, but i stop here.buy it. you wont regret it.			"

												After more than 122 hours into the game (and this doesn't happen frequently) I'd like to share my honest opinions about Verdun - the good, the bad and the buggy.***UPDATE 12/08/2015***After the supposedly full-fledged release, I have to give to Verdun a thumb down based upon many crucial points where the game deliberately fails. But let’s speak about positives first:Pros- well-designed extensive maps inspirited by real battlefields of WWI- satisfying and challenging gunplay- broad gameplay variability based upon different classes to play with- required cooperation between squad players in order to win - friendly and helpful community - solid optimizationVerdun is a good game, very good indeed but it fails to deliver the most crucial game experience:Cons- nothing like an immersive WWI trench warfare experience Well, WWI looked anything but this. Few players camping throughout a waste battlefield make the game pretty infuriating and in time it only gets worse. Verdun will become BORING for many players as it became for me and this lack of players is exactly what buries the game underground. Not to mention another great problem with- feels like still playing BETABefore the supposedly full game release, there was a lot updates and a lots of gigs to download, containing some bug fixes but now, the game is in the same state as it was in beta. I was very disappointed about this literally forced 1.0 release and I'm still waiting for major upgrades in shady areas like- infuriating lagIn the game which is more or less about precision I fail to comprehend how it is possible for developers not to improve upon teleporting moving players which happens all the time!I'd like to blame myself for mistakes I do in game like Verdun where I die constantly, but this is deliberately very bad coding and no one seems to give a f__k.- buggy bugs The game even though it is supposed to be now in a full release state still suffers from numbers of persisting bugs and lags. I'm convinced developers will fix majority of them in time, because they really care about their product, which is worth mentioning again. Do I recommend this game? It depends to whom. I have no hesitation of recommending Verdun to anyone interested in WWI warfare even though it fails to deliver the genuine experience but for a casual player the game might quickly become boring and frustrating. I've spent over 120 hours into the game and I don't regret it, neither the investment, 'cause it was a very FUN to PLAY, but I don't think I'll play again until the core game mechanics will be improved.

												War.War never changes.I've lost count on how many times I died. I died from clubs, shovels, knives to a bayonet. With grenades, pistols, rifles or machine guns. Being gassed, smoked out or mortar shelled. Hell, even cooked by a flamethrower.Yet somehow I always come back alive. Surrounded by my squadmates, we wait for the enemy to come. We can hear the whistles, the battlecries the sound of boots running through mud, over half buried who knows what it was. It's coming closer. For a second everything is silent. And then all hell breaks loose.The machine guns start firing, officers shouting something and the sound of your squadmate reloading his rifle.You seem something moving in the corner of your eye, you turn and see your squadmate falling on the floor. His rifle laying empty beside him.You feel yourself fill with rage as you charge the enemy who killed him with your bayonet, killing him instantly. And silence once again.The fear creeps back into your heart as you know what's coming next.And then you hear it. Officers shouting the order, loud and clear:Over the top boys! Charge!You get up, start running from cover to crater to cover. You're almost there and then it starts.That dreadfull sound of machine guns firing.			"

												This game does a fantastic job of capturing the details of the weaponry, terrain, and uniforms of the Great War. As a military historian, this game is easily in my top 10 games out of sheer respect for said attention to detail and for the hard work the game developers and designers put into the game, which is apparent every time I open up Verdun. Thank you for creating such a tribute to the Great War and for building interest in the gaming community for this tumultuous, yet fascinating, period. Despite not being a dedicated FPS player, I will continue to revisit this game and appreciate the chance to shoot a Chauchat, call in a mortor strike, or clear trenches with a Ruby pistol and ""Le Vengeur."" In addition, thank you for showing your appreciation to your players by releasing such quality DLC. Again, this is soundly in my top 10 games, and easily my most played FPS. I strongly recommend this game to anyone who loves history, wants to experience the Great War, or is looking for a different kind of FPS. Keep your heads down, trompe la mort, and take the fight to the next trench. Just remember, when the time comes to defend your ground, On ne passe pas!			"

								I watched a WW1 Documentary once, and in it, I remember a veteran of the war (it was an old documentary) saying how no one was scared when going ""over the top"". I couldn't imagine how anyone could resist being scared when you're RUNNING INTO RIFLE FIRE. But then I got this game. And even though my life isn't on the line when going over the top, I can still feel that adrenaline rush the veteran described. But enough about that. Here are some pros/consPROS+ Historically accurate weapons+ Chance to mutter rascist terms about the French, Brit, Canadians, Germans, Americans, etc. while killing them. + Great gas mechanics+ Real-life gun events (e.g. rifle jamming)+ Well-done maps+ Diverse classes and specializations+ Getting revealed via pointy hatCONS- Laggy- Odd shooting mechanicsOverall: 8.2/10 game, easily.

												I am a big ol' nerd for historical accuracy in media, whether it is Video Games, Movies, or Television. So it's not a very big surprise that I like Verdun so much. With the realistic trench warfare and period-setting weaponry, this game provides a special era of atmosphere. I am a big fan of this game but it is a grueling mess to get into. Adapting from Modern Shooters with their run-and-gun mechanics to Verdun in it's Sit in a Trench and Pray they don't gas you harder than a bathroom at Taco Bell.

												This game is not comparable to BF1 really, albeit I enjoy BF1 more, they are both great games. BF1 is large scale battles with vehicles etc... (as well as a couple smaller scale engagement modes). Verdun is strictly small engagement trench warfare. It feels completely different. I like them both, however people need to stop comparing them to try and sway people to play this game. It finds its niche among high skill ceiling fps players (of which I am not).			"

""Stand your Ground!!"" *sinister laugh* *war cry* I have been searching for a game like this for many years. It all started with CSS, DODS, TF2, CSGO (in where I have been kicked from matchmaking for exessive use of voice commands) I traversed through these games, in search of a glorious kingdom of voice command usage but to no avail :( ladies and gents, after 10 years , my search is over, mama is home!Oh, yeah, I guess I should mention the gameplay's not half bad either!10/10 would voice spam again.

												Been having a good time in this.First.. runs great! The graphics are very nice, you feel the mud, feel the cold.. and hope your mask is on tight as you crawl through gas..Gameplay is tough, intense and fun. Actually listening to the NCO's of your team / squad works, and important... No crazy FPS action here, no rocket jumps, no wonder super weapons.. just digging / jumping / running / crawling in mud, woods, water.. digging deeper into the ground for just some cover.Weapons are as they were, basic infantry rifle is a bolt action, arty is dreaded ( DUCK IN THE DUGOUT!!! )  fighting is back and forth accross the trenches... futile, dirty, horrifying.... limbs fly.. wounded fall and scream.. gas burns at your eyes.. Amazing game. BEST PART:  No one, not a single incident of toxic community.  My team didnt hate me for being new and dying ( often ) the other side didnt try and turn the game into a 12 y/o hormone fit..  people didnt run and quit when we were outnumbered almost 3 - 1.. we fought it out.. and the other side even said.. cool.  I highly recommend this one.** EDIT ** 4/25/16Have not been able to still devote long sessions here.. but just today was my first encounter with a ... I dont even know what.. attempt to disrupt the game??  Before now I didnt even realize there was a mute button for text chat so readily available. Problem solved.			"

												Very great WWI-era FPS that takes place in France during the most important parts of the war. The game's weapons are at incredible detail, giving you a distinct view of the war of any infantrymen, officer, or gunner you choose. This exceeds Battlefield 1 in not graphics, or realism, but an uncontrollable sense of feel of the game.			"

								If you enjoyed Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm or tactical team shooters that require good team coordination then this is a no-brainer. As of now the lobbying system can be wonky at certain points, but nothing as extreme as a simple restart couldn't fix and even that isn't very often.The gameplay is smooth and it plays as you would expect a true-grit trench warfare game to play. Each person plays a special role in a squad.The squad system implements nationalities and their specialities which is a nice change of pace but still reminiscent of Battlefield's squad system if you're familiar. The attack and defend style play is also unique and really makes you believe this is how your ancestors probably got it done. Sharp rifling skills, smart MG nest emplacements, and well placed mortar, recon planes and mustard gas are required for victory.All in all, it's intense, you'll die a lot, and you'll need a good squad to pull through but it wouldn't be nearly as rewarding without it. For $20, it's a good deal, on sale, it's a steal. Buy the 4 pack, get your friends in the mud. 8.5/10 fix ya damn lobby system			"

												I went into this game rather skeptically - a lot of historical shooters tend to fall into a difficult spot with regards to the way they are played. Most games end up as a classic deathmatch or a camping simulator with old timey costumes, particularly WW2 games. Red Orchestra and Heroes & Generals, despite being two very good 'simulator shooter' games, both suffer from this problem quite heavily. With Verdun, you can set aside those worries now.Verdun manages to break away from that mold by heavily incentivising players to fight in the style of trench warfare. Every battle is fought in a series of 'phases' - one side defending, one side attacking. While defending, if you venture to far towards the enemy lines, you will be considered deserting and killed. If you don't charge forward while attacking, you essentially forfeit the round. Run too far from your trench and you will be killed for desertion. In this way, the game keeps the maps expansive, but enclosed: a perfect size for a medium-scale skirmish that captures the feeling of fighting over a small slice of a much larger war. Believe it or not, trench-style tactics work and really give this game a strong feeling of immersion. If your squad trickles in slowly while on the glorious attack, your men will be picked off quickly and accomplish nothing. But if your entire team charges in a human wave, the enemy simply cannot keep up and will likely be overwhelmed. Then comes the gritty, brutal close-quarters fighting to hold down the trench, stabbing with bayonets, bashing with spiked clubs, and desperately firing off bolt-action rifles at point-blank. A wide variety of weapons are available - pistols, machine guns, bolt-action rifles, et cetera - and you will unlock various side-grades as your soldier gains career points, keeping the game fresh and fun. Currently the game has a nice array of nations represented: The United Kingdom with its Canadian dominion troops and France currently represent the triple entente, while the central powers are represented by the German Empire. Apparently the United States and Austria are to be represented soon, though these may simply be rumours.Overall, the game is a highly welcome addition to the historical shooter genre, and is incredibly addictive and fun to play, and is, in my opinion, far superior to the other options currently available, overtaking even Tripwire's 'Rising Storm' for amazing, brutal gameplay and attention to detail. You would be doing yourself a disservice to miss this one!PS: Sadly, no ANZAC or Ottoman Empire troops or costumes are represented in-game yet, but are the Developers really surprised people are asking for them? You released your WW1 game on the weekend of the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings, which began April 25th, 1915!			"

												Oh boy,I got this game soley because it was the first World War 1 FPS game i have ever found.  I liked it because this time in history is virtually non-existant in the gaming world.   Seeing this was a nice change of pace.  The best part about this game, is the community.  They are helpful, and unlike most FPS fanbases, they think.  When I was mulling over the idea of getting this game, I checked the reviews, like you are now.  What I saw a lot of was ""you are gonna die a lot, but don't let that discourage you.""  They were right, but I kept trucking along.  I got better, and it was fun; then everything changed down the road.  With the new updates coming out, Verdun fell into the trap that nearly every FPS fell into: Catering almost exclusivly to the marksman/sniper class.  I made a discussion about it on the community hub, and they told me just to keep practicing.     I did, but there were still some major problems.  The biggest problems facing this game and two things: 1) spawn system is a mess.   Too many times have I spawned only to IMMEDIATELY get a mortar thrown right on top of me and have my head blown out my backside.  2) As stated before, catering to the marksmen class.  In some maps, like Duramount for example, I REFUSE to play that map as the allies.  It is such a sniper's nest.  Your game play is literally nothing but spawn, die, spawn, die, spawn...die.  To test this, I had a friend watch me and time how long it took me to die when i respawned.  I didn't move forward, all I did was spawn and immediately crouch down, and then died.  My life time?  0.83 seconds....I WISH I was making that up.  This game has(had?) a lot of promise, but so far I am seeing a bunch of wasted potential.  The devs are working, but are they doing the right work?  This game needs a lot of polishing.  As it is now, I cannot recommend it, but I hope that will change.			"

												Very fun game. The devs are continuously expanding on the features, the weapons are pretty balanced, the recent addition of gore and squirming bleeding out wounded people really resonates with my sadistic tendencies and the uniforms and weapons are historically accurate and look realistic. The only thing that can get kinda annoying is artillery and grenade spam which has gotten better because of the recent reduction of overall grenades everyone can carry but should still be reduced in my opinion. Battlefield 1 got nothin' on this ♥♥♥♥ (I can already tell by the trailer).			"

												For years WW2 shooters were all the rage in video games, Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, Battlefield 1942, Brothers in Arms, Red Orchestra, etc, but I always wanted to see a WW1 shooter and now there finally is one. Imagine extreme trench warfare, mustard gas, tons of different bolt action rifles, lugers, mortar fire, running from cover to cover in no man's land, mowing down enemies with the heavy machine gun! This is a lot of fun, it encourages teamwork even though there's limited VOIP, what I and many others will do is relay the enemies' position in team chat, such as ""LEFT SIDE"" if the enemy has breached our position on the left side of the trench, or is about to. One may view the lack of VOIP as a negative, but on the plus side you're less likely to hear any screaming squeakers on the mic and go through the effort of going in the menu and muting them. If you play as the officer class you can call in mustard gas strikes, mortar strikes or air recon (depending on the type of squad you're in) by holding Q and right clicking. The game is somewhat realistic, it only takes one shot from a bolt action rifle to kill someone and you need to use cover, but there's no friendly fire and there are crosshairs. If you like realistic, yet fun shooters, like Insurgency, you're gonna like Verdun. Like Insurgency, the developers keep adding content in free updates (they've added 2 new maps since I've owned Verdun), so I highly recommend this unique shooter as it gives you far more bang for your buck than your typical AAA shooter that charges $50 for a season pass.EDIT: I just found out that they recently added VOIP, but it's limited to your squad only. The developers are adding free expansions that will include gore, new maps, the trench gun, flamethrowers and new squads, including the Americans and Belgians and in future expansions they'll add more fronts, such as the Eastern front between Russia, Germany and Austria-Hungary and many more.

												Verdun is the best WW1 FPS game ever. Once you get used to the fact the damage model is very similar to Red Orchestra/Rising Storm you'll be fine!So the main selling point of this game has to be the fact it's set in WW1 and Trench Warfare, it's different to other FPS's out there and that's why it's so good!Within the game you have squads which are 4 men teams and consist of different roles, the roles are named differently for each faction but they're all the same really.--[ Squad Roles ]---[ Corporal ]-The Corporal is the lead element of any squad. They set the attack orders and can call in either recon planes, artillery and gas.. It's a case of one of the other and depends on what 'faction' you play as. Generally I play as the Tommies due to being british :P-[ Rifleman ]-The Rifleman is,.. well... your bog standard rifleman, you can upgrade the class so you can get your rifle mouted with a long range scope, this effectivley makes you become a marksman. It's a fun class to play and I highly reccomend this one if you cannot get to be the Corporal.-[ Machine Gunner ]-So the Machine Gunner has a LMG you cannot sprint with this weapon due to it being heavy, but you can mount it on certain things around the map because you have a bipod. This is amazing for supressing the enemies while the rest of your squad move up to the enemy trench(es). If you get the Tier 3 upgrade for the MG (This is on the Tommies faction, not too sure if it's the same for the others) you can have a rifle and a MG. If you equip the rifle you can sprint to where you want to be, get the MG out and mount up! Another awesome class to play as when working with a team.-[ Bomber/Grenadier ]-The bomber/grenadier class is pretty much identical to the rifleman unless you go for the tier 2/3 upgrade. tier 2 gives you a pistol and 4 grenades. (Grenades are amazing! The blast radius is a nice size to damage people who try to run from a thrown 'nade) If you go for the Tier 3 upgrade you get a pistol, trench club.. Yes. a big wooden club which you beat people to death with and 2 grenades. Tier 1 is a Rifle and 2 Grenades... possibly a pistol too..In order to maximise your fun in this game you need to play with friends, you need to have communication in your team too, so make sure to press 'U' to type to your team and let them know where the enemies are pushing, you'll find you win more matches, If you're  a Corporal or equivalent. Please for the love of god ask where people need arty / tell them where you have put arty. Set orders too! It's bonus EXP for your squad mates!--[ Gamemodes ]--So far in Verdun there is only 2 gamemodes. Frontlines and Deathmatch.-[ Frontlines ]-Frontlines game mode is where you have to push and try to take the oppsition's trench, once taken you need to defend the counter-attack. After you successfully take the enemy trench, you take the next one. Simple concept but some of the maps are quite... strange and you have to adapt your play style to the maps too!-[ Deathmatch ]-Deathmatch is pretty much what it says on the tin. Every man for himself. It just reminds me of CoD... I wouldn't reccomend it unless you're seriously bored.-[ Private Matches ]-You can also host private matches so if you're part of a competive team.. Yes. It's recent addition to Verdun :P You can practice certain tactics and study the maps without the hassle of people shooting at you ;)--[ So, Downsides to Verdun ]--The only downsides I can really think of this game is when you create a squad and try to play with friends it will kick some people back to the main menu, this means your friends have to search for your squad in the left hand side when they choose to play ""Frontlines"" gamemode.In order to ""add"" people on Verdun you need to play with them in a previous squad or be in a match with them. To add them you press Tab (leaderboards) then right click your friend and click the ""Add"" button. Sorted! You can now make private squads.If you're also playing with people from different regions (EU/US) you need to make sure you change it at the top right so everyone is on the same region otherwise you won't be able to play together.--[ Conclusion ]--If you really into FPS Games which have a realistic damage model then I highly suggest this game. If you're looking to play a casual shooter, Verdun can be quite... rage inducing. BUT If you're willing to stick it out and learn the maps and how the shooting model works you'll be fine and you'll start loving the game! If you're not too sure whether this is the game for you or not. Wait until it's on sale or something, that way you're not spending as much on something you might not possibly like.Thank you for reading this review.

												Verdun is probably the most realistic depiction of WW1 in a video game ever, multiplied by the fact that it's in first person which allows for a more immersive experience. Squad variation is good although it really doesn't matter as long as there aren't four sniper squads on one team. Gameplay is pretty clunky and the graphics aren't anything special but it gets the job done. While most games have an active autobalance script in place to allow for a more balanced experience, this game uses a passive method that politely asks the overpopped team if some could join the other team while lengthening respawn times for the offending team. This can be a double-edged sword because sometimes people won't listen and you'll be stuck with an unbalanced team. Unfortunately this game is mostly dead at this point ~500 players on average isn't a whole lot when you account for the huge split between regions and the smaller splits between game modes. Speaking of which, there's really only one active game mode and the rest rarely have enough players to warrant a prolonged session. It was a whole different story when this game first came out and was alive and well.Overall, if you have or find a dedicated group of friends to play with, I'd give it a shot on sale but don't buy this at full price and expect an active game. Most similar realistic military shooters are more active players than this one so take that as you will.I should really get to bed, huh?			"

								An awesome game, it is a very different experience from your traditional shooter. The main weapon that you use is  a bolt action rifle, so there is absolutely no spray and pray idiots. There are machine guns, but you can't sprint and move much slower when wielding one, also you have to deploy it like in RO. Each team has a few squads and each squad has very different members. Some have a sniper, an observer and a scout, and some squads have a grenadier (guy with grenades not launchers) a machine gunner and a rifleman. All squads have an officer. An officer can call in gas, mortars or observation planes depending on what type of squad he is in. The maps deeply compliment the class system by having (hint WWI): trenches and barbed wire. The maps have several sets of trenches with fairly open stretches of land in-between, and when you are on the offense it is your job to charge across that land, from crater to crater and over the final hump into the enemy trenches. That gets challenging sometimes, but by coordinating attacks with your team you can successfully storm a fortified trench fairly easily. As a defender your job its to stop the enemy from capturing your trench. As you sit behind some cover with only your rifle and head poking out you are a fairly hard target to reach and you pick off attackers as they charge at you. But then you are gassed and you can't see, or a mortar hits you and your corpse goes flying, or a teammate says: BREACH LEFT and you look to your left to see an enemy rifle pointed down the trench line at your head, and sometimes simply you are sniped from a guy in the trenches the enemy just captured.I have been in a few games with the devs even! They are kind and open to any feedback, positve or negative. Overall 11/10 would recommend.			"

												You will never enjoy dying so much in any other game. WWI FPS made with a great, authentic atmosphere with realism in mind. You will die a lot as one hit means death. Thankfully that means you can also take down enemies quickly, leading to some very intense firefights. Gas, mortars and having to attack or defend throughout the match helps the chaos. Weather you are fighting for your life to defend a trench from an incoming attack wave or if you are laying prone behind a tree sniping and covering your team mates advance, you will have a lot of fun as long as you can stick with the game through the initial constant dying while you adjust to the game mechanics. If you have played Red Orchestra/Rising Storm then picture that only with a WWI setting and you know what greatness awaits.			"

												It's about time i write a review here after playing a few weeks now :)I can't compare this game to any other FPS since i havent played one since ... wow *thinks *.. some game on playstation 2 lolBut I will say I was sold the minute i opened it, the graphics are great , the details in the trench are awesome sometimes i just want to run around and look at all the little nicnacs.The gameplay is so much fun I never thought i would fall in love with a FPS game like i did with this one.And i would even reccommend this to people that do not like FPS , because i am the LAST person to play a shooter up game lol, but this one has turned me around and i bet it will do the same for anyone else..I just got sucked into the commmunity and the people are amazing, I see the devs responding to allmost each post they are super involved , you can really tell they have a passion for this game.Not only do I enjoy playing the game, it has gotten me more and more interested about the great war, watching docu's , reading articles...Living in belgium  it's making me visit places i would have never visited.Thanks so much for this great game :) I cant wait for many many expansions :D			"

								World War 1. 2 Words + 1 Digit. 2+1 = 3. Take the V in Verdun and turn it upside-down. Add a line to close the V and create a triangle. We now have a Triangle, and the 3 from the previous equation confirms it. World War 1 went from 1914 to 1918. 1918-1914 = 4. 4-3 = 1. 1 Eye in an Illuminati. Confirmed.			"

Verdun is a squad-based multiplayer FPS set in First World War (WW1) . It may take some time to, but you will have your fun. Although you will also have the times were you don't have fun in the battle(s) that you are in. So, you could have great battles or bad battles, either way it is a good game to play. You just need to learn.			"

								After playing so many hours of this game I thought it would be necessary to write a review. I've been playing Verdun since the early access in October 2013. I have to say the game has indeed come a long way. Verdun has alot to offer, considering it is one of the only WWI games out there. I have really enjoyed going through unlocking new rifles and other weapons. It also gives you a chance to learn what weapons the soldiers used back then. Verdun has a tactical squad system which is effective, as you can play with your friends in a four-man squad. The way the game works is clever too. You and your team have to defend your trench and attempt to push your enemy to there back trench line. The only thing with Verdun is the performance. The game should be like peanuts to run, however I struggle to run even with a high end PC build. The only thing the devs should work on now (in my opinion) is the optimization of the game.			"

												First things first: what do you need for Verdun?1. A big computer screen so you can spot every pixel2. A decent enough PC, although it has problems with running GTX 980`s (sometimes), the game itself is very CPU based3. A lot of dedication and immunity to frustrationOnce you played enough and leveled up, the game becomes really funny and interesting, but you have to stay on it for a while and not get frustrated by some of the veterans running around and getting 70+ kills. It is that sort of game that can waste your entire day not even realising one day began.			"

												I'm definitely a fan of this game! I've only had it for two days, but I've almost been playing it all the time since I got it!The squad system is a lot like the one known from many Battlefield-titles: You respawn in the trench closest to no mands land or on your squad leader. The setting of the game is the Western Front, WWI. The game offers a great idea of the soldiers' lives in the trenches. If you don't keep your head down you're gonna get shot by a sniper. But the enemy's assault has to be repelled or you might just find it that your trench is suddenly overrun by enemies shooting and stabbing their way through your lines! When assaulting the enemy trench, the enemy machinegun and sniper fire will probably kill most of your comrades. When you realize you have to get to cover and you jump down a grenade hole, the machinegun fire flying over your head is suppressing you, your vision is getting blurred, and you're just waiting for your chance to get out of this place. But don't stay to long: an enemy squad leader may have seen you and called for a mortar strike right in your grenade hole.TEAM WORK is the key! Working together, following orders and staying close to your squad leader grants points to you and your squad, eventually leveling up your squad thus unlocking better abilities and heftier fire support. As in real life a squad is not better than the soldiers in it: A squad can very well be level 20, but when you split up and a soldier leaves the squad, the squad level falls drastically according to the squad points he had provided. The points are based on team work and cooperation between the members of the squad. For instance if a new man joins the squad and has never played with any of the squad members before he will not contribute to the squad level before he has been working with them. If a friend of a squad member, however, joins the squad, the cooperation points between him and the squad member will be accumulated to the squad points thus leveling up the squad. It is therefore very important to play the game with good friends if you want to make the best of the game.You can choose between 7 different squad types spread over two teams. Each squad has its own unique uniforms, abilities and special weapons. Usually, there is a:- long range specialist (sniper, rifleman, etc.) on each squad- machine gunner of some sort (or submachine gunner for the assault squads) - grenadier specialized for close combat and trench clearing. There is always a squad leader. He has the same loadout options in every squad but can issue orders and call for different support depending on his squad type.The only negative things I have to say about this game is - lack of support options (currently there is only gas, artillery and airsupport). Tank support or big NPC assault waves could be added as high level squad support intensifying the battles dramatically and really giving the player an idea of how it is to look at dozens of enemies charging towards his trench!- lack of customization options. Though the system is already quite customizable it could be even more customizable! E.g. enabling the player to choose his own weapons in stead of having three fixed weapon loadouts for each class.That said, I think this game is one of the best WWI-games ever made! If you like intense FPS shooters or war games, or if you're just interested in history and WWI, I definitely recommend Verdun!My rating: 10/10 points.			"

												I purchased this game about a week ago and was very surprised by what I had stumbled upon. What I was expecting was a call of duty set in the trenches of WW1. What I have been playing (pretty much non-stop since i bought it!) was a highly squad-based, realistic, and addictive historical FPS. It really does capture the essence of the chaos in the trenches as well as the futility you will eventually feel every time you go over the top to charge the enemy trench. Charging at machine guns, rifles, and artillery fire to gain just a few metres of ground is a very different experience than any other game I've ever played. Anyways my pros and cons are:Pros-Realistic maps, weapons, and shooting (no twitch fire, quickscoping, etc.)-Great squad play, if you do not play as a team player, you will die. Again. And. Again.-Sense of satisfaction from capturing the next trench and line and desperation as you start to lose it in the counter-attackCons-Maps are a bit too big for the team sizes, sometimes it feels as though there aren't enough people attacking or defending. This could be remedied with larger team sizes obviously, or NPC's.-Very odd squad progression system that sometimes carries on through matches and sometimes doesn;t, this is annoying especially when my mates and I are trying to get to the next level of uniform and upgrades.Overall this is a very well made game that is definetly worth its price. I hope to see future updates adding more great content!10/10 "

Early Access Review
								Having bought this game yesterday when there were some huge bugs that were introduced with a patch some hours before, I was pleasantly surprised to see the devs release a patch to fix the issue within a few hours. As soon as I had left the game out of frustration with the bugs, a patch came through. I hopped back on and all the huge issues I had before were gone - hit detection and low latency and no server latency.. and no random invisible god mode!!!So now that these issues were fixed so quickly, I am optimistic this is going to be a great game. I loved the WW1 HL1 mod 'The Trenches' but not enough servers were ever around and not enough players. That was a long time ago so the greyness was really hard to stand with HL1 engine. But Verdun is a great game and I suggest fans of shooters like the Red Orchestra series should check it out. It's not as hardcore as Red Orchestra but features are being added regularly. It's a pretty solid game so far with only a handful of maps. The maps are pretty great though, really capture the spirit of the first world war mud fest. I might suggest some fallen horses or donkeys or other animals as some form of cover. Not too much but a war horse or two fallen would look pretty cool.I ended up playing through the night since I was enjoying myself so much after the patch. Before, with players from all over the world on the EU or US servers, it was almost impossible to hit people with the lag/latency, but now with the patch I can hit people fine. Also there is a Japan server for people in SE asia such as myself so this is great. We just need an iinet or similar Australian server to complete the region mix I think. But I get decent pings on the Japan servers.			"

												Where do I begin, there's so much to say about this game. I may as well state that I am one of the veteran players of this game, been playing this game in the early beta stages and have seen a lot of progress. A lot of progress indeed. A lot of players like me would probably look back when the uniforms were low res and any explosives did zero damage and say ""ahh those were the good days"". I've had this game for two years and I plan to keep it. This game as I said, has been through so many changes. New beligerants to the war and new regiments. Chemical warfare and an accurate suppression system that throws off your aim. Also, time accurate weaponry, along with the amount of usage of these guns. It's not Battlefield 1 where everyone is running around with a machine gun. There's few machine guns but mostly bolt action rifles, just like the real war. Plus the tactics used to play the game and win are just as accurate. Certain regiments play certain roles such as reconnisance or offensive regiments or defensive. Fire support and support in general is just as accurate. No ""killstreak"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, they can only be called in by your regiments NCO who leads your squad, and it's all timer based so use wisely. You also don't get many MLG dumbasses in the game, so that's also a perk. I mean, I am not saying there isn't any period, there are some but not as many like in COD. The community for the most part is mature, you are going to come across some rude or obnoxious people which is expected. In all of my two years I have only seen one person exploit hacks into the game and they have been permanently banned from the game I believe. Plus that was way back in beta days. So hackers are not an issue at all. The game CAN get laggy. Just adjust the graphics settings to where it runs the smoothest and you should be alright. This is also a game that is best played with friends too, so either make friends or play with friends who currently own the game. Playing with friends builds team xp and can provide your squad with better perks and support.That's my review of it, and I hope it can influence you to buy this good game. If possible, go ahead and watch gameplay videos			"

												Verdun is a great squad-based FPS, with a nice balance between realism and playability. It's harsh, gritty and unforgiving, and you will die a lot. You'll get blown up by artillery, just as you've finally managed to sneak through no-man's land while dodging the MG bullets flying over your head. You will choke on mustard gas, and you will get your head bashed in by a sneaky german NCO who's crept up behind you and is now pistol whipping you with his luger. You will hear the clink-clank of a grenade landing between your feet half a second before you're blown to bits. You will freak out as you miss your first shot with your slow-as-♥♥♥♥ bolt action rifle, while some crazy canadian is charging you with a god damn club. You will slam your mouse down on your desk repeatedly while screaming profanities as you get stuck in barbed wire for the second time in one round, but hopefully you've got a sturdy gaming mouse that is suited for that kind of abuse.At it's best, Verdun is a really intense and immersive experience. The trench warfare setting is something you'll either love or hate, and makes it a bit different from other shooters that are usually set in more urban environments. It's highly recommended to play this game with friends, as the squad aspect is really important, and cooperation is the key to being successful. You will also gain co-op xp with the people you play with, which gives your squad improved perks and abilities.This game is great fun if you enjoy historically themed FPS-games and bolt-action rifles. The learning curve is steep, but don't be discouraged. It is recommended that you read the official guides on steam before entering the game, just to understand more of what's happening. "

								Imagine having to crawl through mud, your future uncertain, holding your breath while tracking an advancing enemy running frantically between hills, trenches, and explosions a hundred meters away and with a single bullet, like the reaper, you claim them. That is Verdun and it is as realistic as it'll ever get. Verdun is an absolute must for any FPS or WW1 enthusiast. It immerses you into the era from the beginning with the music and atmosphere. The graphics are breathtaking despite my PC's shortcomings. Verdun has a great unlock system that is easy to pick up and utilize with classes and a plethora of WW1 weaponry. The controls are intuitive if you've ever played an FPS and the gameplay is a thrill. I'm looking forward to see what the developers at BlackMill Games and M2H have in store for this game.			"

												I quit playing FPS games a long time ago because they just didn't keep my interest anymore. Too many times I spent the money and then got bored before I got my money's worth. Most new FPS games feel like re-skins of the same games we've all been playing for years... and I just couldn't get into it anymore.I'd never played a WWI FPS before and it was something I always thought would be pretty cool. So when I saw this pop up on Steam I followed it for a while. After a few months I was bored and looking for a new game so I decided to take a chance on Verdun. Personally I feel like it's the best game purchase I've made in a while. This has been the most fun I've had with a FPS game since I can remember.The trench warfare is just a totally different feel than anything I've ever played before. The pace of combat changes constantly depending on whether you are attacking or defending - and there are multiple ways to attack and defend depending on your load out. The squad system is actually pretty unique too.The learning curve isn't too steep - and so far the community has been pretty cool. I highly recommend this game!			"

												Do you want a true battlefield experience? Then look no further than Verdun. Never have I played a FPS that made me sweat at the idea of running across no man's land trying to invade the enemy's trench. This is not the kind of game where you rank up kills while soaking bullets like some kind of super soldier. If one bullet hits you, you are dead. You better get used to the idea because that's all you're going to do at the start of your first assault. You will quickly realize just how serious the situation is when you start seeing your comrades fall to the ground as the sound of mortars pierce your ears, all while trying to dodge machine gun fire and hopefully not get sniped for the 100th time as you slowly make your way through all the chaos. Your accuracy has never been more important than now. Having fast reflexes is essential if you want to stay alive. In order to improve you need to practice, so I suggest playing Squad Defense mode - it's basically where players fight off endless waves of enemy bots, which sounds less realistic, but consider it a target practice mode that will help you a lot in the beginning.Verdun set out to recreate the horror that was WW 1 by putting players in the shoes of the brave men that fought in it. In my opinion the game succeeds with flying colors and is one of the best war games you can play. Highly recommended!			"

								This was totally worth it! Only paid 4 euros for it, and trust me, I just feel like I should have paid more for supporting the devs. This is a nice tactical shooter that won't work without cooperation and teamwork (kinda the same thing). If you're a CoD fanboy and you're expecting 360 noscopes and Doritos and Mountain Dew as rewards then go away, this is for serious gamers.       A very nice experience, I can't even get bored of it even if I try. There are currenly 2 game modes, Frontline wich is the classic, and realistic trench warfare in WW1 and Deathmatch, where everybody's going crazy, you have to hide and wait for the perfect chance. This is in BETA so expect some hackers, glitches (not many) and some bad visuals.       As many people already said in their reviews, this looks and plays like Red Orchestra 2 or Rising Storm (games I own too, so I can confirm this theory). But, RO2 was free last year on steam for 1 day, so many trolls and fanboys got into it. Still, this is not a RO2 copy, it reflects more teamwork based gameplay and WW1 realism than you think.There are people who actually know what teamwork trully is, and you can play with them right here. Man, I love this game! The developers are active and they read almost every thread on the community. They listen to us and they are trying to fix the issues and problems we encounter in-game. There are constant updates wich I love! They are the perfect example of what every developer should act like.       I'll give this game a strong 9.7/10. Developers you did a great job. Can't wait for final release!			"

												In this review of Verdun I will be covering 5 catagories of gameplay (Which includes game community)*** Preformance ***Although the graphics aren't that of the new Battlefield 1 coming out, Verdun is a beautiful looking game for its content and context. If there is one annoyance I have it is the optimization of the game, I run a GTX 750Ti and I can run everything at high and some ultra, and I get about 40-45 FPS when I play, but I have read where some people with higher grade cards experiance lower or even wors frames, but for me it was fine with some drops in FPS the lowest I have had being was 20 FPS but that was at the beginning of a map when everything renders. One other annoyance that ties into community and preformance, some players turn landscape and foliage quality off or too low to get an edge on players, where as if you were hiding in bushes on your screen, on another players with no foliage you would be laying in open ground. Over all preformance out of 10 would be a 7.5, due to the time it has been out and has been repatched time and time again. *** Gameplay ***The key factor Blackmill was going for in this game was realism and authentisity, and I think they hit that mark to a certain degree, which it is real and fun for both sides fighting. The guns are authentic and so are the squads and languages spoken. I understand if they really wanted to make it realistic by taking out UI and making friendly fire a thing but Blackmill I am assuming wanted to make new players feel welcome without being too harsh in gameplay. Over all score would be a 9 out of 10, the gameplay is spot on with the weaponry mechanics and realism.*** Mechanics ***The mechanics and such for Verdun are average for me. Running is a little clunky and the default keys to crouch and sprint with are assigned in a very weird place, so I rebound crouch to CTR and sprint to SHIFT. However aside from movement mechanics, the bullet mechanics are well made for a 32 player trenchwarfare FPS, there is bullet drop at long range and if you want a kill while the enemy is rushing toward you at an angle you gotta know how to lead your shots. Over all I give mechanics a clunky but not too shabby 7 out of 10.*** Realism *** (In a sense of immersion) Verdun is spectacular at immersifying me into the trenches of World War I. Sometimes when the artillery is soaring over head i'll take a second to look up, as I hear the yelling of other soldiers in the trench next to me, and there is a certain type of peace as well, looking at the whistiling wizz-bangs overhead. But me gawking usually ends with a German putting a Luger round throught the back of my head, pulling me back to reality, ""Oh, I died. Damn.""A solid 9/10*** Community ***The Verdun community is very welcoming with most people, even to noobs at the game, dont be afraid to ask questions in all chat, usually a few people will tell you the answer to put your gas mask on. But the unfortunate part about Verdun is the size of the community, its fairly small for such an awesome game, but I am seeing more people playing because of the recent announcement of Battlefield 1, which is good and possibly bad for Blackmill, but Verdun will always hold a place as one of my most favorite games ever. I am veering off track but, the Verdun community is spectacular, if you see Kaiser Wilhelm in game, he's cool as well nice guy. Rating for community 10/10			"

												Are you ready to fight in the muddy trenches of ww1? Are you ready to run through no man's land? If you are, take your rifle and whistle with you and buy this game!The game is not perfect, but it is good, you really get that ww1 feeling when you are about to storm the enemy trenches.Also the gore system is nice, adds a little something into the game.The controls feel sometimes a bit clunky, but they work.

Early Access Review
								Dear *Name has been rubbed off*,My love, it has been three days since I've bought this game, and I cannot stress how much I love it here. From gunshots flying by my head throwing me into a daze, to my dear friends dying (and respawning) around me, this game made feel something I haven't felt in an FPS in a game in a long while: It immersed me in its world and made me feel like a real WW1 soldier. And dear sweet lord, it feels good.I can feel it in my head, my love. The urge to roleplay seethes through me. I want to leap onto my desk and charge foward as my allies do whenever the general calls for a charge, and I can feel my heart racing when I fail to capture a point and must fall back to my trench. I feel like I must watch every single area around me. And if I fail to observe a single thing in this drab, grey/brown world, it oftentimes costs me my life. Every shot matters, accuracy is key, and knowing the positioning of my body can mean the difference between life and death. And let's not talk about how my gas mask barely fits over my head. But hey, at least it lets me breathe through the toxic yellow gas. But do not worry, my love: The medical coverage is wonderful here, so I come back with everything intact with no seeming consequence.The world is very gray, and sometimes, the textures of the world seem to flash in and out. Even worse, I can see the nether space that makes up our world disappear from the ground beneat my feet. War is hell, but by god, I hope it fixes the graphics in this texture-popping world. It's a scary sight to behold. And perhaps I have not been here long enough, but oftentimes I struggle to discern allies from foes, which often leads to my death. (Until I discovered that there is no friendly fire in this world. I must keep that in mind next time. Always shoot first and ask questions later)I cannot customize the way I look, so don't worry about the socks I requested from before. As well, I don't like my uniform the way it is right now. This blue uniform makes me look a flashing neon light in a dark room screaming, ""HEY GERMANS! PLEASE SHOOT ME"".My time runs short, so I must keep this letter brief. As time goes on, I will be more than willing to send more letters to update the progress of the war. But know that I will be doing my best here. It's an ugly world and the things to do here are very repetitive, but overall, it's quite a nice place to be in.I love you, *name is rubbed off*. I will be sure to write to you again soon. P.S. Send a football for next year's Allies vs. Entente Christmas Football League.			"

								By now, I can safely say this is one of the best WW1 first-person shooters I have ever played; and continues to improve day on day.   Through little over a year, the game has come on leaps and bounds with the addition of various new factions including the Tommies and Canadians, as well as the German assasult Strosstrupen squad.  Various additions to the game are also in the works including a new melee system, and other, highly anticipated map releases.  Although this game is not finished - with it being in Early Access - through having slight bugs or glitches, I can safely say this game is going to be a huge success with the steam community, and if you are thinking of buying the game, know you are going to jump right in with a dedicated and reassuring community fighting it out in the muddy depths of World War one.  9/10.

Early Access Review
								I first found out about this game thanks to FRANKIEonPCin1080p, and thought I just have to buy it. I searched for it, and bought it for a really cheap price and loved it, my only problems with it are the glitches that are still around after 1 year of being in alpha, however those can be fixed pretty easily if they already know about them. Oh, and the really bad optimization of this game really sucks.. I run it at around 50FPS on ULTRA however, I cannot use Post-Processing or any of those other tick boxes without getting 15FPS, and I currently have a really good setup: 17 4770k 3.5GHz, 8GB DDR3 2144MHz & Palit GeForce GTX 770 4GB.. Anyway this isn't for me to show off my PC specs, it's a review on this game.Day 1:After spending 1hr and 37 minutes downloading this game, it was finally time to boot it up, so I rallied up some friends to take into the trenches with me to fight along side in this very well made WW1 trench warfare game. I found out we could make a squad to play easier, so away we go with our own squad, I also found out later on how the squad leveling works, which I actually find really stupid how it works, as once you quit the game you cannot join your squad back it seems :( but apparently as long as there is someone in that squad it will keep leveling, so once you make it you cannot join it back unless you randomly find it..Day 2:After the mass amount of killing I did on Day 1, I decided to go onto it again and this time try out the snipers, found out on Day 1 that there was bullet travel in this game, which is really good.. However this game has really awkward bullet travel time, and I am saying this from a mass FPS game where they also have bullet travel time.. But this game you have to aim far too far infront of you opponent while they are running to make the shot even connect :S Once I finally got the bullet travel time sort of sorted, I began to realise that sniping is really good, and seems to be fairly easy (Coming from a ranged user on all FPS games). The only issue I have with sniping is the mouse sensitivity.. You can only turn down your aim sensitivity which affects all of your aim down sight, so for the snipers I find it best to use a very slow sensitivity on this game, as it enables you to slowly move onto your targets, however you cannot have a set slider to adjust for using snipers, or for just using rifles/MGs which I found really annoying :(Day 3:After getting over the fact that you can only adjust one slider for your sensitivity I found a few bugs, which may have only happened to me, I am not too sure :o 1) Do you all remember the ""Windows has stopped responding"" error which occured on Windows XP the most? Well, now I find that in this game (But nothing stops responding) what I mean by this is, when I look up into the sky, at a set point my weapon starts to do that motion sort of them (When you dragged that error box around the screen a lot) I kept doing this because I wanted to see if it was actually a bug and not just a 1 off problem.. It happened each time. I then found that if I look up into the sky with a gas mask on, my screen goes completely white and really does hurt my eyes, so I kept doing it again to see if it's a 1 off bug.. It happened every time sadly.Day 4:I finally found some really funny people to talk to in the server! It also had some massive ♥♥♥♥♥ who were telling everyone who has a problem to delete the game, and gtfo those guys were real ♥♥♥♥♥ who should gtfo PC. But, I am basically saying is this game has a pretty nice small community which should start to grow a lot faster now that more people know about this game, and have actually seen some good footage of it (Thanks to FRANKIE).Conclusion:Even though this game has a few little bugs, and a few little keyboard warriors on it.. You should still get this game! I got it for around £5 1 week ago so 17th December 2014, and you can too if you use the right website.. But it's on sale now so if you don't know that site, then just buy it from steam while it's on sale! It is a very good game, and I cannot suggest any other WW1 type of FPS I have ever played that was a fun and enjoyable as this.If you read all of this review and didn't just skip to the conclusion, then I thank you for your time. I am not very good at writing reviews so this was kind of my first propper one on a game, but I hope it helped out :) "

Early Access Review
								I grew up with games such as Battlefield 1942 and some of the great mods for it such as Forgotten Hope or Desert Combat and I am one of those people that just don't get to enjoy the direction that many AAA games are taking anymore.  Some of my favorite games are done by small but very competent teams such as Red Orchestra, Insurgency or No more Room in Hell. I keep having my eyes out for interesting new games to play and Verdun sparked my attention just recently. What can I say, I LOVE THAT GAME!!! Like many other people were already saying before me it captures that ""battlefeel"" in such stunning ways that it makes you feel like being right there at the front with you fellow buddies in the mud. The controls are just perfect, the ambiance is awesome. It is NOT a campers feast or a sniper orgy as I was first afraid of, the trenches and the many craters in the battlefield will work to your advantage keeping your head down while you approach the enemies trenches (or run away from them haha).  The level-up mechanism is very motivating, it doesn't take too long to unlock the different weapons that each class comes with and they are all very well balanced. As already mentioned the controls are superb and put you right in the soldiers boots without any weird clunky mechanics to getting used to. The weapon handling is great and feels very realistic.I play it alone but the way the game is build most of the times you end up fighting with some people out of your squad side on side which makes it a very team oriented experience.The graphics look super nice and I was very surprised to find out it was Unity Engine, I thought it was unreal 4 engine the first time I played. Keep in mind though that the game is done by just a handful of people so they don't have the resources to add tons of stuff nonstop but every patch I have seen so far added good features that made lots of sense. It says I only played 15,6 hours but that can't be true I played much more then that.Did I forget anything? I hope this game has a long future ahead of it with more and more people joining the battlefields and discovering how much fun it is. I hope the dev team will support this game for a long time too and keep adding maps and awesome events such as the Christmas truce.  Long story short: do your self a favor and buy this marvel of an indie game. One of the most motivating shooters I played in years without a doubt.			"

												Amazingly realistic, you have to think about flanking or where to come at them. Well scary when the guy in front of you gets shot. So fun when you get in there trench and they don't know. So cool when you run over the top with your whole army. Even better when your sqaud's in the trench. Fun with freinds (if they follow orders, I play as corporal, I'm ok but my friends don't listen to me much, but when you get put into a squad with people that are willing to follow you, it is so fun they follow you and all.). Over all there are some glitches sometimes eg a random face appearing on your screen for 0.25 secs and he's like 'Hallo'. But it is a really fun game and is better than CoD in how scary it gets, like when you're lieng down and an MG is shooting at you and you get deaf (in game) and your screen goes black and white			"

												Not sure if i'm evolving or devolving with this new ""play a ton of"" multiplayer.  I'm going from trench warfare in the skies with airships, to WW1 trench warefare in either mud, or actually pretty scenic forests.But yea, it's basically squad based WW1 trench warfare, where the squad you're in plays a major factor.  Depending on which squad type you're in, the CO of the squad can spawn people, or anyone could spawn people - provided the enemy is not right ontop of you.  You have guns locked away, but they're pretty easy to fully unlock everything.  Goal is to capture the enemy trench, hold off their attack, and it alternates between attack rounds, where you have to get across sometimes small, sometimes hugh ""no man's land"" to get to the enemy trench. once you have numerical superiority, you'll start to cap.  And defence rounds, where you pretty much snipe, machine gun, or just shoot the other side as they make their way across noman's land.  about 5 minutes each, with potential ""foothold overtime""s where at least someone is in the trench. Matches last about half an hour before mapchange, although it could be over sooner.  To get a good feel for it, i'd say play at least 2 maps per session.played it for 24 hours in the past 2 weeks, and still hungry for more. ^.^			"

												You could call me a bit of a history nut and a war buff so it's only natural that I play this game with great determination.This is truely a real Gem of a game and the Dev's should be proud of what they have accomplished here. The historical accuracy is 2nd to none and only getting better with each and every update... and there have been many.All seriousness a side though. Have you ever been picking your way across Nomans Land and got taken down by machine gun fire or an artillery strike... well of course you have and what better time than to make a quick trip to the bathroom right. Only to return back and find you have respawned in a shell crater full of water laying face down and died again. Lesson learned! xDWarningOnly buy this game if you know how to respond to a dog whistle! :PLove it! "

And as you can see I have set Verund as my favourite game on Steam - and I have some really huge AAA kittens there.WW1 climate & gear, immersion, graphics, community, devs - undoubtable pros.Cons? Not that much of a con, it base on experience you earn, but If you are not very familliar with shooters and squad-based side-to-side action - prepare to die a lot.

								I was very fortunant to get this game! Verdun is a WW1 history buff's wet dream as long as they love online multiplayer, a great community that is full of philosophical history buffs and awesome trolls, and first person shooters. It updates from time to time like minecraft. You fight on 5 maps so far; can play as the French, Germans, Canadians, and British. It is mainly a squad based game that requires the strategy and cooperation of your teammates ranging up to games that can maximize to 32 people per server. It requires a lot of patience because it is a long paced game since it tries and succeeds in creating a WW1 atmosphere. You can unlock different weapons as you level up your different squad classes. I argue however, that the squad-class rank-ups are too easy now; you can now rank up all 4 tires in one match if you do well enough while as before it used to take way longer which balanced out the game and formed as a prestiege mode for your progression. Other than that, it is a great game, definantly one of my top-favorites especially out of my steam library. Just know that back then there were mostly bolt-action rifles without scopes, so don't expect so many mobile machine guns in this game. Have fun and enjoy it, the game's price increases the more it updates so hurry up and get it while you still can!			"

												Damn fine game. Basically it's Red Orcestra of WWI. It's hard to do a WWI game well and these guys have. I like the squad system, its something I would like to see in other games. I like the trench warfare and I can't wait to see what else these guys have in mind. I'd like to see tanks and planes come into it. Also, as an Australian I'd really like to see a Gallipoli/ANZAC DLC. Would also like to add that Gas brings in something very unique as well - never seen it in another game. This game can pretty much do the entire scope of WWI and it's brilliant. A few things I found a little annoying is that the movement feels a little clunky and the hit registration is a little off. Wish they had more maps as doing the current ones can get a little grindy and repetitive sometimes. In conclusion this game is a very good realistic historical FPS game and I highly recommend it! 7/10			"

								Really fun game, one of my best game purchases ever.The maps are great and while the setting of trenches doesn't change much but the size, ambience and intensity does change with each.The weapons feel good and being mainly 1 hit kills makes them feel powerful, with bullet drop and lead times it does take skill to hit targets.There are still bugs and optimisation problems but the Devs are working on it and there's patches nearly every week. The Devs themselves are great guys, fun to chat and joke with and can often be seen playing their own game, hope they do more Streams on twitch as it was great to be able to take part in the Q&A with them and helps show their active in the community.

From the teamwork to the actual gameplay, this game brings a fully enjoyable experience, along with a slightly educational edge that really shows the player what it was like to be fighting on the Western front. Also the difficulty of sniping with an ironsight brings an extremely satisfying feeling when you start picking off the enemy players.I highly recommend this game if you are into multiplayer gunfights, history, and teamwork.

								Verdun is one of the best games iv' played. im obsessed with WWI/II! everything about the great wars interests me, The Guns, the Armour, the Places, the armys, the Individual peoples stroys! its all realy special. and when i saw this game Ages ago, i shouved it on my Wishlist streight away! But it was only  Up untill recently that i was Killing my self for not buying it! because My mate did it for me!Special thanks to RG | ConolaCoil (name may change), Your a real Goons mate! Anyway, the game. Verdun is the single most Acurate WWI FPS iv ever seen. Its actualy Quite scary, how close it gets to the real Horrors that they had to face for us, them soldiers XD.One can easely get Completely and Fully imersed in this game. Things like Being able to say things in game like little comands & Misc' frazes like a battle Cry (wich depending on what side your on will determin what could be said) & Laughing, or just saying ""good Shot, Mate!"" or ""I cant Believe ya Hit that!"" in a young British dudes exited Voice. the game just makes you smile at those pointsbut when your teammate Blows that Defening Wistle to sound the charge, You pray and Run like they taught you to in boot camp, strieght at the enimy with tiers of fury in your eyes! Guns blazing, its gonna ither be You or them.Once you get the game, Even the Main menu is Awsomely cute and Acuarate. Your Menu sits floating with a Background of the Trenches were you have been spending the Nights of your Service. Music from the radio floats from the right, and the crackling fire and murmering sets the mood. its realy interactive and special, like when you go to the Options, it takes you to a small Dugout roomwere what seems like Your Personal items are. Its realy cool! to get straight into the action, dead in the middle of the top bar is ""find battle"". Smash that one with your Mouse, and you can pick out of Death match, just Unrealistic cod like DM, and Front line, Awsome staged battles that Use Squads and souch. you Press front line and it will bring you to a map layed out on the table in your Home trench. Find battles in one of there famous locations like Flanders. Once you've done that, You have to join A squad. Each squad has its Own name, made by people who have created them. You join one, and Play a roll for that squad in a battle. You join the battle, and Diferant individual squads are on ither team. your orders dont get mixed up with theres, however the Over all goal effects all in the team (Take Ground and Prosper!). You can even go through Tiers of Classes, giving you something to play for in your time in service. each Class has 3 tiers and once unlocked, the tiers loadout is avalable 24/7. the tiers will introduce items relevent to the class, aka a grenedier will be upgraded with a Pistol of some sort and more Grenades, to get closer faster and LOB em in! a dangerous job. and rifleman can upgrade with Bayonet's and scopes, making Trench warefare as scary as Peeking your head over the trench lines.Everything about this game i love! even the guns have souch attention to detail, and realism is beond messure here. you dont always ♥♥♥♥ the Bolt on your rifle ither, like Automaticly in cod. you dont auto reload, everythings up to the player, like how it was in WWI. the Guns themselfs are Works of Art, looking Beautifuly realistic and sounding like it too. and its the same with the landscapes! The Trenches themselfs have steps were peopel would peak over and fire, little alcoves were people would take cover, barbed wire everywere inwich you can get stuck, and with A lot of movement tear yourself open and DIe! its all wonderfull! I happened to be more patiant when it comes to games for some reson, but i would think that Those who are used to cod may not Like this as much mainly because if you try some stuff that you can do in cod in this, well it normaly doesnt work and will ruin the game for you. so basicaly, if you want an awsome game to do with WWI thats attention to detail is Beond measure, Grab this. if your not, grab cod 1.

It is 16 vs 16 divided into squads of four for the main game mode. Most weapons are one to two shot kills sometimes three depending on the range. The main goal is simple capture more trenches then the opposeing team in the 30 minute time limit or push the enemy team off the map. You most gain a foot hold in the enemies trench before the time limit runs out if you contiune to have one guy in the trench it will not call a retreat you have extra time to hold a majority number for a short amount of time. If you fail at this you will be put on the defence until the enemy team falls back or takes your trench and the bloody cycle begins anew. If you do decide for this game do not be discouraged when you die alot. What matter in the end is doing your job and winning the match. Overall fun game I highly recomend it to anyone intrested in tatical shooters or WW1 history just be prepared to die jumping into the enemy trench alot.			"

												Bought it in June 2016 and do not regret it.  Nice change from the WWII shooters (different weapons, etc).  Gameplay is fun and challenging.  Most weapons seem realistic in killing power.  Variety of nations/types of forces is cool.  Grapshics are very good.  I highly recommend this.			"

												Even though Verdun was only just fully released, myself and I am sure many more felt like we had a full game on our hands from the beginning. The production value, sounds, rendering, and sheer attention to detail has slowly amplified over the past year, and we look forward to these next months as the community expands and enjoys.

												After extensive experience with military shooters i feel the need to advert players about Verdun.As i write this the game has just left early access and is released and i have clocked in more then 18h of playing.The Pros:-Guns sound good.-Feedback of the game is fairly positive, when you hit something you can feel it.-Uniforms are nicely rendered and the progression system is interesting.-Focus on squad gameplay is pretty unique in FPS world.-Maps are fairly interesting and feel authentic.-Its the real first attempt at a commercial WW1 FPS game.-Great value for price.-Great fun when teams are balanced.The Cons:-Atmosphere feels flat.-Spawn killing is an severe issue.-Hit detection and hit boxes are very very rough, you could literally be point at some guys shoulder or chest dead on and nothing registers.-Your shots will vanish upon your death, even though you fired off you rifle before dying.-Lewis gun is unusable due to overly chunky sights, which are a poor representation how peephole type of sights actually work in reality.-Grenade throwing is very clunky and basic and doesn't allow for any nuanced approach, you are always stuck chucking the grenade at full force.-Movement is unresponsive and awkward.Going from prone, crouch and standing there are these small delays that will often get you killed. and forget about jumping into cover your character will try to crouch first.-There is a really strange disconnect in between what you are seeing and what is really happening. In the sense that when you think you have plenty of cover somehow your head is sticking out and you can be shot at? Either this is true or somehow shots can go through solid terrain and neither option is really great.-The retreat mechanic is very poorly implemented, you get very little time to get out of no man's land, its actually more worthwhile to stay behind and attempt to kill something before the inevitable doom and just turn your back and get shot like 99% of the times. This needs to re-designed for it punishes people that are actively trying to fufill the offensive objectives.-Gas seems more of a inconvenience then a terrifying weapon. You often find it being more useful as a smoke screen then  actually incapacitating soldiers like it actually did. -Maps have some really noticeable design flaws. That lead to problems of gameplay. Specially on the loser side, the further you are pushed to the back the more unlikely it becomes for you to be able to make a comeback has the reserve and communication trenches are often devoid of cover or depth. Often even resulting in predictable spawn killings.-barbed wire is counter intuitive and in some cases too effective in channeling players into killing zones.-Legions of bugs, seriously guys, you shouldn't have launched it as is.Conclusions:-I can't reccomend it based on the fact that is so bug ridden and bare bones in many aspects. Although i love what they are trying to do and the vision is very interesting and compelling with a heavy heart i have to say this isn't up to snuff. It needs a hell lot more polish and work before i can really say it is a game worth buying. If things get better over time i might change it to a positive review, but atm it is too rough around the edges.Note to the devs: Seriously work harder guys, i really want to give this a positive score and reccomend it, it's up to you.

												I'm personally very fond of this game. It's become my most favored first person shooter since CoD: World at War, but I'll try to present a fair review. This review was written following the release of the ""Horrors of War"" Expansion for Verdun.Pros:-Accurate representation of World War I-Weapons are fitting to the era and fun!-You start out with 1914-era uniforms and progress to 1916-era uniforms as you level up with friends.-Fairly easy to earn medals even if you didn't play all that well.-The frontlines game-mode really makes you feel like you're participating in the Great War-The writhing death animations and screams will haunt my dreams for years.Cons:-Sometimes your body launches up into the air after being shot. It's kind've funny though.-The community has been sort've notably infiltrated by the CoD and Battlefield community; you can spot them by their endless whining in the chat.-Getting good at the game will require you to die at the start of your career. A lot. You'll get better at it with the more time you put into learning the gameplay. Most people tend to give up within the first ten ranks. If you're easily discouraged or prone to breaking blood vessels from high blood pressure, I don't recommend getting this game.If you're a history buff or have an appreciation for well-made World War games, get it. If you're looking for an ""MVG +420 Call of Duty sequel"" keep looking.			"

												VerdunBefore ""horrors of war"":an update was release a few months before the expansion which made the game run like s**t and crash constantly. only after another few weeks was i then able to play. the game was ok; hard, buggy and a bit lacking in content.After ""horrors of war"":This has changed the game, a load of new guns, squads and a new map make this game now alot more enjoyable. The main reason i now love this game is the gore, now at first this eems wrong and gothic, what i mean is the scary and tormenting deaths, some simple and some graphic, make you realize what it may have been like. everytime you or someone neear dies a chill runs through my spine and reminds how bad the Great War was. obviously this game on shows a fraction of the struggles, but at least the developers have given the time to make detailed loading screens with pictures and desriptions of the battle that you are about to take foot in.Overall: I am just hoping that dice/EA are not developing a WWI game as i belive it would be more insulting than anything else, with more focus on getting kills then verduns focus on trying to make you experience what the horrific battles might have been like. the game is now very good and a very good edition to anyones steam library			"

												Played only 22 hours so far. Game looks good, feels good and has a very good replayability for the price. There are no vehicles in game - it is heavily focused on trench warfare and infantry combat. Maps are rather small and you will not have problem getting into fight. Most weapons are bolt-action, so your reaction and ability to aim matter much more.The teams are divided into squads - you level them up during your session and unlock bonuses (and it's much more fun playing with your friends).There are flaws and bugs, but I never met any that can force me out of game.

												For all of you who came here because you thought Battlefield 1 wasn't realistic enough: This is war. You stick your head out of the trench, you die. You want to run from one bomb crate to another, you best hope and pray to Jesus' holy mother that you make it. You can see the cloud of yellow mustard gas closing in, but you need your hands at your gun to shoot the incoming enemy. As you, a second too late, try to put on your gasmask, you feel how the gas turns your bodily fluids into acid, burning your eyes and mouth. I love this game. It's a harsh master, but it is a good one. It makes you realise you really don't ever want to go to war, since military weapons have only been getting better in the past 100 years. You best mentally prepare for teamwork, because that's how you get things done in this game. Sadly, very few players have voice chat and even fewer actually give/follow orders. Everybody thinks this is call of duty, everybody thinks this is battlefield. Nope. Do what your NCO says and you may just make it home. Better get used to using a bolt-action rifle! Also, most soldiers carry only a rifle or only a sidearm. Get used to that, too. Did I mention I love this game? I do. The only thing I don't like about it is the players: very few ever become an NCO (every squad needs one) so I become one. Then, as I'm giving orders, trying to win the battle, I notice nobody gives a ♥♥♥♥. Sometimes some dude starts caps-locking orders in the team chat, but I know his battle with his own team mates is a lost one. My advice: find friends. Find a clan. There are plenty around, some bigger, some smaller. Then you'll see that the war is not won by a single sniper or a single gunner. This game gets frustrating for me when I don't have anyone to play with. If you want a really challenging game to play with your friends, this is the one.Also, the Belgian soldiers' voice actor is Flemish, and speaks Dutch. That was a personal big plus for me.

												(Edited Review as of March 27th, 2016) Horrors of War took this beautiful game and cranked it to 11! Tons of new weapons, even more factions, coop wave mode, realistic gore, and my favorite thing, the death rattles and somber wails of your enemies and comrades when killed by gas, bullets, arty, barbed wire, burned alive or simply beaten to ♥♥♥♥ with a shovel or club. This game continues to push the hellish and brutal atmosphere of The Great War.  While optimaztion and performance has increased for me slightly (90fps avg Ultra/High @ 1440p) it does drop to 55fps in heavily crowded areas with gas and arty strikes landing but overall feels smoother. (Mileage varies) Overall I still reccomend this game heavily to anyone who adores playing this style of game alone or with friends!(Original Review)The game places you in some of the bloodiest and gruesome battlefields that WW1 ever had... An does so in such beautiful and engaging way it makes your heart pound. Pushing forward trenches with your teammates and friends, frightened that a bomb will land beside you and take your squad out while also dodging rifle and machine gun fire, grenades, and artilery as you push onwards to take your position in the frontlines all the while your NCO's drop artilery and gas on the enemy. If you are lucky enough to get into the forward trenches you fight without mercy in close quarter combat using pistols, grenades, bayonets, shovels and whatever else you may have at your disposal until you either take over the trench or forced to retreat licking your wounds until next time. Once you gain the trench or fall back you are now in charge of holding what you have with all you got. You dig in and get ready as artilery shells pound steadily across the battlefield an enemy soliders push your postion, as gas drops in your trench you frantically put your gas mask on and wait hoping to see the enemy pushing through the gas and explosions and kill them before you are killed yourself. This game is not for the arcade fps game fans, but would def recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good realistic fps game with frantic combat and smooth gameplay. Worth the full asking price or steam sale prices. Will not be disappointed. For those who didnt have the pleasure of owning the game back 2013, this is what you missed during the christmas time!

Early Access Review
								This was reviewed on 120 betaThis game is awesome. It is set in WWI Western Front, Battle of Verdun, which was fought between Germans and French. Gunplay, maps and overall gameplay feels a lot like Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm so if you've liked that game you will love Verdun too. Gunplay feels verysmooth, and realistic. For now in 120 beta there are a lot of bolt actions with bayonets and scopes which you can unlock. Pistols and Machineg guns are present, but I prefer playing frontline soldier with simple boldtaction to kill my enemies. The pace of the game is a bit so so dont expect to get 40+ kills every game, but i think this is a good thing. The thing i love about this game is the realistic gamemode which is consiting of defending a trench and then after some time counter attacking the enemy. If sucessful in capturing the trench from enemy you have to defend it fromeneies counter attack. If not you fall back and defend the old position. Stalemates are common like they were in WWI. Anouther game mode that is rifle (bolt-action rifle) deathmatch free for all,this game mode is self explanotory. Overall the game is awesome and i would recommend it to all my friends to play it.

-Highly Recommended Title-""Now I find, I actually have to be good at gameplay,to do well in Verdun. The biggest challenge is me.""Verdun is a realstic WW1 FPS with its strengths being in it's squad - role based gameplay, and historical representation (the maps are realistic for the period, as are the character , models, weapons, uniforms etc .)One can really get immersed in the ebb and flow of the battles, the atmosphere, geography and heat of the battle.. And feel how tough and suicidal WW1 was. With that in mind, the squad based gameplay allows a good breadth of available strategy and tactics that can be employed to successfully ""gain ground""....but it does take team work, and thats what I really like. The player objects are well represented, and have had undertaken, numerous tweaks, improvements and additions. There are period uniforms, and, as a squad progresses - uniforms get upgraded. Weapon usage and realism is pretty good too. There are aspects that can be improved  (like reloading animations, muzzle flash etc.) Overall, Im able to hit my target, if I take my time - and have good cover and support.The graphics over all are excellent - quite a bit of work has been done by the dev's to smooth the performance vs quality.  Ultra settings still need to be improved - when turned on - performance is very ""laggie"". Graphic performance and quality on ""High"" is good enough though.The sounds are also excellent, with period music, action sounds (explosions, gun fire etc),  and battlecries.The game continues to be developed - the current version is 170 - I think it's pretty close to a final product - but the dev's aren't done yet!It's not an easy game to get started out on for everyone, but other players will help you out if you are new, or you can head over to the Verdun War College and enrol. Between 5-10 hours of gameplay is needed to become somewhat proficient  at Verdun :)Verdun is definately worth the money, and your dollars will help the WW1 era games to develop...they have been the poor cousin to WWII games.The Verdun community is full of passionate, helpful and decent people. Wouldn't be a community without it's trolls too, of which, Verdun has it's fair share. There are numerous official and unofficial guides available to help you understand what's ""under the hood"" .Early Access Score: 8/10 "

												Having reinstalled this well past release, the game has been completely polished compared to what I remember from playing early access.An immersive, well built team-based shooter.I don't really like the WW1 theme, but I'm not bothered by it in this game.The vast majority of players will have bolt action rifles, based on availability of weapons from the time and having to unlock weapon sets. More on that later on.This makes gameplay feel much more about skill, since that one shot counts a lot more. Can't spray and pray with a bolt action rifle!You'll see machine gunners try and surpress rather than go for a lot of kills.If you die a lot whilst playing, remember to check your cover. Since it's trench warfare, what you see directly in front of you isn't all that can see you. ;) Make sure your flanks are secured, hide next to some obstacles so that any threat is within your field of vision.The unlock system has been overhauled from what it was in early access.It is now a system that makes much more sense, you can easily unlock just the weapons for just the classes that you like, no wasted unlocks or anything. Those points you gain by leveling go straight to what you want!Playing with randoms still gives the classic problems of little teamwork, but the linearity of the maps and the objectives on it force everyone to go one way anyway. Which fits the theme.One game where linearity isn't an issue! :)Without discussing price, I recommend this game if you're looking for a less-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t shooter.			"

								Let me start this review by stating that I play this game on the lowest possible graphics settings, so my review will not contain any real opinion of the finer graphical details.  The game is freakin awesome.  Very immersive, very fun to play, and there are a lot of very cool people in the Verdun community.  That being said, there have been some issues over the past month or so regarding performance for some players.  Fortunately not ALL players were affected, but I myself have had periods of a week or more where I was unable to play.Overall, yes I recommend this game.  Whenever there is a problem, the devs seem to fix it reasonably promptly, and most of the time, whatever issue you might experience, is relatively minor anyway.So yes, good game I love it, 500hrs playing it and it is still fun every time!

								After seeing some the negative reviews for the game i almost considered not buying it, though something in me decided to purchase the game, and man am i glad i did!Being a lover for history I find I prefer games not set in present day, so Empire total war and Mount and blade both appealed (no matter how unrealistic) though I have always preferred the two world wars, namely WW1; this led to purchasing Rising storm/Red Orchestra (fantastic game BTW), however, when I realised there was a game which was similar to Rising storm but in the trenches I was compelled to see how it turned out.Long story short I loved this game, it has a perfect mix of realism and quick arcade fun to keep one hooked for the whole 40 minute matches (they are quite long!). The simple idea of assaulting over no man’s land and trying to capture a trench in a certain time period, before either gaining a foothold or having to fall back to defend really forces the player to advance or defend if you want your team to win. Some people do camp in the trenches when you attack but this can be beneficial to provide covering fire to your team.To summarise; I like history, I bought this game, I like this game!10/10 would bayonet an enemy officer after accidently smashing keyboard!

												Could be an awsome game.It has a unique theme, has great concepts, maps and the uniforms look good, and the whole trench and rifle madness just work out. Then what does make it a horrible game ?The netcode of course. Simply has the worst netcode in a pvp game i have ever seen. Players randomly teleporting all over the place, shots go through enemies, getting killed behind cover. Synchronization is plain bad.The character animations look horrible and clunky. Melee system is awful, it automatically locks the target.The first time i say, but this game really needs Frendly fire. On small maps, like Argonne, artillery and nade spam makes a mindless explosive fest.Edit: Plus The Horrors of War DLC introduced more balance issues.			"

Early Access Review
								Having played this game since the early days of it's beta testing I can't really describe adequately how proud I am of the developers of this game. The finished product, I think, speaks for itself. This game is, in this gamer's opinion, a finely-polished killing machine. From the painstakingly detailed period uniforms from several of the nations involved in the First World War, to the gleam of the mud in the filthy, blood-soaked trenches, this game is, simply put, beautiful. This isn't a case of some sub-contractors churning out a Call of Duty/Red Orchestra clone to make a few bucks. I believe these gentlemen perceived the absence of a quality FPS for the Great War and set their efforts to doing this over the past few years. This is quality. Considering the development team was so small it is simply amazing to me that this game is as great as it is but having played several times with the developers themselves grunting in the trenches with me, I think it is certain that this is the product of a labor of love. And their efforts have succeeded indeed. This has been my favorite FPS for the past year. There have been a few missteps along the way but the developers were always on the ball and fixed things with lightning speed. The community is definitely one of the top tier as well. If you are as fascinated by this historical period as I then I cannot recommend any other game more highly. My hat is off to you, sirs. Bravo and well done. "

												This game is really awesome.  It feels very realistic, like you're really in WW1, both in the ways battles are won and in the fighting itself.  Everything seems to have weight to it, unlike some shooters.  I recommend this game to all fans of WW1 and any shooter fans with a little patience.			"

								If you are in to tactical squad action, this game is for you. There is no bullet drop, so most of the time its a one shot kill, which adds to the realism of WW1 trench warfare. Now that it's on sale, and a lot of people are playing, the battles are intense where you have to take sectors and defend for a while. This has a rank up system, and look forward to what more patches will bring, hopefully a graphics overhaul, it's not great now, but it's not bad.You always have to watch all your diretions in this game as the enemy could come from anywhere. I would reccomend taking advantage of this sale, and would always recommend it at full price.			"

												Verdun is based in the tumultuous and incredibly bloody World War I, where trench warfare and the rise of the first tanks took place. The game takes you to various locals and humongous maps spanning the length of France. I have long been an admirer of history, and I must say that this game has not disappointed me in keeping to the period.To speak of the graphics, the game in it's earliest form was basic at the least. However, it has gone far from those nascent graphics and has blossomed into a grimy and bloody masterpiece of historical-based games. Gun models are very realistic and detailed, and include things such as serial numbers and maker's etchings for those that look closer than just the far sights. Uniforms, with the benefit of a scrupulous historical adviser and modeling team, are top notch and pleasant to the eye, as much as they are to the period. On top of these, much work has been done to detail every inch of maps with props and trenches that are again as if they were lifted right from the annals of time to be played by our more recent generation.Game play is formed to follow the manner of tactics used at the time, with the defending or assaulting of trenches, where the capturing of a trench by your team earns it one grueling, hard-won point. After such a minor victory has been achieved, you must then aid your team in defending your well-earned prize for a time before continuing on to the next trench or, failing that, being beaten back to start anew. In this, Verdun captures the essence of the period brutally, but beautifully. You are also able to have a variety of characters at your command that are chosen from a ""squad."" A squad, whether of the Central or Entente powers or factions, have four characters each to choose from, and are further broken down with three loadouts, two of which needing be unlocked via points that you are able to earn. Furthermore, team play is also very encouraged with the inclusion of squad voice chat and squad or team text chat, allowing you to alert your teammates to an incursion into your trench by the enemy. The deadliness of the period is also well represented by the ease with which your character can be brought down to a rather nasty end, whether it be through a bullet to the skull or a mortar round to your hapless, rag doll body. This being said, I must also mention that there are times when game play breaks down to rather nasty spamming of snipers or those that can and do use grenades to a pretentious amount, forcing the enemy team to also stoop to such levels or be annihilated. While this does happen on occasion, it is few enough times to not pose a very large problem, though one that does need some balancing in the hopeful future.Of the squads I mentioned earlier, you have seven to choose from between the two sides. Three belong to Germany, where you have the Stosstruppen, Landsers, and Alpenjagers. Another four of the Entente powers include the Canadians, ""Tommies,"" Chasseurs Alpins, and Poilus. All of these have their own four variants of characters and three variants of loadouts, which add up to eighty-four different possibilities. For instance, each squad has a leader that can call down powerful artillery, noxious gas, or recon planes to give the location of enemies to you and your entire team. Or you can have machine gunners that lay down anything within their field of fire. More squad types are on the way according to the Verdun wiki, which should be very interesting in future gameplay, especially if they also were to include the Russian faction as well, though such a squad might have some internal dissention...In any case, with the exception of a few player-based hiccups, there is little that can be said against the game, besides the occasional problems for people to connect to friends at times, which could be a rather essential bug were it not to be addressed. I recommend yes for those that are looking into this game, as it is educational and fun for all that would play as a soldier of the muddy, frightening, maddening, grueling, and wonderful Verdun!

												It's rare I find a first person shooter I like as they sort of all seem similar to me. Although Verdun is simplistic with it's guns (it is WW1), the terrain and the way they organized the classes is what makes this game very peculiar. The setting is WW1. The battlefront is eastern France. It's you and your squad trying to push the front lines. Well, only if you choose that game mode. Verdun boasts three game modes for the moment : front lines (where it's a defend/advance territory tactic), offensive in which your constantly pushing back defenders to take control of new areas and lastly, last stand where you and a few other players have to hold back hordes of opposing players. The guns themselves are simplistic and depending whether you're playing as an Entente soldier or Central powers soldier, will determine the type of guns you use. Some guns have more ammo than other guns but (speaking specifically about rifles) each gun is relatively the same. Each player is given a rifle and a pistol. The squad leader is stuck with a pistol and cannot holster a rifle. This player has binoculars instead. With this, the squad leader is able to tell the squad where to advance as well as launch mortar/artillery fire to his choosing. The class system is a little bit different in Verdun than other games. You are not actively allowed to jump from class to class as it may be occupied already by another player. This player has to accept your offer to switch classes. This is important as this game is highly based on team work. It is near impossible to advance or defend without the help of your team mates. Most of the guns offer a one-shot kill but head shots do count for extra points. Some classes even have some high powered machine guns if you rank up enough! I should also add there is a ranking system in place where after each match you will be given experience points to unlock further arsenals. The maps/terrain are what really set apart this game from other shooters. You can't simply start running and gunning. Everything is a calculated move and no-mans land is really dangerous. You never know whose peaking from their trench waiting to pick you off. You can however, move slowly and try to remain undetected. Moving slowly and moving with squad mates really increase your chances of winning. Some action players may not like this ""look-then-move"" strategy but it's what really distinguishes the game. I'm a personal Halo fan and love the running-gunning-blowing up sort of stuff. This gives me a little break in that and also forces me to really work on my aim. It can be quite the thrill trying to advance and sneak behind enemy lines. Don't go too far though or you may be killed by the game for staying out of the playable area. All basic controls are here. WASD provides for basic movement while the mouse let's you point and shoot where you want. ""G"" throws a grenade (when you get one) while ""V"" is melee. I should add some grenades are gas grenades in which you will need to equip your mask to avoid further damage. A great feature in this game is the ability to crouch or prone when necessary. Space will stand you up or allow you to jump. Holding ""shift"" (or sprint) while aiming down your sights will make your player hold his breath for a better shot.The graphics aren't too bad at this stage. Their up there but I think they could do a little better. I have a brother (whose really into WW1/WW2) also mentioned some of the trenches are way too clean. I understand the game has to look neat to a point but some realism would be appreciated. I wouldn't mind seeing mud being slapped up by a player as he's running, or even mud pits that can slow players down. The sounds are okay at the moment and aren't extremely immersive or over the top. The basic sounds are there but adding a few more things may take the player to another level. Hearing shots skimming over your head can't be beat. Overall, this game has some huge potential. I'll be keeping an eye on it to see where it goes. I'm hoping down the line they add a few more perks and add a few more options for players to play with. I know it's world war 1, but even adding a ""radio"" that let's you ""report"" enemy positions may be cool! Luckily, there is a system now in place that takes care of this.

												Quite possibly the only ""realistic"" World War I first person shooter out there. The trench combat is surprisingly fun and the gunplay is extremely suspenseful. This gameplay is paired with an impressive presentation and nice maps. Frontlines and Rifle Deathmatch are extremely fun, and the Christmas Truce is also great whenever it comes around, but I don't like Attrition or Squad Defence.Overall, really fun and good value for money. If you're a history buff, a milsim fan or someone looking for a new FPS to play, this is definitely worth a look.

												As someone that has played countless hours of this game, I do feel like I know what I'm talking about. There is surely a lot of potential in Verdun yet the developers somehow manage to bury that with their own choices. Starting from a bunch of recently added clutter to maps which then couldn't be optimised (and still isn't), to the addition of a field-of-view and movement update that discouraged aggressive objective gameplay all the way to ridiculous features like a maximum bullet travel distance, Verdun just has too many setbacks to make me recommend this in the current state that it's in. The optimisation is still completely hit-and-miss, and system requirements are just excessive given the final product. Don't even get me started on the hit detection which never seems to improve and numerous bugs, many game breaking. The anti-cheat system was also troubled recently with an influx of hackers, although it seems it is unable to ban anything besides just testing if you have CheatEngine running or not. Don't get me wrong, there are still great parts to the game and the setting is something I absolutely love. If you ignore the negative aspects it is pretty damn amazing. Sure, give the game a go if you want to try, the refund button is always nearby if you find the same issues that I have. I really can't give a positive review with the current state of the game, maybe one day. #bringbackoldverdun			"

Early Access Review
								A very good, but somewhat simple game. < That is pretty much the only way to sum it up.In a game that seems to be the first of its kind, I find myself having to really step up and apply myself when playing this. It's a frustrating game, in that you have to be really accurate in order to get kills. There is definitely an element of skill needed to play, but that's part of the fun. There is definitely an element of teamwork and co-op required also... which is where this game will shine for most players. COD Kiddies should find something else, because going rogue in this game gets you nothing but dead. As of the release version at the time of posting this, there is a few nagging issues that you may need to keep an eye out for/be aware of..1) MG's can, and will find you... EVERY TIME. They are wildly accurate, powerful and annoying. Currently they are bugged in the fact that you can't hear them over long distances (aka ""silent MG bug"") and they are tough to spot.2) Luger is wildly accurate, seems to 2-3 hit kill over long distances (pulling off a headshot across the map with a luger isn't a tough task) but the stopping power up close is annoyingly lacking. If you can't manage to land a headshot when clearing trenches, you can and will most likely get rolled by a crackshot with their rifle. I think the luger needs a bump in damage but then so do all pistols in the game so far. A bump in damage, but nerf their long range accuracy and damage falloff.3) The Lee-Endfield/SMLE has a weird bug when using a scope on it that seems the scope isn't aligned properly. You need to aim slightly to the right of your target (if he stands still) to hit him. Ironsights on it are also bad. I'm not entirely sure of this is just one of those usual mid-dev bugs or if it was intentional, but just keep that in mind.All in all it's a very well put together game, for a game with only 3 devs. I look forward to seeing what they do in the future with updates.

												I've heard about the game for quite some time, but never tried playing it. With the Battlefield 1 hype(btw i don't like/play BF), I asked my friend to share the game with me. Turns out to be one of the most fun shooters I've ever played. Talked with friends and we all got a 4-Pack, and it was worth it.Pros:-Realistic WW1 setting.-Nice trench warfare combat.-Very good gunplay wich rewards your skill.-Easy to get classes upgrades, you don't get locked in the early game.-Nice graphics.-Great maps.-Squads rewards teamplay, especially with friends.Cons:-Some performance problems.-Sometimes you get unbalanced teams, making hard to hold or atack a trench.-Not many people play, but atleast is suficient to have maps with full teams.-Some squad bugs.Additional Notes:-It doesn't have a ingame tutorial, but it doesn't make the game bad, if you have played a lot of FPS or games like Red Orchestra 2, you won't have problems learning the game. I found it way easier than RO2. -If you need help about the game, go to Options->Game Help, there is tons of useful info to help you get into the game.-It's multiplayer only.Overall I'm having a great time playing the game, if you have a interest in WW1 setting or you want a good shooter that doesn't hold your hand too much, I recommend it in a heartbeat, be it on sale or even full price.

								Verdun is a game which is an early access beta game, but even so it is already spectacular!  It is different from most first person shooters in that it is highly cooperative on each of the sides.  Individuals must join a squad which is comprised of four people each of which have different roles within the squad.  If success is to be had, it comes as being a member of a squad, and not just one of many soloists as is commonplace in most other first person shooters.  This not only gives it a unique flavor, but also gives it a strong feeling of what it was like to be fighting in World War One.  To my knowledge, this is the only World War One first person shooter ever to exist.  Other than a few flight simulators, there have been practically no games on the subject of World War One at all.  My Grandfather was a veteran of the ""Great War"" which is what it was called up until the conclusion of World War Two.  He was an officer in a tank battalion and commanded a young tanker who would eventually become famous as a World War Two hero, tanker, and general: George Patton.I highly recommend this game.  The authors are continuously updating it, sometimes as frequently as several times a day, but never less than a couple times a week.  They are dedicated to creating a great game, and thus far they have succeeded fantastically.  This game is worth every penny even in this stage of beta, and I'm sure that when it reaches its final release version, it will rank up there with the best first person shooters of all time.  Count yourself lucky by shelling out some cash, and becoming an early release beta tester of this wonderful new game.  I assure you, you will not be sorry.			"

								Ever dreamt of an FPS set in the First World War? I know I have. Verdun, mon ami, is the answer. There's almost nothing I don't like about it. Let's get to the facts!Pros?Awesome graphics, even on low settings. Over twenty weapons, all authentic, all from the war. The maps are fun and well-planned, and really immerse you in that Great War feeling. If you're afraid of being limited to bolt-action rifles and bayonets, then fear not! There's room for knives, machine guns, pistols, shovels, even submachine guns. You can mêlée with just about everything. For example, if you don't have a bayonet fixed on your rifle, you can strike with the stock. Heck, you can kill people with binoculars! The levelling system is great. Performance is good, and I've encountered very few bugs.Cons?The movement animations always get me... I mean, when you're running, your weapon just looks like it's bobbing off your chest! They need to look less robot and more human. The crawling animation isn't good. I'd like for there to be static HMGs, however the devs have said that this is a no-go.In the end? An awesome game! Among the best games I've ever played... and it's in beta! Later we'll see more maps (including a more indoor/urban map, set in fort Douaumont), more squads... who knows what else. Suffice it to say that if games were potatoes, this would be a damned good potatoe.I'll see you on the battlefield!			"

So for the most part you don't have 13 year old kids telling others to ""Get rekt"" or swear every chance they get. Every now and then there will be one or two of those people, wich is unavoidable. However there is a mute option but it is not like other games and may take some time to figure out. Though I'm sure if you ask in-game there will be people to help.   Third, this game does include clans such as 'KK', 'BW' and '+', and elite players. '+Zab' is one you may hear a lot about.   Finaly, at times it can be enjoyable, agrovating or however you want to put it. Overall it is one of the best WWI FPS games you can get.			"

								So this my old review This game is clearly not at a ready standard. As someone who likes to play Red Orchestra 2 this game was a disappointment it does have postives and I feel that it will become worth my money once they add more stuff but at its current state don't buy it. If you are looking for an intense realistic shooter do not get this get Red Orchestra 2.Developer response:M2H_Mike  [developer] Posted: 31 Oct @ 9:50pmLots has changed since your review. I would appreciate it if you'd check out the game again and let me know if we're going the right direction :)But I feel its not time to make another after playing a bit more. Even though I have not played an awful lot of time there is a clear improvement beofre I would given it a 3/10 but now i would say 6/10 I can happily say in the future this game will 8/10 for me game still feels a bit clunky but looks beautiful and does feel much better to play I will wait a couple more updates to play but it is starting to be worth cost. Keep up the good work.			"

												I LOVE this game so much! The action, the explosions, the intense moments! Sure it can get a little frustrating at time to get shot dead by someone 500-1000 yards away, but you get over it pretty quickly and get back into the fight! Getting kills in this game is so satisfying, because if you miss your shot, you might end up dead for your mistake. The maps are great and varied and the graphics, while not the best, are beautiful at times and really hit home the grim nature of this game. If your into historical shooters and are in the mood for something diffrent from the regular crop of games like Call of Duty and Battlefield, come try this game! Just get ready to die, a lot!			"

												Verdun is an extremely entertaining game, which balances skill-based and shoot-'em-up in a very nice way. The restrictions of the game being a relatively accurate WWI means that there is a bit of a learning curve from more popular FPS franchises where you might not have to deal with jamming weapons, slow reload times, swaying weapons, etc. These restrictions though come together to create a more skill intensive game, which I prefer. There's a decent amount of strategy, and as with any game, you'll find yourself dying a lot early on, but once you get the hang of it, the game is very rewarding. As of right now, matchmaking doesn't do a great job of balancing teams, but you can always try and fight that by getting some friends together and voicechatting. The ingame chat tends to be rather friendly, a lot of camaraderie and discussion, as well as being decent for strategizing. A solid game that will only get better over time.			"

 Verdun: The World War I (First-Person-Shooter) Game of the DECADE.  Verdun is pretty much the best FPS game of the Decade, considering it is hilarious, and it is very well organized. Ok, so Verdun: Why the best game WWI FPS Game? The game has some bugs, glitches, and hyperboles, but otherwise, it is  great! I do recommend this because of the great graphics, semi-great physics, and the continued updates.			"

												Although I was gifted this game, I can definitely say this game would be worth buying. (Especially if you get it on sale).This game could be considered ""competetive"". I can most compare this to Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad.Although the game is not as easy as a run and gun. It definitely has its moments of derpyness, and it is really fun to create a squad of friends and to go out charging into the battlefield (Most of the time you'll end up dead).Pros:-Forward spawn (and this varies for different squad types). This allows there to be some mobility on the map, as squad leaders advance and take cover, your squadmates can spawn on you.-Variety of different weapons and squads.-Squad Abilities capture arty spam of WW1 well.-The maps are very well balanced. Sometimes it is balanced so well, specific maps will end in a stalemate 9/10 times.This can be seen as a pro and a con if you don't like static games.-It is still in development and the devs seem to do a good job at fixing bugs that appear in the latest patches, the patches don't add pointless stuff to the game.-Squad Progression: I don't think there is an ""OP"" squad ability, even as your squad levels up. Bonuses to your squad are well balanced, but still worth achieving. How you level up your squad, is mostly affected by how many matches you play with the people in your squad. Because of this, you pretty much need to play this game with friends if you want to unlock squad abilities. As for unlocking new weapons, you will get career points over time that you can spend on particular positions in different squads.Cons:-There are still glitches that appear after each patch, but these seem to be rapidly decreasing over time. -The game is still being optimized. Even if you have a half decent graphics card, you might get frame drops every now and then until they optimize it more.-Sometimes it is hard to find a full game depending on what time you're playing, and where in the world you live. Most of the time you can just switch to another server like EU and there will be full games.-You will die a lot in the beginning.Overall people who don't like slower paced games where you die a lot won't like this too much.

								A very good WW1 simulator which utilizes trench warfare to almost perfection. Camping and tactical play play a major part in this game from a defensive perspective but when attacking you need to carefully plan your attacks and attack where the enemy is weak. Infiltrating an enemy trench and stealthily killing everyone there can never get boring with the added suspension of not knowing what is behind the next trench corner. The game rewards you working as a squad with the spawn mechanic where if the leader of the squad is deep behind enemy lines the squad players can spawn on him and help with the capturing of the trench. The game also has a one shot kill mechanic for rifles where the best marksman will be the one to get the kill to add further suspense. The developers have also added massive amount of historical accuracy in the gun designs ;  the outfits of the soldiers also look amazing. Well worth the buy for its price and the game has still got more to come from it when the official release comes.			"

												Honest review: This game has been around way before Battlefield came up with the WWI idea. In my honest opinion it executes everything better overall. Realism is this games forte, nothing arcade like in the ways of BF or CoD. There are no F1 accelerating tanks or no-trench maps. This is actual WWI, as it was intended to be. You play as a forgotten soldier in the muddy and rainy trenches of France. A bullet can kill you, or fatally wound you. Gas attacks or barbed wire can be very troublesome either. There are also several modes to play and the biggest thing they have is the trench warfare style move forwards and backwards maps. It is true that the game requires a good rig to run smooth but if you have it and if you like realistic shooters on WWI, then I say it is a must get. You get the most bang for your buck. Have fun and see you in the ghastly trenches of war !			"

Early Access Review
								A rarely seen WW1 shooter emerges from the unknown. <- That was pretty much my mind when i saw the game first.Since i am a great fan of World War 1 shooter, i said to myself, it's worth a checkout.And it was really worth it. Even though my computer is pretty bad at the moment, i can handle this game without losing pleasure at the game itself.The graphic are not high quality but then again remember: My computer is pretty bad and it's still early acces. I would stay neutral at this point because i'm not in the position to judge over the graphic with a computer like this.The feeling of sitting in a trench...just waiting for the enemy to run into your gun is amazingly caught! Before i forget there are Squads (4 people working together...reminds me of L4D but don't mind that, it was basicly it in WW1). Imagine you are in the defense move of your newly captured trench line. 4 Squads are holding the position. But if one Squad is whiped out during the defense...you are at risk of getting flanked, so you have to look up your map more often to avoid that risk, to reinforce weakend sites of your trench.The WW1 feeling is once more amazingly caught by the gameplay itself. If you get shot, it's over pretty much 90% of the time. You need to be careful if you advance to the enemy trench, if the enemy sees you and you are not fast enough, it's over. Even if you can't see the enemy... there could still be someone targeting you, a world war 1 feeling greatly captured. And if there's a short time of silence in the battlefield... be aware! Somebody could be aiming at your head.All in all to not make this too long, Verdun is a great WW1 shooter. WW1 shooter are seen rarely and if there is one game like this, it does not capture the trench warfare, gas warfare and the psychotic warfare as nearly as Verdun! PROS  - Great feeling when playing the game (doesn't matter whether it's the Entente cordiale or the ""Axis""- Greatly capture of the units sended into the war back in the time.- Sounds are quite noticble- Great capture of the trench warfare and the combined gas warfare- historicly correct battlefields, weapons and looks of the units- nice rank up system- World War 1 shooter- Balanced gameplay (Outcome depends on the players) Neutral - Graphic which i can't judge about CONS - pretty empty servers - can be frustrating (if your hard work, to get to the enemy trench line is destroyed by one shot but then again... WW1)- Ranking up can be pretty hard if you have a skilled enemy teamI hope i could help you people out there a little bit with the decision to buy Verdun or not.Greetings			"

												A one of a kind Historical FPS. The game takes its title from the most infamous battle of World War I and its prodominate feature is its historically accurate weapons, uniforms, and battlefields. Players will work in 4 man specialized squads on either the Entente or Central powers' side. Gameplay involves defending your trench and attacking theirs within an alotted time. This is more fun than it sounds at first, as your whole team will need to work together and communicate to capture the enemy line. Obsticles include enemy gas and mortars, machine gun fire, rifle fire, grenades, barbed wire, sandbags, trench works, shellholes, old vehicles, dead horses, and more.This is definately a game for those who are history buffs, FPS fanatics, or looking to die a whole lot. Not for the easily frusterated. Weapons (especially rifles) will present a slight learning curve because of the bullet drop and physics of WWI-era weapons. The news and game updates are constant and the team is highly dedicated. Devs often play matches and converse with the players.Pros:- Fun and Addicting Gameplay- Historically accurate weapons, uniforms, and maps- Devoted Developers- Great Community (League/Tournament + Plenty of Clans)- Multiple Servers which are usually populated decentlyCons:- Bugs and glitches here and there (Devs will fix major ones asap)- Slight learning curve for new players- You'll die a lot.

While they're working out the bugs in the beta, that shouldn't stop you from buying the game now! Only multiplayer for now. There are French, English, Canadian, & German squads... with more on the way.This is quite an accomplishment for the small group of devs involved.The squad based combat means there are defined roles such as officer, rifleman, support gunner, sniper, scout, and fragman in each squad.

								I quite fancy this game. Haven't played it all that much but with the 3 or so hours i've put in thus far i'm liking it. Many of the maps look fantastic (Playing on highest settings), except the Flanders map which looks like a giant turd. The gameplay is nice, quite like Red Orchestra 2 but with less automatic weapons and more trenches. There is unit variety and each role has a unique feature.Overall, if you have a decent PC and have enjoyed other historical shooters (like Red Orchestra) then you are sure to enjoy this one.

												After playing 149 hrs, i would like to share my opinion about this game.Right now, this is the best WW 1 Multiplayer Shooter avaible. A lot has been written about the good parts of the game, things i do not need to repeat. I do agree with them though.And yet i do not recommend it, here is why:1) The netcode is simply the worst. The server trusts the client, this means: Client A says ""I hit Client B"" and the server informs Client B that he has been hit and is dead. That Client B allready had his head down in the trench is of no interest. See the problem there ? People with high pings will ♥♥♥♥ you good, especially if you are on a very good connection. Because your information where you move reaches them faster, than their movement info reaches you. Also this kind of client-trust makes the game very vunerable for ""hacking-tools"" - something that had The Divison loose a lot of players. But in all my play time, i never really experienced obvious skript kiddies and i dont consider it a problem.2) The game randomly disconnects you upon map change, or when you try to join with a squad. If youre lucky and on of your squad-mates made it through the map-change progress you have to join him quick via steam overlay. Otherwise some other player might take your spot ...3) The maps are filled with stupid bugs that make you fly up in the air or randomly for example.4) All the above problems are not new. They exist for long. And yet what do the devs do ? They work on a silly console version which will fail hard because of Battlefield 1.Verdun is a great game, which is marvelous to enjoy with three friends. But if your not a hardcore fan of Simulator like WW1 with friends: Dont buy!			"

												Fantastic game. It truly gives the feel of a real world war 1 combat experience. The weapons are balenced and time accurate, all of the soldier models and faction uniforms look great. The only things I would add to make it better is more players per game, more maps like the somme, vimy ridge, and passchendaele, maybe more customisation for personal soldiers to use in game, use of stationary weapons (machine guns & artillery), and maybe a bit more rain. Overall great game for the gamer who likes realistic world war 1 combat over fast paced and full of automatics.			"

												I really like this game. Here is my initial thoughts after about 8 hours of straight game play.Pros:- Decent comunity- Excellent ""feel"" to the game; it feels like you are on a WW I battlefield! Great team based decision making. You can really have a blast when you meet up with your riends and join the same squad. Working together is what it's all about in this game.- works on modest computers- the back and forth feel of battles is great. Capture a trench, defend it, and move on to the next trench, repeat.- Great assortment of weapons and squad types. I think most players will find what they are good at ater a short while. PLeanty of diversity - Fast pace to a game. Although you die pretty quick, the wait times for respawning are short and pretty interesting really (such as re-spawning on your NCO, etc.)Cons:-Needs a solo campaign. Also, should have nots to fill in for missing players. As it is currently, there is no solo campaign and NO bots at all. Completely a multi-player game. Not a real bad thing, but I would like to be able to practice and learn the maps better. Solo play would work best for this. True, you can enter an empty server and do the same thing.- Hard to tell friend from enemy.Overall I really do like this game. It isn't for everyone of course. If you like tactics and teamwork in your games, this game has that.			"

												(My first review)I cannot remember when i bought this game, some time ago. Alot has changed and this game has become quite interresting. Although it is not finished yet.I have to admit, in the beginning i did not really liked it(early access/alpha/beta/bugs/cluckyness etc), but something has changed....it has become a really good game.Some people compare it to RO/RO2, i think thats true. I recommend because:If you are interrested in World war 1.If you like similar games such a RO. (somewhat realistic, it is not extremely realistic though)If you like to level-up and progress.If you (like me) like trech warfare game modes of attack and defend and vica versa.I do not recommend because:If you like quick run and gun FPS games.If you like extreme up to date graphics (personaly i care alot more about gameplay)If you don't like to die alot and quickly in a FPS game.If you don't care about history(WW1), and is only interrested in modern stuff.I can recommend this game. Gameplay:9Graphics:7 (i have to admit, sometimes a little bit weak, floating trees bushes etc. however the game is made by 3 people, so i have read. Accualy that is amazing)Sound:8Originality:9Support of Dev's:10 (active witch patches and active on steam to awnser questions)  "

												Perfect game for a player who loves historical FPS and hate arcade-like-gameplay. Graphics is nice, the environment is astonishing, great lighting, sharp details and impressive visual effects. For new players, expect to die alot.Pro's:Free DLC'sKinda rewarding when you kill an enemyGreat and close-to-real-life details in the maps and gunsCommunity is OKDev's are listening to the communityCon's:Multiplayer only!Not so massive playerbaseHotfixes are ages to be releaseSome minor glitchesSome maps are not optimisedCons were not a deal breaker but will annoy you alot sometimes. An absolutely MUST BUY!			"

												Verdun is a tactical WW1 FPS with an emphasis on teamwork revolving around 4 man squads. The gameplay and visual style of the game is similiar to Red Orchestra 2\Rising Storm, although there are several unique elements involving trench based combat and some unorthodox class loadouts (get used to using handguns and revolvers, which are quite handy in some circumstances). Getting your head around these unique elements might take a few hours and you'll probably die a lot, much like the real inexperienced soldiers of WW1, but after gaining a bit of experience Verdun is a very exciting and rewarding gaming experience.Highly Recommended unless you suck at games			"

								It's the game I've always wanted, a WWI FPS that truly demonstrates how ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ terrifying trench warfare can be. Some of the many little things I love are my gun getting jammed right as a german marched up to me, a trench shovel as a melee weapon, the panic of putting on your gas mask as the enemy comes swarming in all while artillery is going off around you, getting lost in the trenches, and seeing an entire line of men mowed down by a Louis gun.WAR IS HELL, and this game gets it			"

												holy ♥♥♥♥. this game is amazing..i'm big into world war one. There's really not a lot of world war one games worth a damn on steam and besides this one they're all strategy pretty much. Verdun is a world war one game more then anything else. Muddy trenches, muddy nomansland, muddy everything. Artillery shells falling, gas floating into your shellhole, Rifles crack from all over, the occasional sound of a lewis gun firing rattles in your ears. The atmosphere is amazing, although sometimes maps are lacking players. There are several maps, each based on a different section of line on the western front. From Flanders, the muddy, stalemate of a map, to the Aisne, a rather unscathed piece of battlefield with trees growing and pretty foliage (lots of hiding spots). The mechanics are great (with the exception of one) and amazing for a world war one game. THIS IS NOT A GENERIC SHOOTER. The ballistics are probably unlike anything you've seen, and the change from assault rifles to your bolt action enfields and lebels is an awesome change of pace in a game. The game focuses on attack and defend gameplay, and can sometimes result in very trench warfare-esque stalemates. There's a time limit to prevent too much of a boring stalemate though. You can level up and unlock new weapons for your classes, and pick from one of several squads from each side, such as Poilus, Landsers, Tommies, Alpenjager, etc.If you play with the same squad members a few times you will earn squad xp earning you bonuses like better artillery, more points, and late war uniforms. The graphics are also amazing, especially for an indie game. THE ONE FLAW I have with this game is the melee. I think its pretty lacking for a world war one game where hand to hand combat was the norm. But this is a minor flaw, I just hope it gets improved down the road. And on that note my final praise. The devs started working on this sometime around 2006-7? And they finished the thing this long after? Thats a crazy feat for indie developers, and they have showed they will provide regular updates that are very good unlike many early access developers. That's all good, but even after the game has been released they have just now unveiled their plans for after the games release. A BUNCH of huge updates, FREE! Adding things like night maps, US squads, flamethrowers, gore, and more! AMAZING game!			"

												It is a breathe of fresh air in the sea of Modern Shooters to see a shooter from the World Wars. However, this isn't World War II but the Great War of 1914-18. See the harsh and violent war right at your finger tips. This game gives a glipse into the hell of Trench Warfare as you play the soldiers of the Central Power Germany against the Entante forces of Great Britian, Canada and France. (Soon the United States)Verdun uses a squad base system with each squad having it's own unique weapons and classes to fill with seperate abilities to use to help claim victory.There are three game modes to choose from but only the main Trench Games are where you're going to find people playing with 16 on 16 battles. 32 players slugging it out in the trenches. (I wish for maybe 32 on 32 but not a real complaint) The enemy charging your trench is the least of your worries as gas attacks, recon planes, mortars and bombardments can rain down on you at anytime. Once you repeal the enemy charge, it's now your turn to charge in the Counter-Attack. Beware though, you can lose your head to a sniper and machine gun fire.I am glad to see a game that covers over the Great War as it's often looked over for World War II. The game is a blast but it does have it's own share of problems in my opinion.The boundaries can often get annoying as you are executed for sticking your pinky toe in the red for too long or when an attack fails, you have so many seconds to retreat back to your trench before you are executed for desertion, so it doesn't allow you to stick around to slow down the enemy's counter attack. Games are often one sided with the game asking people to switch sides. It's counter to this is putting a penalty on the outnumbering side to prolong their respawn. From what I see is there is no voting system in place to allow you to vote someone out of your squad. For example, my friends and I often play in the same squad but on occasion, one of us suffer a disconnection from the server. A new player will join the game and take our friend's spot. You can ask him to leave the squad but you often told ""No."" You can't vote him out of the squad now and your friend is out of luck again.What I'd like for the developers to add in and I know this is primarily done over the Western Front but I'd like something to show the Eastern and Southern Fronts of the war.The snowy mountain battles in the Carpathians between the Germans and Austrians against the Russians.The German Push against the Russians in Poland and Lithuania.The Urban Battles in Serbia and Poland.The Gallipoli landings of the Entante against the Ottomans. So much more.The game is a solid enjoyment for History lovers and shooter fans. I highly recommend it.			"

												This game is amazing. I was initially skeptical that a WWI game could ever be fun considering how the battles played out in real life, but the map design is so good that you can actually attack without getting mowed down if you take the right path and find the right cover. Still though, there are times when your entire team gets mowed down, but then you get to mow down the enemy team when you're on the defense so it balances out. It's just a wonderfully crafted game.

												Can't remember when or how i found out about this game but i am so happy i did! The maps (for me) do an incedible job of creating and conveying that ""feel"" of a heavily bombed and trenched landscape. As for being a beta the only thing that i've even noticed were some lag spikes. And thats no biggie for me, annoying but not game breaking.[[EDIT]] I have been having a bit of a problem at the end of battle which sometimes results in the game hanging in such a way that i have to (manually via alt-tab) close it down and re-start the client/game. Again annoying, but not game breaking for me as it seems to only happen once every 5 or 6 matches. [edit] Two days and an update later the issue is completly resolved. If by some miracle the devs read this you guys rock!Also the graphics are beautiful all around with some nice animations for a beta too. Although the movement and associated animations can feel a bit sloppy (reminds me a bit of arma 2) it's a good starting point. Sounds are great as well. Again it's a beta, but probably the most stable and playable beta i've ever had the pleasure of being a part of. Just in case it matters to you, I run Verdun with everything turned UP as high as it goes![My PC = i7 4770 + GTX 770 4GB oc]Here (as in the real trenches of WW1) if you are silly enough to poke your head up to take a look over the trench, you will most likley catch a bullet in the face. So team work, timing and caution are key. Also the fact that every one is packing a single shot bolt action rifle means that running blindly around a corner, or skylining a ridge or hill top will result in you getting shot (again) and possibly giving your squads position away. I also love the way the battle flows in a similar way to the battles of the first war. Men were massed, a whistle was blown and they went over the top to take the enemy position. The gameplay is a similar series of attacks and counter atacks with little to no ground changing hands (just like the real deal). Many will not like this as a shooter for many different reasons and thats ok. But if you're looking for something a little harder than the usual shooter Verdun offes what i feel is a refreshing take on the trenches of the first world war. This game requires a more thought out and ""calm under fire"" aproach. Move as a group, don't bunch up, cover your corners and listen for the gunfire. I can't wait to see what the developers (who are very active and open to feedback) add to the game next! 22/07/14 - Still loving this game. Animations and sounds have been improved and some time soon (I hope) they will be adding gas attacks. This should really shake things up in terms of game play and make storming that trench all the more deadly!15/02/15 - It just keeps getting better! Now with a new engine this game is starting to really take shape. The graphics are better, the physics (bullet drop/lead) are good and getting better. Gas attacks, trench clubs and to top it all off they now have an Australia/Pacific server. Constant updates and feedback from both the community and the devs keep this game evolving and moving in a very positive direction. Thanks for reading!			"

												This game is truly a one of a kind game, as a history buff and a movie buff, I can say the accuracy of the game is very close (sure there are some minor flaws including how some players proceed in the game, but they are being worked on) This is not your ""shoot em up"" fast pace COD or BF game, this game requires skills in patients and to have a solid strategy. If you like making friends and don’t mind moments of intensity (when you’re forced to rush the battlefield) and having motor blasts and gas attacks every 5-15 minutes this is definitely the game for you!

The summary of this game is trench warfare because you're forced to stay in the trenches You live in the trenches and that is why I love this game. Don't trhow yourself in a open battlefield only to be a ""rambo"" because you will get instantly killed, this is a tactical game not cod. one thing sometimes you need to use a gas mask yeah the gas mask obsucured your vision, but it's better than choking death.i recommend this game for lovers of World War I. vote 8/10			"

												I followed this game through most of its development over the last year.  I was originally drawn to it for the subject matter, and despite its, at times, quirky aspects, such as somewhat crude character models and cartoonish animations, I found myself sticking with it.  The gameplay always drew me back, and I found myself devoting more and more of my limited gaming time to this intriguing game.Slowly, over more than a hundred builds(!), the developers changed one thing, then another and another, in a steady march to completion.  It hasn't always been a straight line to the finish - sometimes two steps forward, one step back - but these guys perservered, and succeeded, in ways both surprising and impressive.What started out as a clever, quaint little Indie game, fun in its own right, has blossomed into something much different.  The talented minds behind this effort could have stopped trying to improve things long ago, and still have it be considered a success.  Instead, through relentless hard work and obvious devotion, they have produced what, to me, is the best looking, most immersive, fun (and intense)  multiplayer FPS I've ever had the pleasure to play.  From the choice of a graphics engine to attention to gameplay elements, they've managed to do what virtually everybody said couldn't be done - create a compelling FPS based on the First World War.  Graphically, this is hands down the most gorgeous game I've ever played, of any genre.  Fantastic artwork, gentlemen!  You've put the big-budget boys to shame!There may still be some elements that are less than perfect, but it has been a real pleasure to follow the development of the game through beta to release, and I suspect that development will continue.  If you like multiplayer FPS games, you owe it to yourself to try this absolutely stunning effort.  I highly recommend it (as if that was in doubt)!Thanks to the devs for bringing this game to life.  Thank you, thank you.  I only wish I had the time and the stamina to play it more!			"

								If you've ever romanticized about the first world war as a story of how brave men left their wives and significant others to go slug it out against the forces of the German Empire and win a victorious battle then Verdun might just be the game for you. Just like the millions of brainwashed idiots that signed up to fight in this ridiculous war you too can reimmerse yourself in the horror of trench warfare. See comrades ripped to shreds by mortors and machine gun fire, experience the fear of being forced out into no mans land by your commanding officer and become entangled in barb wire sharp as razors while bullets, mortors and grenades rain down on your p'iss soaked position. Witness death and destruction on a scale never seen before as the devs are soon to include mustard gas where animations of violent choking and vomiting are almost a surety. Increase your squad XP by sticking with the same lonely cun'ts who play this game day and night to unlock horrifying artillary weapons that unleash total destruction upon your enemies. I recommomend this game to anyone who believes in gentlemanly warfare.			"

								To stand out amidst a sea of generic shooters takes a bit of work. Fortunately, Verdun stands out by virtue of the setting - World War I. Despite being almost ideal for translation into gaming, Verdun is the first FPS to really put a player in first-person WWI combat. The attack/defend system is ideal for the core gameplay, and the different abilities within a squad is a nice take on a familiar mechanic. The small dev team is evident as soon you start the game, but really the appeal of Verdun is that it takes place in an oft-overlooked period of history. By that fact, the sort of player that is attracted to this game is also the sort of player who can look past a lack of polish and just enjoy what is a very rare, and very fun gaming experience.

								Verdun is a lot of fun, especially for the casual gamer such as myself.  Although, if you enjoy CoD (the only other modern shooter I have played) look elsewhere.  This is not a free for all shooting match.  It actually takes skill more than luck to have a high Kill-Death Ratio.  That being said, the history buff and late 19th/early 20th century fan will thoroughly enjoy Verdun.  Good graphics, fun player base, and definitely worth the $16.			"

												All I had was a shovel, I had thrown all of my granades, but I was stuck alone in the enemies' trench.While trying to find my comrades, I happened upon almost half a dozen enemies.Something in me sparked, I'm not sure what, but I charged, brutally smashing the first 2 men's heads.The others turned to see me bash another one of their comrades' faces.They shot, most likely before aiming, and they missed me by a margin.I could only see black and white while I screamed something only a savage could.I stuck my spade into the last few enemies.When I had finally awoke from my barbaric instincts, I sat there, speechless, wondering what I had just done.All I could hear was one of the men screaming, and another gurgling as he choked on his own blood.I was still paralyzed when I came to the realization of what I had just done, ""Wha-...AHHHHHH!"" I screamed aloud, fearing the monster that I had released.War is hell my friends, war is hell...			"

								this game plays well, from the sound of the guns to the pace of the battle, the only issue I have found, is being in AU, the game is all but unplayable with the current lack of servers in the local area. ""cloud based muliplayer server"" sounds great but a ping of 320-450 is not.If local or SEA servers were providing steady pings under 100, sure this would be a no brainer to recommend, at present though if you are in AU, avoid this until such an option becomes available.as a MP only game, it is very disappointing to not be able to run a local server or find a low ping server.while I am clicking on YES I recommend the game, I am doing so on the provision you dont live in Australia.

								Alright, this is how this game is:As someone who started out playing alone, and now plays in one of the ""competitive"" clans (it's a beta, there's only so much we can do, but vet players know who's who), I've had most of the experiences you can have in Verdun.  It starts out difficult, absolutely, and a lot of the bad reviews you see are there for two reasons:1) They only played a few maps, couldn't get over the learning curve in that amount of time, and quit2)They forgot it's EARLY ACCESS, yes, it has bugs, it says that in the pop up right when the game startsNow then, the learning curve can be extremely steep.  Expect to die, and expect to die often.  You will be killed on occasion the moment that you spawn due to spawning on the NCO into enemy fire or unlucky spawns into grenades/mortars/artillery fire/etc.  This game is about playing smart.  Going rambo/gung-ho as you would in CoD/Halo/etc rarely works.  You want to move up, use plentiful covering fire, watching for movement, and don't fire from the same place too many times.  If you stick it out and learn to play, and especially if you can find a good group to play with (feel free to add me, I'm happy to help new folks), then this game can be extremely rewarding.  Updates are fairly frequent, so the devs are hard at work.It also has the buff of being a rather accurate WW1 game, which we know is uncommon compared to WWII.  So, give it a try, expect to die, and learn the game.  The community is pretty solid for the most part, and we're happy to help new players and answer their questions.  10/10 - Would recommend if you have the patience to handle a learning curve and occasional bugs.

								Verdun takes us back 100 years ago, durning ""The Great War'"". Personally I'm glad to finally see this period of our beautiful history taken onto digital entertainment.At first you may think it's one of those Red Orchestra title, with unsteady recoil and other ""realistic"" implements, however the answer is no. Verdun aims to be in the middle between ""realistic"" let's say Red Orchestra style and bit casual Call of Duty 2( no bullet drop and etc)  and it does it very well. Therfore both groups of players should find Verdun suitable for them. Yes, we have seen it with RO 2 where the devs tried to make the game more ""easy"" to attrack casual players and we all know how that ended. Verdun is different.The key of the game are so called squads, now before you start playing you might want to read very well written guide about it, trust me it will save you being confused when you start playing the game. In other games for example Battlefield the squad thing is optional with Verdun it's a must do thing, you can't pass it. Squads in Verdun make gameplay both tactical and dynamic, if you already have some friends to work together the gameplay expierience will be really pleasant. If not then I'm sure after a while you'll find some friends that will play with you.  One of the things that I really liked about the game is the ""Counter attack"" mode, where you take the objective and then have to hold it and vice versa if you lose it, just like in WWI, huh. The devs are constantly working to offer us more and better therfore the future of the game looks promising. If you are into ""WWII"" shooters definitely give it a go, no matter if you are into realistic or casual shooters. Verdun offers fun and ""epic"" gameplay for both.			"

												Verdun is a game of brutal charging and camping. As true to WW1.Pros:-Good graphics-Doesn't require a million dollar computer-Has a diverse system of weapons and attatchments-Is a open-field (new genre-ish) type of game----------------------------------------------------------Cons:-The camping can get very annoying-Sometimes it may be hard to find a server populated to your taste.-It's infantry only, meaning no tanks or planes other than some recon.

								Verdun is a huge breath of fresh air in the shortage of worthwhile WW1 games.  Verdun provides great map design, historically acurate and realistic weapons and mechanics (e.g. chemical warfare, trench warfare, and artillery) and intense long and short distance skirmishes.  Great buy.			"

								I love playing Verdun.  It's frenetic, in your face, brutal, compelling, sounds amazing and genuinely makes me feel like my ♥♥♥ is on the line..  I'm a long time Battlefield 1942 / Vietnam player with the occasional Modern Warfare mod from years ago.. years of early Counter Strike AWP'ing around..  I played Battlefield 4 multiplayer very briefly and went back to Battlefield P4F - Call of Duty Advanced Warfare got all of 45 minutes before I said 'what is this cr*p' and went back to finding something interesting which is where I came across Chivalry Medieval Warfare and thoroughly enjoyed the 'oh.. he's going to hurt me' gritty close range fighting but always felt it a bit cliched, with Verdun it's got the intensity of Chivalry without the moment to look each other over.. if you stare into someones eyes in Verdun one of you is going to die and that happens a lot.  The maps?  Glorious.. some are wide and expansive rolling fields of carnage, some are watery graves of face crawling, all with layer upon layer of attack and riposte.  My only frustration is people seem to not acknowledge the game for what it is - a rolling to and fro of attack and defence - this means as the attack phase timer ticks down, 5 or 10 team mates will be laying prone, meters from the enemy trench seemingly frozen in space and time..  if the timer ticks out and you haven't got the trench, you loose your attack wave (and eventually the game)..  the historical trauma of WWI was the obscene body count due to hurling massive numbers against each other ..  as this is a WWI game, sitting on your ♥♥♥ meters from the objective does nothing except frustrate your team mates and amuse your enemy.  Get with the program - Take the trenches (and die trying).It might be a worthwhile feature to have a 'ground covered / advanced' counter so everyone could see who was covering the most forward ground and potentially, that NCO's could execute those who refuse to attack.  You want to hide in a trench and not go forward when the whistle blows?  Bullet for you buddy.			"

								This is a rare sight in FPS gaming. Never have I seen a fun and historically accurate WW1 game if any WW1 game at all. With so many moderm FPS games they get a bit drab this addition spices up the FPS market! Only playing a few minutes of the game I can tell it is good. If the steam workshop if implemented it would only improve the game further. I would love to see this game one day become a AAA title. When defending the trenches against the french this brings back fond memories of my US history teacher calling frenchies ""frogs"". In all this is a great game for $16.99.			"

								Excellent, highly recommendedReasons for excellency and highly recommended? I am a long time fps and rts player. I have played Halo - Halo Reach , and CoD 1,2, MW 1-3, and BF3. I havent played a first person shooter for a while, but I have been missing the old school fun of an old world shooter. The game that comes to mind when I play verdun is Call of Duty 2. It was a break through game for the xbox360. I also downloaded these simultaneously, needing my WorldWar fix. With only 3 devs, there is a surpisingly high amount of productivity. Any question on the game let me know.			"

								A nice game that's currently doing a good job in its beta stage. This is my first game to try out bolt-action weapons from WWI, and I will say that they are quite ""Noob-friendly"" and easy to adapt to. The new models on the Central and Entente powers look great! The only issue I have with this game is the optimization. My PC can run Red Orchestra 2 on Ultra at 60 fps but this game runs at 20 fps on high for me. It's not that much of an issue since I can get 35 fps on medium graphics and barely notice a difference, but I suggest that the devs keep working on improving the optimization with each update. Another addition that i think would be nice would be bayonet/trench club charges to give another option while traversing no man's land.			"

												-=June 18th, 1916=-     It was a day like any other day: Frenchmen waving baguettes in the air while shouting ""Viva La France!"" and throwing their berets in the air, Britons sitting around a fire with their teapots steaming and their monocles getting fogged up while one sits off to the side opening canned crumpet with his teeth, and Canadians playing a game of hockey on the frozen Flemish soil while chugging maple syrup. Truly, there was not a more normal day here on the western front. I crouch in my dugout with my buddy Hanz; we have a picture of glorious Kaiser Wilhelm captioned, ""Gott Mit Uns!"" hanging on the wall. I stroke his majestic waxed moustache for good luck. The whistle blows. Stuffing the picture in my jacket, I leap over the top with Hanz following right behind me.      There is a boom. I am showered in a torrent of blood as Hanz is blown apart by a mortar round directly to the sternum. Lying on the ground with most of his ribs and vital organs nowhere to be seen, Hanz shouts, ""Nice mortar!"". In the distance, I hear a Brit shout back, ""Thanks mate!"". RIP Hanz. Nevertheless, I charge on right at the baguette twirling Poilu, who, glass of wine in one hand, white flag in the other, cry ""Mon Dieu!"" as I jump into the trench and begin skewering them for Der Kaiser. All surrender. None survive. The incest-ridden Tommies are coming now. One shouts, ""Oii! It be 6'bong ya git! That's tea time, you damn hun!"" and he fires his Lee Enfield at me. Not being of superior German quality like my Ruhr made Gewehr, the bullet invariably bounces off my Pickelhaulbe and kills the Canadian's goaly. I then take a shot and blow all of the crooked teeth out of the Brit's mouth. The Canadians are mad that their goaly's dead though, so they run at me hockey sticks drawn, shouting, ""Eh! You hoser! You ruined our game, eh!"" Sadly, most, drunk on maple syrup, trip on the slippery ice and crack their skulls. Those that make it to me begin to beat me with their hockey sticks. I feel numb. Then, all is white. All is quite. Der Kaiser reaches his hand out to  me and I take it. I have no fear for Der Kaiser is with me now. Der Kaiser sees all. Der Kaiser hears all. Der Kaiser is all. Heil Der Kaiser!-=November 11th, 1918=-NEWS FROM THE FRONT:     Germany's forces prevail as the French all surrender and the British swim back home to watch soccer, using their teeth to carve boats out of trees. The Canadians summarily abandoned their posts and beat each other to death after a controversial hockey game. German boots beat on the streets of Paris! Heil Der Kaiser!			"

												A few days prior to seeing Verdun on the Holiday Sale, my friends and I were discussing the lack of any WWI shooters available on the market. When I saw this game on the Steam listing, it was like seeing our discussion come to life. With the historical aspects of the Great War as well as the cooperative aspects one looks for in a multiplayer game, Verdun has reached every expection I set when discussion the ""hypothetical"" WWI shooter. The squad system allows for extremely balanced gameplay in addition to promoting teamwork. Furthermore, the in-game mechanics revolving around trench warfare allow for a sort of ""flow"" not present in most multiplayer games. Overall, grab a few friends (3+ for maximum efficiency) and have fun travelling back about 100 years to fight alongside others in one of the best multiplayer games I've played in a long time.			"

												Verdun is a blast to play. It's not like most games where you just run and gun and those with the quickest reflexes win every time. Each kill is a thrill because you spend time sneaking up into a good position with cover and fire support. Half the time, the enemy doesn't know what hit them. Or you don't know what hit you.The game mechanics sound a bit limiting at first but they channel you into the type of warfare that Verdun is supposed to model -- gritty, dirty, muddy, freezing cold trench warfare. You feel the helpless vulnerability while slogging through open muddy land, and it's a relief to drop into the relative safety of a sodden trench. Most matches are quite evenly played, too, so the auto-balancing system is well developed.The only downsides are that there is an occasional crash and it's a little confusing for the first couple matches. Once you get the hang of it, though, this is a solid game to have in your Steam library and play regularly. "

								Before we get into the details, I want to say that this game is still in beta, with more content and bug fixes promised to be coming. With that said, Verdun is still a very fun and addicting game. The weapons are accurate for the time, so if you do not like bolt action rifles, this may not be the game for you. The gamemode frontline is unique in the way that you alternate from being on the offense and defense, and this simulates WW1 very well. Overall, this game is a great addition to anyone's game library, and it has the potential to get even better, so get it now before the price increases.			"

												Verdun is excellent WW1 FPS game and its for sure my favourite history war shooting game ever. Graphics is very good and atmosphere is perfect. Maps are great and for every map there is historical explanations about battle whos going on there. Game have options for ""gore"", so when its On it shows the bloody picture of the war what is big plus for the game effect, and that makes body parts to be all over place after bomb or mortar explodes, when you shoot some soldier he starts screaming like in Chivarly medival warfare, here just a bit longer etc.. Game have 72 types of weapons what includes rifles, pistols, machineguns, bombs, mortars, poison gases etc.Its based on trench warfare what gameplay makes static in some sort of Red Orchestra 2. There are 3 game mods and a co-op modes based on hold the ground against AI. Developers are still working on the game and recently they release (for free ofc,) new pack what game makes even more exciting. Also after sometime they release updates for the game for imprvements.Community is great, mostly nice and chill people. There is no co*ksucki*g little ♥♥♥*s who f*ck your mom every match.Things I dont like in this game is there are still some minor bugs. Biggest issue what I experienced, but very rarely, maybe 2 times, that weapon disappears from your hands and you are disabled to do anything except walking. But in the end game is playable and awesome.Like I said, gameplay is statical warfare. If you are some fast jump shooting killer player guy who dont like old guns SPECIFICALLY bolt-action rifles, then its better for your wallet and your nervers to skip this beauty. In this game many dies, A LOT. But you never know, maybe when you start playing it you may like it, so besides this review play some youtube video about gameplay of the game.			"

It tries offer trench warfare and does to some success. I think that's why the game has a unique taste and why I enjoy it, I haven't seen any other game offer this different perspective before. My only problem with the game at the minute are the servers. I recieve lots of lag and jumpyness from other players and slow reaction time.

Verdun is the only WW1 fps game I have ever seen. The attention to detail that was put into the game is incredible. The historical accuracy is great; the maps and guns awesome. I love using the old rifles. And now they added gas. The gas added a whole new aspect to the game. The squad gameplay in the frontlines mode is great and keeps the game organized. One thing that I think that they should add is the ability to create a squad for a specific map. One thing they could also do is have all the rifles unlocked in rifle deathmatch, I'm sure that would get a lot more people to play it.

												Do you like the idea of Call of Duty, but hate the execution?  Do you like to mindlessly kill hordes of people, but think that all the other games that provide that experience suck?  Well Verdun is for you!  I have had this game for about 5 months now, and while it is not a game you put hundreds of hours into in that span of time, it is a great game to play casually in some down time.  I have only recently actually played it with friends, as the game was on sale and they finally bought it, and it is an even better experience!  The game is so addictive and immersive that you begin using callouts and other advanced strategies, no matter whether you wanted to or were conscious of the action or not.  Highly addictive, great fun alone, and an unimaginably awesome time with friends.  Solid 10/10, and there aren't even that many maps or guns, and it doesn't matter at all.  There could be 1 gun and 3 maps, and this game would still be 10/10.  Gameplay is amazing, and there are so many awesome moments that at times this game puts Battlefield to shame.  Must buy, especially on sale.  Would rather buy 4 more copies of this game for no reason than ever buy another Call of Duty in my life, because this game is so worth it.			"

Though it's a Early Access and the Developers promised fixing these kind of issues(The developers work really hard on this game and keep it up to date everytime they can).Such as in Real Life all the nations have different equipments and weapons. Each one with unique traits, fire rating, modifications, firepower, etc. Thing is sometimes the fight will be unfair deppending on what kind of situation you are, and that is how the game was meant to be played. You must develop a strategy and try to use all your resources against the enemy(such as Gas, Mortar Support, and Artillery Support). This game involve some strategy and of course some good reflexes.NOTE: If you have played games like Red Orchestra/Rising Storm before You'll be familiarized with the kind of action you will encounter in this game.And Lastly and MOST IMPORTANT of all!

Though it's a Early Access and the Developers promised fixing these kind of issues(The developers work really hard on this game and keep it up to date everytime they can).Such as in Real Life all the nations have different equipments and weapons. Each one with unique traits, fire rating, modifications, firepower, etc. Thing is sometimes the fight will be unfair deppending on what kind of situation you are, and that is how the game was meant to be played. You must develop a strategy and try to use all your resources against the enemy(such as Gas, Mortar Support, and Artillery Support). This game involve some strategy and of course some good reflexes.NOTE: If you have played games like Red Orchestra/Rising Storm before You'll be familiarized with the kind of action you will encounter in this game.And Lastly and MOST IMPORTANT of all! Have Fun!			"

								Put yer iPad Lytes down and listen up, kids. This game is in Early Access (at the time of writing) and has already managed to impress me by doing WW1 FPS well. I ran into very few bugs. It handles well and is fun IF you're prepared to communicate and work as a team. The graphics are good, but once again the game is not finished and not an AAA movie-budget game. Besides, the graphics should not put you off Verdun at all. The price might put you off, but it's worth it even at this stage.In short, it's good. If you're a Red Orchestra 2 fan, then chances are you'll like this. "

												This game is really fun. If you're decent with a bolt action rifle and want an immersive WW1 FPS complete with artillery, mustard gas, revolver mounted bayonets, trench clubs, a class system complete with level up and great scenery if you like rubble, mud, burnt shattered trees under a beautiful sky and men with mustaches. You will love this game.There's nothing like correctly sneaking into the enemy trenchline and murdering them one by one while convincing your teammates to sneak in and help take the line. Or getting caught out the open when a retreat order is called and scrambling back to your own trench. To defend, or defending a key point, only to lose all your vision to mustard gas and putting on a gas mask and getting claustrophobic and paranoid because your vision is limited and anyone can come out or into the gas cloud to kill you.

								A fresh take on the FPS, Verdun takes you into the trenches of World War I where players will experience the brutality and frustrations of trench warfare in squad elements. Bolt action rifles and machine guns dominate the battlefield, while mortar rounds and recon planes whistle and whine above. It's the only WWI game I know and the game is constantly updated.

								Verdun is probably the current World War 1 FPS Game i would really say is highly recommended. It has the thing in it that makes players feel like were really in the great war. But so far as ive played through out the months of beta and research. The MG-08/15 is still missing the Bipod and lack of firing speed also goes for the chauchat with its low speed of fire. but everything else is just fine. As a player in his review i highly recommend to this game producers to please add vehicles/destructive terrain/usable artillary/naval battle to improve combat experience. For example Battlefield with all its destructive weapons usable in combat, do not change anything else considered up and running. Conclusion is to the question should i buy it? YES you should.			"

								Verdun is something fresh in the FPS market. While there are AAA titles like Battlefield and COD going on, all set with their ACOG sights and HOLO sights and Ergo grips and other tacticool crap on their automatic weapons, there is Verdun. Verdun is a game set in the First World War, also known as the Great War. There aren't any fancy sights, or getting a mag emptied on somebody and not killing them, or airstrikes and tanks. Instead, there are bolt actions, early machine guns, and semi-automatic pistols. Even though this game is in Early Access, and has some bugs here and there, this game is a blast and has a lot of potential in future updates. In addition, the group of three devs have done more work on this game than some entire companies do on their game, and it shows in the quality.  If you want to finally play a game that is in WWI and authentic, then get this game.			"

								This is not only the greatest WW1 FPS ever made (yes, I'm aware the list is short), but it is also a fantastic attack/defend squad-based shooter.While still in beta (getting better with every update), the gameplay is beautiful. Nothing feels more rewarding than getting a lung-shot (1 hit kill with those) from over 200 meters away all while accounting for bullet drop and velocity (lead your target!).There are very minor graphical glitches than can occur, but overall it looks and feels fantastic. If this is how good it is pre-release, it's going to be one hell of an addictive shooter once fully completed and polished.A must buy for anyone who enjoys squad-based shooters and wishes to experience a sense of nostalgia no other game out can produce.Get it and enjoy the feelings of victory, frustration, excitement, surprise, and thrill of the kill all at once.A definite buy!

												UPDATED : Logged for almost 970 Hours now and still find this game really enjoyable, even finally joined a clan for my continous support for playing Verdun. This game IMHO would be destined to be somewhat Semi-realistic version of the upcoming BF1 AAA-title and most probably enjoy the similar success to their counterparts, the RO series. If you really like fast-paced, detailed and historically correct weapons and loadouts, you will definitely join the ranks in no time :)Pro's:1. Authentic weapons and loadouts, somewhat really detailed models and audio is still WiP.2. Main selling point of this game is still one of the game mode : Frontlines. Tug of War type of battle, different pace it offers from certain attacking/defending phase is really awesome IMO.3. New weapons have been rolled out! Horrors of War DLC has been a huge success and you should try the Wex (Flamethrowers) to roast some ""Baguettes"" ^^4. New Game mode: Squad Defence. Agains hundreds of AI hordes when defending your trench, how long will you survive? ;)4. Although it's been released for some time now, Devs have been working on new Spectator Mode, Audio updates, collaborating with Othais from C&R Arsenal, and probably tournaments as well!Con's:1. Lack of Guides and Tips for new players. So make sure you follow your NCO in the trenches and communicate with team all the time to increase survivability in No Man's Land!2. Updates sometimes makes the game buggy, but thankfully Devs are on point interacting with the community lately to smooth out the transitions in Unity Engine.Hope you can get  a clear idea what the game looks like now and I'll see you in the trenches ^^finally after 75+ hours or so playing this game, I can give this a thumbs up review. If you like WW1 or history of it in general, you should buy this game immediately :)Pros :1. Rifles, Uniforms, and some of the audio is really authentic2. Best game mode: Frontlines. Changing of pace between 'campy' in defence and suddenly enemy breach your trench and you shouting to ur mates, typing like crazy.. one of the best feeling playing this game or on attack when u try infiltrate the flanks and try to clear their trench.. Verdun you did good :)3, FREE DLC!!Cons:1. Some of the movement and MG placement are glitchy, but hey, look at F1 2015 in comparison :))2. The fact you are still reading this review. Go buy it, for god sake! :D "

												Seems like lately their patches have broken the game more than fixed it. Heavy FPS drops, join bugs that require you to try rejoin or exit out the game completely to get it to work, bad hitboxes, invisible objects at a distance. It's a mess. The melee system is also atrocious, that uses a sort of auto aim system which simply turns into who ever clicks first or the fastest wins. There are melee specific classes and the best method of actually using that weapon is if you lay prone around a corner and wait to hit someone in the cankles to kill them.Also there's no friendly fire on. Meaning there's no need to be careful to rain massive amounts of artillery on your own squad to shield them from the enemy, or care for where you spam grenade and machine gun fire.			"

												It is day 16 of the attack, the Jerries are attacking taking immense losses but the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s keep on coming, slowly forcing us back. But we know if we surrender we will be shot for cowardice....Then comes the gas. It rains down from above, as I scramble to put my gas mask on I see others around me are not as fast and slowly succumb to the horrific gas from above. After the gas the enemy starts to pour into our trench for one more push. I shoot 3 as they scramble in but 4 more take their place. I try to reload but it is no use, one turns to me and stabs me through the chest, and as I lay dying in the muddy trench that has been my hell of a home all I can think is this is a pointless way to die...

												WOW! What can I say!The atmosphere and reality of WW I is absolutely incredible. If you have watched the WWI scenes in Downtown Abbey and other WWI series/movies, you really understand what these ""kids"" yes they were young, went thru.It was so cool to see a large map showing the War and the battles where real players in squads are deployed.Although, i am not sure just what else it does other than showing what squads are deployed and where.There is also a ""unlock"" system where the more XP you earn playing the more different weapons and uniforms you get.Really makes you feel part of the larger effort and meaningful.When you first start playing you really feel like a conscript...a new green soldier, as you have not yet gotten used to the game and its environs.Moreover, you are afraid to get out of the trench... you are afraid to lift your head up, you are afraid to move.And just like in real life as you get more accustomed and experienced your situational awareness gets better and you actually begin to peer out from the trench, move, attack out of the trench etc.And also get your first kill.This game is not like other FPS games, you will think and learn about WWI trench warefare and as you do you will get better.Barbed wire does what it was supposed to, i.e. tangle up poor guys so you can shoot them...but it can be your friend also keep ing the enemy from bayonetting you or getting to close to you.Exploding shells and chemical attacks are a threat and the game tells you what color the gas is, thus indicating what it is.So put that gas mask on!Just as human nature will be, you sometimes cannot resist and run that extra few feet to another crater for cover, or pop your head up for a look one too many times or for too long....and bang you get hit.Human instinct and learning does take over and you learn and feel that just right moment to duck.It is quite amazing and realistic to say the least.

												Trigger warning: may contain observations and opinions that hurt feels.Updated almost two and a half months later after playing again recently.Also the comments section is not there to waste my time discussing every little detail. This review is there for potential customers who have never played Verdun. Enjoy being ignored if you feel like flamebaiting or trolling.TLDR: 6,5/10. Good, but not great. Very atmospheric game with lots of undeveloped potential that has issues. So a red thumb because Steam forces me to be black and white like that.I feel strongly about this game and I really used to like it, so that is why I write this as a warning for potential buyers and as constructive criticism toward the developers. The positive reviews show many people ""want"" this only WW1 MP FPS available today to be good and so do I, but I am at a point where the bad outweighs the good. This game has tons of atmosphere and potential but it is being dragged down by some of its flaws. You can read several reviews citing poor optimisation, no spawn protection getting you in a loop of being spawnkilled over and over again, clunky controls etc. that are also correct. But these are my personal five reasons that mar my enjoyment of this game to the point of not being able to really recommend it anymore in descending order of annoyance.- glitchy weirdness, exploiting or worse in PvP: in a significant portion of sessions I have played, for instance an invincible guy around level five with two hours on the counter or with a similar profile joins and starts killing people who are hiding wherever they are on the map, not a single shot missed at high rates of fire. They end up with K:D scores like 55:0 against people level 80 and above. This game also lacks vote kick options so you are left with people who use exploits or such cheats for as many matches as they wish to stay. One option that does not explain everything my regular squad of four has seen is that these people are using low graphical quality settings and terrain clipping exploits. One example of the other mysteries that remain unsolved to this day is how players who are perfectly hiding at the bottom of a trench with no enemies around get shot from far away through ground and sandbags. Update: friend with 275 hours showed me footage of aimbotting (immobile player making stab kills in the distance) post-summer sale...- nonsensical spawns: I am not even talking about the lack of spawn protection, rather there are circumstances where you have to defend a trench and the game decides to spawn you about a 100 m away from it and you have to run through a stretch of no man's land that has no cover whatsoever to attack the trench you are supposed to defend. That is not what defence or holding your ground means. Yes, that also means GG because the opponents can mow you down with impunity.- classes and weapons: some are clearly meant to be under- or overpowered. The German side has very few portable MGs that take too awkwardly long to set up and to be effective except for heavily prepared and dug in defence scenarios, and all of their rifles have only five rounds (Entente usually eight to ten). While this is historically correct, it is very annoying to see there is no balance when confronted with Entente soldiers that can fire basically all MGs like the Lewis, Chauchat and BAR while running, they have an OP semi automatic rifle and do not need to reload as much. Reloading can be deadly because it is an awkward procedure that is harder to interrupt than in other FPS I have played.Some classes are not even assigned a firarm which I feel is a poor choice. A source of minor annoyance is that you cannot pick up dropped weapons or restock on ammunition (but you typically do not live long enough to run out of it).- silly suicides: instead of invisible walls some games have added a warning system with or without a timer to return back to the zone the game wants you to be in. In Verdun not getting back to the zone in time instantly kills you and the game says it is a suicide that costs you XP. I have noticed these timers often are too short to get back to the map. I have also charged at the beginning of matches into the right part of no man's land only to discover I am getting suicided.- bots in coop: they teleport. One moment they are thirty meters in front of you, the next they respawn next to you in the trench and stab you. Obviously at this point the coop mode is relatively new, in general has very rough edges and needs work. Update over two months later: flying, teleporting, invisible bots and invisible weapons galore. This mode still needs work unfortunately.Positive bit: - We can hope these things will change because the game is still actively being supported and expanded. But for now if you ask me with the things I have mentioned: thumbs down for the current state of the game which tends to annoy or frustrate just a tad too often.			"

												This game is not finished. If it is, then the developers simply do not know how to make a game. Major issues for me:Spawn-killing. This is majorly ♥♥♥♥ing frustrating. On several maps you can be killed a second after spawn by a player with an MG or Sniper Rifle. This is extremely frustrating, especially when your entire team spawns back at the same time and then all get killed a second later by an MG.The game has massive problems with lag. I've not played a game without someone jumping around all laggy. It happens too often with too normal ping observed for it to be the players problem.The hitboxes seem kind of wonky, coupled with the lag make it frustrating when you clearly hit someone only to have them lag-teleport elsewhere. Even without the lag I find shots that clearly hit not even registing a hit.The character class system is annoying and damages the WW1 asthetic. There are 16 players per side. There are 16 classes per side, for a totaly of 32. All are different. Most lack basic things like grenades or a bayonet. Only one person can play a class at a time, so you can't have most people playing a grenadier - likely you would just have 2-3 per team. It's needlessly complicated, especially when each squad has a different uniform representing a different nation so you have to learn 8 different infantry uniforms and 8 different officer uniforms.There are problems with the terrain. I don't know what causes it, it's certainly not my computer, but the terrain will only partially loads in. It's not a draw distance thing, because terrain behind it loads in perfectly. But I see a dude's head pop-over a hill, shoot it, only to find I get nothing by the bullet-hits-ground effect. Sure enough, I take a few steps forward and the hill in between use loads a foot higher than it was, and that's what was seperating us.See through terrain, related to the previous point. You can't shoot through it.Barbwire is handled poorly. One small contact with your leg starts killing you. I've been killed without realizing I'm caught  on any because it was so small that I didn't even see it. Also, jumping over it is a waste. Apparently stepping on with thick army boots won't stop it from tearing your flesh? It could've been handled better is my point.Game feel. There is next to none. No sloshy mud, no soldiers cussing as they reload, no screaming deathrattles, no weather, no nothing. It feels like an empty, quite world devoid of anything that makes me feel like I'm part of it.There are other issues, but I can't recall them right now. I'll update if I remember anything new.I feel like the developers are lying when they said this game was out of beta and finish. I feel ripped off because the game is clearly not finished or polished. I feel you would be better off saving your money. "

												Verdun, though not yet fully released, is a WW1 fps which offers satisfying and challenging gameplay individually and as a squad member. Tactics reflect Western Front reality - frontal assaults - so some may find that limiting. The devs are doing a good job of refining an already solid game.If you like RO2, there are similarities which would merit your taking a look at Verdun.THE GAME HAS BEEN RELEASED A LONG TIME NOW. The graphics and performance has greatly improved making it much more satisfying to play. There are now some highly experienced and competernt players who know every inch of the maps. Consequently, this game can only be described as ""hardcore"" , newcomers especially will have to invest a good amount of time and effort to become familiar with the game.Squadplay is rewarding and frustrating in equal measures at times. Deathmatch is satsisfying especially when there is a fair balance between rambos and campers to mix things up!Verdun is the best WW1 fps available; you will die a helluva lot before you become the scalp-taker everyone falls to!  :)Highly recommended especially if you like investing time to develop the skills required by the game!

								This game has great potential. The genre is virtually untapped in FPS (I vaguely remember a poor WW1 mod for the original Half-Life) and I hope it continues it's current trend. It's already come on leaps and bounds since I purchased it.Really good for a bit of bolt-action fun. Unlike DoD Source, Red Orchestra/Rising Storm or a ""rule-based"" Battlefield 3/4 server, no ♥♥♥♥ can suddenly pull a G18 or L85A2 out and auto your face off.Only gripe at the minute is there would appear to be either some poor match making or a lack of servers. I'm on high-speed fibre with at worst a ping of 20-40 but there are often players with pings of upto 300-450. I really think this could do with some attention.Would certainly recommend for anyone who likes a skillfull shooter and is prepared to watch a game develop in the long run.			"

												Verdun is not like other World War Shooters, because Verdun is actually like a World War. In this case, WWI. That means instead of running around with a silly knife performing ridiculous acrobatic feats and stabbing enemies to death, or wading into battle with an improbably configured, heavily accessorized gun, you'll be crawling across a shattered, shell-pocked wasteland for minutes on end without seeing the enemy, only to get blown up by a lucky mortar shell or find yourself spotted and taken out by a machine gunner. Because that's how WWI was. You'll use the actual weapons fighting men were issued, and their lethality will be accurate— one good hit from a rifle round and you're done. Because that's how WWI was. You'll force a bloody foothold and eventually sweep an enemy trench clean, only to have to defend it from counterattack moments later to hold the few meters you've taken. Because that's how WWI was.For a relatively little-known shooter, Verdun is impressive— the take-and-hold dynamic of its gameplay is unique and challenging, rewarding lots of different skills and battlefield roles from combat to command. The environments are well designed and evocative, there's period-accurate gear, squads, and dialog. Gameplay is fun and fluid. Teamwork garners great rewards; a single good officer can effectively win a game if the enemy team doesn't have coordination to match and he's got a cooperative squad under him.In terms of cons: the squad level up dynamic can be a bit inaccessible and those who figure it out tend to have a strong advantage, but it doesn't tip the game too badly. Team coordination sadly lacks, possibly weighed down by the somewhat dated automated dialog system of pressing a series of numbers to autotype important phrases; teamwork might be easier if there were a better way to mark up the map, but any HUD elements or ""radar"" components would also hurt the organic feel of the game, so it's a bit of being stuck between a rock and a hard place from a dev's perspective, I reckon. I find that the trenches don't end up being used as heavily as one might think; I wonder if this has to do with the way the game is designed or the limitations of scale that online gameplay imposes. The only true complaint I have about Verdun is that I want it to be so much more; if you've ever read Sniping in France you know the crucial roles that intelligence gathering, sapping, and trench raids played in the war, and you also find yourself wishing you could try out the trench mortars and artillery pieces scattered around the map. The scale of the war is also sometimes missing, the charges through the creeping barrage, the whistles blowing men over the top. The developer has bult a wonderful foundation which has the potential to become a market-changing game given the chance.			"

								At first, its very punishing for new players. Really easy to die if you are not experienced in this kind of games. But when you get the hang of it, the game is amazing. Really good graphs, sounds and maps in general. Although it lacks some stuff, its really worth your money and when it comes in the full version it will be epic. By the way, they really need to fix hat thing when bullets fly through the enemy and nothing happens, i shot a guy 6 times with my gun and he headshot me right after. Really frustrating but at least this happens rearly. (maybe its a hack)			"

												This game perfectly captures the various aspects of World War I in a manner that is both realistic and fun.  The graphics, while not the best, are quite good for an indie game, and while the UI might not look impressive, it does its job well.  All the different classes and weapons are very well balanced against one another, and the maps offer as much variety in scenery and gameplay as is possible given its setting.  It's gameplay mechanics recreate the back and forth of trench warfare in a manner that doesn't feel forced, and gameplay offers a stark contrast in engagements, either sniping across no-man's-land, where machine guns and rifles dominate, or the savage close quarters trench combat in which pistols and grenades excel.  The only real problem the game suffers from is optimization issues, with lower framerates and higher ping that is to be expected.  However, the developers have done quite a bit to fix this issue, reducing its severity and scope to the point of a minor, occasional annoyance.  In my opinion, this is probably the best shooter obtainable for $20 on Steam, and is well worth its asking price.  I wholeheartedly recommend this game, but feel free to look at more recent gameplay videos to assess its character, and make sure to read the Official Steam Guide to ensure that you understand some of its less-explained mechanics.

								This game is in beta and needs help.  If you've ever wanted a Great War FPS then this game needs your support.  It has a lot of potential, but needs a lot of work.The attack and defend system in this game is perfect for the back and forth battle for the trenches. I am excited for more content.If you have a lot of patience with the fledgling player community and a very buggy beta, I think you can find a lot to enjoy in this game.July 29 Edit:There has been a lot of hard work done on this game.  As an added bonus, it's on sale for 33 per cent off!  It costs less than seven dollars and a huge influx of players have arrived.That said, the game gets progressively better and better with each update.  There are nicer visual models, smoother gameplay, and constant bug fixes.  With more players, it has a better feel of the great war.  I highly, highly recommend this game.			"

								This is by far the best World War 1 first person shooter. It is very realistic, for example: with the rifle most shots are 1 shot kill, you can get caught in barbed wire, you get to attack and if you don't gain any ground you have to retreat and then the enemy counter-attacks and you have to defend. Overall a great game as long as the developers can get the glitches, freezes, and bugs under control.			"

								I absolutley love this game, I play it anytime I can. there are a few bugs but then again the game is still in beta so im sure those will be worked out. i have a few suggestions such as more maps! but maps that are dedicated to a specific role, such as sniping, trench on trench, or all out war(combination of all roles). if you could also put in some more historically accurate maps such as vimmy ridge, or paschendale(both canadian) i would be the happiest soldier on the frontline there ever could be, i also noticed that some people were having trouble with screen-shots. and possibly a player to player chat or some kind of chat filter. Even though the general community is currently great to play with. When the game starts to get bigger and bigger, the chat is going to become more and more painful to read. Some more personal requests are character customization, and possibly a create your own class gamemode, where players chose the weapons and perks they use, but only in one gamemode, the rest of the game should remain the way it is. In conclusion, this is honestly the best game i have ever played, and im sure that it is just going to get better and better. A large thank you to the developeers and steam for greenlighting this gameP.S. please try to incorperate some of my ideas			"

								What can I say beside The Civil War, I always wanted a WW1 game. Yes this game may have some annoying glitches still. But the concept and the gameplay are fun. I have maybe only have had a handful of games where they was a clear victor. The rest where virtual stalemates, and there is nothing worng with that. I knew taking a trench line was hard as hell, but I wasnt ready for the reality that would you be lucky to hold out long enough to fully clear and capture that trench. Its a great shooter, with some trerain bug fixes, and some optimization this game can only get better. Do i recomend this? Yes awesome experience. Well worth the money I paid. If you play this game come in with your eyes open and see its real potential.			"

												This game is by far one of the most imersive FPS shooters out there.  Put on a pair of headphones, and within five minutes, you will feel yourself actually ducking from bullets and artillery.  The gameplay works well, albeit it may take a while to get used to the specifics.  The only complaint I have so far is I didn't quite grasp how to actually get an MG playing as the Gunner class when I first started.  You have to select it and spend a point whilst in a match to unlock it.  Some may consider it a waste of a point, but considering most classes, with their upgrades are simply to a different rifle, there isnt much else to spend it on.  Add in that you get quite a good ammount at the start and each time you level up, you'll have the wepons to match your style in no time.  Can't wait for the future updates!Currently, 9/10.			"

												This is a great change from the shooters we have been receiving recently. Where as other games are taking a futuristic approach to war with advanced technology and skills, Verdun takes you back to the early 1900's with an authentic feeling WWI feel. Currently there are 2 different game modes to choose from, Frontlines, which is a squad based, team oriented game of capture the trench. In this game mode you must push the opposing team back out and away from their current holding and claim it as your own, or else they will be doing the pushing. The unique aspect of playing Frontlines is the aspect of attack and defend, and how it is handled as the rounds play out. If your team loses their hold on the trench, you are required to fall back to the previous trench and defend from there, hoping not to take a bullet in the back upon retreat. The active objective trench acts as a boundary where both sides can enter and fight for the claim by having more soldiers present (unless teams are unbalanced, this is compensated for). Teamwork is a MUST for a squad/team to succeed.The other game type is a free-for-all Rifle Deathmatch, which it just what it sounds like. There are no worries of someone out-gunning you simply because they have bought a better gun or other concerns. Rifle Deathmatch is a true test of skills where everyone has a bolt action rifle, the same amount of ammo, and no individual has an upper-hand based on what you have in-game. There are some options, such as, the type of rifle (all authentic era styles) and very basic attachments. Would you rather have a bayonet for a 1-hit-kill melee, or perhaps a ranged scope for better distance shots? There are pros and cons to either choice.All-in-all I rate this game very highly, and would recommend it to anyone and everyone who enjoys the FPS genre, it's a good change from the fast-paced shoot'em ups we have become accustomed to			"

												This will be my first in depth review of a game so fasten your seatbelts.Verdun is one of the best games I have ever played (no joke) the WW1 authenticity matched with FPS mixes to create a fantastic batch of awesome. This game is a must buy for WW1 history buffs. Weapons are modelled to be historically accurate to the counterparts. One of the best parts of the game is the immersive trench gameplay, you could be in the muddy hills, rain creating muddy puddles and boddies stained with blood and gore around you. Or you could be in mountainous terrain charging up hill as fire rains from above you, these moments make the game. The game also features a blood and gore mod which just enriches the gameplay further. The game explores all aspects of WW1 from guns and gas to the terrain and conditions. If you are either a fan of, 1.) FPS which are semi-challenging or 2.) A WW1/2 fan, this game is for you! The gameplay is fluid and feels good and the satisfaction is so high when you kill someone! The suppression system makes you feel like you are really under fire, and the weapons have a great feel. However there is one thing that may deter players, that is the repeative deaths. Yes this game is in WW1 and WW1 featured many massacres across no mans land, so does this game. You will constantly die in this game and if that bugs you an astronomical amount, that may take away from the game, however if it doesn't really bug you then this only enriches the satifation of eventually making it into the enemy trench and going bezerk on those Jerrys. So In Summary, if you are a fan of FPS's and can put up with a few deaths or a huge WW1 history buff (like I am) do yourself a favour and BUY THIS GAME!!!!			"

												An amazing game with both depth and innovative gameplay unlike any other that you will find. Rather than change the events to fit a set framework for a game, the devs have produced a squad based game thta is cohesive and where the benefits of proper squad play are substantial and intrinsic, whilst also being fun. I want to play this game to death, and really wish there were more plays to play with. That is not to say the community isn't great: most people are responsive and helpful, with little to no players to ruin the gameplay. This is definitely a niche, and may be hard for some at first, but after sinking in some time and little bit of effort one can become adjusted. The game has no scorestreaks and is very hard for one person to comletely own the game, easpecially in the signature ""Frontlines"" mode, which adds to the balance. Even dying a lot can still be fun, as much of the game is about strategy and tactics, along with communication: where to push, when to push, when to call in covering artillery, where to place machine gunners, where to place the NCOs for effective spawning, etc, while unlocking classes is neither grindy or arduous, taking much of the extra time and though out with set classes. Overall I wish the graphics and/or look were a little bit better, otherwise this is an all round great game, especially when played with a friend.			"

								Gamers of all strokes will find a role to enjoy in Verdun. Strategic movement is rewarded, and teamwork emphasized with the in game spawning mechanics. There are times where you will hear the whistle, stand up to leave the trench, and immediately collapse from a rifle shot. It only makes the final push more satisfactory. You may especially enjoy the back and forth dynamic, as defending and assaulting are quite different experiences. Performance during the waves dictates attackers/defenders respawn times and wave duration, rewarding a team which is able to efficiently elliminate many enemies. I would label this a 'Tactical FPS' though it lacks the typically strong learning curve of such games.			"

Personally I really like how the assault/defend phases work in the team mode and there is a real feeling of teamwork and coordination.Free updates have been promised also, which is very commendable in 2015.Oh and bullets actually kill people.. its not arcade style, so thats a huge plus.2016 edit: feels like youre getting shot behind cover, you can be sitting in a trench totally safe and some guy across the field kills you. Then it happens 20x, to your entire squad.I searched ""shot behind cover"" on the forums and there are a lot of complaints about this, back to 2014. I had the game uninstalled for a long time, and had just reinstalled it. Felt frustrated, this doesnt happen on other games, I know the difference between something like this and RO where you may just not have seen some guy in the bushes, but this is perfectly in a foxhole or w.e and being shot in the head when your head is 4 feet below the top.

Early Access Review
								For so long I had longed for a WWI shooter, and felt resigned to the fact that it would never happen because it was simply too difficult a setting to translate into a compelling video game. Then Verdun was released and changed everything. This $17 game is worth more than the last three $60 COD games.  It has a totally unique squad based system which can allow you and your friends to work as a cohesive unit. The gameplay is a refreshing kind of brutal where not keeping your head down will almost always result in your death. Objective battles are fantastic, and the ffa mode is one of the funnest i've ever played. In short, if you're looking for a unique shooter that is fun and won't break the bank, you've found it.			"

								Verdun is a multiplayer FPS, but unlike other games this one is set in WWI which gives it a different style. It isn't about running and gunning. The basis of the game is to attack and defend trenches which is very important, When the enemy attacks, the defenders must defend. This means that players must play the objective which doesn't always happen in games.An important aspect of the game is that it is based around squads. Each player is in a squad and each member of that squad has different skills. Each squad also has an NCO who issues orders. Players are rewarded for working with their squad which increases the squad level and unlocks new equipment.Overall this is a very fun game with a largely ignored setting but that is very interesting.

												Game is well done, maps have a lot of detail, battles give you a good feeling of being a soldier in battle during WW1 on the Western Front.  The organization of the game is interesting.  You can join of up to any of the 4 squads on each side during a multilayer game, each squad has 4 men with various skills.Few things I wish were added.  For example, why not being able to control some of those early tanks (like in Red Orchestra 1 or 2), what about being able to fly planes?  What about mud and flooded trenches?  I haven't played enough to tell but it appears the game does not have too many maps yet.  Where are the tunnels of WW1?Overall though the game is a must have for anyone who enjoyed playing Red Orchestra games, or similar historic oriented 3D shooters.			"

												This game, is absolutely amazing.While not exclusively in Verdun, It's literally THE Best WW1 game I've ever played. Which to be honest isn't really saying much because there are only few I can really mention right now. Sadly other developers of games think it's a boring time to make games, which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to me, being deeply interested in the timeframe and the history behind all of the nations. But It's a very great game nonetheless. It has mechanics that absolutely match the setting of the game, 1 hit from a rifle means you're most likley going to die, although 2 shots that means you're lucky and just stay in cover and hopefully your ally can save you or the enemy who shot you gets distracted or something. There are 3 mechanics that make it one of my favourite games I've played this year...1- Bullet mechanicsAs I've mentioned bullets do extreme amounts of damage and you can't just go run out in the open like Rambo/CoD style like a retard, however there is also bullet drop in the game, along with the foggening of the screen and more of a dark tunnel when being shot at rather jelly blood literally being thrown at your face when bein shot, which adds more of the WW1 feel about being in a trench. Which makes a Pistol really deadly in a trench, and a machine gun a beast when shooting at attackers, and the rifle is a good weapon to use all around depending on how you use it2- Atmosphere/Map designAs well a prior statement, however with this I mean by when your running through the trenches, it makes mud sounds when running through them, and even makes it awesome when artillery fires on it and you need to duck and cover from it or you will 99% of the time die. However, No mans land is even more awesome to run through durring an assault on the enemy trench, because you have to worry about barbed wire ripping your legs apart and being left on the field for dead, or using artillery craters as cover because small abandoned, unfinished trenches can't guide you the whole way. Another reason not to run out as a retard rambo/4 Year old CoD player.3- Chemical Warfare UseMy Personal favourite part of the game is the fact that there is different gasses used such as mustard gas, or chlorine gas on the battlefield against your enemies or at you and your allies. What really makes it interesting is that you can go through it so long as you have your gas mask on and you aren't being currently shot at. It doesn't even just come and go also, it stays and lingers the area of impact for about 3-4 minutes and if you die and spawn in it, you need to get your mask on fast or you will certainly die. It's not scripted on each map thankfully, there are special units that can call it in like calling in artillery or commanding squad members, so it will either appear multiple times in one battle or none at all.  That's really on your own opinion whether it's bad or good though.And that's really it, I got the game the day before I made this review, and I think it's better than most of the CoD's combined already. Other than it being a WW1 game, the 3 game mechanics are the best I've seen in a long while. So I highly recommend this game for the stated reasons. The only problems I've seen so far is the body mechanics on when people die, and the melee weapons are a bit overranged, like a small shiv can reach like an officers sword which is strange. But nonetheless this is the greatest WW1 shooter ever made in my opinion. I hope the're a lot of people who agree with me and I don't doubt it at all, considering the countless of positive reviews aside from mine. Final Rating: 9/10 for Verdun			"

												This is a wonderful little shooter. It isn't polished to within an inch of its life, it's a bit janky here and there, and it can most definitely feel very unfair sometimes. What it does very successfully is create an atmosphere of verisimilitude that allows for what seems to me like a rare thing: a game that is simultaneously historically faithful and mechanically satisfying, with a main multiplayer mode that roots the action in a tangible objective, simulating the back-and-forth of trench warfare as best it can. Again, it's not perfect by a long shot, but compared with other, more generic shooters, this feels full of personality.			"

								In it's current state it's unpolished and clunky, but surprisingly responsive and playable. There is a good deal of response on the rifles and after your first few games you can see a lot of depth and potential to the game. This game has some potential for the future, but if you are turned off by non-AAA shooter titles you might not be interested in it just yet.

												First and foremost: You are going to die. There is no point in trying to deny that in this game. You will be shot at, blown to bits, stabbed, hacked at, cut down by wire, mauled by a blunt weapon or cut open with a trench spade. This game is brutal. You will feel some kind of shell shock when french 75ers rain down on you and your squad. You will grasp quickly for that ""4"" button when gas comes up. You will hate yourself for not reloading properly and having no round in the chamber in a pitched situation. This game is gloomy , dark and unforgiving. The maps are brilliantly orchestrated to only allow a few tactics that almost always end with hundreds of deaths by you and your teammates. I've seen pros complaining and yelling about the unfairness of the game. Men and women with hundreds of hours on their record. If you get hit by a bullet, you'll most likely die. One hit, one death. No mercy. So why do I do this? Because it's supposed to be like that! WW1 is everything but a nice place. This game gives you a glimpse into that dark, unforgiving time. Into the trenches and back out again.But is it fun? Oh yes! Tactics are limited, but must be performed in great accuracy. You can  outmaneuver the enemy if you play it right. You can be the hero of your squad or team by being the first in the enemy trench, spitting them with your Rosalie because you have no time to reload. You can stop a whole team with a well places MG 08/15 or some SMLEs in the right place. You can kill 5-7 people at once with a nice mortar hit. But in the end, it's your squad and your team that you have to rely on. They as a whole decide if they attack or if the are dead. This is no game for people to sit in their favorite spot. This is a game in which you have to attack. Or you'll die. Oh … and die you will.  "

												Verdun is the best WW1 shooter we currently have. Capturing and defending trenches is exhilarating, atmospheric and as you can imagine slightly depressing. Eduring a high level artillery barrage is a highly memorable experience. Unfortunately the game has some major drawbacks. The controls are somewhat clunky and the sound design needs major improvements, especially artillery sounds. Communication from the developer is fairly non-existant, although small updates and fixes do arrive fairly frequently, but silently.The biggest drawback is the absolutely toxic festering community of high level players and clan-boys. Expect to hear childlike phrases such as ""git-gud"" repeated at you endlessly, with sporadic pointless arguments in chat. The overall voice is that of the braindead ""gamer-teen"" stereotype. Members of clans such as '{lp} les poilus' or {pirates} also have really disgusting attitudes and the game suffers severe balance issues at times due to abuse of the flawed co-op XP system that allows people who play together frequently for many months to have certain gameplay advantages.I absolutely loved the game for a few months, it definitely fills a void in the gaming scene and can be really enjoyable. Lately however I don't recommend this game, the developers don't do enough to keep it fresh or encourage a good-spirited community. The lack of official forums is huge downside aswell.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  This game has a bug causes server disconnects for some players.  If you are one of the unfortunate players to be affected by this bug, you will be always be disconnected from any and all servers, game types, and maps in under 30 seconds of joining a match.  This bug, which renders the software from a game according to a reasonable interpation of a game into nothing more than semi-interactive menus with music, loading screens with music, and very brief glimpses of other people having fun.  The developers are aware of this issue and have gone from saying they are working on it to a position that because they are not getting as many people reporting the issue that it must be fixed on their end despite the fact that each game update they send out changes the average time to disconnect bug, and are now blaming the issue on end user firewall, router, and internet issues without providing requested information that would allow an end user to troubleshoot connection issues on their end.  Because of this known issue even though I like the idea of a world war 1 first person shooter, I cannot recommend buying this game.  This do not buy this game recommendation would have been removed if the issue had been fixed before exiting early access and if the developers had not repeatedly removed discussions on these issues.  For those of you who encounter this issue and are unable to play this game, I recommend you join me in asking for the issue to be fixed or refunds for the purchase price be given.			"

Early Access Review
								Verdun is a bloody spectacular game. It includes a large reliance on social, objective, and challenging game mechanics which the game has fused together solidly. The objectives in the game are completely based on the capture or defence of trenches, which can only be done by teamwork.Teamwork is the main focus of the game, with squads of four players cooperating as a subsection of the team, where two opposing armies fight in trench warfare. As a social basis, the reliance on teamwork forces leadership and forces cooperation between the players, which also forces people to restrain themselves from the general tendancy of anonymous gamers to ♥♥♥♥♥ and to spend their entire time complaining (excepting situations in which this is justified).Teamwork means that the squads are engaging and helpful, noobs (as long as they are willing to learn) are accepted as future functioning members of the squad—with people ordering or recommending courses of action. The influence of social and objective considerations is only possible with a challenge, something brought by the fact that in this game, one bullet means death. This is not a CoD or TF2 clone in which your player character can absorb an entire clip without dying. This ups the stakes and forces teamwork, coupled with the game's 'desertion' mechanic, which means that players are where they should be.The developers did a good job in balancing the game, though there are still issues in it, where maps are unbalanced and a lack of a tutorial means that noobs proliferate. Yet, for an early access game in open beta—this is a spectacularly done job. Verdun's developers listen to the community, and the game itself is spectacularly engaging, something I heartily recommend for anyone to add to their steam library.Other than percieved balance issues, there is one issue to the game which I feel cannot be overlooked. There is a web-client available for free on Kongregrate. While this is used to 1) fill the servers, 2) promote the game, and 3) draw people in—I myself was drawn in from the web-client, the presence of a web-client means that you can try the full game for free. I feel there should be more limitations on the web-client; and for a game in open beta, with only about 200 regular players, this is acceptable.			"

												After only 9 hours of playing Verdun I can safely say its an incredable game and its still only in early beta stages. The game is divided into two different modes FRONTLINE is squads of four guys attacking trenches and trying to take them from the enemy you have 5-6 minutes to attack then you must defend for around that amount of time. Each class plays a great role in this game the riflemen pushes into the trench trying to take it the sniper kills with range and in my experience are the most deadly players the commanders or whatever you call them are greta being able to order strikes on weak points and call in morter strikes to sometimes great effects as for the machine gunner I have never seen anyone use it to great effect so I can't say anything about it. The tactics for FRONTLINE revolve around using your whole squad in a combined attack but since their is no voice chat yet this rarely happens ^^. As of now there is only four maps Picardee Vossges arrgonne and I always forget the last one they are all fairly fun to play on although I must admit Picardie is the most fun ;). The next form of game mode is RIFLE DEATHMATCH no not the crappy COD kind really nice FFA bolt-action rifle greatness no killstreaks and crap just good old fashioned fun. You get to pick one rifle you want to unlock and you get that you level it up and get new things. Moving on to the community I FREAKING LOVE THE COMMUNITY ON THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Almost everyone in game and on the forums are incredably nice and helpful people offering new players tips and very rarely bad mouthing ( you notice I said rarely it does happen ;) ). I go on the forums vcet players ask me to play with them and they'd give me pointers really nice people online. Probably the funnest people on Verdun are the history buffs I love history and watching these people talk about French battle tactics ETC ETC ETC... is really fun and enjoyable. Moving on to Graphics how are they you ask? They are good I would tell you I myself don't care for graphics as long as the game is fun but I have to say the game is rather good looking the guns are well detailed and look amazing the facial textures and models are terrible but who cares when the gameplay is so fun. The graphics option menu has a bevy yes bevy of graphics optins which is very nice. Over all as a person who usually detests FPS games I find this game very enjoyable it has very few bugs that I have noticed there are a few graphics glitchs but these are rare, And what bugs there are a quickly being fixed by the amazing developers I have looked at posts of when this first came out in alpha and it was terrible but since then the three devs yes only three have worked hard adding new things and fixing bugs making this game very enjoyable. Overall I think this is the bet WW1 shooter your gonna find anywhere and I highly reccomend it to anyone even if you dislike FPS games like me I think you might enjoy this nice game. I hate giving scores but that what most people want but I won't because this is only a BETA everything I say might change in three days in a new patch so I won't bother to give it an overall score till it officially launchs but I still highly reccomend this game anyway I'm out have fun dying to snipers and the OP commander pistols PEACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!EDIT: Game released yesterday and its amazing. Haven't played it since August of 2014. The graphics, gameplay, and new features all add a lot to the game. Totally worth buying at full price. Only early access I have seen that is this loved by its devs.			"

								Except for CS, this is the only FPS game I will play. Not only is it a beautiful game but It is great fun to play. There is also a real skill aspect to the game with shooting bolt action rifles. You need to make sure you hit the first shot or you can be at a real disadvantage. I've been waiting for a good trench warfare game for ages and I'm glad that is has finally come.			"

								I have played this game for a long time now and started to really like its style. The game has historically had many updates and good ones at that. Weapons are fairly accurate. Squads are fairly accurate. But sadly players will not be.  There is a high spike in learning how to play quickly. Train your eyes. I do have to give it a terrible side though. Even though I said the updates had been good. The most recent update has ruined my experiance. I used to be able to 11:1 KD but now due to changes that I believe are meant to attempt wear and tear realism. The game has frustrated me. I often find myself wanting to quit.			"

Early Access Review
								Verdun is a bloody spectacular game. It includes a large reliance on social, objective, and challenging game mechanics which the game has fused together solidly. The objectives in the game are completely based on the capture or defence of trenches, which can only be done by teamwork.Teamwork is the main focus of the game, with squads of four players cooperating as a subsection of the team, where two opposing armies fight in trench warfare. As a social basis, the reliance on teamwork forces leadership and forces cooperation between the players, which also forces people to restrain themselves from the general tendancy of anonymous gamers to ♥♥♥♥♥ and to spend their entire time complaining (excepting situations in which this is justified).Teamwork means that the squads are engaging and helpful, noobs (as long as they are willing to learn) are accepted as future functioning members of the squad—with people ordering or recommending courses of action. The influence of social and objective considerations is only possible with a challenge, something brought by the fact that in this game, one bullet means death. This is not a CoD or TF2 clone in which your player character can absorb an entire clip without dying. This ups the stakes and forces teamwork, coupled with the game's 'desertion' mechanic, which means that players are where they should be.The developers did a good job in balancing the game, though there are still issues in it, where maps are unbalanced and a lack of a tutorial means that noobs proliferate. Yet, for an early access game in open beta—this is a spectacularly done job. Verdun's developers listen to the community, and the game itself is spectacularly engaging, something I heartily recommend for anyone to add to their steam library.Other than percieved balance issues, there is one issue to the game which I feel cannot be overlooked. There is a web-client available for free on Kongregrate. While this is used to 1) fill the servers, 2) promote the game, and 3) draw people in—I myself was drawn in from the web-client, the presence of a web-client means that you can try the full game for free. I feel there should be more limitations on the web-client; and for a game in open beta, with only about 200 regular players, this is acceptable.			"

												Well-polished game that's definitely worth the $20. The weapons are lethal, which means that cover, tactical thinking, and teamwork are essential to succeeding. The gameplay feels very well-balanced, and the squad system is impressive compared to other FPS games. The maps are pretty diverse too, ranging from lush forests to apocalyptic landscapes. Don't forget to turn on some of the post-processing effects!			"

												Not like most FPS games, you need to focus on positioning and teamwork in this game rather than running in and getting killed (which will happen a lot). That said, kills are very satisfying and the abilities/weapons each squadmember has make it pretty cool too.Grab this game if you want a realistic WW1 game, if you can't handle the idea that you'll probably die to gas, barbed wire, invisible snipers etc. then just keep being a cheeky scrub. If you want a challenging but rewarding FPS, get it!!			"

Early Access Review
								Verdun is that special game that you will proably not see something like it for a long time if at all.The Game is set in WW1 and is an FPS, the setting is nice and hardly ever done. Something I wish other games explored. The game tries to do its best to fit the setting. With songs from the era playing in the menu and people shouting in German and French as Mortar Shells and Rifles sound thorugh the battle.Now gameplay wise the game is very simple. It's a squad based FPS. With 4 men squads consisting of 1 Officers and 3 Troops each with it's own specializations, unlocks and weapons difrent for each type of squad and each faction. The battles play out in a push defend way. One side attacks, the other defends if the attack succedes the other team has to push the enemy out if it fails they get to counter attack.Gun play is very simple but yet fun. The game is set in WW1 so Most people Run around with a Rifle with the exception of MG's and Officers. You aim, fire and bolt. Repeat till you kill someone or have to reload then repeat the proccess till you are killed. The game adds flavour to this by adding Bayonets, Scopes and Grenades even Pistols to some Classes and Types of Soliders. All in all I found the gun play fun and entertaining.Now on the bad side.Graphics are mediocre. This doesn't bother me as in my PoV the gameplay makes up for it.Sounds are mediocre as well but at least the weapons sound well enough.Maps are repetitive so far but this is understandble as the game is Early Access.Like any Early Access Game bugs are there and there isn't enough bug spray.But over all the game has potential it is fun and you can clearly see what the devs want to develop this game into. But this game is not even half way finished. I would recomend you get it on sale or keep an eye out for the game to be fully released but as it stands at 20 Euro's its not worth it. Potential is there but there is not enough value at the moment for that price. "

								Don't be fooled to thinking it's a bland FPS. Get this, it actually uses alot of tactical strategy,so there's balance and limitation. This isn't a bland a circle jerk FPS like most are,but a game of alternating objectives of capturing and defending in a single round. There's no running ahead before you hold you post for the objective amount of time,and attacking requires planning every foot step. Sprinting hole to hole trying not to get shot while giving supporting fire. There's also different squad types,and specified classes. All of the clases are fun to play,and they play an important purpose of their own.			"

								It's a fun shooter and does a good job representing the WWI style. Games can go on for quite some time depending on how skilled each side is. The only problem is when you get stuck in a role you hate as each squad can only have one of each soldier type. I only really play it in small doses but each time I have a lot of fun. Not the prettiest game as of yet but it's only in Beta however they are still working on it and it shows. Still some bugs and annoying times where you can't turn properly for no discernable reason but totally worth checking out.Also if you wan't I recall this game being free to play in the browser however the difference between that version and this are huge at this point.

								When a game is Indie, some people think the game is not so good. When a game is at beta stage, some people think the game is not so good yet. Verdun is an Idie game at beta stage, and no matter what you think, the game is just great. Of course it has some glitches, and things to be improved, fixed or removed, but anyway, the game is just great. It like the only FPS game I've played about WWI (except for BF1918, but that was a mod). It is like some old shooters with bolt action rifles and one shot-one kill, but with an objective and squad based gameplay. As you can imagine, the main weapons are bolt action rifles, but there are also some other stuff like pistols, machine guns, grenades and mortar/artillery strikes. It makes you feel, when shooting with rifles, if you don't kill an enemy with this shot or if you miss, he is going to kill you. And it is usually that way. Sometimes it can be frustrating, when attacking an enemy trench and not being able to capture it, just like WWI, but it doesn't represent the horrors of trench warfare.There is only one thing I don't like: there are too few players for a such a great game.

												Verdun is a wonderfully addictive game. The trench warfare is authentic, the environments feel real, and the experience is always enjoyable. No matter how well you do in a match, it is entertaining enough to run around in the trenches of World War One. I could easily say Verdun is one of my favorite games.Unfortunately, the game is far from perfect. The amount of glitches and inconveniences greatly diminishes the experience. Trying to join a friend's squad can sometimes send you to a seperate match. Trying to make your own squad can kick you out of the game. The leveling system is complicated and there is no explanation for it. It is hard to figure out and remember which squad does what without reading a few extensive guides. While charing across no-man's land you sometimes teleport around, ruining your advance. Some parts of the maps are angled awkwardly, causing clunky movement. The ""hold your breath"" system is pretty much the only way to aim well, but it hardly lasts long, is loud and annoying, and makes it harder to aim when you're done. The map rotation can send you on an endless loop of Champagne and Douaumont and never include certain maps like Flanders.There are so many other downsides that I didn't name here, and they all become very annoying when trying to play successfully. With more improvement, and I sure hope the devs get on it, this game could be even better than it already is.			"

								How many other World War I games are out there? The answer, my friends, is not many. While Verdun is still a major work in progress, it's definately worth your dollar, thanks to it's unique setting and gameplay. Simple to learn but difficult to master, gunplay in Verdun is immensely satisfying, a feat considering how frustrating the game could have been made instead. Despite the WWI setting, the game does still feel a bit too ""run and gun"" at times, but is very entertaining overall.			"

And it does the time period in a very good way.Trench war is displayed very realistically, and most of the guns kill in one shot, so poke your head out too early and bam, you're dead.The main game mode is called ""Frontlines"" which pretty much is, attack the enemy trench on command, and if that doesnt work, retreat and defend your own trench line from the enemy counter-attack.There are several factions in the game, with their voices very well done, as well as the weaponry of the time.And if You happen to get bored of the frontlines, you can always hop in for some bolt-action rifle free-for-all deathmatch, like in good old CoD1 or 2.Also, there are few minor bugs within the game,  mostly being sometimes really awful hit-detection.Pros- Very original idea about bringing WWI to a shooter.- Realistic trench combat- Squad based gameplay that favours bold squadplay.- Very well done weapons from the era.- Several Factions- Mostly, fun and enjoyable maps.Cons- Sometimes awful hit detection- Master server sometimes gets very ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, making it impossible to find a match.But in total summary, the game is a strong 8+/10. I'd recommend it for everyone that likes a bit more serious shooter, with a large emphasis on team and squadplay and cooperation.			"

												A wonderful first person shooter set in the first world war. It also incorporates some of the elements that made the Western Front such a gruesome spectacle. Prepare to be executed if you go against the current order (Attack or Defend) and to be rewarded for staying with your non-comissioned-officer. If you don't mind spending time waiting in trenches or trying to find the one path that is not being locked down by the enemy defenders you will enjoy this game!			"

								In time of writing this the game is still in Early Access. So its hard to judge if it is going to be good, but I´ll look forward to it. It is really great, there are no kills where you feel ""cheated"". However, there is no singleplayer and in time of writing this no bots either, but I don´t mind it. The guns feel very good and there´s a leveling system which gets you to keep playing, but you´re not underpowered if you´re level 1.Overall I´d recommend this game to anyone who has no problem with the learning curve.

												Very fun and enjoyable game, even for a new player! I just got it today and really have no idea how to do much of anything beyond shoot and move, but I have had the most fun in an FPS for the last 2 hours than most of the other FPS games I've played recently. Tactics matter; aim matters; cover and concealment matter; orders to your squad when you're the Corporal matter. It's a total blast and I can't wait to learn more and experience the different weapons soon. Great maps, great balance, Bought 3 copies for my friends even, just so I can squad with friends, but even strangers were a blast. THIS GAME IS A WINNER!!!!			"

												I've been playing Verdun since shortly after it appeared as an Early Access game on Steam, and while I have written a review for this game before, I decided that with the game being fully released, I should update it.Verdun is a squad based World War I shooter. There are four members to a squad and four squads per side (Germany and the Entente (currently the game only focuses on the Western Front.) Both sides take turns attacking and defending their trenches, and the side the takes the most ground will win.Throughout my time playing this game, I have seen many complaints about the difficulty of this game and how they are nothing but cannon fodder for experienced players. Unfortunately, the game does not have level based matchmaking (it would be impossible with the player counts as they are,) and so as a new player you will face off against veteran players. But, while initially this could be very difficult for new players to handle, most players are using the same (or similar) weapons, and once you learn how to use those weapons, you will be at an level playing field with veterans.This game has glitches and other stability issues, but overall is a beauty. You will die, a lot, but that is to be expected from a game about the trenches of the Great War. I would recommend giving Verdun a shot (pun intended) as it is a unique FPS experience.			"

												You wake up to find yourself in a war thorn land. Today is the day we charge and finally take up that enemy position. You hear whistles and run along with dozens of your battle comrades. Upon leaving the trench they start dropping like flies. All you can hear are bullets, grenades and occasional war cries. You see your friends falling one by one, running to their death. You are not brave. You crawl from a hole to a hole like a rat but alive one. You are so close to getting to that enemy position. Suddenly you see a nasty looking gas, obviously you won't go there so you try the other side. Machine gun starts opening fire killing what few of your battle brothers remained. You run back into the gas, barely putting the mask before suffocating. You can't see anything but you keep crawling, only mere steps from reaching the goal. The enemy is well etrenched but suddenly you see your commanding officer, bravely ordering the artillery before succumbing to numerous bullets. Enemy position is being heavily bombarded, you can hear screaming and suffering even though it is in a language completely foreign to you. You finally enter the enemy trench, a sole survivor of this great assault. The destiny lies in your hands. You start moving towards the center, first enemy activates a grenade and hurls it towards you. Alas, the grenade hits the cerade and bounces back to that ill fortuned soldier killing him instantly. You praise your luck and continue with the advance. God is with you, you feel invicible, you made it until the very end. Clock starts ticking, victory is so close. You hold your rifle with all your might and look for any incoming enemies. You hide in and try to set up an ambush, holding your breath and steading your rifle hearing your heart beating rapidly. Finally, an enemy soldier appears. All that hatred and suffering directed into a single shot. All that dramatic tension that has been building has been concentrated in a bullet. You, a mere private, can save the day and end this pointless war. You take the shot. You miss. You know it's end of the line for you. It was.If a game can inspire you to write something like this, you know they have done a very good job. Immersion this game provides is one of a kind. Truly unique experience.			"

												I started following Verdun back in 2011, when I first discovered it. Back then, it was thought to be Dead, Leo having moved on. All the footage we had was a short, soundless demo. The forums were nearly dead. But then in 2013 something magical happened - It came back to life. There was a free Alpha, which was of the rifle deathmatch mode. It was fun, but showed SO much had to be done. And since then, so much has. This game is a tense, quasi-realistic FPS set in WWI, and as a WWI buff it has my seal of approval. It's fun, especially with friends. Playing with friends allows you to level up your squad together, and thus have access to newer uniforms, slight stat increases, and increased firepower (deadlier gas, more arty, etc...). Seriously, this game needs and deserves more players. Buy it!			"

												Did not enjoy. Camper's delight. Poke your head out of a trench and you'll be killed while trying to scan for enemies. Seems like everyone has a scoped gun (except me).... Large learning curve to this game, so it's not clear how squad progression works, how to play as a squad leader, unlock things (like a scope), etc. Iron sights help with accuracy but not effective at zooming into targets, so enemies are extremely small and hard to hit at a distance without a scope. Adding to this, it's not immediately clear who your enemies are. Extremely slow-paced tactical shooter, so shooting, movement, and reload speeds, while realistic, take ages. While this works for this genre, it can be extremely frustrating due to the campy nature of this game. There's a huge skill gap here. I'm not terrible at FPS games but find it easy to go sometimes 5 minutes or more without a single kill, meanwhile there are players with 30 or more kills.Graphically this game is much too dark without the HDR option checked and/or a brightness/gamma bump. Even then enemies are still hard to see. Most maps comprised of extremely muddy gray and brown tones. Wanted to like this game but it's getting uninstalled. "

												While the game itself has promise and I love the theme of the game I cannot support it at this time.  The tutorial if you can call it that is exceptionally useless in actually instructingyou on how to play the game.  It gives you no useful information with which to see how to make any kind of decisions about what to do.  Furthermore when I went to the steam forums to seek help in attempting to learn how to play I got almost exclusively negative commentary about it.  ""Just go in the game and run around"" or ""Watch the tutroial noob"" or other unhelpful and confrontational comments.  Even after making my own cheatsheet of the keyboard commands for the game and attempting to not just immediately die I was frustrated to no end by the fact that I cannot identify who is friendly and who is not.  While this could be a fabulous game it is not due to the issues mentioned above, a wasted of whatever I paid to get it.			"

												The game really doesn't deliver the experience that was shown in the trailer. For me at least all i've played so far has been poor, it doesn't matter if you are good at these sort of games or a newcomer, you will most likely find this game frustrating.There are some good parts, for example; The maps feel authentic.The weapons feel realistic and sound good.Everthing in the game is too its time setting.Graphical quality is great.That however is all the good i have to say about the game. The bad points really show more than the good and are more likley to take your attention of the good points. Here are the things in the game i take issue with;No matter where you get shot, one hit means dead.Spawn killing is a big issue.The battles are spread thin and doesn't capture the true nature of the war.Gameplay is very slow.The only way you can get from one play to another without dying is going prone. (Even so you will still die a lot)Iron-sights for the most part are useless.etc.. etc..I wouldn't recommend this game at all especially if you are thinking of getting it at its full price. I got this on sale and it still doesn't feel worse the £9 i spent on it.			"

												SO, Verdun the game.Well let me start off with mechanics.The game feels VERY clumsy to new players and that because it is, you can barely see the sight post on your first rifle and the guns take up more than half you screen when aiming down said sights.Melee is also pretty broken, when you stab or hit someone there is a split second lag before it registers that you hit them, so the animation for your bayonet or club going into their gut shows up, BUT they onew shot you anyway, and you didnt even get a hitmarker.Also, dont even TRY to use the melee system without using a bayonet as they are all two hit kills or more and like i said the melee system is extremely slow and buggy.Then we can move onto new player friendlyness, there are no hints to start with and you basically have to learn how to use Artillery Binocs on your own, which did take me a bit to figure out because i had to check the key binds.Another thing is that just like WW1 everything on the battle field is cluttered and strewn about, making it very easy for campers to just lay down in no mans land and snipe your team one by one if they peak above the trench.Graphics and player models look solid colored and saturated which gives the game an unfinished feeling and look which gives the game a sort of open beta feelingDuring my first few hours i was playing i was actually thinking that.""Wow this is all very buggy, hah look at the dying animation, he just glitches into the ground while his limbs wriggled around his body and crunched into the floor....i wonder when the next update is...?""But no despite numerous connectivity problems for EU and other country players besides US, a buggy melee system and bullet lag system weird unfinished looking graphics and player animations in first and third person THE GAME IS THE FINAL PRODUCT, THERE WILL BE NO UPDATES FIXING THESE PROBLEMS.One more thing is team balancing.Im sure you all remember the issue with TF2 team autobalance happeining when it wasnt neccesary, and then the mistake of Valve of removing auto balance all together causing some teams of 7 or 8 to go up against a full 16 player enemy team that refuses to even out the teams just so they could stomp the team with less players.Well that repeats itself here in verdun, and it happens ALL the time.Teams of 6 to 9 players will go up against a full enemy team making it a one sided slaughter.All in all the game had a lot of hype but was extremely dissapointing in a lot of ways.It can be quite fun but after all the problems listed here the game really just starts to be annoying.I even regularly get 16 or more kills per game but honestly you pulling your weight in this game doesnt ultimately contribute to a win, because your team got killed off by a German team full of level 80's to 100's that pushed you back 4 trenches before holding them in place.Veteran players simply take advantage of a less experienced team with almost half as many players as their team.Like i said though it can be fun but you want to avoid servers that arent atleast part way full.TLDR: The game feels unfinished, not forgiving to new players and very buggy with alot of connectivity issues for non US players (im a US player but my friends have alot of issues with it) and can only be sparingly fun if the teams are even and have the same amount of experienced players.

												Verdun is one of the most unique FPS games I have ever played. It truly feels like trench warfare, as being careful and strategic are the ways to victory, not simply running and gunning. The level of detail in this game is amazing, from the weapons, to the environments, and even the hobnails on the soldiers' boots.

												I was an American grenadier, carrying two hand grenades and a Springfield m1917 rifle without a bayonet.  Gas shells landed in our trench, shoving our squad into the field as we struggled to smash our '4' buttons and put on our gas masks.  We charged the enemy pillbox, a German with a machinegun cut down our squadleader and rifleman, leaving our own gunner and myself to finish the job.My friendly gunner used his BAR to lay down suppressive fire on the German position, spraying down multiple enemies from the hip, giving me the time I needed to throw both of my grenades at the entrance of their pillbox.  I heard two explosions, and the screams of the dying enemy machinegunner.  I looked back to check on my comrade, but he had been cut down by enemy rifle fire, so I finished the sprint into the enemy pillbox.  No enemies were inside, yet I knew they were near, finishing off whatever remained of my brothers in arms.  I crouched down and pointed my rifle towards the entrance of the pillbox.The barrel of a Gewehr 98 poked into the doorway, followed by the German wielding it.  Ready, I took my shot and killed him instantly with a clean hit to the chest.  Just as I finished cycling the bolt, another enemy ran in, my next bullet killed him just like the last.  Realizing that an entire squad was entering the pillbox, I began to smash my left mouse button, firing and cycling a new round in as quickly as I could, missing once and killing two more enemies as they entered.  The last man to enter caught me out of ammo, so I charged him and bashed his face in the butt of my rifle, ending him in two clean hits.  All four men were dead or dying on the floor.  The sight of their bodies thrashing around and the sounds they made as they died haunted me, so I took a second before heading back to reload.Just as I slipped a new clip into my rifle, a German officer sprinted through the door, leaping over the pile of his dead squadmates.    He fired his c96 at me, but there was little I could do, so I jumped twice before catching three rounds with my torso.  I promptly died, ready and waiting to be reunited with my fallen squadmates, in approximately twelve seconds, assuming there was no balance timer.10/10 game, more virtual PTSD than ro2 imo			"

												Verdun is the greatest World War game since Medal of Honor in my opinion. While it is simplistic in nature, its mechanics and weapons are on point. Nothing like getting through 4 of the 5 bullets in your bolt action rifle's clip and knowing you need to reload, but also that you may not have time before another foe comes around the corner of the position you are looking at.I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a classic shooter and people who have squad goals.

												Verdun. Has a very nice atmosphere to the game and is fun to play with friends. Everything is pretty balanced as far as the eye can see. You got your different squads, each one different from the other. You unlock specializations with carrier points you get from leveling up. And your level depends on the abilities you get in the squad. It's all so dandy!There is one problem though, the network connection. Sometimes whilst playing I will take 3 shots at someones head or torso with a pistol or a rifle and they don't die, they take a shot at me and I fall flat on the ground dead. That can occur and if you have a short temper, maybe you shouldn't play this to often. I just rub it off as one of those every once and awhile problems and keep playing.Overall, if you like old fashioned combat like this here. I recommend this!			"

												 Being a bit too interested in history I went under the ""Historical"" tab for the Steam Store and one of the first games popping up was Verdun. It was literally the only WWI game in there, so I decided to buy it around June of 2015. I was instantly hooked. It was something about the classic WWI experience of artillery and machine guns spawn camping that I somehow enjoyed. I couldn't bear looking at my KD/R. I was still determined to Git Gud. At around 200-300 hours clocked in I felt like I was getting much better at the game, as it has a very steep learning curve. Being Level 100 doesn't really mean anything. I thought I would enjoy the game more, and I did, but now almost every match I would get a bit ticked off. After learning how to actually get across No Man's Land, there is nothing worse than a MG scrub camping on the floor of the trench through the bodies of his comrades. Or the randomly called mortar strikes that seem more like homing missiles. The best way to help is just playing with friends as they can help call out the MGs or other inconveniences preventing you from going 200 and 0 like a god. Also, a feature of Verdun that I truly enjoy is the squad leveling system. The game basically rewards you for playing with friends by upgrading your tear gas to mustard gas, or your puny mortar strike into a creeping barrage of 75mm. Verdun has numerous bugs that can be a bit irritating like hitbox issues and graphical bugs, (New ones pop up and old ones disappear with each update) some of which are actually kind of funny like a head growing to the size of a hot-air balloon after a headshot. My feelings are very mixed for this game, but there is nothing else like Verdun in terms of a realistic WWI shooter game. This game has really grown on me for the past year, and I feel like it deserves a thumbs-up from somebody with 900+ hours in it			"

												A fresh experience if you are in to shooters. The Frontlines game mode is the cream of the crop, while the others (rifle deathmatch, co-op, etc) are otherwise insignificant. Despite this however, there is a good amount of content and, while there isn't a huge amount of maps, there is replay value in playing with 11 different squads, with 4 different classes per squad, and of those there are 3 variations of kit.I could mention other things, such as the squad levelling system affecting squad bonuses as well as the SL abilities and the uniform your troops are equipped with, but ill keep this brief: I bought this for £15 when it was on sale in Early Access, however I can recommend it for the current price point now that it is full release (plus the recent expansion) and I can safely say this has been one of my best purchases I have made from EA. Absolutely superb.			"

								AWESOME GAME! I LOVE IT!I find this game more fun than any of the Call of Duty's. It's mostly trench warfare with snipers and such but you can get close and use a pistol. I played this game once before and I didn't enjoy it nearly at all because I didn't understand as much, but i'm happpy I gave it another chance.Although, there is things that need to be fixed because this game is in alpha. I haven't noticed much besides that fact that when you die, there is ALOT of frame drop. There is alot of weapons besides that you could use though, making this game alot of fun. You play in squads and can rank them up as well as yourself making this game alot more fun if you play with friends. Hope this helped!			"

												I was at first kind of mixed about purchasing this game, but after playing it for only 20 minutes, I am in love with it!I've seen many complaints from some of the negative comments and my conclusion is that this game is not for everyone.  For all of you that love CoD or games that are constantly in action where you just run around and spray people, Verdun is not like that at all.  For all of you that love Battlefield type games, Verdun is similar in that squad based gameplay encourages people to always use strategy to find the best way to attack.  Another complaint I've seen is that you die fast, and to answer that is that it is true, you do die REALLY fast if you don't use a strategy.  People cannot just run around and spray people or else you're dead meat.  But that is because the game is incredibly realistic.  Damage is very realistic as well where any hit you take from a rifle instantly kills you, pistols and machine gun fire can kill you in about two or three hits.  Like I said before, you do die EXTREMELY fast if people decide to run around without a strategy.Another positive is that the game changes from large battlefield shootouts to close quarters gameplay quickly.  Sometime's you will be defending your trench and are trying to pick off enemies all the way across the battlefield in the opposing team trench.  Sometimes you are clearing out a trench and are surrounded by enemies.  To conclude, if you are someone that loves realism and strategy based teamwork, this game is definitely for you!! For those of you CoD players who love running around and spraying, this game is definitely too slow for you.			"

								This game is a lot of fun. As a beta it doesn't look the greatest and has a few bugs. That being said, this game being made by 3 or 4 guys is a huge accomplishment. I think I can only recommend this game for anyone who enjoys WWI history. The gameplay is different from most games. there are only one or two automatic weapons in the game. most weapons are bolt action rifles and one or two shot kills. I would describe it as a super linear capture the point game where you will move up on sets of trenches to try and capture them and then defend against a counter attack. It is fun to attack the trench through the no mans land populated with dead animals, barbed wire, and shell holes. It is also a lot of fun to defend from the trench. As an attacker getting a breakthrough and then pushing down the trench is thrilling, everytime you feel like a MVP. The gameplay is similar enough to otheres that you will know what to do but different enough that it'll be new. I recommend this game for fans of WWI but if your not, it is still in beta and not for everyone. This game is definitely for history buffs. I cannot wait for the final version.			"

												Verdun is a stimulating game, with a few glitches around movement and terrain clipping.It is focused around trench warfare during WW1, and the game does a great job of exhibiting this while being fun and challenging. It creates some of the most intense experiences I have had in a Multiplayer FPS.During a battle as a Landser unit (German) my buddy and I got a good rhythm and fought, crawling through withering fire into no mans land - breaking the enemy hard point, and finally entering into their trenches... Only to be laid into by a massive artillery barrage that the enemy had called on to their own position... I saw my comrade at arms hit the dirt as around him my entire squad disintegrated into bloody parts flying through the air, landing in the hellish mud. This barrage of hell just barely over.. the enemy counter attacked to regain their trench... I watched as, in an instant - my battle comrade, who had survived MG fire, grenades, artillery barrages and fought through the enemy line... was killed. By a lunatic armed with a f*cking Spade.A Spade. I knew my death was imminent, but putting a bullet through the mad spade wielding, comrade killing lunatic made it all worth it.This game is hell.This game is awesome.			"

								A fun game that goes in a different direction than most shooters these days. If you are a fan of WW1 this is a game you should give a try. It stays true to the attack, try to hold, retreat or advance trench warfare tactics used in WW1. If you can not decide you can always try the free broswer version at the link below. The game includes a deathmatch mode for those who enjoy playing solo.http://www.kongregate.com/games/M2Hgames/verdun Those of you interested in the future of the game should know a real DEV was playing in one match and was eager to answer our questions and hear our suggestions. He was not just standing around talking to us either. He was shooting at enemy players with his gewehr 98 enjoying playing the game, and answering our questions. I have never seen any DEVs do this in any other game. He talked about the addition of gas to the battlefield later this summer, and the addition of more factions such as the British. His communication with us the players is something the industry has been lacking. They seem focused on making a WW1 game that players want to play and will enjoy playing.			"

								*April 13, 2014 Early Access Review* (Review will be updated when Verdun is off its beta)Verdun can be explained in one sentence. A World War I first person team-cooperative shooter with some similarities with Red Orchestra franchise in a sheer blend of fast-pace pitch battles and gunfights. Initially, I really like this game mainly because of its setting and reliance of using instincts in order to survive (like Red Orchestra). However, as I play more, the game seems a bit more like a World War I version of Call of Duty. The previous sentence sounds harsh, but it's not as bad as it sounds. While the game seems to tackle in a semi-realistic gameplay that relies on teamwork, it is unfortunate that the majority of players in the game only cares about K:D ratio and selfish ambitions. Players do not use their roles properly and the only way to win is kill the enemy players as quickly as possible in order to take enemy positions before the enemy spawns. The texture is ""alright"" and the human faces need significant improvements in terms of facial structure. So far, the community for Verdun is fairly tiny/small but the majority of players are pre-teenagers and immature players who are arrogant that may or may not lead to your team's downfall. What I dislike about Verdun the most is there is little or no teamwork, and that needs to be addressed. Strangely enough, I continue to come back and play the game mainly it has the potential to become a great World War I shooter that can be compared to World War II's Red Orchestra franchise. The game will be good if there are no arrogant players with the attitude that you see in Call of Duty and stronger emphasis on teamwork. The game has my recommendation only because of its potential to become a great game...but by a short margin due to the immaturity of the community. *Review will be updated soon*			"

												You get in the game, die 20 times to mortars, grenades, bayonettes and other ♥♥♥♥ you can't even see coming. You peek once and don't die so you peek again and get recked by 6 snipers. you see one guy with a scope, try it out and can't hit ♥♥♥♥. you spend 30% of the game shooting at guys running and missing, and then you shoot randomly and hit two. Your NCO spawns you in tear gas and you die.10/10 would play it again.			"

												I was at first kind of mixed about purchasing this game, but after playing it for only 20 minutes, I am in love with it!I've seen many complaints from some of the negative comments and my conclusion is that this game is not for everyone.  For all of you that love CoD or games that are constantly in action where you just run around and spray people, Verdun is not like that at all.  For all of you that love Battlefield type games, Verdun is similar in that squad based gameplay encourages people to always use strategy to find the best way to attack.  Another complaint I've seen is that you die fast, and to answer that is that it is true, you do die REALLY fast if you don't use a strategy.  People cannot just run around and spray people or else you're dead meat.  But that is because the game is incredibly realistic.  Damage is very realistic as well where any hit you take from a rifle instantly kills you, pistols and machine gun fire can kill you in about two or three hits.  Like I said before, you do die EXTREMELY fast if people decide to run around without a strategy.Another positive is that the game changes from large battlefield shootouts to close quarters gameplay quickly.  Sometime's you will be defending your trench and are trying to pick off enemies all the way across the battlefield in the opposing team trench.  Sometimes you are clearing out a trench and are surrounded by enemies.  To conclude, if you are someone that loves realism and strategy based teamwork, this game is definitely for you!! For those of you CoD players who love running around and spraying, this game is definitely too slow for you.			"

I for one study World War One so much that half the time I think you studdied the battles that go on in this game. After all of this work I'd really love to see something like a gunning run with airplanes. If that's not possible I understand.

												A fresh experience if you are in to shooters. The Frontlines game mode is the cream of the crop, while the others (rifle deathmatch, co-op, etc) are otherwise insignificant. Despite this however, there is a good amount of content and, while there isn't a huge amount of maps, there is replay value in playing with 11 different squads, with 4 different classes per squad, and of those there are 3 variations of kit.I could mention other things, such as the squad levelling system affecting squad bonuses as well as the SL abilities and the uniform your troops are equipped with, but ill keep this brief: I bought this for £15 when it was on sale in Early Access, however I can recommend it for the current price point now that it is full release (plus the recent expansion) and I can safely say this has been one of my best purchases I have made from EA.

								AWESOME GAME! I LOVE IT!I find this game more fun than any of the Call of Duty's. It's mostly trench warfare with snipers and such but you can get close and use a pistol. I played this game once before and I didn't enjoy it nearly at all because I didn't understand as much, but i'm happpy I gave it another chance.Although, there is things that need to be fixed because this game is in alpha. I haven't noticed much besides that fact that when you die, there is ALOT of frame drop. There is alot of weapons besides that you could use though, making this game alot of fun. You play in squads and can rank them up as well as yourself making this game alot more fun if you play with friends. Hope this helped!			"

												It may not be as fast paced or smooth as games like BF1, but it's authentic and fun. The uniforms, guns, and the main game mode all come from WWI and there's a great balance between bolt-action rifles and machine guns. If you enjoy history, indie games, or having fun I recommend it whole heartedly. (Please note the game is not perfect and can be buggy at times, but what games aren't)			"

								This game is a lot of fun. As a beta it doesn't look the greatest and has a few bugs. That being said, this game being made by 3 or 4 guys is a huge accomplishment. I think I can only recommend this game for anyone who enjoys WWI history. The gameplay is different from most games. there are only one or two automatic weapons in the game. most weapons are bolt action rifles and one or two shot kills. I would describe it as a super linear capture the point game where you will move up on sets of trenches to try and capture them and then defend against a counter attack. It is fun to attack the trench through the no mans land populated with dead animals, barbed wire, and shell holes. It is also a lot of fun to defend from the trench. As an attacker getting a breakthrough and then pushing down the trench is thrilling, everytime you feel like a MVP. The gameplay is similar enough to otheres that you will know what to do but different enough that it'll be new. I recommend this game for fans of WWI but if your not, it is still in beta and not for everyone. This game is definitely for history buffs. I cannot wait for the final version.			"

												Great game! To me every kill seems satisfying and it's just something I love to play. It's want a group of friends in game for sure. It can be frustrating at times but I think it was well worth the money. It runs pretty smooth on my older computer so I'm really pleased with this! it's a small community but everyone seems pretty laid back. No matter how far you are behind team members don't rage and its just fun. If you're new to a ""class"" or ""position"" team members or even the enemy team will help you get better at it all you have to do is ask for help!  One of my best experiences in this game was when I made it into the enemy trench, they called gas on us and charged! Most of my team was dead I was one of the few still alive in the trench, I had my gas mask on and my rifle posed and ready, then out of no where 5 guys round the corner one after the other, I have to squint to see them through the gas then I proceed  to just rack in the points mowing them down as the come around the corner, during all this I was being fired on by mortars! Was such an intense moment!			"

								Verdun is a WW1 First Person Shooter that captures the feel of the trench fighting (1914-1918). Verdun offers only a handful of maps, but they can be played differently by choosing one of the many classes the game offers. Verdun offers the ability to unlock attachments and new weaponry just by playing Verdun. The maps have fantastic detail along with the play style of the game. From Machingunner to Riflemen you'll find yourself having tons of fun playing Verdun. Overall rating: 8.5/10 "

												Fantastic game with a great community. The setting and atmosphere is perfect, all the weapons/outfits are historically accurate, and even the use of language is impressive. When you can't see them, you know the nationalities of your allies and enemies by their shouts. If you're a German and you hear French and English in your trench, you'd better get ready to fight. It's a small detail that I personally find very immersive. Brutally simple gunplay. Most weapons are bolt action rifles, and you die in one shot most of the time. I think the setting and mechanics of the game turn away cancerous ""COD-kiddy"" type players who crave killstreaks and fast paced gameplay, ludicrous guns, etc. You can usually spot them whining for 2 or 3 matches in the chat, and then never see them again. I really doubt this was intentionally done, but having these players naturally phased out dramatically improves the community. Good job, Devs!Speaking of which, the community is full of proper gentlemen, the type of guys you feel proud about capturing a trench with. The overwhelming majority of players are friendly, helpful, and non-toxic, Something nice to see in a modern FPS game.This game requires patience, and you will probably die a lot when you start playing. It plays very differently than shooters like COD or CSGO, and therefore it won't appeal to everyone. Having an interest in history also improves the experience, but definitely isn't necessary to enjoy. I think many FPS fans will appreciate this game because frankly, it's just a lot of fun.It's clear that the developers wanted to create a proper WW1 shooter, something that many people, myself included, have awaited for years. Thank you for fulfilling this wish.TL;DR: Amazing game, don't buy if impatient or diehard ""COD kiddy""Edit: Came back to play after missing it for a few months, and the community has devolved into absolute cancer.

The game is very well playable again.The mentality of most players is still that sitting in your trench will get you rewarded with the enemy trench, but that's part of the game.

												Verdun is a challenging game with a fairly steep learning curve in terms figuring out the best way to use certain squads and roles, how to move around on the map, and how to work with your team as well as the number of times you will die for reasons beyond your control.However if you stick with it, it is really fun to play.  It's rewarding to take trenches or fight back enemies, treks across no mans land are tense, and kills are very satisfying.  It does have it's glitches, and it is not well optimized but the very friendly community, nice attention to detail, and game play that aimed at thinking vs raw action make it worth it.			"

												I've been looking at the forums, and, to my amazement actually found bad reviews. To set things clear, here goes my review (700+ hours gaming time; specs are: let's just say zombie-like craptop).I admit I got this game when it was on sale, paid 7€ (9 dollars) for it. My first shooter ever and my first k/d was 1-41 on Picardie. This is one issue about the game which bugs most people: If you are new, you have to get used to the gameplay (1 hit 1 kill rifles, 1-2 hit 1 kill pistols). This usually lasts a few matches, and *zack* ""stupid game, don't buy, blah-di-blah-di-blah"".I hammered on (also because all my other games were rts and I wanted a change in terms of game genre; still.)Now I have played... a lot. Even if this game was 50 € / 54 bucks, hell yeah buy it! It will become AWESOME in the next years due to many planned updates; get it while it's still at 20.Why, you may ask.Here we go:- 90% of all the veteran players are nice and will give you tips if you don't troll around and don't camp- REALISM- Awesomly well-made maps, uniforms, weapons- cool squad system (it's better than the ad says)- unique setting- it simply won't get boring, you keep discovering new tactics- when it gets boring, an update comes- very cool graphics even on low, as my craptop would most certainly explode if I take them any higher (also, they improved a lot since I started playing this)Downsides:- for me?: none- things that might bug you: initial ""shock"" as described above (but you quickly get over it); one or two annoying bugs every now and then (such as insta-kick before you get to a game due to ""squad missing"", whatever that is); some players lag a bit.My rating: 10/10 would be lieing, it actually is 11/10. Why? I only have an understatement to answer this: it is AWESOME. (Depending on how much you hate bugs, the worst-case scenario rating is 9/10)			"

								excellent game if you like military history, even though the graphics may feel kind of arcadish, they have improved and they probably will improve until the final game is released. this is one of a kind, the only game that is kind of red orchestra/battlefield-such that you can play battles situated in world war one. currently there are only germany and france, but it is likely that great britain and some other nations will be added. it is a lot of fun to play. the first person shooter elements are definitely authentic if not the best, and there is hardly any spraying bullets in the game because most of the people are using bolt-action rifles.currently there are two kinds of squads for both germany and france: regular army squads and mountain infantry squads, there are 4 people in each squad. NCO(commander/officer), gunner, machine gunner, grenadier mountain infantry wield shorter, faster-firing rifles, better for shorter range engagements, and they have superior stamina, their officers have recon plane abilities that can reveal enemy locations on the map. regular army squads have 4 people as well but they are better for long-range engagements, their officers have mortar strike abilities.the game is set around trench warfare, you will either defend or attack a position. if you accomplish the objective, you earn a point as a team. therefore, the match scores are usually like soccer game scores.there is also a deathmatch mode where you unlock your own rifles and attachments. pros: -authentic gameplay,trench warfare-decent visuals-unique game-concerned developers, even though there is a grand total of 3 of themcons:-bugs and stuff. your progress may get reset.-certain roles are picked up by people who have absolutely no clue what they are doing...if your officer does not advance, you keep spawning on him, and you will have to walk a lot. it can get quite annoying-no automatic team balancing, you can have plenty of games where there is twice as much of the enemy,mostly french outnumbering german teams-french rifles have better sights than german rifles. thus, it is easier to hit targets with them. this causes balancing issues where most of the great players will prefer shooting with french rifles. i always play as both german and french and get kills easier with french rifles at range			"

												The BETA finally ended and the game has changed very much since it was published. I really love this game (cant play it anymore :( the graphics worked well but since an update I cant play it anymore at good graphics). But this game is great its not a pointless TDM game,your team has to capture/defend the trenches of your enemys/allies.Its a very funny game and because of that im a WW1 fan i bought it on the first days when it was on the market.But you die very fast in this game,the enemys are camping the whole day and shoot everyone in a few seconds.And if u cant breech the enemy line just call a artyllery strike and its done.Its totally worth the price, would buy it 10/10.

												You're crawling across wet stinking mud into a waterlogged shell crater while the screams of your dying teammates drown out the blast of a creeping artillery barrage, desperately hoping the hail of lead from the machine gun tearing your comrades in arms apart doesnt find you in its sights. Suddenly infront of you, an enemy soldier. He fires first, but in panic, misses you. You leap up and beat him to death with the butt of your rifle. Staggering and out of breath, you take a second to get your bearings, but behind you, you hear the shrill whistle of the Commading officer, and the call to charge. Ahead; a yellow mist wafts across the trenchline. You know it is certain death. Yet onwards you go. Through the Fire and Smoke.One of the best games I've ever played. Reminds me of the original Red Orchestra in terms of gameplay. Great Community, great developers.			"

												What can I say... the graphics on this game could be a lot better. That said I don't know of any game on steam that quite captured the essence of WW1 trench warefare, it's futility, it's brutality, it's sheer mindnumbing horror. You stay in the trench, you get an artillery round and your dead, you stick your head up to have a look, you get your head shot off, you jump out of the trench to attack across no mans land you get shot... you go the wrong way you can caught up in barded wire you get shot or die...you get the picture.... Great game... the graphics need a bit of work.. but awesome game if you feel like some self traumatisation every now and again.			"

												Fun lil trench warfare shooter. It's not quite Red Orchestra and it's definately not like COD. This game is a slower paced, semi-realistic shooter with some lovely sound and graphics to boot. The community is respectful, people tend to know what to do, and if you're a noob you likely will not be berated for it. Overall, this game reminds me of my days playing paintball with its one-shot-one-kill mechanic and having to use the land (as opposed to boxes/buildings/walls) as cover. It's hard to see enemies and if you're leaving yourself out in the open you can consider yourself as good as dead. I often find myself looking for vantage points where I can shoot a couple times and then leave as to not leave myself open to return fire. It's a tense environment, yet deceptively relaxing and not many games pull of this feeling for me.For the price, why not give it a spin? You might be pleasantly surprised.			"

								While the First World War setting gives an element of novelty to this online multiplayer shooter, what is truly innovative is the ebb and flow that is baked in to the gameplay. At any one time one side is in their trench defending, not allowed to advance towards the enemy, while the other side is in their own parallel trench being forced to run, crawl and walk over no-man's land towards their (almost) certain doom. Once the attackers reach the enemy trench it becomes a tense game of nerves as danger lurks around every corner. Succeed in capturing the trench and the enemy fall back to another; fail and you are sent back to your own trench to this time defend. In this way a map is played across a set of parallel trenches with advance and fallback, capture and defend.The first world war elements are all there - bolt action rifles, hand guns, primitive hand grenades, mustard gas & gas masks, binoculars to spy the enemy position and calling up of mortar strikes. And the maps are full of mud, duckboards, sandbags, bomb craters and burnt out tanks and crashed bi-planes - truly desolate. The sound track is full of French and German commands and cries, with whistles alerting you to your officer's commands.It's a truly innovtive game and well worth a try. Do yourself a favour and buy the multi-pack and share the love.			"

Brutal WW1 Trench Warfare experienceOne of the best FPS games I've played in a while, albeit it being not too friendly for new players, because the game is fairly difficult. A keen eye is required to play this, since most of the time you scan the environment for enemies. Classes are varied and it's tied to a ""Squad"" system, where each squad is consisted of different country soldiers and each have their own unique traits, weapons, appearance and so on. You can also rename and create squads any way you like. Also, each squad has to have one of each class. For ex: Officer, Rifleman, Machinegunner and Grenadier. This is great, because it keeps the game naturally balanced from everyone picking snipers or grenadiers. There's also Rifle Deathmatch, Attrition Warfare and Squad Defense, but I did not bother with them, because they have a smaller player base. Frontlines is probably the mode that defines Verdun anyway, so I highly recommend sticking to it.Maps are fairly varied, but they are repetative, due to their nature - trenches, trenches everywhere... Also, you will die - a lot. 8 out of 10 times, you won't know what killed you, because you die very quickly. Played this game solo, but had no problems communicating with players and even rejoining games with people I enjoyed playing with. Game has a built-in history of recent players.Variety of weapons is crazy. So many rifles, MG's, pistols, grenades, types of mortar and even gas. Hell, you can even pick a class with 5 grenades, but only a spade as a primary weapon for smacking people. Highly recommend playing this with ""Gore"" enabled, because it highlights the horrors of World War 1. Soldiers screaming and twitching in the battlefield with either their heads or limbs missing. Absolutely horryfing when your team gets shelled by a mortar that managed to directly hit 3-4 people and showers the whole area with body parts. Graphics also look nice, the sky boxes are well done. Shadows are wonky, but the lighting itself is quite good. Do not recommend playing with a high FOV, because it reduces the size of your weapon, and also your iron sights which is CRUCIAL. Playing with 70 FOV, but it still plays and feels nice, due to it's slower nature. Peripheral vision is not the main thing here, since most of the time fighting takes place in front of you. Unlocking new items is very easy, you get ""tokens"" which you can use to unlock class specific loadout ranks. Each costs 1 and it's very hard to run out of tokens. New players are not inherently at a huge disadvantage, which is nice.All in all, a very good and solid FPS game. Would definitely recommend to anyone.			"

								Verdun is Amazing Upcoming Trench Warfare game. It is game that any Gamer who enjoys Classic World War 1 game must obtain! It feels like a Classic WW1 shooter right off the bat, Reminding me of Call of Duty 1 and Medal of Honor Allied assault with the Different Squads based on real squads from the Verdun war.  The game runs on the Beautiful Unity 2 engine which is used for Cross-Platform gaming and also features the ability to play on Mac and Linux! The Graphics are stellar and I extremely enjoy it since I've been waiting for a Next-Gen World War 1 game for years now.  There is a basic System unlock tier for all weapons and different types of attachments. The controls simple and easy to play with, It's just like any other FPS game.  The server system is very unique, Where you select a gametype on a Big Board and then select a Map to play on as opposed to a specific server, making it much easier to play with Friends. My favorite part of any FPS game is a statistics counter, Which Verdun has! It keeps track of all your kills, Melees, Deaths, Stats for specific gamemodes etc. It even has achievements and medalss within it!  Verdun is absolutely a must have for the current price of $22.99. M2H and BlackMill games are hard at work developing it and making it better with each passing day!  -Please remember it is an Early Access game so there WILL be Bugs/Glitches and impending changes to the content and gameplay.

												Verdun is suprisingly easier to pick up than red orchestra 2. The gunplay is generally nice (especially with the mgs), the sounds for the other guns are a little weak though and it sometimes feels like you're shooting a peashooter that kills in a shot. There isnt as much teamplay as I would expect however generally people move towards a their goal. Oh and it runs really well on my crappy macbook air (with low settings ofc).			"

												I like this game particularly because of its setting. World War one is a undersubscribed genre for gaming as of late, especially with all the centenary  it is getting. With more units, weapons and nations available this game will only get better and better. It is also fun to play with friends, but can get rather frustrating if you have a team consisting of new players. The fact i am in interested in the era this game is set in helps its case a lot of course.			"

												Ensure a significant amount of players is playing in your region before buying this, I've been here since early access and considering the players in my region started to decrease dramatically at one point, I started going to the only populated servers at that time EU, and Americas. It was good despite my ping delaying everything I do for a few miliseconds - regular seconds, but once they added Ping limiting I could never play the game since then, if anyone shows up on my region it would be 2 - 4 players TOTAL, and that's on a week-end, when you expect the servers to be flooded.

								  With a lot of the early Access games coming out I've noticed that it can be very difficult to judge progress within the given title. If you've only ever had the pleasure of seeing this game on steam, you may fall under this statement. Originally this was a browser based game and the amount of distance it has covered since then is substantial.   Has it been polished to a shining gem capable of reflections? No, but its a great example of what the early access section is capable of; Marked improvement over the duration of its development. It has a lovely community, and the devs listen and provide feedback, covering issues the community sees as most important (bullet drop is a great example).   The settings are great and immersive, bleak and unwelcoming. The gameplay is unique and really hits a niche with its first world war era backdrop. Charging trenches with grenades and bayonets, then defending against onslaughts of furious counter-attacks is thrilling.  Now I do admitt, the price tag is a little steep, though it isnt to waste. This has the potential to be a great full release, and as of me writing at this moment, it WILL be a great title. Spend the money and help us make it that shining gem that reflects our gleaming smiles.			"

 tl;dr -> If you want a WWI trench warfare simulator, then look no further. Machinegunner was mowing down our troops, so we called for a mortar strike on his position and rushed the trenches. Enemy responded with a gas attack on the immediate area, but we were able to get our masks on in time. Our attack wave ended, so we had to double back and repel the enemy advance. 11/10 for gritty realism.I got this game gifted to me, and was looking forward to a chance to dive back into the competitive FPS genre. I was very satisfied with the work-in-progress, and am hopeful for the future direction of the game. If you like WWI trench warfare, brutal, unforgiving combat, and heavy teamwork (player interaction is more Battlefield-style than Call of Duty's lone wolf, rambo playstyle), then you will enjoy this game. Although the game is very much an early-access product, the development seems strong and consistent, and there is definitely a lot of potential here.The aesthetics are pretty good - the amount of detail in the environment is well-done, and the textures have a decent amount of work put in. There isn't any music, however, the  sound assets are fantastic - with practice, you can even distinguish which kind of weapons are being fired just from hearing it. I tried going underwater and firing my weapon, and the sound changes accordingly. Hiding underwater and listening to the difference in gunshots when you come up is pretty cool. The grenade mechanic - if one goes off next to you - is very good, and shooters can even sneak up on you while if they are careful. The controls are typical of your generic competitive FPS, and don't take a long time to get used to. There is no tutorial, but there are plenty of helpful members in the community willing to help you out if you just ask. Matchmaking can be a bit confusing at first, but understand that each unique squad (Canadians, Germans, etc) have their own set of 4 classes to choose from, and your squad-class-specific experience carries between matches. Higher levels in a class unlock better loadouts - for example, I reached level 2 in a rifleman class and unlocked a sniper scope. Squads can also level up, and they will receive things like mortar/gas strike abilities. Classes have a maximum of 4 levels to unlock.The checks and balances (trade-offs) are very impressive in this game. If you use the sniper scope, for example, it will increase your viewing range significantly, however, it will almost completely eliminate your peripheral view - making it easier for people to sneak past/toward you. Machinegunners are a menace to the trenches, but are easy rifle fodder because of the large muzzle flash they create. The Canadian squad is lightly armed with mostly pistols, however, they are excellent trench rushers and flankers. You can try jumping over barbed wire fences, but if you get stuck or land in one you will take significant damage.During gameplay, you will have to alternate between attack/defend waves, which require the attacking team to try to capture structures or critical areas by having more soldiers within. When the wave timer runs out, the roles will switch, and any attackers caught too deep in enemy territory are automatically executed (defenders also cannot run out too far). You will most likely die from a single rifle/machinegun shot, but can take one or two extra pistol hits. Combat is very satisfying, especially if you can get into a superior firing/kill position overlooking the enemy. Overall, if you are interested in historical trench warfare, I would strongly suggest you check out this game. I look forward to what the developers have in store for the future.Recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												I purchased this game because I saw Seananners playing it and thought it would be cool. I played the free to play alpha on Kongregate.com before this had even come out and enjoyed that too.Biggest disappointment I've had in an age. The game is horrifyingly bad for a shooter game, and that's saying something. I've played some pretty bad shooter games in my day, including very, very old ones, but this one is genuinely awful. Coming off Red Orchestra 2's gun mechanics for bolt action rifles you realize how much of a dream it is in red orchestra compared to this. The controls feel stiff and jerky when you try to move around, like your character never quite does what you want, and at times even delaying your movements which is a huge red flag for a FPS shooter. The weapons have ♥♥♥♥ controls, iron sights you can barely see that zoom in slightly when you hold your breath, but for some reason your trained soldier can't control his breath for more than 3 seconds before he starts panting like a ragged dog. Reload time is ridiculous, and you can't reload while you move, meaning you have to sit still every time you need to reload, which often gets you killed, because even pistols in the game kill you in one hit. Every weapon in this game kills you immediately in one hit. The game promotes camping not limited to spawn camping because there is no spawn protection. But let's not forget the community. A game with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gun mechanics could still be fun and enjoyable if the community is nice, right?It's not.The community in this game is horrible and abhorrent, cursing and yelling in the chatbox 24/7 and only get worse if they realize there's a new player in the game. Many of the players either have superhuman vision or are capable of seeing you from the length of the entire map away, and seeing you clear enough to headshot you with a pistol. Yes I said pistol. You pop out of cover anywhere and you get headshotted before you can react because someone already knows you are there. You can't move anywhere. The Class system is broken and ineffective, leaving certain players unable to do anything properly because some idiot is the NCO telling you do defend your spawn while dropping mortar rounds on top of friendly troops. Vet players blame ""newbs"" for all their problems in this game. 97 players online in the main game mode. It's safe to say the community for this game is dead, possibly worse than Heroes and Generals, since when I played that, it only had 250 people active on the server. I refunded this game as quickly as I could, and hopefully never have to experience an overhyped mess like this ever again.			"

												whilst the enemy put on there gas masks, I knew it was my time to shine.5 shovel kill killstreak. 10/10.But seriously, this is a fantastic FPS thats got alot of love behind it, Ive only just played with all the weapons and classes 12 hours in and every role in a squad is perfect.Playing with friends in a squad with people who communicate too is one of the best experiences when you clear out a whole trench together, and thats why I can't stop playing this game.

												This game feels like a ghetto version of Red Orchestra 2. The animations are stiff and robotic, the voice acting is horrible, the movement is clunky, etc. One of the biggest problems that I have is how arcadey it feels compared to other ""realistic shooters""; you have a crosshair on screen for most weapons, you can jump like it's Quake, and all the weapons produce hitmarkers. However, I really enjoy the weapons themselves (the models are nice and they sound fine). I like how the squad leaders have a more offensive role than in RO2. I like the weapon and class diversity among the different factions.It's a shame that this game has so many issues, as it really has the potential to be great. In its current state, I cannot reccomend it, and I don't think I ever will be able to. Fundamental issues like bad jumping physics and bad animations are not likely to ever be fixed. If this game is on heavy discount (<$10), and you're tired of better games, I suppose you could have a few hours of fun with it, but expect to be frustrated as well. tl,dr: Playing this game is like eating an ice cream sundae that you pulled out of a rotting animal carcass; some bites taste great and you would really like to have some more, but then some taste like rotting meat mixed with fudge.

												A real shame. The gameplay is excellent when it works and the atmosphere is brilliant. However the game is terribly optimised and I suffered frequent crashes, my longest stint of uninterrupted gameplay coming in at 23 minutes. After contacting the support team multiple times without answer I gave up and had steam refund me. Terribly disappointed.			"

								Each update makes the game better. Such a great WW1 game. Really captures the trench warfare aspect. Matches feel great as both sides just push and defend trenches. Rifle firing seems spot on. Even free for all servers are a ton of fun. Quite challenging trying to watch all sides in the vast maps.			"

												This game does some much right, thats not a lot of other shooter give you.This is one of few games that creates a trench style WW1 shooer game in an acceptable way, wave spawning and certain classes that allow for auto fire weapons only.However, this game is not fun after the first 6 hours, the game just gets boring with a very little amount of content.I start to get annoied with the game when the UNOPTIONAL spawning on your NCO or back at your line kicks in as I have spawning multiple times on my NCO right into enemy fire with a life of about a 0.5 second, only to have to wait for another respawn in 20 seconds! The spawning at home trenches is even worse sometimes as it does not even spawn you in a trench but out in no mans land causing you to get shot before you can even make it to your trench to defend. The shooting feels off and the iron sights on the weapons are awful to where you see almost nothing at a longer range. The auto fire weapons are a nice feature, however they are way too overpowered compared to the other weapons, they cause a lot of suppression, the suppression is so bad in this game that it make you almost unable to aim.A lot of the time you also get really crappy teammates who decide to camp your trench instead of attacking, the team balancing is awful with NO FORCED TEAM CHANGE...ARE YOU KIDDING?! If the teams are unbalanced its down to the players if they want to balance the teams, and no...they won't.This game has a really good idea, but it needs more content and some serious tweaks to the gameplay to stop spawn camping. More maps need to be intoduced and no mans land needs more cover, games are supposed to be fun, not accurate representations of historial battles, thats why this game for me got boring after 6 hours and made me want to rip out my eyeballs after any more. Other maps could include some more things out in no mans land such as more destroyed tanks and planes as I have only seen these about one or two times on two different maps. Some more things could be added into the trenches like some more living quarters and other smaller features that makes the trenches fun to fight in, instead of an almost straight line shooting mindlessly at the enemy.PS. The motars and gas is the worst, NCO's can throw down a strike like every 30 seconds and you can have like 4 on a team at once. A lot of deaths will incude you spawning, getting in trench (if you can), motar spammed in your general location.			"

												Short version: very poor optimisation ruins the game for many people.I come to Verdun from Red Orchestra 2, Operation Flashpoint (2001) and ARMA (1-2). If you enjoy these games you will love the gameplay of Verdun. It is more realistic than Red Orchestra 2, slower and more unforgiving, but more casual than ARMA which is good. I will keep it short: if the game would run how it should I would give it a thumbs up - but it does not at all. It stutters from 70fps to 8fps and back every few seconds now [25.11.2015]. So if you are in the middle of a trench combat it can screw your gameplay completely. This stuttering is permanent and probably for everyone. Many people in the forum and the game complain about this issue, even people on powerful machines. The reason is probably some bad written code. The game is not in early access anymore and because of that I can not forgive this, if I knew about these issues I would have not bought it at all. Great idea - badly realised. For now I go back to Red Orchestra 2 and hope that the developers will take it seriously and fix the heavy performance issues. When it is done I am willing to return and give it another try. Stay away from this now or buy it with this in your mind.Added flaws that I have found:There is also no way to refill your ammunition, nor a way to pick up weapons from dead friends or foes. When you use normal rifles that is seldom a problem, but there are classes that use a machine pistol or only grenades with a melee weapon. A machine pistol user is an attacking class and runs out of ammo very fast, that means once you used your 4 or 5 magazines you are left with the weak melee attack of it until you die. And that happens immediately, since chances to survive in a 1-shot-1-kill game with a melee weapon are zero. The same goes for the class that uses 5 grenades and a melee weapon - once the 5 grenades are gone you will die pretty fast and you will not be able to take a rifle from somebody. I see it as a clear design flaw that is breaking my immersion in the game.One point that is not so important for the gameplay, but for immersion, is that the ingame interface looks very modern and like from 2003. Something could be done about it, making it look atmospheric, using old maps instead of this red/green gps radar.At the default settings there is a crosshair (!) turned on. I switched it off immediately since I think that it is not compatible with a realistic game, but other players might let it on and probably have an advantage because of it. I dont know how precise shooting from the hip with the crosshair is.The animation for throwing grenades is very bad. I like the one in Red Orchestra 2 much better, since it is easier to estimate the throwing strength and distance. In Verdun it looks and feels very unnatural and I have difficulties estimating the distances right. Check youtube videos for it.The players I saw were pretty passive about teamplay. Nobody was ever talking on a microphone, people are mostly running around and doing their thing. Maybe it is because of the many new players coming from the sale. But what I saw is this: there is a great squad teamplay implementation that forces you to become a member of one squad all the time, but the people in this squads are not really working together. I had difficulties calling for help when we were flanked a few times. I was sitting alone on the right side of the trench, the other guys all on the left and not listening. Maybe I am doing something wrong, have to figure it out. But thats not the fault of the developers and can happen in every game.This game is still in beta, folks.			"

												I'm sorry but with the poor performance that has degraded since release, generally unfriendly and all-but-dead community and severe balancing issues - including the explosives (read: Mills) abuse - I can't recommend this game.It doesn't have any single player component to speak of, and I did not see any way to set up a private server with bots or anything. These points really wouldn't be such a big deal if the community were larger - but I just played a match of Frontlines at 7:30pm EST on a Saturday evening and there was only 61 other people online. That's total players on the game worldwide, not regional.I know, downvote me but here is the ugly and inevitable comparison: Battlefield One. If you have the money and an itch for WW1 combat, that is your ticket. Thousands of people online regularly, better balance to the weapons and gameplay mechanics, and significantly better performance. And no - I don't care about the graphics, (at all!) I am talking strictly performance - BF1 runs better. In my humble opinion, Verdun was good but now that BF1 is out there's no reason to get Verdun - BF1 will last longer, making it a better investment.To be fair to the developers of Verdun: if you want to look at which dev is better, it's them. They have released quite a lot of content for free, and continue to support their game with massive game system additions and tweaks like the gore system. Despite the declining player base they maintain their game with regular patches, even though sometimes the patches backfire a little. It should be noted here that sometimes the patches do significantly degrade the game, making it (personally) unplayable for stretches, but they fix what gets broken. In the end, neither EA nor Dice will provide this level of loyalty to you as a customer - however, in an online-only multiplayer shooter like this, the game's worth to you as a potential buyer ultimately come downs to the community, and most importantly it's longevity. Verdun, despite the best efforts of the devs, is dying. And that means, in my opinion, it isn't worth your money.			"

												You can capture them with easeeeee all you need is just a little limburger cheeseeee Been on this game since it was 6 bucks after it first came out on steam.  Thanks to you goons I've been searching local pawn and gun stores for a G98 and a full size Berthier.  This game's atmosphere is SPOT ON.  Uniforms and weapons are SPOT ON.  Verdun is geared more towards realism, but it's not enough to drive anyone away.  A history nut like myself can drink this game by the liter.........The developers are doing a fine job, I'd buy another pre release game from them if it was a historical shooter.

												I finally made it into the enemies trench, after running through a no man's land filled with gunfire, explosions and imminent death. Me and the few soldiers that made it into the trench now are  highground, the enemies main trench is below us, connected through a narrow path. I put my mashine gun on top of a small sandbag barricade and open fire on the enemy below us. They seek cover first and then shoot back, willing to drive us out of their trench. It's no use, their blue helmet make good targets along the dark mud and moldy planks, and they drop dead within seconds. My comrades start charging forward. I stay behind, giving them cover if needed. They run down, making it into the main trench without resistance. I wait a few seconds, then decide to catch up to them, as there are no targets for me anymore. I put my mashine gun aside, and instead take out my Luger. I start running down, my comrades in sight. Suddenly, I hear several shots and see my allies falling to the ground. Alerted, I stop moving and aim my luger around nervously. A french soldier suddenly runs past me. He notices me too late, I give off three shots in his direction, two shots hit him in the chest and he drops to the floor. ""Five shots left in the magazine"", I think, just before another enemy soldier comes from the other side, his rifle aimed straight at me. I panic, and empty the rest of my magazine in his direction, while he fires his rifle at me. I manage to hit im in the arm once, his shot luckily misses me. He takes cover again. I't dawns on me that my magazine is empty, and that he come out of his cover any second to finish the job. I head back, going up the path I came from as fast as I can. The path is narrow and small, there's no way he will miss this shot. Suddenly, I hear the sound of a german rifle next to me. Another soldier must have made it through the no man's land while our enemy was too busy fighting us off. I see my chance and run back to the hillside fortification while the enemy seeks cover from the rifle fire of my comrade. I make myself as small as I can, and try toreload, hands still shaking. I once again hear rifle fire, and see how my comrade makes his way back into our small sanctuary. I don't know if he managed to kill him or not, but at that point I don't even care anymore. I grab a magazine and put it into my Luger, when suddely a french soldier jumps in from above and stabs his bayonet right into the chest of my saviour. The magazine is in place, and I pull back the lock to avenge my fallen comrade, but it's too late: The soldier runs toward me, and before I can pull the trigger, he stabs his bayonet in my chest.Probably the most intense shooter I've ever played, 10/10 would get stabbed during reloading again.

												Verdun is the perfect WWI simulator.My most memorable game was a battle that was going poorly in Ypres for the Entente. They were pushed back to their final defensive line with the Central Powers practically dominating the field. The Entente barely survived what should have been The Central Powers' final push to victory and were given the opportunity to counter attack. And then something just... Happened.The Entente's counter attack was aggressive and unwavering. Their morale bolstered a thousand fold with nothing left to lose. After resecuring the Support Trench, the Central Powers were unable to keep the Entente at bay, being pushed further and further back, right into their inital trench line, the score dead even with a 3 to 3 ratio. Both sides reorganized themselves and ready to break the tied game!And then time ran out and eneded in a draw. Hundereds of men dead for aboslutely no gains. 10/10.			"

												I seriously think Verdun is one of the best multiplayer games ever made.As someone who has been in constant search for the perfect WW1-era game, and after being completely disappointed by some weird, meek attempts (looking at you, Necrovision, Darkest of Days, and yes, the Battlefield 1 Beta, as it is definitely too CoD for me), my pledges have finally been answered. Verdun is a game which packs a serious hell of a punch, plunging deeply into all-out trench warfare. Without holding back for the mainstream public, which sadly only wishes for 360-noscope kills across the map with an EMP rifle while jetpacking, Verdun boldly says 'no' to that by creating a perfect game environment with the main mode, Trench Warfare. Wave after wave, trying to push and defend the trenches which were so bloodily conquered, you truly feel like a Great War soldier. Never has a game made me so glad to follow orders. Verdun rewards you for being patient, disciplined and brave. Some of the best stories in all my years of multiplayer gaming come from this game, even though I have played it for a relatively short time. It doesn't matter. Contrary to what I feel towards the rest of multiplayer games (and especially due to the multiplayer community), the more I play Verdun, the more I want to keep playing.Absolutely commendable.			"

												I started playing Verdun around a year ago.  I saw a video of it on youtube from a popular youtuber playing it.  With all the futuristic FPS's out there it was good to see one that was made for WWI.  I of course started off without knowing how to do much or how to play very well and got punished for a long time.  I remember how proud I was when I got my first game over 10 kills.  It's a very rewarding game and makes you feel amazing when you play good.  The squad system is excelent, the in built voice communication is good.  The optimization is very bad as I have a beefy PC and still have fps issues at times.  Besides optimization there are some components that are still rough around the edges.  For new players starting this game I would say be patient and keep howning your skills.  Don't get discouraged.  If you start the game and end up in a game vs 2-3 high level people expect to have your world rocked.  Don't give up and enjoy the game.  Learn the different rolls, try different weapons and play styles.  It's a very solid game and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good skill based FPS.			"

												Even with just a couple hours played so far, I love this game. I never really played a WW1 set game before playing Verdun, mainly due to the allarmingly low number of WW1 games available. However this game is great, its gameplay is fun, slowpaced and very realistic and atmospheric. The graphics are great and its a well made game given WW1 is such a grey area in terms of gaming development. It just annoyes me how so many people purposely avoid this game for CoD or the other mainstream arcade like FPS's and completely rule out this game as ""its set in WW1 and is there for boring and dull"". The game deserves a bigger community and at times the battles are too empty, come on guys, try something different as apposed to stupid futuristic combat.			"

												Verdun is an immensely fun game with a dedicated and friendly playerbase. The graphics are beautiful and the maps and trenches are very detailed. The game runs surprisingly well on a middle-aged Macbook Air not at all designed for gaming. There are very few to zero hackers, I don't know why one of the other reviews says there are. There is a bit of a learning curve and you will die a lot during your first games (keep your head down!) but a bit of patience will take you a long way and give you hours of fun.Recommended if you like:Tactical Squad Based ShootersA Great Visual AtmosphereWW1 HistoryTeamworkWould not recommend if you want:Driveable vehicles.A deathmatch style of gameplay. There are team deathmatch and free for all modes but they are not played as much by the playerbase.			"

												Logged on, died almost immediately as the game has a steep learning curve and I was busy appreciating the scenery. Several deaths later I killed my first Frenchman, and was momentarily upset by the sight of his lifeless body tumbling into a crater. Went on to kill many more Frenchmen with rifle, grenade and trench mace.10/10 would contemplate the tragedy of war again.			"

												Back in Beta the Snipers weren't ever a problem, but now there's too many people equipping that scope, and going to town on anyone that's defending, from all the way on the other side of the battlefield, this means that on the bigger or more open maps, (Picardie and Aisne) It's almost impossible to stick your head above ground level for more than five seconds without losing it, this is GREAT Historical Accuracy, but is still extremely annoying.

												Great game. Intense 1st person shooter that explores the all horrors of real warfare. I've had this game since beta and have not been disappointed. Of course there are games where you can hardly make it out of your own trench without being slaughtered, but you will find that in every shooter out there. It's best to play with friends, because you can level up your squad and have better chances at fighting off your enemy. Servers always have a few matches going and during peak hours over 20 games will be going. Lobby of 32 players, in squads of four with a decent variety of squads.			"

												Verdun is honestly one of the funnest games I've played. It feels different to a lot of other FPS games, not only in the theme but in the gameplay mechanics too. I particularly enjoy the NCO role in squads giving access to command auras and abilities such as mortar strikes, smoke screens, air recon, and gas attacks.It's very fun to play and has a few different gameplay types although I spend a vast majority of my time in the frontlines type in which you fight for control of enemy trenches.The weapons are very fun to use and I feel there is a good and interesting variety, with the vastly different fire rates of weapons, along with the different requirements of no man's land and trench fighting, I feel there is a lot of tactical thinking that can go into gameplay and deciding how and when to take your battles.I really enjoy the team focused elements of the game and I feel that the Verdun community is one of the friendliest and more welcoming communities in online games that I've experienced.Progressing, gaining ranks, medals, etc. All of that is nice as well and gives a real sense of achievement and I often screenshot the scoreboard and my medals when I've done particularly well, and looking at the screenshots in the community hub, I'm not alone in doing this.All in all, it's a very wonderful, sure there is the occasional bug but I feel the developers are pretty good at fixing these and I wouldn't say they impact gameplay much at all.I would definitely recommend Verdun!

Early Access Review
								Fun and plays really well but is slow paced if there is not a full server. There needs to be bots to bolster the numbers missing in a server, 8 on 8 in WW1 isn't that enjoyable. Other than that if your a Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm fan you'll definately enjoy this and feel right at home. Interested to see how this game turns out later down the track.			"

												Ill get right to it, Verdun is a solid game with great gameplay mixed in with a little bit of history.Pros:- Accurate environments- Extremely satisfying gunplay- Tactical classes such as the officer- Intense fights- Great teamplay due to certain game mechanics- There is NO other game like it, this makes it incredibly uniqueCons:- Sometimes it can be hard to find a populated server in your area. There are times when servers are full (night) and empty (mid day)Overall i would recommend Verdun for most people, it is great for casual players, gunplay is incredibly solid, teamplay like no other game and can be very intense. Also if you are interested the historical information on the loading screens is quite interesting to read.			"

												Verdun is by far one of the best games I ever played. After all the modern and ww2 first person shooters the ww1 setting is very refreshing and works surprisingly well for the genre. The core gameplay is very solid and especially with some friends to fill a squad it can be enjoyed for manny manny hours. The gameplay feels pretty realistic and really gives you the feeling you'r in the middle of the first world war. Maps are well designed and guns feel really good and well balanced. The squad system really brings a deeper level to the gameplay as each member has a different role with different weapons and it rewards teamwork in a great way. I never felt as good winning a game as I did when we took that final trench. Totally worth my money.10/10.			"

												Verdun isn't quite finished yet but I definitely recommend it.  It's particularly good if you can get one or more friend to play with you- there is a mechanic that allows you to get bonuses to certain squads if you play with one or more friends.  They're going to add the Belgians and Americans soon, as well as a new map.  The devs add content at a decent rate and plan to continue releasing stuff for quite a while now too, so there will be more and more content as time goes on.  A must play with friends (four is the best number).			"

												This game is pretty good overall for what I have played.  If you are looking for a high speed twitch shooter then this game isn't for you.  That said it has plenty of action, a good mix of strategy, detailed maps, and a fun squad based system.  That said, you definitely want to bring your friends for this one, being in a squad with people you play well with will increase the enjoyment of this game immensely since so much revolves around the squad gameplay.  Rough around the edges, but solid at its core Verdun is a game I feels bring some freshness to the otherwise stale modern FPS genre and will keep playing it well into the future.			"

												Absolutely Terrific.There aren't many Great War games out there and this one manages to pull off what a lot of AAA titles are afraid to do. Extremely challenging and terrifyingly realistic this game is well worth the price. Each kill is extremely satisfying and worth the effort. If you're looking for a good K/D...this probably isn't the game for you. You will die. A lot. But I still keep coming back despite my enormous death toll because the game mechanics are so fun.Today they also came out with a free expansion for the game. That is great for multiple reasons. First off, you get more content and it is free. But secondly it means the Devs are still passionate about their game which doesn't happen very often with small early access games. I've had this game from day one of early access and it has honestly ceased to amaze me. Great buy! Definitely recommended.			"

												This game...is great...if you don't mind a bit of out of date firepower and overload in rifles then this is the game for you. This game offers a lot and i think the devs put a lot of hard work into it as there is a history for this game. The game is only multiplayer but that's the fun of it as you cant play trench warfare on your own. The maps are some of the most detailed Ive ever seen and the amount of guns at your disposal is insane. The game is truly amazing, there is 4 different modes at the moment... front lines/attrition/rifle deathmatch/ and Coop survival. Though in the future i hope they add more. There is a wide range of squads from 5 different nations. If you get 3 other friends to play with and work as a team, you will find yourselves winning alot if your team also does the same. Teamwork is whats grants victory. However running rambo with a flamethrower and be a blast as well. If you love history and have a soft spot for WW1 then i strongly think the money you have is worth giving for this game. "

												I finally made it into the enemies trench, after running through a no man's land filled with gunfire, explosions and imminent death. Me and the few soldiers that made it into the trench now are  highground, the enemies main trench is below us, connected through a narrow path. I put my mashine gun on top of a small sandbag barricade and open fire on the enemy below us. They seek cover first and then shoot back, willing to drive us out of their trench. It's no use, their blue helmet make good targets along the dark mud and moldy planks, and they drop dead within seconds. My comrades start charging forward. I stay behind, giving them cover if needed. They run down, making it into the main trench without resistance. I wait a few seconds, then decide to catch up to them, as there are no targets for me anymore. I put my mashine gun aside, and instead take out my Luger. I start running down, my comrades in sight. Suddenly, I hear several shots and see my allies falling to the ground. Alerted, I stop moving and aim my luger around nervously. A french soldier suddenly runs past me. He notices me too late, I give off three shots in his direction, two shots hit him in the chest and he drops to the floor. ""Five shots left in the magazine"", I think, just before another enemy soldier comes from the other side, his rifle aimed straight at me. I panic, and empty the rest of my magazine in his direction, while he fires his rifle at me. I manage to hit im in the arm once, his shot luckily misses me. He takes cover again. I't dawns on me that my magazine is empty, and that he come out of his cover any second to finish the job. I head back, going up the path I came from as fast as I can. The path is narrow and small, there's no way he will miss this shot. Suddenly, I hear the sound of a german rifle next to me. Another soldier must have made it through the no man's land while our enemy was too busy fighting us off. I see my chance and run back to the hillside fortification while the enemy seeks cover from the rifle fire of my comrade. I make myself as small as I can, and try toreload, hands still shaking. I once again hear rifle fire, and see how my comrade makes his way back into our small sanctuary. I don't know if he managed to kill him or not, but at that point I don't even care anymore. I grab a magazine and put it into my Luger, when suddely a french soldier jumps in from above and stabs his bayonet right into the chest of my saviour. The magazine is in place, and I pull back the lock to avenge my fallen comrade, but it's too late: The soldier runs toward me, and before I can pull the trigger, he stabs his bayonet in my chest.Probably the most intense shooter I've ever played, 10/10 would get stabbed during reloading again.

There are sooooo many explosions around ya making an authentic feel of trench warfare and the weapons are very authentic :) I  honestly don't think Battlefield 1 will have anything on Verdun.

												Charging an enemy trench with my stormtrooper squad; Lewis gun rifle rounds whistle  past me and hit one of my comrades and he goes down. The sounds of him choking on his own blood resound out behind me as the last three of us jump over the top of the enemy trench, landing behind the Lewis gunner who had to stop and reload. The first man in bayonets the gunner and kills him, his lifeless body falling to the dirt, groans of pain following. Shots ring out from down the trench as two brits open up with their Enfield,  my two team mates go down, blood shoots from their chests as the rounds make impact. I charge over their writhing groaning bodies and open up with my mp 18/i, closing the gap to render their rifles useless. I empty my 32 round snail drum spraying from the hip and watch the two soldiers drop. I reload and get to the top of the parapet just in time to see two french squads charging towards me to retake the trench. I take aim an fire.10/10 would get PTSD again.This new update completes the game. Get it now.			"

												Verdun is the perfect WWI simulator.My most memorable game was a battle that was going poorly in Ypres for the Entente. They were pushed back to their final defensive line with the Central Powers practically dominating the field. The Entente barely survived what should have been The Central Powers' final push to victory and were given the opportunity to counter attack. And then something just... Happened.The Entente's counter attack was aggressive and unwavering. Their morale bolstered a thousand fold with nothing left to lose. After resecuring the Support Trench, the Central Powers were unable to keep the Entente at bay, being pushed further and further back, right into their inital trench line, the score dead even with a 3 to 3 ratio. Both sides reorganized themselves and ready to break the tied game!And then time ran out and eneded in a draw. Hundereds of men dead for aboslutely no gains. 10/10.			"

And there are like 4 game modes in Verdun... but i have only played one out of them... (The frontlines) Where you have to chose which side you are on... (German strosstruppen, British tommies and French poilus) however The french poilus are allianced with the British tommies... so there are only two sides in this game. But that is like how The First World-War Turned out like... they had some alliances with some other countries... but those sides... have not been invented in this game yet... But M2H Blackmill Games really made a good job with making this game so far... because the Graphics, Music, The quality, The atmosphere and the HUD-system really brings out how it may have been in a war before... but nah... it had been worse in real life because well... people died... lol. Because in games you respawn after you have died... just like in this game and many others.I really like how they have made so if you try to run out of the gunfight and war you get executed for deserting. And if you get tangled in barbed wire you have to get it off very easily or else you will die... but the problem is... you are a great target for anyone on the other side to get a good shot on ya... and when you give commands... whichever side you are on they will say the commands in their language. And the orders you get in this game makes everything so much harder... because you can see on the map which places you can't go to... because they count as deserting soldiers and when the enemies try to smoke you, you can put on a gasmask by pressing ""4"". and you can chose out of 4 different soldiers and 7 squads in this game. The soldiers however are:----------------------------------Corporal.Rifleman.Gunner.Bomber.This game is so good at creating feelings for me at least... lol. when you run out in the frontlines shooting, bombing, slaughter everyone out there and til at last dying over and over...makes me wanna give this game 8,7 out of 10. because after a while it can get a little monotonous... but still it's a really great game.

VerdunVerdun is a WWI fps that places you in trench warfare.  This game is unique in that it is one of the few WWI games offered and that it is trench warfare and not just an open map yo run around and shot everyone.  The game is designed on the Unity engine and looks decent.  The engine provides good physic effects which makes the experiences that much more enjoyable.  Developement CycleThe graphics and gameplay have improved a lot over the last year.  The developers have released several patches since I made this video in June, 2014.  The game plays and looks better today than in my initial video review but still feels last gen.  Improvements have been made in areas like bullet trajectory/hit boxes which was a huge improvement needed in this game.  The GoodThe game brings a unique gameplay/experience in a very competitive war FPS genre.  Playing a WWI game is very cool to experience as most World War games are based on WW2 or something  sci-fy. The Devs really hit the mark in providing a trench war experience. I really enjoy playing this game. The BadMy biggest dislike is a lack of maps/battle locations. But unfortunately, this is a realistic game based on the actual WWI battle of Verdun so more maps is most likely not going to happen. ConculsionIs it worth your time? If you like the idea of playing a WWI game in the trenches of Verdun then yes I do. I really like this game and recommend it for any fan of war themed first-person shooters.

												Verdun is a great game that hits that sweet spot between realism and annoying ease. The squad system makes the game unique and encourages you to build relationships with the people you're playing with. Unlike most FPS games, there's a lot of patience and tactics that go into attacking AND defending, and if you don't like to wait around, you may not like this game. However, if you have a group of friends who enjoys squad play, this is a great game to get.The biggest downside to the game is the lack of player base; I would also like to see some different game modes, and I hope to see those in the future. At $22, it's a fair price. On sale, it's a steal.			"

												Verdun is the perfect WWI simulator.My most memorable game was a battle that was going poorly in Ypres for the Entente. They were pushed back to their final defensive line with the Central Powers practically dominating the field. The Entente barely survived what should have been The Central Powers' final push to victory and were given the opportunity to counter attack. And then something just... Happened.The Entente's counter attack was aggressive and unwavering. Their morale bolstered a thousand fold with nothing left to lose. After resecuring the Support Trench, the Central Powers were unable to keep the Entente at bay, being pushed further and further back, right into their inital trench line, the score dead even with a 3 to 3 ratio. Both sides reorganized themselves and ready to break the tied game!And then time ran out and eneded in a draw. Hundereds of men dead for aboslutely no gains. 10/10.			"

Thanks to you goons I've been searching local pawn and gun stores for a G98 and a full size Berthier.  This game's atmosphere is SPOT ON.  Uniforms and weapons are SPOT ON.  Verdun is geared more towards realism, but it's not enough to drive anyone away.  A history nut like myself can drink this game by the liter.........The developers are doing a fine job, I'd buy another pre release game from them if it was a historical shooter.

												I finally made it into the enemies trench, after running through a no man's land filled with gunfire, explosions and imminent death. Me and the few soldiers that made it into the trench now are  highground, the enemies main trench is below us, connected through a narrow path. I put my mashine gun on top of a small sandbag barricade and open fire on the enemy below us. They seek cover first and then shoot back, willing to drive us out of their trench. It's no use, their blue helmet make good targets along the dark mud and moldy planks, and they drop dead within seconds. My comrades start charging forward. I stay behind, giving them cover if needed. They run down, making it into the main trench without resistance. I wait a few seconds, then decide to catch up to them, as there are no targets for me anymore. I put my mashine gun aside, and instead take out my Luger. I start running down, my comrades in sight. Suddenly, I hear several shots and see my allies falling to the ground. Alerted, I stop moving and aim my luger around nervously. A french soldier suddenly runs past me. He notices me too late, I give off three shots in his direction, two shots hit him in the chest and he drops to the floor. ""Five shots left in the magazine"", I think, just before another enemy soldier comes from the other side, his rifle aimed straight at me. I panic, and empty the rest of my magazine in his direction, while he fires his rifle at me. I manage to hit im in the arm once, his shot luckily misses me. He takes cover again. I't dawns on me that my magazine is empty, and that he come out of his cover any second to finish the job. I head back, going up the path I came from as fast as I can. The path is narrow and small, there's no way he will miss this shot. Suddenly, I hear the sound of a german rifle next to me. Another soldier must have made it through the no man's land while our enemy was too busy fighting us off. I see my chance and run back to the hillside fortification while the enemy seeks cover from the rifle fire of my comrade. I make myself as small as I can, and try toreload, hands still shaking. I once again hear rifle fire, and see how my comrade makes his way back into our small sanctuary. I don't know if he managed to kill him or not, but at that point I don't even care anymore. I grab a magazine and put it into my Luger, when suddely a french soldier jumps in from above and stabs his bayonet right into the chest of my saviour. The magazine is in place, and I pull back the lock to avenge my fallen comrade, but it's too late: The soldier runs toward me, and before I can pull the trigger, he stabs his bayonet in my chest.Probably the most intense shooter I've ever played, 10/10 would get stabbed during reloading again.

												Verdun is an immensely fun game with a dedicated and friendly playerbase. The graphics are beautiful and the maps and trenches are very detailed. The game runs surprisingly well on a middle-aged Macbook Air not at all designed for gaming. There are very few to zero hackers, I don't know why one of the other reviews says there are. There is a bit of a learning curve and you will die a lot during your first games (keep your head down!) but a bit of patience will take you a long way and give you hours of fun.Recommended if you like:Tactical Squad Based ShootersA Great Visual AtmosphereWW1 HistoryTeamworkWould not recommend if you want:Driveable vehicles.A deathmatch style of gameplay. There are team deathmatch and free for all modes but they are not played as much by the playerbase.			"

												Finally a good World War 1 game! Experience the great war with all the bolt action, trench warfare, chemical weapon fighting you want! As of this review there are a deathmatch and Front lines. The Front lines game mode requires a little bit more explaining. I am going to quote the wiki here for you guys new to the game. ""Frontlines is the most popular type of match played in Verdun. It is a competition between two teams, one French and one German. Each team has up to sixteen players. Each team is divided into squads of up to four players. The teams alternate between offense and defense (""Attack"" vs ""Defend""). While on offense the team can score a point by capturing the next trench. If the defending team is able to successfully defend their trench from the attack, then they earn a point. The match ends when one team controls the entire map or the timer runs out. ""There is a lot of detail put into Verdun, but it does have a small playerbase at the moment. The game itself reminds me a bit of the Red Orchestra games in a World War 1 setting. Overall I have got to say I really recommend Verdun, its just got what it takes to be a great game!			"

								this game really is a diamond in the rough at its current state. its got a lot of issues in that the gunplay is quite boring and there is  little to no variety in arms but one thing it nails perfectly is the immersion. when the commander shouts that everyone needs to get back to the trench and you rush back with your comrades. and then when you are in the trench half the unit is dead and there are bullets flying everywhere. its only early access so its going to improve a lot i hope. still worth your time and money though.

								Good to finally see a WW1 fps, this seems to be specially aimed for a niche so I would recommend the devs to bet on details for the historical realism and other factors of major importance such as weather and battlefield (i.e.: wind and mud were hugely influencial). Great game for coop with a small group of friends (4) as the platoons have their own class and the mechanics forces you to stay with your leader or you automatically get shot for desertion (thumbs up for this). In the future I would like to see the introduction of other army groups (scottish, portuguese, etc) some artillery play, horses, chemicals, dogs, mark I tanks, and other goodies. But also important not to overload and stay niche and realistic, focusing on trench ambience too (I would like to see trenches that would make you feel like you dont wanna be there, darker, tighter, deeper, smellier with shattered muddy/bloody corpses with human rejects and lots of flies and the random mice). CONS:-Sync... which ruins everything but hope it gets fixed.-Matchmaking. Being on a battle with 1 vs 12 is ridiculous. Also extending the capacity of numbers of players in battlefield would feel closer to the actual events.-The ammount of bullets you take to battle is ridiculously unreal.			"

												If you want WW1 trench combat, this is basically the only game you can get. Thankfully it's a good game. Classes feel mostly balanced and maps are mostly decent. There are obviously good maps and bad maps. The majority of the maps are good but some are still absolute stinkers (looking at you Fort Douaumont). Verdun feels mostly finished, but there are some things still missing such as only the British character models have gask masks, missing sounds, iffy netcode, reload animations don't sync with audio.. etc. It's all nit-picky stuff, apart from the netcode issue. The core gameplay is bug free and solid and I can only suggest a couple of improvements (i.e. one I really want is having an indicatior if your bolt isn't positioned correctly since the gun model always has a closed bolt even if the game thinks the bolt is open).I've been playing Verdun on both Windows and Linux and as expected, performance is utter trash on Linux. Maybe with some tweaking and better drivers the game will perform better, but bad performance is a common theme for me and games in Linux. Crashes are extremely frequent on Linux but I've never experienced a crash on Windows 10.			"

You can use recon sitting in trench to make sure from what flank enemie will come, then you prepare to shoot enemy silently waiting but then enemy arty or gas kick the ♥♥♥♥ out of you. When my grandpa saw this game he said that in Aughanistan everything was the different way. He said it's not realistic.

Something I want them to add is ""Team Colonel's/Team Oberst's."" What I mean by that is the Colonel could speak with Squad Leaders to give them orders to issue to their squads, it would definitely increase the amount of realism to trench warfare as well as giving an edge to a team whether their team's Colonel does a fine enough job. A cool feature I would love the developers to add is a feature where the team Colonel has an option, called ""Over the top."" Which essentially issues a mandatory order for all squad's to run over the trenches and charge over, just to add a chilling effect for when the men in the trench have to hold them off, it would be awesome to see larger servers and multiple squads charging over, definitely something that will give you chills!

												Finally a good World War 1 game! Experience the great war with all the bolt action, trench warfare, chemical weapon fighting you want! As of this review there are a deathmatch and Front lines. The Front lines game mode requires a little bit more explaining. I am going to quote the wiki here for you guys new to the game. ""Frontlines is the most popular type of match played in Verdun. It is a competition between two teams, one French and one German. Each team has up to sixteen players. Each team is divided into squads of up to four players. The teams alternate between offense and defense (""Attack"" vs ""Defend""). While on offense the team can score a point by capturing the next trench. If the defending team is able to successfully defend their trench from the attack, then they earn a point. The match ends when one team controls the entire map or the timer runs out. ""There is a lot of detail put into Verdun, but it does have a small playerbase at the moment. The game itself reminds me a bit of the Red Orchestra games in a World War 1 setting. Overall I have got to say I really recommend Verdun, its just got what it takes to be a great game!			"

												The game is amazing. The amount of thought and care the developers put into this game is admirable. They have a weekly blog where they communicate with fans, and are a breath of fresh air when it comes to video game dev's. Since I started playing the game has gone through many changes, most recently the Horrors of War expansion pack, which nearly doubled the amount of content in the game for  no cost at all. Gameplay:The game works by having 2 teams of 16, separated into 4 squads of 4. Each squad member has a specific role and a choice of 3 loadouts that contour to those roles with a unique type of offmap support for each of the NCOs to use.. There are a few kinds of Squads as well: Theres the basic infantry squad consisting of an NCO, Marksman, Machinegunner and Grenadier. These squads are the British Tommies, French Poilus, American Doughboys, and German Lansers. Theres also Raider squads, Reconnaissance squads, Heavy Defending squads and Specialist squads. The Raiders are the Canadians and Stosstruppen who use Gas attacks, Recons are the French Chausseurs Alpin and the German Alpenjaeger who use Air support. Defending squads are the Belgians and german Schutze who use precision heavy mortars. the Specialists are the USMC who use 30-06 French Chauchats and the M1897 Trench Gun, and the German Pioneers who use the Flamethrower and both call in Smokescreens and White Phosphorous attacks.Game modes: the Frontlines gamemode where the above mentioned set up is in play, and each team starts either defending a trenchline or going over the top to the enemy  trench line and the objective is to take or hold the trench, and if captured to defend against counter attacks. Rifle Deathmatch is a free for all mode where you choose a rifle and attachments and just play free for all.Attrition is a TDM that uses the squad system.And squad Coop  is when you enlist in a pals battalion with you and your friends and hold a trenchline against waves of attackers.I could go on even more than already on this game. I highly reccommend it especially for history buffs. The game definitely deserves 10/10			"

												Verdun is a First Person Shooter game set during World War I. The developers have a large focus on authenticity with this game, trying to create an accurate representation of what it may have been like in the various brutal trenches and No Man's Lands of the conflict. In terms of gameplay, there are four different game modes that can be played with friends or solo. Frontlines is the main game mode where the objective is either to leave your (somewhat) safe trench and sprint across No Man's Land dodging gunfire and bombs into the enemy trench and capture it for your side or defend your trench from the attackers by sniping, calling mortar fire, using recon planes to spot enemies and using mount machine guns to mow down the numbers. One thing that many new players may dislike at first is that you WILL die. It more or less cannot be avoided in this game, although, I think it adds to the overall experience. This mode is awesome fun, especially with a four man squad of yourself and friends. The other modes include Attrition Warfare (which is effectively a Team Deathmatch mode), Squad Defense (a wave survival mode against bots than can be played with friends) and Rifle Deathmatch (a free for all gamemode). Squad Defense is pretty fun and can prove to be quite a challenge as you progress through the waves. The other two are pretty simple and if you have played TDM or FFA gamemodes before you know what to expect. The player can create a four man squad from a variety of different countries involved in the War, comprising of the Entente Side (Britain, Scotland, France, Canadian, American etc.) and the Central Powers Side (Germany). Both sides have different classes unique to certain countries, for example, the German ""Pionere"" Squad has a Flamethrower, other squads don't but have some other unique weapons or classes. One smart feature of the squads is when playing with the same players, the squad levels up and most of these squad ranks offer advantages like smaller cooldown times on abilities, different uniforms, longer hold breath time for sniping etc. There are still a few factions missing but they will probably be added in due time. The NCO of each squad can set a marker on areas to advance towards or defend as well as call in a mortar strike, a recon plane or a gas bomb on a highlighted area. However, only certain squad types will get to call in each attack which allows different squads being able to do numerous things for their allies. The gas attacks are just awesome, requiring anyone nearby to equip their gasmasks and hinder their visability. There are a variety of different weapons that can be used by the player. From the SMLE rifle to the MP18 machine gun to the trench clubs, spades and bayonets to the close quarters Trenchgun, there is so much choice and you will find that some weapons work way better on certain maps (snipers will be more useful in long, open No Man's Lands but may be harder to use in a close quarters, mazelike trench system). Nothing quite beats the adrenaline of driving a bayonet into someone's neck in a deep, muddy trench.The maps are very atmospheric and look like they have been completely modeled off of the photographs of the battlefields. These maps range from huge, open, crater-filled fields to deep and damp trenches. While there is a small number of maps, they are randomly selected so you are pretty much always playing on a different map.One thing that is specifically awesome is the extreme level of detail in the gory aspects of the war. Heads getting blown apart, bullets shatter skulls, grenades and bombs blow off limbs and flamethrowers leave a path of charred corpses behind. There are animations for various ways you can die. These animations, while can be glitchy, really create an intense atmosphere and are quite immersive. One example of this is while myself and another player were sniping, the other player was shot in the neck and fell backwards grasping his throat as blood spurted everywhere. That, paired with the distant screams and gunfire, created a fantastic, cinematic feeling.Technically, the game runs fairly well for me, only slightly dipping in fps at the start of a match. The online connectivity is relatively stable and I've only had one or two disconnects. The game feels pretty clunky at times and could probably be smoother, especially when you're having an intense melee battle with an enemy and you both look like foosball players in the process.Overall, the developers did a great job of creating an intense, authentic World War I experience and while it is clunky at times, it still is a great game for a World War I enthusiast.I recommend this game, especially if it's on sale.

												Verdun is by far one of the best games I ever played. After all the modern and ww2 first person shooters the ww1 setting is very refreshing and works surprisingly well for the genre. The core gameplay is very solid and especially with some friends to fill a squad it can be enjoyed for manny manny hours. The gameplay feels pretty realistic and really gives you the feeling you'r in the middle of the first world war. Maps are well designed and guns feel really good and well balanced. The squad system really brings a deeper level to the gameplay as each member has a different role with different weapons and it rewards teamwork in a great way. I never felt as good winning a game as I did when we took that final trench. Totally worth my money.10/10.			"

												So what is verdun? Well, for starters, its a ww1 infantry fps game, that mainly focuses on so called ""trench warfare"".And just to make it clear if it already wasent, when i say its trench warfare, and is a infantry fps game, i mean just that, there are no vehicels or any thing of the sort. The only thing that exists out side of the players equipment that it can use (like grenades,rifles and melee for example, that are directly used by the player), is the artillery strike which one (or more, i cant remember if there are mulitible classes that can do so) of the classes can call.The game is very immersive, and fairly true to the real thing (at least compared to video game standards), and all of the factions in the game, do actually use the rifles, pistols etc, that were used and manufactured by them. So the british use the lee enfield, and the germans use the .98 mauser for example. Which is to be expected from a historical game, but either way its in there.And as i mentioned before... The characthers are divided in to diffrent classes in small squads (kind of like in bf, but here the classes can only be occupied by one person at a time). and these classes have diffrent types of weaponry and perks to them, for example the grenadier can have up to four grenades on him, but then maybe just a little pistol as a primary, or you can be a machinegunner mowing down your enemys with for example a large lewis gun.The game has two game mods one which is basically just team deathmatch, so jsut running around in a trench and blasting eachother away, and then there is the bread and butter mode of the game. Which is a bit similar to almost something a bit like ""Rush"" form the battlefield franchies, but not really at all, but a nudge. But what you do is that either you start by attacking, which consits of you jumping out of your muddy, stinking, comforteble little trench and run out in to the ""no mans land"" and try to survive and take your self to the otehr side and then capture the enemys trench. Which is a lot easier said than done. And then if you succed in taking the trench, there will be a enemy counter attack, where the enemy try to take back their old trench through the same procedure as the attackers did.And here sadly the game starts lacking....The game is otherwise fairly well balanced and well patched at least i cant actually remeber myself rnning in to bugs while i played it).But the gameplay it self really lacks. Why? 1# the game is trying to be a realistic ww1 infantry shooter, and let me ask you, do you think it was very fun storming a trench? The answer is no. Most die, and so will you, over and over and over again, getting sniped by a sniper you dont see or mowed down by a mg, or maybe you get killed by morter, or maybe even gas if you dont throw on your gas mask quick enough. And when you finally think: ""oh my god, im so close, i can even hear those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. And soon i will get my revenge for them killing me 30 times, and i will teabag them so much that from here on out they will be reminded of this very momnet"". but then, you and your friend that are all cramped up in a little crater/foxhole, get blown up by one single well placed hand grenade.And the game is just really redundant to, because its the same thing over and over again, and the enviorment might change abit, but the experince is generally the same.And the combat isent to god either, since its really quite clunky, and grenade spammy once you get into the trench, and it mostly comes down to who is camping in the best spot.2# some of the classes are quite similar, which also contributes to the repetetiv nature of the game.I dont know what to say really, like the game has really lacking gameplay, but then again, its a almost one of a kind game, and there is not really any other game that offers the same experince. In the end maybe it isent really a bad game, just a game that wants to be historically accurate, and at the same time try to make one ofthe most brutal wars ever seen, feel enjoyble.But this is my opinion on the matter, are you just a general fan of fps games? You might want to skip this one. But if you are a person that wants to experince trench warfare, and a historically accurate game, and is generally intrested in history (specificly the first world war), then this is probably the best game to date to potray that.So the review will be positive, because its a game that offers a experince that almost no fps games do, and i to be honset cant come up with something like it that ive seen. Conclusion: The game has a very atmospheric feel to it and is well crafted immersive experince and can be quite fun at times when you get a equal amount of both sides of the gameplay that is offerd, that being to trench warfare, and the very intense and very punishing gameplay of the no mans land. A very unique game, But as most unique things, it is not for everyone.			"

												If you want WW1 trench combat, this is basically the only game you can get. Thankfully it's a good game. Classes feel mostly balanced and maps are mostly decent. There are obviously good maps and bad maps. The majority of the maps are good but some are still absolute stinkers (looking at you Fort Douaumont). Verdun feels mostly finished, but there are some things still missing such as only the British character models have gask masks, missing sounds, iffy netcode, reload animations don't sync with audio.. etc. It's all nit-picky stuff, apart from the netcode issue. The core gameplay is bug free and solid and I can only suggest a couple of improvements (i.e. one I really want is having an indicatior if your bolt isn't positioned correctly since the gun model always has a closed bolt even if the game thinks the bolt is open).I've been playing Verdun on both Windows and Linux and as expected, performance is utter trash on Linux. Maybe with some tweaking and better drivers the game will perform better, but bad performance is a common theme for me and games in Linux. Crashes are extremely frequent on Linux but I've never experienced a crash on Windows 10.			"

												This has become my go to game for any WW1 video game cravings as it is highly accurate to the historical time period and offers some very good graphics for the eye candy aspect.  The workings of the guns in this game impress me because of all the little details that go into working the gun, for example with the German Schutz  class Kar 98 sniper rifle with a scope the animation shows you having the gun move up as you cycle the bolt since they were not exactly light, straight pull bolts and needed some muscling to cycle them. The sounds and visual effects of the game help with immersion and I can easily play this game for hours without a regret. The general multiplayer community is actually decent and much better than a World of Tanks community for example. Most people aren't confrontational or accusing. Most people just play the game and avoid the world chat which is fine with me. As for lack of players, I haven't had a problem finding games though some of the other game modes besides Frontline can be sparse at times.However I feel the gameplay can feel a bit clunky at times and isn't as smooth as a Battlefield or COD game would be but I don't think it takes away too much from the enjoyability of the game. I think the game would benefit from a larger userbase and maybe smooth out the controls but otherwise I don't see any other problems that would bother me.			"

Reason is most of all immersion and atmosphere that this game creates especially when your whole team is attacking enemy trench (mostly more than half of us dies in that process). Devs are constantly bringing new updates and new content so i am glad that i bought a game where devs are so devoted. I would wish for better physics and 64 player servers (now its 32 max) but i LOVE this game even with these (minor) flaws.All glory to Kaiser and his Sturmpioneers! "

												I think I dreamed this game once, feverish and confused as to how a Great War shooter could possibly work.Verdun not only works, it excels at what it does. Most ""class based"" shooters divvy up weapons based on a preferred playstyle. In Verdun it's all about being able to fill a role well enough that the team can succeed. At times it's brutal; You will die moments after spawning quite often. You will never know where the shot that killed you came from, and the core dilemma of gameplay is often about finding yourself a good firing position without exposing yourself to too much return fire.10/10 died repeatedly and horribly.

It is an extremely unique game, with a WWI setting, which recives constant updates for performance and new features. I have seen games by M2H before, but I thought that this was the best yet! With highly dynamic multiplayer gameplay and unique weapons, this is definately a good buy for any FPS lover. And, as an added bonus, it is made by three indie developers! 5*'s everytime!			"

												Verdun gets compared to Red Orchestra a lot and I think that this game would appeal to RO players. Verdun shares some of the weapons selection with RO but this game has a rigid pace and the guns are EXTREMELY lethal (once you get hit, you die and there is no saving you). And that's the fun of this game, it captures the WW1 trench warfare perfectly with the waves of men attacking at the sound of a whistle, the bleak hellish battlefield, and the things that made the battlefield so hellish like gas, machine fire mowing down soldiers, and barbed wire everywhere. The graphic and sound detail are top notch. There is lots of foilage without it hampering the performace, and the little audio details like the clanking of the soldier's gear while he runs is nice. My biggest gripe with this game are the menus and that they tend to make things harder to reach than it should be.The game runs at steady 60 fps for me at medium settings x 1080 on a GTX 750TI.			"

												Fun bolt-action shooter that requires some patience to play and either quick reflexes or a good eye. Strongest part of the game is that it is very team-based; victory predicates on your team working together, not on kills. Guns are fun enough to shoot and have minor variations, but as all rifles are one shot kills, the only real differences are clip size, rate of fire, and sightings. Pistols are fun but useless at range, MG's are powerful and are excellent defensive weapons that must be setup to be useful. There is no need to worry about weapons overheating, however, so they can be a bit lacking in depth. Poison gas is a very cool element of this game and does a great job of mixing up a fight, bringing everyone into close-range shootouts and melees and blocking line of sight. Map selection is limited, but I do believe more are planned. Their individual quality is surprisingly good considering they are mostly made up of pot-holes and trenches. Performance wise Verdun runs OK but tends to have variable performance even on higher end systems with medium graphics settings. Overall a solid purchase for anything under $20. $23 is acceptable, but this is a game you know will go on sale for deep discounts.			"

								I've been waiting for a WWI FPS for years and this is the best that I've been able to find and for what it is right now, despite its flaws, it's pretty effing good.  I've always had a grim fascination with the Great War and think myself to be a bit of a buff.  The guns, classes, the desolation and destruction are all very well done.  The ambient noise (the shouting, the planes flying overhead) can be pretty eerie.  It is patched and updated fairly regularly and I can only see it getting better. One of the best things about it?  From what I've seen, the people who play it/that I've played with are some of the nicest I've encountered in a long time.  That could be worth the price of the game itself.I wish only the absolute best for the Verdun team.  Buy the game.			"

												I first played Verdun when it was in its early stages, the only gameplay available was rifle death match. Even though I was not all too good, I loved the game. When I found it on Steam, getting it was a no brainer. I love this game even more now than I did then. However, this game is not for everyone. If you can't handle dying constantly then you have no business playing Verdun. In Verdun (at least for me) you are dead for just about as much time as you are alive. The weapons it this game are not ""Call of Duty"" type guns either, you can't just go in guns blazing or you will be dying A LOT. However, if you love WWI games or just games that feature fast paced trench warfare, then Verdun is the game for you. The maps are detailed and expansive, as well as difficult. With all this being said, I would strongly recommend that you get this game, it is very fun. If your not sure about whether or not you would like this game, I know YouTube has a good amount of gameplays and tutorials you can watch. I hope you get this game, and I hope to see you on the frontlines!			"

												Alright, here goes another review.I like this game. It is immersive, besides a few glitches here and there, but still pretty cool. I am going to steer clear of the word simulator though.The variations of squads is cool. You have squads for punching through the line, squads for recon, squads for clearing out the trenches. Along with these squads comes with a variation of rifles, pistols, grenades, and equipment. Some of these squads also have Machine gun units as well as Sub Machine gun units. Very nice.The uniforms are nice too. They look worn just as they would after a battle.Although this game is pretty good, it is no where near perfect. In fact, it almost seemes like the devs abandoned the PC version of this game and went in search for gold in the new world of next gen consoles. I'm not sure if I can entirely recomend this game for PC but it seems okay for the next gen. Keep in mind, this is my opinion, and I think the game is good. If you enjoy war games that immerse you as this one does, then you should get it, though I would recomend geting it on a sale. Hope I catch you in game!			"

												Verdun is a great game that hits that sweet spot between realism and annoying ease. The squad system makes the game unique and encourages you to build relationships with the people you're playing with. Unlike most FPS games, there's a lot of patience and tactics that go into attacking AND defending, and if you don't like to wait around, you may not like this game. However, if you have a group of friends who enjoys squad play, this is a great game to get.The biggest downside to the game is the lack of player base; I would also like to see some different game modes, and I hope to see those in the future. At $22, it's a fair price. On sale, it's a steal.			"

Early Access Review
								Verdun is absolutely amazing for an alpha. The game demonstrates trench warfare perfectly, while the whistle blows I'd hop over the trench and charge the enemy under machine gun fire. Once in the trench, the enemy would drop gas and I'd put my gas mask on. Then my squad and I would take the trench and prepare to charge for the next one. It makes me feel like I'm actually there. This game is entirley unique because, sadly, there are barely any fps set in WW1 out right now. Some cons about the game are the fps. I have a high-end gaming rig and I still manage to get 20-40 fps depending on the map. I know this is still in alpha but I'd like it fixed. Some things I'd like to see in the game are aerial dogfights, and more gore. I think it would look awesome to look up and see planes firing at eachother. But I would definetly like to see more blood and gore the most. It would be more immersive to be pinned down in a blood filled with guts flying everywhere, considering how brutal and rutheless WW1 was. Overall, I do recommend this game in it's current state.

								Wow. This game is truly amazing. While it may have some graphical and sound errors, along with a couple buggy animations here and there, it is still a one of a kind first person shooter. Mustard gas, bolt action rifles, machine guns, mortar strikes, trenches. Everything that you'd want from a WWI shooter. It's a great game and I want people to support it so it can get even better.

												I will just tell you who reads this about how I feel about this whole game. I wont be talking about classes and how the game runs, just how it feels for me.So. You sit there in the trench, taking pot shots at the germans on the other side of the no mans land. Your whole squad around you, you got to know them over the training and battles you been in so far. You feel in your gut that sitting in this trench wont be and that you and your friends have to brave death once again.First its the French, the whistle is blown and they storm out of the trench shouting and swearing as machinegun fire and rifle fire destroys their advance. Only their bodies left in the mud. You take a deep breath and as your corporal blows the whistle you rush out from the trench and into no mans land. You run, screaming and shouting with the rest as members of other squads fall around you, luckily the bullets seem to evade just you. You throw yourself in a nearby ditch, picked by the corporal as a rally point. You turn around as see no other in your squad and you assume the worst. Steeling yourself you stand up and run into yet again. No mans land. "

								This game is FANTASTIC. That's not an understatement! It's a squad-based FPS that takes place in the trenches, with many dynamic maps. Not as many maps as I'd like, but i know that they will come out with more maps soon! There are 4 different classes per squad-type. First one is Corporal (at least that's what it is in English!), second one is along the lines of a sniper, third is a Heavy-Gunner (machine gun) and fourth is the dude with the grenades! BOOM! As of now, you can choose to play as Canada, Great Britain, France, and Germany. The countries each have their own weapons and specialties. The devs never cease to amaze me!Hope this review helped,Mega			"

												Finally a good World War 1 game! Experience the great war with all the bolt action, trench warfare, chemical weapon fighting you want! As of this review there are a deathmatch and Front lines. The Front lines game mode requires a little bit more explaining. I am going to quote the wiki here for you guys new to the game. ""Frontlines is the most popular type of match played in Verdun. It is a competition between two teams, one French and one German. Each team has up to sixteen players. Each team is divided into squads of up to four players. The teams alternate between offense and defense (""Attack"" vs ""Defend""). While on offense the team can score a point by capturing the next trench. If the defending team is able to successfully defend their trench from the attack, then they earn a point. The match ends when one team controls the entire map or the timer runs out. ""There is a lot of detail put into Verdun, but it does have a small playerbase at the moment. The game itself reminds me a bit of the Red Orchestra games in a World War 1 setting. Overall I have got to say I really recommend Verdun, its just got what it takes to be a great game!			"

												This has become my go to game for any WW1 video game cravings as it is highly accurate to the historical time period and offers some very good graphics for the eye candy aspect.  The workings of the guns in this game impress me because of all the little details that go into working the gun, for example with the German Schutz  class Kar 98 sniper rifle with a scope the animation shows you having the gun move up as you cycle the bolt since they were not exactly light, straight pull bolts and needed some muscling to cycle them. The sounds and visual effects of the game help with immersion and I can easily play this game for hours without a regret. The general multiplayer community is actually decent and much better than a World of Tanks community for example. Most people aren't confrontational or accusing. Most people just play the game and avoid the world chat which is fine with me. As for lack of players, I haven't had a problem finding games though some of the other game modes besides Frontline can be sparse at times.However I feel the gameplay can feel a bit clunky at times and isn't as smooth as a Battlefield or COD game would be but I don't think it takes away too much from the enjoyability of the game. I think the game would benefit from a larger userbase and maybe smooth out the controls but otherwise I don't see any other problems that would bother me.			"

												One of my few serious reviews. Pros: WW1, very few people do this. They did it right Good graphics, I like all the graphics they are great and very well textured and thought out. I like that a lot. Player to map size is great, although I do want one more squad per map, I feel some maps such as Pircade are a little under populated and not very fun. One more squad would fix that. Wide range of map choices. From hills to forrest, to a fortress. I like that, I like that a lot. Great gunplay, I like how the guns feel and look. They fire accuratley if you hold down shift while looking down. Also when aiming down sight due to your player breathing the scope and gun will move so make sure to shift when aiming down sights when you are about to fire, makes it a lot easier. NO DLCS, yes this is a PLUS. I am sick of paying for a DLC, I hate them. Excluding EU4 dlcs. But Verdun offers so much when it comes to the one time buy. No pay to win, all skill based which is grea too. I am very glad they do not have a DLC. If they do add a DLC I would hope they add the Eastern front as a DLC for 20 dollars I think is a fair price. New maps, guns and factions for that is what I would 100% buy. The gore update is great, I love losing my leg, arm or whatever to a bomb, bullet or nade. I like this a lot. Great sounds, very nice Neutral I am neutral to the player size, as I said one more squad would be a lot better. The maps although good are a bit lacking in some areas but still great. Wish they were more trench like, where you can pier over the side without exposing half your body. Selection of joining a match is good, which they added how much time is left. I hate joining my favorite map and in 30s the round ends, wish they added a timer in the selection menu. Filtering out certain squads. I know you can choose your own however it would be a nice touch to add an ability to filter out certain squads such as Canadians, U.S Marines, etc. Cons: Communication is the worst I have ever seen. No voice, or at least voice that is useful. They need to add localized voice chat, squad chat and squad leader chat to allow squad leads to talk to each other as well as squad members to talk to each other and localized proxy chat. No one reads chat, no one. It takes too long to type in combat and over all the worst I've seen in a game that requires fast paced action. An example of just 30 minutes ago I was in a match in the fort and a German sat in a corner and fired at everyone who ran by. I saw him. However almost everyone went right by him every time. I was talking in team chat and NO ONE payed attention to it. Also those goes for ALL players pay attention to chat please. No campgain however this is a multiplayer game that is expected but if they did add a DLC a campaign would be nice as either German, Americans, French or British would be a great 20 dollar addon that I would buy easily. No rewarding upgrades, I use mostly stock guns because they are so good so for players like me who have a good amount of time in no rewarding guns in higher up levels are any good. Excluding MG and Greandier. Can be a bit glitchy. My other complaint about gore is that you cannot shoot a dead body and it splat blood, I wish you could do that. OverallYes this is a good game, I would recommend buying it for 25 it is worth it, at FULL price. I got this for cheap on sale so I was very lucky and it has TON of replay ability. The devs constanly update it adding a ton of things. Gore is great. I would rate this 8/10. Worth a buy? Yes. "

												French faction is in a game made by indie developers. DICE/EA Have millions but will put them for DLC. But honestly, this game is great. Sure at times it may be glitchy and clunky but my god, the gameplay is actually so much superior than battlefield/COD.... And its a ww1 game. There is more of an emphasis on flanking the enemy and lining up your shot with your bolt action rifle. Every bullet counts. You even have to look at the enemy's uniform to see if they are with you.The landscape,gore,sound effects and attention to detail for the era really highlight the horrors of the Battle of Verdun. Try to have a few friends with this game and enjoy. Yet this game appeals to many people- casuals, arma players and people in between and everyone seems to enjoy it.

												If you're a fan of World War I or of squad based tactical gameplay in general, Verdun is definitely a game worth owning. It's a historically rooted game that display's the horrors of the First World War while allowing you to participate in the full scale battles that many of these men had fought through. Pros
 Real WWI Experience for fans of its history Fast paced gameplay in some areas while maintaining tactical gameplay at other times Intense combat for crazy in-game moments Good amount of classes, squads, weapons, and a variety of other things Maps that throw players into many different scenarios for new experiences Has Replay Value Cons
 Small server population sizes at certain times in the day Ping is high for many far from the source Spawnkilling WILL happen in many cases A lack of tutorial mode or of other better game modes other that Frontlines Squad setup and game finding is slightly frustrating at times No shortage of bugs and glitchesDespite the flaws that are pointed out, this game is still a good experience for those who are willing to play with friends and work together to achieve an ultimate goal as one.

												Verdun is honestly one of the funnest games I've played. It feels different to a lot of other FPS games, not only in the theme but in the gameplay mechanics too. I particularly enjoy the NCO role in squads giving access to command auras and abilities such as mortar strikes, smoke screens, air recon, and gas attacks.It's very fun to play and has a few different gameplay types although I spend a vast majority of my time in the frontlines type in which you fight for control of enemy trenches.The weapons are very fun to use and I feel there is a good and interesting variety, with the vastly different fire rates of weapons, along with the different requirements of no man's land and trench fighting, I feel there is a lot of tactical thinking that can go into gameplay and deciding how and when to take your battles.I really enjoy the team focused elements of the game and I feel that the Verdun community is one of the friendliest and more welcoming communities in online games that I've experienced.Progressing, gaining ranks, medals, etc. All of that is nice as well and gives a real sense of achievement and I often screenshot the scoreboard and my medals when I've done particularly well, and looking at the screenshots in the community hub, I'm not alone in doing this.All in all, it's a very wonderful, sure there is the occasional bug but I feel the developers are pretty good at fixing these and I wouldn't say they impact gameplay much at all.I would definitely recommend Verdun!

I've always had a grim fascination with the Great War and think myself to be a bit of a buff.  The guns, classes, the desolation and destruction are all very well done.  The ambient noise (the shouting, the planes flying overhead) can be pretty eerie.  It is patched and updated fairly regularly and I can only see it getting better. One of the best things about it?  From what I've seen, the people who play it/that I've played with are some of the nicest I've encountered in a long time.

												I layed down holding my rifle tightly as I watched my friends being shredded by enemy fire. We were attempting to take a trench ontop of a hill that ws very important for the battle. I had not yet been spottd for i was laying down in a patch of tall, thick grass. I was about tn feet from the east side of the trench. The trench sprawled to the west for another 100 feet or more. I saw an enemy infantryman behind a tree to my left diagonaly about 10 feet away, him being right infront of the trench. He was facing the other direction. I saw my chance and I took it. I sprinted up to the side of him and pushedd my bayonet as hard as I could Into his side. He died instantly. I then proceeded to run into the trench and crouch down. I saw an enemy about 20 feet awaying coming my way through the trenches. I then layed down and pointed my rifle at the exact possition I was going to shoot him at. I saw him come out and I fired and watched as his lifeless body hit the ground. I stood up and ran, but before I knew what was going on, it was too late. I ran passed an enemy MG and he opened fir on me and I was torn to peices and hit the floor. I Sat there watching as my allies stormed the place. I realized that not only had I sacrificed myself for my team, but also caused a distraction just long enough for my men to take the trench. thats all I thought about as a faded into the after life. Then I respawne and did it again.			"

												Verdun (pronounced Verdan) is a WW1 FPS Action Game. in my personnal review i really recommend this game to other users the gameplay is a BIG 10/10 & the graphics is very well done after it's big visual improvement and i also think this game should add more things to get the game at a better standpoint.

												As a player of the original Red Orchestra mod, I fell in love with Verdun almost immediately.It is dominated by the same, slow, considered bolt-action rifle gameplay that RO-MOD was and it is glorious.The game extremely atmospheric and the maps are excellent. Putting your gas mask on and charging with your squad into a mass of yellow gas as whistles are going off in the background and tommies yelling ""OVER THE TOP BOYS!"" is really quite fun.There is no game quite like it.Worth every penny.

												Fun bolt-action shooter that requires some patience to play and either quick reflexes or a good eye. Strongest part of the game is that it is very team-based; victory predicates on your team working together, not on kills. Guns are fun enough to shoot and have minor variations, but as all rifles are one shot kills, the only real differences are clip size, rate of fire, and sightings. Pistols are fun but useless at range, MG's are powerful and are excellent defensive weapons that must be setup to be useful. There is no need to worry about weapons overheating, however, so they can be a bit lacking in depth. Poison gas is a very cool element of this game and does a great job of mixing up a fight, bringing everyone into close-range shootouts and melees and blocking line of sight. Map selection is limited, but I do believe more are planned. Their individual quality is surprisingly good considering they are mostly made up of pot-holes and trenches. Performance wise Verdun runs OK but tends to have variable performance even on higher end systems with medium graphics settings. Overall a solid purchase for anything under $20. $23 is acceptable, but this is a game you know will go on sale for deep discounts.			"

								I personally recommend this game.Pros:-Eight varied classes with different perks and loadouts that can be unlocked through level progression.-Very engrossing depiction of trench warfare.-Great squad based gameplay.  Friends only make it better.Cons:-Hit detection can go to ♥♥♥♥ sometimes.-Spawn system is a little wonky.-Barbed wire is rediculously deadly.  Seriously, is my guy swallowing handfuls of it whenever he finds some?Interesting:-I now fear the sound of a friendly officer's whistle.So turn up ""Paschendale"" by Iron Maiden and commit atrocities upon your fellow man.

								This is a great game.  Innovative in a way with the trench warfare style of play. The squad based functions are implemented perfectly and once you pick up on how the game works with retreating and advancing, you can use the squad functions to brutal effect.  Overall this is a refreshing take on FPS gameplay, and I highly recommend it. Try to nab it on sale. However, I do believe it is worth buying full price.    P.S .

												Alright, here goes another review.I like this game. It is immersive, besides a few glitches here and there, but still pretty cool. I am going to steer clear of the word simulator though.The variations of squads is cool. You have squads for punching through the line, squads for recon, squads for clearing out the trenches. Along with these squads comes with a variation of rifles, pistols, grenades, and equipment. Some of these squads also have Machine gun units as well as Sub Machine gun units. Very nice.The uniforms are nice too. They look worn just as they would after a battle.Although this game is pretty good, it is no where near perfect. In fact, it almost seemes like the devs abandoned the PC version of this game and went in search for gold in the new world of next gen consoles. I'm not sure if I can entirely recomend this game for PC but it seems okay for the next gen. Keep in mind, this is my opinion, and I think the game is good. If you enjoy war games that immerse you as this one does, then you should get it, though I would recomend geting it on a sale. Hope I catch you in game!			"

												Verdun is a great game that hits that sweet spot between realism and annoying ease. The squad system makes the game unique and encourages you to build relationships with the people you're playing with. Unlike most FPS games, there's a lot of patience and tactics that go into attacking AND defending, and if you don't like to wait around, you may not like this game. However, if you have a group of friends who enjoys squad play, this is a great game to get.The biggest downside to the game is the lack of player base; I would also like to see some different game modes, and I hope to see those in the future. At $22, it's a fair price. On sale, it's a steal.			"

												I first played Verdun when it was in its early stages, the only gameplay available was rifle death match. Even though I was not all too good, I loved the game. When I found it on Steam, getting it was a no brainer. I love this game even more now than I did then. However, this game is not for everyone. If you can't handle dying constantly then you have no business playing Verdun. In Verdun (at least for me) you are dead for just about as much time as you are alive. The weapons it this game are not ""Call of Duty"" type guns either, you can't just go in guns blazing or you will be dying A LOT. However, if you love WWI games or just games that feature fast paced trench warfare, then Verdun is the game for you. The maps are detailed and expansive, as well as difficult. With all this being said, I would strongly recommend that you get this game, it is very fun. If your not sure about whether or not you would like this game, I know YouTube has a good amount of gameplays and tutorials you can watch. I hope you get this game, and I hope to see you on the frontlines!			"

								Verdun is absolutely amazing for an alpha. The game demonstrates trench warfare perfectly, while the whistle blows I'd hop over the trench and charge the enemy under machine gun fire. Once in the trench, the enemy would drop gas and I'd put my gas mask on. Then my squad and I would take the trench and prepare to charge for the next one. It makes me feel like I'm actually there. This game is entirley unique because, sadly, there are barely any fps set in WW1 out right now. Some cons about the game are the fps. I have a high-end gaming rig and I still manage to get 20-40 fps depending on the map. I know this is still in alpha but I'd like it fixed. Some things I'd like to see in the game are aerial dogfights, and more gore. I think it would look awesome to look up and see planes firing at eachother. But I would definetly like to see more blood and gore the most. It would be more immersive to be pinned down in a blood filled with guts flying everywhere, considering how brutal and rutheless WW1 was. Overall, I do recommend this game in it's current state. I'm sure the devs will fix the fps issue and add more content later on. I rate 8/10.			"

												The game is very similar to Red Orchestra II, as it consists of holding and attacking cap points within the game. It is also similar in its realism. One shot with a bolt action rifle will kill you, while the game makes you reload each individual bullet into your rifles. It's not fast paced like BF or Call of Duty, this game is much more realistic and hardcore. It's unforgiving, relentless, but very rewarding if you have the patience to learn the maps, work together as a team, and figure out the different weapons. Right now there are eight maps on Frontlines, which is the main game mode where you attack and defend positions. There are several squads to choose from, such as Americans, Canadians, Belgians or French. Each squad has its own unique classes such as sharpshooters or machinegunners. Weapon upgrades can be unlocked using experience points gained within the game. I highly recommend this game. It's a good alternative to arcade shooters like Battlefield or Call of Duty, and essentially the only WWI shooter out right now. 10/10 would WWI again.			"

But yes.. this game has its place and it has defnitely really high value.. you can feel that ppl that made this didnt make it for money but out of passion and it is oozing from it.. prepare for clunky engine and kinda clunky gameplay tho.

								This game perfectly captures the absolute pants ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boredom that was experienced during the actual Great War. Long drawn out battles with hilariously inaccurate bolt-action rifles, a complete lack of charges, and general phyrric victories are commonplace in Verdun.For whatever reason, I quite enjoy it, and I think the rifle deathmatches are fun.8/10			"

												This shows the true gunfights of World War I, unlike Battlefield 1, which is full of intense action with guns that existed on blueprints,  Verdun's gunfights can be slow or fast.   This game should be more popular than Call of Duty Infinite Warfare.  10/10			"

												The game is very similar to Red Orchestra II, as it consists of holding and attacking cap points within the game. It is also similar in its realism. One shot with a bolt action rifle will kill you, while the game makes you reload each individual bullet into your rifles. It's not fast paced like BF or Call of Duty, this game is much more realistic and hardcore. It's unforgiving, relentless, but very rewarding if you have the patience to learn the maps, work together as a team, and figure out the different weapons. Right now there are eight maps on Frontlines, which is the main game mode where you attack and defend positions. There are several squads to choose from, such as Americans, Canadians, Belgians or French. Each squad has its own unique classes such as sharpshooters or machinegunners. Weapon upgrades can be unlocked using experience points gained within the game. I highly recommend this game. It's a good alternative to arcade shooters like Battlefield or Call of Duty, and essentially the only WWI shooter out right now. 10/10 would WWI again.			"

												Verdun is a real keeper.  Rarely does a game make me swear, panic, cry 'tears of joy' and make me ♥♥♥♥ myself all with in a 3 second period. I have played a lot of Red Orch 2 and this is the next best thing.  They are very similar in the way the 'frontlines' game mode, but Verdun is much more squad based and obviously in trenches.  One of the most immersive FPS games I own tbh.  As a seasoned FPS player this game was very easy to pick up and much more challenging and immersive than the likes of some AAA shooters out there today.			"

												If you get this game expecting Call of Duty or Battlefield, turn back now. This is not a run and gun type of game. Sure, sometimes you will find yourself running into an enemy trench with your guns blazing, but not often. Employ tactics one use in most modern shooters and you will find youself dead very quickly. And even if you are super careful, you will die a lot. You will move carefully between cover, utilizing shellholes and other defenses to make your way to the enemy trench. Any second you might be seen and shot at. You are just meters from the enemy trench, and you are preparing to make your charge in an attempt to help capture it. A shot flies past you and you duck behind the nearest cover, cowering as bullets fly overhead as the enemy tries to nail you. In a few seconds the bullets stop, and you rise again to rush into the trench. This is it, this is your chance to kill some enemies and establish a foothold for your teammates to exploit. You rush into the trench with your rifle at the ready and are swiftly cut down by an enemy who was lying in wait. You respawn, and you get to do it all over again!It actually is a really fun game. This isnt a game about k/d ratios. Its about teamwork. Without teamwork, your team will likely lose. Thankfully, unlike some other games, this game rewards teamwork. For example, each squad has a team leader. The rest of the team can spawn on him, so a good team leader will sneak up close to the enemy trench and then hide, letting his squad spawn in really close to the frontlines. He wont rush in guns blazing, because he will likely die quickly and not be there for his squad to spawn in on him. If you are willing to put the team and the objective above your own stats, you will love this game. If not, I suggest moving on.			"

												Take the excellent shooting mechanics that Call of Duty developed over a decade, add a dash of realism, the crisp graphics of this year's latest shooter, and base it around a game where team work and cooperation is vital and you have Verdun.This generation's answer to the big-budget, big explosion shooter, Verdun goes back to the roots of historical shooters by offering dozens of period accurate bolt-action rifles and cutting back on the pyro-technics and kill streaks. Verdun isn't without its explosions though as every new player will find out when they are on the receiving end of a massive creeping artillery barrage that forces them to hug the dirt and claw over thier squadmates to find a safe place to hide.Being historically based this game focuses less on team balancing, certain nations just have benefits. The allies will have a better time being on the receiving end of a gas attack as their masks have large single pane lenses, while the German's are forced to use lenses held together by solder, obscuring vision even more. However, the Allies, often have rifles and machine guns that lagged behind some of the cutting edge weaponry of the Germans (including flamethrowers, box fed machineguns, and a high-caliber anti-tank rifle).My personal favourite ascpect of the game is the reliance on teamwork, you wiil actually get to know people you play with. Kill/death ratio amount for such a small amount of the score that they are almost irrelevant. A player can have almost no kills but be the highest scoring player in the match because they supported thier team and took the most ground.If you want a shooter with great graphics and sound, historical accuracy (for a game), and are looking for a cooperative experience, this is for you.

								Verdun. A game that describes the first World War, this is a truly amazing game even though its in beta, this is definitely a game worth you´r money when its on sale and when its on its base price, the battles moving from the Fields of Flanders, Picardie, to the forests of Argoness, attacking and defending on the map from you´r trenches to the enemy, this game has smartly implented combat like in World War 1, on the maps there´re muiltple layers of defense line with cordinated defense making it almost impenetrable. i recommend this game anyone who like realistic first person shooters what requirs teamwork and good cordination, this is surely a great game for anyone who likes both World Wars, the negative things are not many in my opinion, this game is definitely misssing a report button as i saw people with numerious buthurt comments, also a clan option would be nice as this is a game about teamwork, the prone and crouch movements should be lowerd as it more feels like a cod game with the movements, this is overall a great game and i give personly 8,5/10 from what the beta already has to offer8,5/10 a good game i you have money to spare			"

								Sitting in my trench listening to everyone yelling at each other, hearing shot's land too close to my position I move down the line. Next thing I know chlorine gas explodes on my positon and i hear the pitter patter of at least a squad of men coming towards my position. I slip on my gas mask while listening to my squad get wiped out, out of nowhere two whole squads of germans coming charging in down the trench with their mace's and bayonet's swinging away. I yell holy ♥♥♥♥ and proceed to run away while hip firing my Lewis gun at the charging Schnitzel's, as i start to change my magazine while still being chased I realised I had loss track of two of the charging men and then out of nowhere two German's coming flying into the trench in front of me and proceed to bash my skull in with their maces.10/10 would be slaughtered again			"

												If you're a vintage war enthusiast like myself and cried when you saw Battlefield 1 gameplay then this game is the game for you!For years people said that it couldnt be done. A world war 1 infantry shooter? They would call you crazy, Yet here we are. It's enjoyable, It's fun, and It's pretty historically accurate.You should try it to at least say you have played the only WW1 shooter in exsistence and when people say ""that's not true what about bf1?"" You can just laugh at them and walk away.			"

HighlightsOne of the most intense and realistic FPS set in an historical era, in this case the unexplored World War I. It has the perfect combination of realism and acion, giving us something close to Red Orchestra. It features big maps inspired by historical battlefields, a good amount of weapons, and a lot of different squads, each one with 4 soldiers with their unique habilities.Pros:-Realistic, and an extreme attention to details-Immersive (among the best voice acting I've ever seen)-Good variety of weapons, squads, maps...Cons:-It's really hard to get used to this game. One hit kills, and it can lead to frustration-The squad exp system is interesting, but punishes solo players (a little bit)			"
