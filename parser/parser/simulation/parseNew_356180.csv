Early Access Review
								While the game gives you a good start experience, it quickly gets boring and repetitive.The game is too short and have less than two hours of gameplay. I think, for the lack of content, its quite expensive on its actual state and seeing how slow progress, it seems that this game wont ever be anything great.Of those two hours of gameplay we must take into account that its really a lot less. The game itself contains only two very small levels which you cant even explore freely because you get magically teleported back. Those two hours of gameplay its only due the slow pace at which the game tells you what to do on every step. There is nothing chagenging at all, no way to do something wrong. You just simply obey and push the button that you are told.The game gest boring easily when you notice that no matter which tool you will use to ""get"" data, it still the same on every case and all of them just make you go near the dinosaur and click a button. Its also pretty sad that lacks any kind of exploration. All you do is move in a little ""pool"" with only two species of dinosaurs which arent even interesting to start. Their behavior is also pretty bad done. They often go inside rocks or even out of water. It doesnt matter how agressive they are, they will hardly eat you due their limited IA that makes them swim in circles around you before even being able to reach you with their mouth. Which isnt even a problem as you never die, just get teleported few meters back.To be a game where you mostly watch like if it were a documentary, the lack of content as well as the environment makes you dont want to play for long. There is absolutely nothing to explore, it lacks something impressive to watch. I wish it had some cool under the sea structures like caves, coral rifts, dark deep areas, etc.. but no. Something pretty annoying is the blue effect. Im not sure why everything inside water is blue, water isnt blue after all. It should be pretty dark on the deepest areas.Also, take into account, that half of the game duration is based on the first level which is the free demo that you can download anytime. I recommend you to download that and play, you wont get ""more"" from playing the actual game anyway. I have spent more time and felt more realistic just playing the demo Neptune Flux which gives you a way more inmersion than this ""3D museum simulator"".Despite of being an early access game, if we take into account its price, we are just looking to a very poor game. I got very impressed by the demo because it looked like a nice start for a cool game. Then you realize that all the game have to offer is just that simply start.EDIT==========Since the devs have shown some interest on my review, Ill add here what they requested from me:To Rommel:Freedom of exploration: This should be key for such game but the space its too limited and doesnt really require you to explore too much.Amount of actions possible: We should be able to do more than just obei orders. The game should require some important interactions, to make the player responsible of diffrent success. You cant do what you want or in the order that you want. You have to stick with the instructions and thats not funny. It may be good for kids but not for everyone. People needs to feel that they control the situation, that they can take decisions that will have different effects. Not everything should be ""look at this and press the button"". It should be different kind of ""missions"" to accomplish. For example, protecting certain kind of specie, escaping from some dangerous area, being cautuous of not being discovered by some predators while finding a key item lost in the deep, etc..Realism: The game had a lot of immersion to me. There is just one thing that isnt totally right. The deep should be dark, in fact, mostly pitch black and not blue. Blue its what you see near the surface but could be really awesome to have some levels on the totally dark being able to just see a couple of meters in front of you while your radar its broken and you have no idea what huge creature its out there. The rest of graphics seemed fine to me besides of being a bit repetitive and lacking details (there should be more life, more plants, etc...).Sense of danger: It doesnt exist. Once you realize that its ok if a dinosaur eats you because you just will respawn some meters behind, you stop worrying for everything which makes the game boring. You simply cant die or lose.Pace: This factor at the begining isnt an issue as you still learning. But after a while, you notice that you not just have to follow every step that someone its telling you but you also need to do take the time for it. You cant go faster and everything happens in the same order always. What if you could do B before A? What if you could do just B and skip A? You cant and hence, there is no consequences. Playing a game where there is zero freedom or no error makes it boring.In conclusion,the game had a nice idea to start. What seemed like a relaxing travel collecting date seems to be an illusion that breaks once something strange happens and you dont know where you are. But all that ends there as once you ""recover"" you go back to the same boring tasks. Heck, what should be the most awesome work recollecting and exploring prehistoric landscapes ends being the most boring job. Its like working on Jurassic Park but being delegated to clean the toilets not being able to see a single dinosaur.Just make the game fun, give some action, let people get scared of going alone in the dark depths of the sea, make possible to explore everything and discover new dinosaurs and vegetation as well as new secret places, and above all, let people fly out of the water and explore others areas.

Early Access Review
								This game has been a fantastic introction for me to VR and i am becoming quite a proficiant mini sub pilot. The VR graphics are amazing, a real sense of actually being there with all the vulnerability that would accompany that. It can also be a great tool for people who suffer from a fear of heights and want a program that de sensitises them.I have discovered that the Time Machine VR game is great for getting the old acrophobia going. When you are at the base station which is sometime in the future there is a building made from steel girders etc with towers supporting satelite dishes. Land the pod at the front or back of the building then get out of the pod by simply standing up ( for this game you are seated) then take a step forward. From then on it feels like you are standing outside. Then using the controls on the X Box controller move straight up slowly to the roof of the building, it feels like you are on an elevator platform and totally exposed. If you have a fear of heights i guarantee this will get your palms sweating. When you are on the roof do a simulated walk around the perimeter of the building and if you dare have a look down. I could hardly do it to start with and the feeling i get is exactly the same as if i was really on top of a building. Iv just tried it today and i am just starting to get used to the feeling. I am going to do this for around one hour per day then when i can eventually do it without fear i will put the de sensitisation theory to the test by walking around somewher high in the real world. I would imagine that this part of the game was not intended for what i am using it for but it certainly generates the same fear as i get in the real world. Imagine what the develoers could could put together if they intended it to be a therapeutic tool, maybe a one for the futer eh?			"

												Would you like to marvel at the massive marine beasts of the past? I know I would. I jumped at the chance at trying this interactive learning experience. Instead After a few hours exploring Im dissapointed at how badly the scanning system, which is the core ""game play"" mechanic in ""Time Machine VR"" has been implimented. After the 10th time trying to scan and capture the feeding behaviour of a massive sea beast that I was clearly scanning, but for some (unexplained) reason Time Machine VR was telling me I wasnt, had me exiting in frustration. Couple this with every gamer's nightmare, the unskippable exposition scene! and I was wondering A: had these guys played a game before never mind developing one and B: why these eye rollingly rudimentary problems are following us into the brave new world of VR and stinking it up like 200 tons for rotting dino-fish.Not polished enough to recommend but nice models and animations are worth seeing, just not at this price, so just try the demo instead.*Update* Now tested on Vive and has horrible graphical latency, conclusion: AVOID			"

Early Access Review
								Having spent the past 15 years of my life sculpting life-size dinosaurs for theme parks it's fair to say I'm quite the fan of prehistoric monsters so buying this game was a no brainer. Time Machine VR is pretty much everything I want from a VR experience being both educational and thrilling (seriously the Pilosaurus scares the crap outta me). The headtracking is very smooth and I haven't experienced any nausea. As it's early access there are a few bugs here and there but doesn't detract from the experience, also runs great on my modest GTX680. Overall it's been one of my favourite experiences so far on the DK2 and well worth the asking price. Eagerly looking forward to what future updates bring.			"

												Its a good game, not great due to a few factors (Vive related).  I would recommend it though.  Pro: Pretty good looking game, although no AA.  I understand they are worried about frame level droppage.       Re-allignment is easy since its not a room scale gameCons:I don't like that when you load it drops back to the HTC Vive main room.  You should keep the user in the gameat all times even when loading.  Just show a picture of one of the creatures or something.  The controls for the HTC (touchpad right side mainly) are not accurate enough.  You should give the user an option to calibrate.  Driving the pod takes some getting use to.  I want to move my hands to far in each directionYou don't let the user explore, or if I'm lost trying to find the pad you say ""Out of area"" and throw us back at the start.  We are capable of going out far and we are sure capable of back tracking :) don't take the freedom away from the user.Its still fun to explore and I'm sure any dino loving kid will just have a blast!

												It's a really great concept, educational and fun, however if you suffer from motion sickness this may be one to avoid.I've played most of the top titles available on the Vive and haven't suffered motion sickness on any until now. After 20 mins of playing and thoroughly enjoying the game the motion sickness started. I believe it's due to the game being seated and the gliding motion of the pod. I'm still very keen to play the game and will probably stick to one mission at a time.			"

								This is a really cool game. I love how I can analyze old underwater monsters and its extremely scary to do so. The textures on the ground surfaces can be pretty bad but at the same time this is VR and because it's VR it still looks cool.Of course this is early access and there are hud issues including not being able to press continue when I pause the game for a while.

												This game isn't worth it. That's the TL;DR, right there. Even after the sale price I feel like i've been robbed.So, quick rundown:Pros:- Fantastic graphics- Moderate scientific accuracyCons:- Lack of content- Childish appeal - Lack of free roaming whatsoever- Confusing/Buggy movement controlsI wish I could say ""There's a lot more minor details,"" but there's not. There's really just not. There's 4 levels, each of which may take you a half hour at most. So two hours of gameplay for... thirty dollars. Jesus christ. You there, you, yes, you reading this. Let me ask you, do you honestly think you're going to get a lot out of a game that takes 2 hours to play entirely, and do you think it's worth 30$? For god's sake look at EVERYBODY writing a review. Good, bad, funny, doesn't matter. NOBODY (at least, as far as I looked) has more than 10 hours. Nobody. Granted, VR is a developing field and there's a lot of games that you could say the same for, but they're treated as betas, or early access. They have dedicated developers, strong concepts and organisation, and in some cases, even an ear towards the community. I can't tick a single one of these boxes for Time Machine VR. And it's really a shame, too. I have so much of a dinosaur and prehistoric animal addiction that I should see a therapist, and I knew that I was taking a risk in buying this game. I KNEW that there was a good chance everything went to♥♥♥♥♥♥ But something made me believe past the reviews, past the people who warned me, and past every god damn obvious flaw in this ♥♥♥♥♥torm that we call a game. It's honestly shameful that the devs sell this for 30$ and can get away with it just because it's a VR game. So allow me to make this simple for those who want to have another TL;DR: DON'T BUY THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME.I REPEAT: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.I know what you're thinking, ""I love marine life/dinosaurs/getting ♥♥♥♥ed by negligent developers (go see TheHunter: Primal)!"" But not only will this game♥♥♥♥♥♥all over and abuse the fact that you believed their game could entertain you, it goes so far beyond the definition of developers screwing you over that I can't even say ""getting ♥♥♥♥ed"" is appropriate.So if you take away ONE GOD DAMN THING from this review, let it be this: No matter what you think, no matter what you hope, this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥and it will stay that way.If it goes on sale for 5$, or hell, even 10$... Then you can CONSIDER it if you REALLY want the game.			"

												This game is a colossal cheek. 30€ for about 3 hours of gameplay - 2 if you rush through and don't let your wife try the first level :D ... I know demos that have more content. 2 hours is like... well it is like a game-selling platform would choose this amount of time to allow you to refund, right?Obviously, some game developers have gotten into sort of a gold rush when they can label ""vr"" on their early design studies. In the long term, this will ruin the VR experience for many gamers and put studios which behave like this on the gamers' personal blacklists. By that it will harm those studios more than they can profit in the long run.Now to the game: It is ""ooohkaay"", and I was totally fine if it was priced like 10€. Basically, you float around in a spherical whatever and tag ancient fish. It is one of those ""go there, do that"" games, where a voice tells you exactly which button to push and you are not allowed to go any other way. It is so flat, that it even continues the game if you fail to do a job without any penalty. (e.g. [spoiler ahead] it does simply continue if you do not scan the mark on the stone circle or if you do not distract the ""shark""-o-saurus (forgot the name) while your pod is recharging in those between-the-levels sequences).When it comes to education, this game is awesomely shallow as well. The voice gives you some basic information about the faunae that you are scanning. Neither do you actually explore any interesting behavior (except tasks like ""scan while eating"") nor do you have enough species and interactions to call it anything else than shallow. Even ""farland"" (free title on the Oculus Rift) is more interesting, although completely based in fiction.The immersion is ok, but not grand. The gfx and model details do not look very up-to-date to me. I felt much more awe in titles like Subnautica (and even on my flat screen), although Subnautica is pretty much at the beginning of its vr implementation and sometimes feels a bit shaky.Although I do not suffer from gaming sickness and tho' cannot fully judge this, I think this game does this one job pretty well here. You move slow paced, stay aligned to the horizon, and there is always some ""grid"" of your pod visible in your peripheral view.Stability: The game forced me to take off the Oculus Rift at every single launch to push an OK button when windows requests permission to run a network shell script, for whatever reason. It crashed two times during gameplay. Virtually I spent more time restarting than playing. And by now I spent nearly as much time in this review as it took me to complete the game.			"

												Time Machine VR was one of the best experiences with the HTC VIVE that I had.If you are interested in prehistoric underwater creatures and always wanted to see a dinosaur for yourself, this game takes you right there.You can swim with some of the most famous prehistoric predators and learn about them in the course of it. You should not expect a hardcore action game here, the focus is on observing the target and learning about its behaviour. And this is where the game does a great job, it gives you as much time as you like just trying to wrap your head around how huge these animals were. I can imagine programs like this in future schools. This game might just be a pioneer educational VR applications. I have to say I dont really understand some of the other reviews complaining about the controls. The controls are explained at the start and I didnt have any problems with them. Quite the contrary, I've become very fond of them. This game has the courage to let you move around other than the teleport mechanic so many other vr games use. It offers its own solution to moving in a wide vr surrounding with the limited space you have at home. If you ever wanted to swim with a dinosaur, this is the experience for you. It is true that the graphics are not as polished as theBlu, but after all you move around in a larger surrounding. But nevertheless this game made some childhood dreams of mine come true.			"

												It looks pretty and worth your time (for the moment), but it feels rather repetitive. Plus once you go through all of the portals, the story is ""technically"" done, and then in order to reach 100%, it becomes a grind where you literally have to scan everything to get there... It's cool to begin with, but the ""10 hours"" of gameplay will literally be ""two hours of interesting content"" then probably ""8 hours of grind"" at least that's what it appears to look like... If that is also the case, the price is rather high.Plus, don't expect to see any land creatures. It's all annoyingly underwater...			"

I was watching my son play Time Machine VR and based on the media provided on the store page I thought he was going to jump or get scared but instead both of us were very bored. This game has very little action besides taking snapshots which again to me was a big let down. For kids younger than 10 then this would be a nice game, but otherwise I do not recommend.			"

												Great idea, fun and educational and a well designed seated experience. A few suggestions though; the Vive controls for strafing and turning should be swapped, the left trigger should move the pod (including strafing) and the left touchpad should rotate the pod. In addition to being more intuitive this would add the possibility to rotate vertically (maybe an option for advanced players).Secondly, when loading new areas the player is often briefly sent back to Steam's VR lobby. If possible try keep the player inside the pulsating pod while loading. Lastly, I realise that VR is very resource intensive but adding more graphical effects like particles, god rays and more flora would be great for those who can run it.Otherwise, the pod concept with it's subtle hexagonal grid is a very immersive experience. I hope to see more games from this developer in future.			"

The controls can be a bit hard to get used to, and I've got a few nitpicks here and there regarding the story and gameplay, but I'm able to overlook all of that because this game is quite literally a dream come true for me.

Early Access Review
								Good Start to the game, but definitely an Early Access Title.It currently spans about 3 missions, only taking about 2 hours to complete, but contains quite a bit of content from voice/video acting and gorgeus models of the aquatic fauna. Do not expect however the tracked motion controllers to work properly, so using the Gamepad is quite a neccessity, and is designed to be a seated experience.The plus:- Movement is nailed down quite well for for the xbox controller - Can be played as a seated experience with the Vive without issues- The Aquatic Fauna rock- Video / Audio are swell- Some mystery in story aside from the ""Go save us by going to the past"".However, there are down sides to this:- As of this moment its short and ends with to be continued.- Some of the environments feel a bit stale and could use more flora: There also are some wierd blobs when one is looking into the depths, but these could be probably more emphesized as something projected by the UI.- Could use some more tension like in the first non-training mission, or could be switched up a bit to put the more relaxed ones before the first one.- Unlocking the shutters should be done a bit faster.- No proper support for motion controls (so why is it listed with such?)Those aside, Waiting to see more, and I can recommend this anyone looking for an experience.

								If you need a reason to justify a VR headset that doesn't involve space based dogfighting then this game is the best example I've seen so far as to what a VR game can be. It has excellent controls, minimal nausea inducing gameplay unless you start spinning your sub like crazy. Overall a very fun game that I hope continues to add content. The only complaint that comes to mind is that the Avatar looks to have a rather emaciated body either that or I'm stuck in the body of a bean pole adolescent.			"

												This is the first game I've felt compelled to review. It was annoying to control, and the challenges weren't really fun, and the writing was uninteresting.

												Time Machine VR! A game about looking closer into dinosaurs. I have seen reviews of people saying ""It is more for someone who is scientific or is intersted about the way these animals lived rather than those who want to get eaten by a dinosaur"" this is not true. I purchased this game because despite all the bad reviewed I thought ""Its a dinosaur VR game, how could this possibly be bad?"" and I was right. This game does have a scientfic side to it but for me, this does not change the experience. Going into the mouth of a whale type dinosaur was terrifying and one of the most unique experiences on VR. If you have no interest with the facts of dinosaurs but just want to get face to face with them, this game is still for you! Absolutely terrifying and fun.There are a few bad things though, the controls suck. It uses the VIVE controller but trying to control the pod I find super hard, especially when you have to scan the eye of a moving dinosaur. There is not that clear of a tutorial, I only found out about an hour after playing that if you press the right side button on the VIVE controller it highlights all dinosaurs around you... this would have been helpful. And the final bad thing is how you have to scan etc.. it is hard enough to get in line with a moving dinosaur but you have to be literally right next to the eye if that is what you want to scan and I find it more than a struggle to keep a good distance to continue a scan. RATE: 9/10			"

												Controls felt very clunky with the vive and as such I had a lot of issues just trying to get through the first mission of the game.  In game videos made me feel like I was on a bad amusement park ride instead of jumping through time to see dinos.  Also this game was a seated experiance only which threw me off since it does support motion controls.  All in all I returned the game, it was not what I'm looking for in a VR dinosaur game.			"

												So, let me start by saying that this game is not Call of Duty.  If you are expecting something like that then this is not the game for you.  This game is more of I guess you could call it an educational game but it really isn't.  If you are like me and like to watch documantaries and you like archeology and anything science then I would highly recommend checking out this game.  It is a lot of fun to play and it is absolutely mind blowing to be able to see these prehistoric creatures up close and personal.  Yes some of the other reviews are correct when they say that it is basically just follow directions and go forward but that isn't always a bad thing.  I guess the best analogy I could use would be to say that this game plays almost like an interactive documentary on prehistoric animals but in first person perspective with a VR headset.  I am someone who loved shows like Planet Earth and Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey.  So something like this is VR gold to me.  This game really is a lot of fun to play.  You would be doing a disservice to yourself and to VR if you skipped this game.			"

								it's a good VR experience, there's something to do, not just go around, but it's basically boring and ""slow"".Maybe a faster Pod would make things better.What I'm really disappointed about is the lack of ""presence feeling"" many other demos/games have in VR.It just feels something is missing in the recipe. Maybe it's because it's just too slow.Plus now I've developed a very good tollerance to VR, didn't feel dizzy at all with Time Machine VR,because it has graphical references points like your phisical pody, hands and the ""pod glass"".It sounds weird that so many people feels sick with this.One more thing: the in game UI is awful but works great and it's very well designed. Just hope it will get better graphically.			"

								Played the demo for this and instantly bought it. The headtracking, amazingly smooth, graphics look beautiful in the rift. Its noticable this is in early access, I really hope the story arc gets more and more added, more levels, creatures, mechanics. Even at its current state I would recomend this game to anyone with an oculus rift as it is an absolutely fantastic experience that everyone should be able to play at somepoint! The only complaint I have about this is the fact that creatures can swim through rocks as if they werent there most of the time, so that makes scanning them rather tricky sometimes as if you have to scan one particular creature and its out of the map in some rocks... its a tad annoying but you get to see the amazing scenery so its all good~ I dont think its planned but the ability to see some land creatures would be nice but aquatic creatures is absolutely amazing anyway. You get an amazing sense of scale when playing this, like in the first part you have to swim into this massive creatures mouth. I felt like a tiny fish compared to it. An amazing experience, well worth the money as well. I know there is some complaints with keyboard and mouse support, personally I think a controller is the way forwards for vr games anyway so I have always used the controller. Nice to see though that the developers are adding things like keyboard support though which they may have already added when I type this tbh xD. But this game, 10/10 best oculus rift experience I have ever had.			"

Early Access Review
								This was my first underwater virtual experience with the Oculus Rift and it blew me away. I love the feeling of truly being submerged underwater. The graphics are beautiful, and I can't wait to see what it looks like and how it feels on the commercial release of the Oculus hardware.I do have several criticisms however, especially as it pertains to the game moving forward. While there is a good amount of content in Early Access so far, I can see this getting very montonous if the entire game is underwater, or even if the character is always limited to his pod. I understand that this is part of the game, but it will get annoying quick, trust me. Also, for the above-water parts, I truly believe the character should be walking/running as opposed to hovering in his time caspule. It may serve better to confine those parts to within one building. There isn't really a need to fly over the entire landscape here. Perhaps once as part of a visual effect, but not as a long-term game feature. The pod moves far too slowly. I can see the speed of the pod being doubled, especially since you can always slow down time to catch up with the creatures you're going to be scanning.Also, I hope we visit new environments! Not just time periods with dinosaurs, but perhaps with prehistoric mammals, and even important human events throughout history. Perhaps there are other researchers looking to utilize this technology? Political and social scientists? Anthropologists?I wish you all the best. Good luck!			"

Early Access Review
								I would describe TIme Machine VR as an educational game (rather than a gamey educational experience) where you travel around in an underwater probe to study the marine creatures in the Jurasic period. It is mission based with an original plot that justifies your presence in the game - you are not merely an observer. Although it is ""early access"" they have developed a good backstory and some interesting gameplay mechanics. The visuals are quite well done and I felt more presence than in most of the demos I have tried for the Oculus DK2. Scooting around in the little probe and seeing the surface of the water high above and the sea bed below and around you is very immersive - everything feels really big. I felt quite vulnerable when the larger dinosaurs got close! The game looks very promissing so far and runs very smoothly on a 780Ti, but there is still plenty to improve on.My main beef is with the lack of colliders in the sea bed. The dinosaurs often swim straight through solid rock, even dissapearing completely and this looks really bad. I hope the developers concentrate on fixing that before adding any more content.Secondly is the probe/submarine movement. While this is not unrealistic for an underwater vehicle, the top speed and especially the turning speed are too slow for the required gameplay. I found myself spending a lot of time turning in circles trying to chase a target and it eventually made me a little nauseous.There are other smaller gameplay issues that will be easily ironed out, like sometimes it isn't clear which scan method you are supposed to use, but nothing really gamebreaking.tldr:Immersive early access game that looks good and runs judderfree (on a 780Ti). Needs to improve animations  before adding more content to make a full game.  "

								This is a game designed from the ground up for VR and it shows.  The movement in game is gentle enough to provide a comfortable experience for most people, and the game's premise of underwater exploration is perfectly suited to the sense of wonder that a good VR experience can generate.On my Win 10 setup with DK2 on an nVidia 780TI the game rarely drops below the ultra-smooth 75 FPS so judder is rare - although most common in the mission hub environment, so don't be put off by the hub experience, the rest is great.A good use of a control scheme (X-Box One Controller is perfect) and VR headset to provide an imersive interactive experience inspiring a sense of wonder.  Some minor glitches but ultimately very stable for an early access release and strongly recommended to anyone with a DK2.			"

I'm just not impressed and at a price tag of 16.99 CAD there is at least 16 great games in my library that could have been purchased all together giving 10s if not 100s of combined hours of enjoyment for the exact same total... okay maybe on steam sales that happen like everyday...

												I enjoyed this game, The flight model and small craft is really cool and the locomotion is nailed, You start off in an area that you can fly your craft (in the air) and this is the best looking part of the game, It has the teleportation circles to the four game levels, yes only four! I finished the game in 2 hours and was like ""Is that it!"", All the Dino's look great but the underwater levels look really poor quality, I did not know they had grass on the sea bed in the Jurrassic period?, Their is next to no life apart from your target Dino, It really is a big let down that the levels are so baron and boring, Scanning the Dino's with your multi tools can be fun and challanging and it's made easier as you can stop time at the right moment. I like the game and it's concept but their is just not enough content to warrant the price, You are hand held all the way through and it feels like one long tutorial and then its over before it's started. I think the mechanics and flight system could make an interesting multiplayer fight game!, All in all get it on budget. 3 out of 5.			"
