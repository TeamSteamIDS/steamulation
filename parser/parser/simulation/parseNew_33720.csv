												Kudos to Steam for making this work on Windows 10! This was one of my favorite child hood games. It is definitely a mellow game for your inner child. Its fun to treat the animals and take care of them over night and each day and go to town to buy medicine or go to classes to learn how to treat different animals. You can also shop for horses and train your horse which is nice for getting around and taking care of. I suggest getting a 2k loan right away and getting 1k advertisements and going to school to learn how to treat cats right off the bat. Also I love how you see the animals hunger and thirst fill while they are eating is a nice touch. A tip for you guys is to save your game twice a day just to be safe.			"
