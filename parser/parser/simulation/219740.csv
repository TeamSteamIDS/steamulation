												One of my absolute favorite games. It's quite a challenging game, especially until you get the hang of things. It's a dark, twisted survival game where pretty much everything is trying to kill you. You've got to scavenge, build things, and defend yourself, all while trying to pay attention to the environment (weather) and the fullness of your stomach. The developers also seem to be constantly updating the game and adding huge amounts of awesome content for free. It just keeps expanding and you just keep wanting to play again and again. Highly recommended!October 2014 Edit: Multiplayer is coming to Don't Starve! It's currently in closed beta at the moment, but should be coming along eventually!			"

												Don't Starve is one of the games I will never forget!I'm sure you ask yourself why? Let me explain:When I saw the game I were like ,,Naahhhh I'm not going to buy this.'' but a few days later I looked a second time and tought ,,Why not?It looks funny. And it says you can celebrate with your piggy friends.''  that was when I bought it. I can tell you I got addicted to the game. The first day I played 12 h's. I told my brother and my friend they should buy it. They did it and got addicted, too. I think nearly every Computer can run the graphics and the the characters are funny, too. With every game I started a new story war born. For example I started my first game and forgot to make a fire when the night came up I died and I was like ,,Why?I should have know''. And I learned with every new day that the game hates me. The game likes to punch you in the face. And the community is amazing. In the forums you can see artist, storywriters, survivers and so on. Pretty fast updates with new content to explore and even merchandise. It's a tip for everyone who like survival games. You will love it.Graphics: 10/10Gameplay: 9/10Sound: 10/10I hope you enjoyed my review.If yes press the like button :§D			"

												Do I recommend this game? Hell yes. Every single time you start a new game file, it's an entirely random generated world where nothing is the same as the last. You can play this game for weeks and still not discover all its secrets. It's a sandbox strategy game that keeps you on your toes for anything and everything that's trying to kill you. And believe me, there's a hundred and one monsters who all want your face on a platter. GAME TIPS:1. Always have a means to make fire. Always.2. Pigs are your friends. Build your base near them.3. Spiders are not.4. BEWARE THE BEES. 5. Beefalo herds are awesome. Fill your pockets with their endless poo. Great fire fuel.6. Prepare for periodic hound attacks. Make spears and tooth traps.7. Pick flowers. 8. Not starving is the LEAST of your worries.			"

												This survival rougelike is excellent. You are trapped in a cruel, randomly-generated world where everything wants to kill you, and left to fend for yourself in the wilderness. You will start off with nothing, collecting supplies to make a fire and survive your first night. The goal is simple -- survive for as long as possible.The randomness of the world generation keeps it fresh for every playthrough. There are countless ways to die, ranging from freezing to death to getting mauled by a tentacle. Once you die, you will be forced to start anew, which can be frustrating.I seriously love this game, and it really is worth picking up. You should also pick up the DLC which adds a lot more challenge to the game. This game is EXTREMELY addicting.			"

												You desperately fend off Eldritch horrors manifested by your own insanity while you turn your fallen friends' remains into a colossal bat made out of ham and run from a giant badger who shares a fondness for your dead compatriots. The sun begins to set, counting down the seconds before you are struck blind, tethered to a flickering light with the terrors of the night. Forests are mowed down behind you as the beast pursues.You dive into a sinkhole that dumps you into a pitch black cavern where you are promptly mauled by a horde of spiders and rabbit-people. You scream in terror as the light from above grows fainter, the rabid shrieking of gigantic insects growing louder and louder.10/10, extremely relaxing game.			"

												Don’t Starve starts off slow and punishing and continues to get even harder as you play. Its merciless difficulty coupled with its monotonous gameplay can leave some players feeling frustrated and bored. Those who enjoy a good challenge, however, will relish in the satisfaction they’ll get when they manage to outlive their previous record or clear the game’s evil Adventure mode. It may not be for everyone, but if you’re looking for a roguelike game filled with charm and challenge, be sure not to miss Don’t Starve.			"

												This game is fantastic.It combines roguelike and survival gameplay, dumping you in a strange territory to explore, forage, learn, craft and progress on your own terms. For the most part, the controls and interface are intuitive, so it's simply a matter of deciding where to go or what to do.The game is called Don't Starve, and hunger is indeed a major theme. If you go a few days without food, you will die. That said, there are plenty of other things to kill you - a variety of animals and monsters, environmental hazards, and your own dwindling sanity. To battle this, you rely on building your own equipment, consumables and structures, ranging from weapons and armor to crock pots to unwholesome magical devices.Don't Starve can be brutal, so you should expect to die, but just making good progress is rewarding in itself. You unlock new characters as you play, each with little touches or specialties to diversify your experience. And while there are some pretty powerful or useful items you can make, there are still a lot of ways to play, and they're all valid (which is good, because sometimes you don't have much choice.)If you're bored or frustrated, you can change your experience by starting a new game and adding or removing features. If you're tired of fighting certain monsters, you can just turn them off. I haven't messed with this myself, as I like the feeling of surprise, and playing the game as-is, but the developers have left the doors wide open for custom play experiences. In the same way, you can make use of a wealth of user-created elements.There are a few things I missed for awhile, like the fact that you can view a map of everywhere you've been so far, but overall the game doesn't suffer much from lack of tutorial or hand-holding. You can go read everything on a wiki if you prefer, but this is a game where I don't actually begrudge trial and error learning. Encountering strange new things and deciding what to do with them is a ton of fun, even if it sometimes gets you killed.A warning (at least from my perspective) - this game is so immersive, I prefer to keep playing it for hours on end once I start. It's not a game I enjoy having to stop, unless I come to good stopping point like dying at the end of a long survival run. In fact, sometimes I forget to eat for a long time when I play this. So, yeah. Irony.			"

												Boy Scouts should be required to play Don't Starve before going on any camping trips – they could even get a badge for it, in the form of a gaping, pointy-toothed wormhole. Or maybe a friendly campfire.Don't Starve is, at its most basic level, a survival game. It features crafting, mysticism, science and all manner of nasty creatures, especially once it gets dark. In order to stay alive, players have to use the surrounding flora and fauna to craft increasingly complex tools, starting with a simple axe and building up to items as intricate as lightning rods and carpeted flooring.When you die in Don't Starve, your current world is destroyed, along with the things you created while surviving in it. There are advanced tricks to escape death – constructing a Meat Effigy or finding an Amulet – but rest assured that you will most likely die before gaining the experience required to craft or dig up these items. A Touch Stone will also resurrect fallen players, but finding that structure early on is more luck than certain death. I did find it, at the beginning of my second run, but I didn't know what the strange circle surrounded by pig heads was, so I didn't use it, and when I died, I was dead.That said, curiosity and a desire to poke at unfamiliar things are essential in Don't Starve.Dying is a fundamental gameplay aspect. Death won't always come from starvation; it inhabits many forms, including beasts large and small, and the terrors that hide in the night. A clock-like status bar in the upper right corner of the map shows how many days you've survived and the current time, and it provides health, hunger and mental gauges. It's an efficient system, the clock hand moving from yellow to red to blue – day, afternoon and night – and circles of health systems draining without proper care. One glance and it's instantly clear how long until you have to build a fire, or if you need to eat or rest.On top of a solid survival game, Don't Starve is a deep, layered experiment in crafting and exploration. Throughout the biomes are wormholes that transport players to different lands, which offer new materials for building science machines – which unlock new crafting recipes – and heartier structures. New characters are unlocked with experience – 20 points per day survived. This is all in Sandbox Mode, but Don't Starve also features an Adventure Mode, which players can enter by finding and activating Maxwell's Door. Adventure Mode is Don't Starve's campaign, pitting Wilson against Maxwell, the demonic genius who brought Wilson to the wilderness in the first place. It's five grueling chapters – upon first entrance, players lose all items and crafting recipes, and can only carry four items between Adventure Mode chapters. Die in Adventure Mode and you're spat back out into Sandbox Mode, precisely where you left it.For its art style, deceptively dark vibe and experimental approach, Don’t Starve is certainly worth a look.

												Don’t Starve tries its best to be a haunting challenge, with a Tim Burton art style. It does a good job. The core gameplay is simply trying to survive. gathering materials and food during the day, and huddling by a fire, trying to craft useful tools at night. As the day to night cycle progresses, so does the seasonal cycle. After a couple days, winter comes, making it harder to collect food, and hunt. The nights become longer and the days become shorter as you huddle by your fire, trying not to freeze to death. During winter, your homemade farms stop becoming useful. Huntable animals disappear and other more dangerous animals come in swarms. As far as the story goes, there is an oddly rich story, which can only be experienced by skilled players. Whenever a new game is started, Maxwell, the games antagonist, warns him to get food. The real story mode cannot be achieved unless the player has found the four pieces, and then moves to the next level. After beating a few levels, they reach the epilogue, where maxwell is unlocked as a playable character and the game is complete. Don't starve’s graphics and art style is very Tim Burton. The monsters, alone have a scary but yet cute feel to them. The sound of the game is very creepy yet welcoming. depending on what the player is doing at the time. The music changes whenever the player is in combat or not, making the combat feel even more immersive. Don’t stare also has a large amount of options. Not only can you pick your character but you can also modify the world and its many resources. Players can make the world a food rich wonderland, or a barren wasteland, randomized each time. Each playable character has its own stats, and buffs/debuffs, tailoring to each possible playstyle. The in game crafting provides a large variety of machines, tools, farms and structures. The player can craft anything from carpets, campfires, spears, drying racks, walls, bee-based mines and a large variety of clothing, all with special perks. Winter coats to keep you warm, mining hats to provide light, feather hats to increase how many birds there are, armour to reduce damage, and a flower garland to keep sanity up.Don't starve does lots of things right. The art style and sound design is amazing for this gameThe crafting feels organic and worth the effort.The clothes in the game change not only how the player looks, but also has bonuses. The Monsters in the game are interesting and fun to hunt.The many varieties of food make the game more interestingThe story is enjoyable, even if you don't play through it. The antagonist is one of the best “bad guys” i've seen in games for a whileThe different playable characters are fantastic The game has a customizable world setting.The game has playing cardsDon't starve does a few thing wrong.The cave mechanic is hardly explored until late gameThe game has a few bugs still needing to be fixedThe follower mechanic should be touched upThe vanilla game can be a tad boringThe player may rage-quit after dieing on a long time world.The game lacks achievementsThe game lacks vanilla co-opDon’t Starve isn't only a magnificent survival game, but it is also a well told story, for those who care to play it. I believe that there is a large market for this game, and that market keeps on growing. If you don't already own this game, pick it up on sale. Its on sale almost every winter and summer sale. I payed full price for it and i think its worth it. "

												Updated now to include the massive lot of new content and Klei's commitment to the game -So. Tim Burton designs minecraft, this is what it would look like. That's the quick version. The not so quick version involves you attempting to survive in a world which is pretty much entirely out to kill you (even the trees will try to kill you...), having been dumped there by a mysterious character called Maxwell. It is down to you to, as with many Minecraft games, start from the ground up by collecting flint and twigs, and putting together rudimentary tools, before hacking down trees and mining rocks for the more advanced stuff. As your toolset grows, so do your options, and thankfully, so does your diet choices (berries work for a while, but there's nothing like cooked rabbit).The game now has a fair bit of lore and background to it, and with the addition of caves, and sub areas, now has a more ""exploratory"" feel on top. Combined with the Steam Workshop, a slew of unlockable characters, and a soundtrack which I seriously suggest everyone who picks up the game -also- collects, results in an outstanding offering that will appeal to survivalists and minecrafters alike.

												It’s a pity that Tim Burton hasn’t been involved in video games: both his visual style and his storytelling abilities would be welcome additions to our industry. Thankfully, niche approaches to style can find a welcome home in today’s indie market, and the folks down at Klei entertainment have turned that particular style onto the video game scene in their new 2-D open world survival title Don’t Starve. It’s a refreshing and unique entry into the genre, one that puts extra emphasis on the ‘surviving’, and that’s sure to give players a welcome challenge.The goal in Don’t Starve is simple and straightforward (hint: read the title). The player takes control of a forlorn, classically British-looking protagonist, and although there is only one default starter character, other playable characters with potentially useful abilities unlock as the game progresses. When you start in the world, you’ve got only your bare hands to work with. There’s no tree-punching, thank goodness, but you’ll need to start off by hunting down some flint and sticks so you can fashion yourself an axe. Your first priorities are simply to acquire fire (which you must have to survive a night) and food (which, as it turns out, delays starvation). As luck would have it, it’s not enough to simply peg down a steady source of calories; if you’re not careful, you can also be killed in the conventional manner, in other words, by being ravenously eaten, poisoned, or pecked to death by some of Mother Nature’s wonders. There are also some native inhabitants, better armed and armored than you, who are probably best avoided. As if that weren’t enough, there’s one more danger that feels just a tad artificial: your character starts to go insane without having new things to think about (aka, crafting new items or gathering pleasant items). This provides an impetus to keep you gathering harder-to-find materials, and although this seems like a bit of a poor man’s way of encouraging you to explore and ‘techify’, the crafting is fun enough that it stands on its own two feet. Generally you’ll be quite happy to spend time gathering special items just because you want to, say, build yourself a suit of armor, or a new kind of animal trap. There are even cute hats to make that have the added bonus of keeping your sanity up.If all of this sounds like an open-world creativity journey, think again. Don’t Starve does give you several nice options for survival. For example, your food sources can come from scavenging, farming, hunting, or even cultivating your own bees. However, in the harsh climates that you’ll be fighting through, your options are usually so limited that you’ll need to focus all your efforts on whatever strategy is most likely to let you live another day. It’s not a game of fun and frolicking: you’ve got to fix your problems now, before they grow to big and doom you by your own stupidity.That’s all well and good for the basic ‘survive-and-thrive’ aspect of Don’t Starve, but there’s also a form of campaign in the guise of the Adventure Mode. Here, the player is placed into specially created worlds with particularly difficult settings: it might be extra cold, or extra dark, or the food might be extra hard to come by. Surviving in each world long enough to collect pieces of a McGuffin allow the player to progress to the next challenge, slowly uncovering a thin story as the adventure continues. It’s not a strong enough narrative to be an independent draw for most players, but gives a nice added challenge to the standard gameplay.From its title to its music, Don’t Starve does an excellent job of perfectly nailing a unique tone: it’s always a little dark, a little humorous, and a little self-conscious. The soundtrack is mostly made to mimic small-ensemble Victorian era motifs, the sort of thing that you would expect to hear in a haunted mansion movie. That said, it feels like there’s not enough of this high quality music to go around. The light-hearted morbidity of the game is even reflected in what characters you can play with: it’d be so easy to simply make the player a terribly frightened little girl or boy, crying for his or her mommy. Instead, the characters in the game gleefully watch trees burn and take pleasure in slaughtering whatever cute furry animals they can find. It’s a kill-or-be-killed world, and your character loves every minute of it. But the best part about the game is that the environment itself practically has a character. Nature isn’t just a harsh environment: it’s out to get you. Chop up too many trees, or wring the necks of too many fluffy bunnies, and you might find yourself facing some particularly vengeful avatars of the outdoors.The worldbuilding in Don’t Starve is a special treat, and is quite possibly the most enjoyable aspect of the game. The scenery and enemies are given a dark, edgy sketch style that looks a bit like a flannelgraph or felt puppet show. Birds and critters all have their distinctive hoots and whistles, and even the trees quiver when they grow new leaves (which, appropriately, happens in a sudden ‘pop’). Genre-wise, Don’t Starve sits nicely in that sweet spot of gothic aesthetics, partway between simple turn-of-the-century technology and homespun magic.Comparisons between Don’t Starve and Minecraft are inevitable, but unfair. Don’t Starve isn’t nearly as open-ended: it’s more focused on the challenge of survival, and there’s very little call for customization at all in the game. All recipes are technically given to you in advance, although you may need to traverse a tech tree in order to gain access to them. The crafting in Don’t Starve is also more focused on utility - generally speaking you’ll be so busy trying desperately to build the weapons or shelter that you require, you won’t ever find yourself making something just for the fun of it. Instead of offering limitless exploration, Don’t Starve offers a particular feeling; that of being in a creepy, kooky horror story.With only a few biomes and enemy types currently implemented, the game as it is only carries a decent amount of material, and replay value is sadly limited. The sticking point here is that, like Minecraft, Don’t Starve promises continual updates (and cleverly posts the date of the next game addition on its main menu). This makes the purchase of Don’t Starve something of a gamble: maybe it will fill up to the brim with new content, maybe it won’t, and only time will tell.More so than in other genres of games, world building in survival games is important, because the world is your enemy. Just like every good heroic RPG needs a delicious villain to focus your conflict against, a good survival game needs to give the environment itself a personality. While most outdoor survival games do this by making the environment be something like an inviting, friendly host, Don’t Starve goes in the opposite direction by making the Mother Nature seem more like that weird cat lady who lives in the boarded-up house. It’s not so much an invitation to explore and enjoy yourself as it is a long list of dangers to avoid. Don’t pick fights with the locals. Don’t stay in one place for too long. Don’t ignore that growl you hear in the night. Oh, and just in case you forget... try not to starve.Highly Recommended "

												This game is so addictive, while trying not to starve on the game you may starve in real life, you won't sleep and you will go insane keeping your charactor alive. This should come with a health warning but the games name should be a reminder in itself, maybe add an ingame timer that saves the game and tells the player 'eat and go to bed' after they've been playing 20 hours.If you have lots of spare time this game is definitly worth it's money.

												Best. Game. Ever.I seriously cannot express how awesome this game is. Whether it be the overall gameplay, the lore, the deaths, the nomming, the insanity, or having your base burnt down because of one lightning strike in Spring, the game delivers on all of what it promises and more.Buy this game and you will not be disappointed.

												What is Don't Starve all about?Don't Starve is a survival horror game that drops the character in an open and fully explorable world filled with numerous monsters and many interactive objects. This is a must buy for anyone who enjoys a game where the player is given total freedom to do what they want, how they want and when they want. So as a player and big fan here is my own personal experience on such an awesome single player experience game. J20Hawkz Personal OpinionI have been playing this game since early release and still find it extremely hard to stop playing it. Personally for me I enjoy adventure, action and rpg, Don't Starve combines all three in a unique way and blends in survival horror and a sort of farming, resource hoarding element also. If you enjoyed playing games such as Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon you will definitely feel right at home playing this. The added twist is you are always on your feet to make sure you don't go insane and lose health. Oh and of course don't starve. Seasons, Days, InteractionsAlmost everything can be interacted with, from catching small butterflies and bees to having epic battles with huge lumbering monsters that hunt you in the coldest and hardest of times. Yes Don't Starve has seasonal changes, and not only do you live to survive, you must survive to live. Days go from light to dark, they don't last very long making it all important you do enough to survive the dark night and start again when the sun comes out. Anything that moves and would potentially pose a threat can harm the player if you choose to get too close or in some way anger it. Weapons, Traps, Armour, FoodCraft weapons, armour, traps and walls to defend yourself against continuous threat. Capture, kill, gather and cook food to make sure your hunger never drops. Everything you see can be used to collect valuable resources that will be used to craft hundreds of helpful survival items. Explore a living worldNot only are we free to explore a fairly large open map, we can also go deeper into the caves and explore a strange and creepy ancient world. With the addition of such levels Don't Starve replay ability went through the window. Again exploring either the world above ground or venturing deep into the darkness of the caves, is all up to the player. There are no strings attached. You do as you wish. Minor IssuesThere are some minor faults with the game, but the team behind this game are very supportive and at least one member is on hand to help sort out any technical issues or those annoying bugs we encounter while playing. Never have I seen a more committed development team than Klei. Most questions can be answered by reading the community made Don't Starve Wiki, you can also visit the Official Klei site and post questions or reply to other friendly members of the Don't Starve community. The Steam Don't Starve forum is also a good place to share or ask what's on your mind. DeathDeath can be a pain, if you die that's it, you have to start all over again. The further you get is based on the number of days survived. However you gain experience points based on this number that is used to unlock other playable characters all of which have unique aspects about them. There are ways of avoiding a permanent game ending death so not all hope is lost. Play alone or togetherDon't Starve was originally planned as a Single player game only. On the 6th of May 2014 multiplayer was announced for late summer 2014. More to follow. FinallyAll in all, this game is a great single player oriented experience. The achievements we get is what we find hard and over come. With no online capabilities or steam associated achievements, some may find this game not worth buying. However if those are the only negatives in a game you will be hard pressed to find something that is as captivating as Don't Starve.  I give this game a solid 85/100.Here is just one example of what can be made in Don't Starve.

												Aside from ridiculously fun gameplay, Don't Starve's art style is eye-candy, reminiscing the feel of a Tim Burton movie adapted into a video game.Don't Starve doesn't hold your hand at the start. You pretty much figure out what to do by yourself. Oh look, that looks edible. And just like that, you could be dead.It's a trial and error game with a flair of adventure. You could stumble upon something very interesting or dangerous. You may have met your potential pigman allies. Tread carefully as the world of Don't Starve is perilous and unfriendly. Most importantly, don't starve!			"

Charmingly addictive // Recommended for survival gamers who don't want their hands held+ The longer one lives, the more XP is accumulated; characters are unlocked via XP, so unlocks can be obtained by those struggling to acclimate to the game, albeit not as quickly+ Boasts myriad environments and biomes, all of them offering a unique pallet of items and consumables+ Camera rotation is a godsend, and makes camp construction much less frustrating+ Permadeath offers a rousing incentive to succeed, particularly due to nighttime being so fatal+ Absolutely fantastic art style and animations+ Has an intricate, yet fairly intuitive, crafting system; this is greatly complemented by the mechanics of magic and scientific advancement+ Controls are practical and responsive; works very well with mouse and keyboard+ In addition to the hunger and health meters, the player must also consider the needs of the 'sanity' meter, adding further to the logistical challenge; sanity requirements can be satiated differently between the unlockable characters+ Worlds are all procedurally generated, making each experience into something refreshing and unique+ Sound design is nothing less than superb- Game can often lend itself to tedious frustrations, in large part due to the unforgiving environment and the fragile nature of the player's character- Crippling lack of a tutorial or beginner's handicaps; this will not appear as a negative to most enthusiasts of the genre, but less experienced survival gamers may find it off-puttingLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												For me, it was the small things :The blue tint of winter. The silent whisper of your demons, as you slowly go insane.The witty analysis of each character on their environment, showing how unique they are.The breathing you hear in your left ear, but cant see beyond the piercing dark.Dont Starve is a great game, with devs that listen to their players. Open mod support encourage the community to build the game they want to play. The addition of Dont Starve Together adds an almost primal need. Survive with your pack, feed them and fight with them - Survive. A hidden gem, a beautiful game.			"

												At around day 100+ I feel obligated to review this masterpiece of a game.Imagine you're stranded in a world which his only point is defeating you.Now imagine it's a video game. that's Don't Starve.You start in a world without any prior knowledge to what it contains, no idea on what to do, how to craft, how to eat food, how to survive.You roam around and pick up grass, saplings and flint without any target on your mind, doing it like you feel obligated toAfter a while of doing so, you hear a wild *DING* and a flashing bulb captures ontop of the crafting tab captures your eye.What could that be you possibly ask, as that is the tools tab.You continue your pointless journey by crafting your self a pickaxe and an axe, respectively.You start by getting some wood, maybe some stone if you're lucky and it's already night.Luckliy, another light bulb ontop of a campfire logo has captured your eye and you've got a campfire, just in time for the night.After the night has fallen, a new day had began. You're low on food and sanity so you start picking up these berries which you haven't thought about doing in the beginning, and you also found flowers. You try eating them but notice that whenever you pick'em up your sanity raises. that's good.After a while of looting the enviorment you come across a rock biome. Great, you've gathered enough rocks to make yourself nothing because the night came again.After almost dying at night you start getting stone and come across a gold nugget. What could that be?And, again, a bulb ontop of the symbol of Atom has caputred your eye.You make a science machine as you start grapsing that basics of this game. After a while of exploring your general land you come across a pig village with, ofcourse, the king pig inside. These pigs will turn out to be your only allies in this game. They have farms, they offer protection for any kind of meat and will save you from some of the horrors of this game. So you start making your base next to them as it is the only logical choice you could make in this game.After more days of looting and gathering resources you hear a faint woof. What could that be?Hounds.As you run relentlessly without understanding what's going on, your fellow pigsman are there to save the day, not for long though. You came out clean this time, which you should thank the gods of this cursed land.You started making up a base, you crafted random items from the science tab and again, a bulb has lit up.You craft an alchemy engine which will help you craft more scientific items.After roaming around in the world yet again, you come across ancient guardians of this cursed land.They work like clockwork, they defend their land like no other creatures. You bribe your fellow pigsman and you go to fight these ancient creatures, winning the battle.After looting their corpses, you come across gears. When arriving at your house, you craft an Ice Box to slow the spoilage of the food. Neat.You have a base, well protected from the horros of this world, you have everything you'd like in it.Now, there are two scenarios which can happen:1. Summer starts.You have no idea what to do, your character starts to heat up without any knowledge on what's happening.Your house starts burning and you, yourself, is overheating.Okay, lets say that didn't happen and you miraculously didn't any fires or didn't overheat because you mined ice.Guess what?Dragonfly. I'll leave that for you to discover what's that.Scenario 2:Winter starts.Great, you're cold, you're almost dead but you came across a failed survivor which had a Puffy Vest, thermal stone and a Cat Cap. How lucky you are. So you barely survive this day and come back to your house, rapidly fueling your campfire as it's the only gateway from this hellish environment. You have food in your ice box, you have enough wood somehow to survive the winter (Who am I kidding, this never happends, but for the purpose of this story let's assume it does).A saxphone sound comes out of your characters body and a text appeares, ""That sounded big"".I'll let you guess what's going to happen next.Ofcourse, there are 2 more seasons, Autumn and Spring, but I feel like they shouldn't be focused on now as they are pretty similliar.You die.Again.And again.And again.And again, until you master the horrors of this cursed land, feeling success after surviving your first winter, summer, autumn, spring. You survive the countless waves of hounds. Great.You come across a sinkhole.I'll let you find out what's going to happen next.All in all, this game is a well polished survival game with a giant replay value, very little bugs are found, great developers who listen to the community, great DLC's which add a LOT to the game which are very cheap aswell.If you like survival games and want to feel what a real survival game is, check this game out, it's on sale right now aswell.This game will always have a special place for me.

												EDIT: Well looks like wherever I got the multiplayer information from is wrong(?). I have to say the mutliplayer is very fun, however can get tedious with long sessions.Action packed adventure game. This is probably a more realistic approach to what surviving is really like but with an obvious cartoony visual. This game requires its player to always be thinking about what to do next so that they can always be prepared for a bad situation. Don't Starve is a very fun and feels refreshing each time you play, the characters with unique abilities and the randomised maps help the game stay addictive and attractive for a long time. It has an absoultely huge variety of gameplay and things to do and explore.I would have to say the only two cons there are with this game are there is absolutely no chance of multiplayer (apparently something with the scripting idk) and that if you get ambushed by monsters, all your hard work will literally just disappear, aka sometimes its just too easy to die.9.2/10 definently my favourite indie game at the moment			"

												Don't starve is a game that really grew on me.It seemed very unforgiving at first, but when i learned my way around it, it felt very rewarding. Then, just then i realized how challenging this game really is. I felt like i really had accomplished something.It wasn't just delivered to me with flashy signs or arrows that indicated what i should do or when.And this is without saying how beautiful the art and the music are in this game, which is only a plus side to the amazing gameplay that was carefully crafted.Is it worth buying? Yeah, i don't know, can you handle being challenged to a frustration point? Because unless you took a look into the game's code, getting around the situations you will be put in, on the first attempt, will be extremely hard.And if you care so much about beating a game like i do, you will get mad.Personally, i feel like this game changed the way i see things, that the weird and bitter sometimes can become your biggest passion.

												Since I have no idea how to review this game, I am just going to tell a tale of one of my adventures.Please note, this was played on Reign of Giants 1st update.Day 1 through 7. Getting Started.I pick Wilson as my character and start my game. It dumps me in a birch tree biome full of Twigs, Grass, Berries, Carrots and Flint. So I walk around gather all that crap, cut down some trees gathered wood and acorns and made a fire and waited through the night. The next day comes and I start exploring. I come across a biome full of Boulders and Gold nuggets. So I make a Pickaxe and just start going through every Boulder getting Stone, Flint and Gold Nuggets. I did that all day. The next day comes and I went to search for Beefalo. Within the first 2 minutes I find beefalo. My reaction was “Yes! I can now get their poo and start a farm!” I then realise I got excited over poo... So I got a bunch of poo and found a decent spot to make my camp. The next day I cut down a ton of trees and made a lot of stone walls and marked my base. Once I had set my walls, I replaced the floor with wooden flooring. Then I placed my Science Machine, Alchemist Machine, Crock Pot, Drying rack, Lightning rod and made 3 improved farms. Everything was going great!. That was all in the first 7 days. A great start for me.Day 8 through 12. The Rise and Fall of Friendship.I go exploring looking for spider nests for webs and the Pig King for Gold Nuggets and Pig men to recruit for help. I take 4 steps up and boom! Forrest Biome full of spider nests! And right next to biome was the Pig village with the pig king. Having killed a few spiders on the way to finding the Pig king I had some monster meat. So I recruited 2 Pig men called (And I am not kidding you) Nacho and Libre. They helped me out killing spiders and getting webs and they also helped with cutting down trees. The next 4 days pretty much went like this. I got my webs, made the Bug Net, Bird Trap and Tent and then…something I was not expecting happened. You need to keep giving the Pigs meat for them to keep following you and I have been giving them Monster Meat that the Spiders dropped. Day 12 I give the Pig men Monster Meat for the fourth day and…they turned in to Werepigs… I had to kill them both. So at this point I go on the Don’t Starve Wiki to find out why this had happened. Turns out giving them 4 Monster Meat turns them in to Werepigs… R.I.P Nacho and Libre. Day 8-12. Day 13 through 21. Preparing for Winter.Sad. Having killed my fellow Pig friends, I continued on. I go to an unexplored area and I find something surprising! A skeleton with an Ice Box next to him. I smash the Ice Box, take the items and ran back to my camp and made an Ice Box. This made me very happy. Now I can now store food without them going bad in 3 days. This also gave me a purpose to go mine the Ice blocks since Ice never melts in an Ice Box. For pretty much day 14 to 21 I stocked right the up on food. Making several meals from the crock pot and stocking up on Berries and Carrots that I could find. Just before day 21 hits, while just looking around in a forest I find yet another skeleton and this time he had a Winter hat and a Breezy Vest. I had loads of food in the Ice Box I had the perfect clothes and a fully heated Thermal Stone and my beard was fully ready. Bring on winter!Day 21 through 31. Spelunking and Giant encounter.Winter arrives! Snow everywhere! PENGUINS! And trying not to freeze to death! Winter was a pretty slow and boring time. Can’t really go out much without freezing so I thought to myself “I’m going to go explore the caves!” Expecting it to be dark and full of bats, I prepared myself. As soon as I go down the cave there was yet another skeleton! This time he had a lantern and a chest full of this green slime. I thought “Great! This is will get me around the cave without using 50 torches” It didn’t stop the fact that the caves are terrifying! At first it was just a marsh biome with GIANT TENTICLES! trying to kill you. As soon as am out of that biome I enter this new looking place I haven’t seen before…and I encounter something that made me ♥♥♥♥ myself! Now keep this in mind, the cave is pitch black and you can only see with a lit source. In this case the lantern I found. The lantern does not light the entire screen. You can only see like 3 feet around you. I encounter ROCK LOBSTERS! Which are (As I find out later) these terrifying yet harmless mob. My first reaction was to turn around and run the ♥♥♥♥ out of the cave but I noticed they didn’t follow me. So I approached one and it did not attack me. I learn that you can befriend them by giving them stone. I befriended 1 and continuted. Then I encounter the 2nd most terrifying thing…GIANT BUNNYS! These big furry bunnies are also Harmless and you can befriend them by giving them…Carrots…I also continued on without them. From then on it was just Cave Spiders and Bats. Having explored most of the cave I decide to finally leave it. I resurface only to be attacked by 5 hounds. I don’t attack them. Instead I lure them all the way to the Pig Village and got the pigs to help me out! The hounds died with the cost of 1 Pig man….So I took the meat he dropped and dried it and made Jerky!Having not died in the cave and surviving the hounds I decide to just take these next few day’s slowly. Having planted a load of acorns outside my camp I cut down all the trees and made 3 pig houses just outside my camp. Just in case anything comes to attack me (Like a Giant perhaps). I decide to venture out to more unknown area and I encounter a strange bug, I encounter the Goose Moose in winter. It left me confused considering it is a spring giant. So what did I do? Recruited a bunch Pig men and killed it! And it was successful! I gathered the Meat it dropped and yet again headed home. But on my way over I got caught in the darkness and can to settle in the middle of nowhere. During the night I was attacked by like 6 bats. So during night I was just running around my fire like I was doing a rain dance.Day 32 through 54 The Quest for the Fire Staff and Leaving the World Behind Me.The snow has stopped. The rain continued. And I have literary no worries of dying anymore. I have all the food I need and I have my fellow pig Neighbours for protection. At this point I thought I had nothing else to do. So I wanted to start messing with magic! Luckily I found a bunch of collapsed rabbit holes so I caught 4 of them, made a Top Hat and then made the Prestihatitator. The first thing I made with it was the Meat Effigy which pretty much acts as an 2nd chance if you die with the cost of 20% of your total health. But what I really wanted to make was a Fire Staff. But first you needed a Shadow Manipulator. Which are not easy to make due to the fact you need 3 Living logs and 7 Nightmare Fuel. Getting the Nightmare Fuel was easy but getting the Living Logs was a quest in its self. After many days of searching I finally found a Living Tree and got it. Now with my Shadow Manipulator made I needed 1 red gem. So I found graveyard and started digging graves until I got one. Literary the 2nd grave had a red gem. So I was happy. I made my Fire Staff and it was total worth losing lots of my sanity! I burned Bees, Spiders and an ENTIRE FOREST!. So that was fun! and pretty much from then I had a daily life and I left it on day 54. During all of this I happened to find all 4 of the “thing” items to enter a new world. Having explored the entire world and not wanting to stay any longer, I head over to the “Wooden Thing” location. Knowing it is guarded by the Clockwork mobs I of course, yet again, had a pig army!. We made our way over, killed the mobs and I said goodbye to the world and my fellow Pig friends. I have yet to start the new world. The End.I love this game. 10/10			"

												Ever had a feeling of utter helplessness? An impending sense of dread? Well if you like pressure, Don't Starve is your game! A bundle of wicked all wrapped up in a funky little art style which we all know and love.+Like I stated before, these graphics are wonderful, they aren't next gen but they don't need to be. They are like old school Tim Burton and grab your eye like a sexually frustrated teenager grabs a breast; they make this game what it is.+The game balances a sanbox survival aspect with a real purpose which I won't spoil. In survival games I just feel as though I wander round aimlessly until I inevitably die, with Don't Starve I feel like I am really accomplishing something with every decision I make.+You get a ""keen sense of despair"". Like the game says, there really is fear aspect to this game. Every choice is crucial, fraught with unseen consequences. A choice you make 5 minutes into your run could make the difference 50 days in. There are countless terrible creatures out for your blood. One of the worst moments you can experience is in the dead of night as you are racked with pain as insanity takes over. You will hear a child's tune play like that from a Jack-in-a-box. Then you will see an evil shadow hand come to steal your fire and envelop you in darkness.+It's downright witty and fun.There are no negatives to Don't Starve: this is game at it's finest. -Developers open to suggestion, always adding new and exciting content.-A welcoming and inspiring community.-A game that challenges you to think but remains fun.

												Although I only  purchased  Don't Starve recently, I have been following it's development since shortly after release. I had always been fond of it, but playing it was far better than I could have imagined.Don't Starve has won a very special place in my heart. So much that I even bothered with a review.One of my favourite titles of all time.Can't be  Recommended Highly Enough "

												If your a fan of games which don't hold your hand from the get go and are actually quite challenging to the extent that you will no doubt die multiple times during your time playing but which also reward skilled play and efficient micromanaging, then this is the game for you!Engaging, immersive and enjoyable experience. You will find yourself actively making mental notes on what to do the next day, stocking up on vegtatles for winter and scouting for animals to hunt to get loot which will accelerate you into the games not so obvious progression curve.Even once you have a fully established base with a constant supply of food and a surplus of anything, you will still end up dying to the natural environment. This game encourages you to be thinking on your feet and be ready for anything, whether that be an incomming wolf attack, or a surprise giant you are always on your toes. Thats what makes this game so unique, there is no time to be bored while playing because you always have something to do and it feels good once you accomplish it. If you are not a fan of busy work tasks then you will also like this game, there are no objectives set in the game, you essentially set your own path and every task you set isnt one you do for the sake of doing it - its because you need to to survive.Looking forward to the Shipwrecked patched, cannot wait to sink in (lol get it!) hours of fun into the new content to come. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes rewarding games. I was skeptical at first when I saw the graphics, then I realised how ignorant I was, the art fits the theme perfectly and gives the game a bit of charm. Recommend!			"

												An unforgiving perma-death survival game with a Tim Burton aesthetic that rewards planning and management. A beef jerky you reluctantly ate on day 10 can lead to your demise on day 30.

												If you like hard, stressful, moody games, Don't Starve is for you.The rogue-like qualities of permadeath and procedurality have spread far and wide, and now we have Don't Starve, a survival game with a Tim Burton-esque aesthetic that demands you navigate a hostile world of unforgiving plants and wildlife. And then, come nightfall, deal with monsters.This game is equal parts stressful and fun. In directly proportional amounts.The lack of achievements just goes to show the game's focus: You can play this game however you want, change the spawning rate of specific plants and critters, the length of seasons, all of which would undermine achievements and their place in the community. But could make the game more fun, if you want to enjoy it that way.KLEI seems intent on polishing a single aspect of a game in each release, SHANK the action, Mark of the Ninja the stealth, and now Don't Starve the procedurality. Their previous games were tightly focused and linearly designed, but here we have something almost infinitely replayable. And incredibly unforgiving.Crafting, managing resources, and carefully avoiding conflict mean that long term you might manage to erect a homestead with a farm and wander the world with a loyal pet. More likely you'll die trying instead.But I like that. If you do, too, then this's for you.			"

												An awesome art style like if it was made by Tim Burton himself, an amazing OST in one of the most creepy open world games.ProsImmersive is one of the worlds that describe this game.An art style that makes you remember the Tim Burton movies, pretty well realized.The soundtrack is amazing and fit with the world in a outstanding way.Gameplay simple but well realized.Pretty original.Enjoyable and variated Characters.Lots of amazing mods.ConsDoesn't have a Tutorial.Its trial and error, and unforgiving, if you die you lose all.A really great game, if you like open world survival games this game is for you, and its not like the other games of the genre, this will give you a lot of surprises, especially if you lose your sanity.

Maybe you'll die from a spider attack,Or maybe you'll die from a raging wolf pack.Maybe you'll die from the sting of bees,Or maybe you'll die from a sentient tree.You could even die from a beefalo horde,Or possibly die with little sanity restored~At which point your shadows would begin to kill,Within the midst of all of these thrills.It's unlikely that you'll die from an ongoing storm,But good luck later on when snow begins to form,As you start to have trouble keeping things warm,Whilst nature breaks down and becomes deformed...Maybe a tallbird will ruin your day as you decide to grab your lunch,Pecking away at the trail you leave, persistent in it's hunch.And just when you get away from it's frighteningly large size,The montrous Krampus will come to grab both you and your prize.Perhaps the end will come to you just when you think you're safe,Your chests are set, your fire is lit and the grass begins to chafe.But, somehow, you will forget about the most important affair-Then soon your belly will start to scream in hopelessness and despair.When you scramble for warmth and shelter,When you battle big beasts on your own,When you worry about the the sweltering summer or the ghosts lying under gravestones,Make sure you remember the main point of this journey you are on,And make sure that this December,You Don'tStarve Alone.

												Simply, wow!  First look at the game, I loved the whimsical, gothy caricature artwork of the characters and environment.  I didn't survive the first night because I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do.  Round two, I lasted about 3 days.  I would have lived longer had I not gotten too much into exploration mode.Don't Starve is a quite the time/resource management game packaged into such a casual looking box.  It's quite complex.  With each time you die, based off of how long you survive, you earn experience points which helps unlock a new character to play with, each with their own quirks and personalities.I highly recommend this game and can not wait until they release the multiplayer version!

												Hi, The first big paragraph is me ranting about FPS games, if you want to hear about DS, skip down a bit... How to create a review that doesn't just repeat what everyone else has said 10, 000 times before? I don't know if I can, so instead I wish to share a little version of my journey through video games, and use that to explain why I settled on this huge gem, and why It's the first game in my library (about 420 as of this writing) That I paid full retail for.I'm a gamer. no, seriously, that's what I am. I play games, I collect games, I live games.*For reference,FPS=First Person ShooterPvP = Player Vs PlayerPvE = Player Vs EnvironmentI have always liked and preferred FPS single player shooters, and only much later did I start getting into skill based FPS (vs Perk based FPS - read: CoD is not in my games library. Shucks, Battlefield BC2 flet like a mistake to me after playing it, even for $4.89). I only started playing CS:Source to shut up some young know it all in my internet cafe. Next thing I'm playing tier matches on CS:GO with $800 of DLC in my account. Why? It's a tight, fast paced tactical game with the only advantage over the other guy being my skill, not my special gun.I actually can't remember why, but I got this urge to start playing some slower paced survival type games, I do know I was beginning to tire with the fastest fast paces of PvP, and often not knowing or caring about my teammates, as I'd be in a different match in 4 mins anyway. I tried with Nether which feels like PvE until some base camping 12yo snipes you from 3 blocks away. I got tired of getting 8h in and then permadeath to that. But all of a sudden, I like permadeath. You failed? start again. No, really. Start Again. Perks? Byebye. Guns? Gone. Here's a kitchen knife, go stab some guy with a full kit in the back. If it had true PvE, I might still be there. I wanted to give Nether a go, because other games like DayZ, etc already had a huge negative reputation. And I really don't like Zombie themed games except maybe Killing Floor, which is team based PvE, and they are clones, not zombies, but they are called Zeds... hmmm... Don't even know why I got KF in the first place, I think it was because it looked interesting and I actually wanted one of their other games, ""The Ball"" - a single player puzzle oriented FPS with no shooting but lots of squishy (Puzzle-Solving via Giant Rolling Artifact Of Death).So at some point, I saw this title, and instantly dismissed it as a cheap flash-based game that was popular in a similar way to ""Candy Crush"". Heh, that's what you get for not looking into something properly before forming an opinion. Wish I had - was on sale for half price with a second copy of the game for free. (I don't think Klei will ever do that again for this game). This game was suggested in a Nether thread I had started about wanting a better PvE experience. I'd put in a  list of requests/prerequisites that would make it a game I would want to play, and someone suggested Don't Starve to me again. I thought 'no', but I saw in one of their threads that they adamantly refused to add multiplayer, because they wanted to create the best single player experience possible. This had my attention, as I saw it as now being a truly PvE experience, and by this time, I was craving it.I likely would have got into this game much, much sooner if it had ever gone on sale. It only had sales in the early days, whilst it was still gaining traction. Now, they are planning on making it more expensive when they release the next DLC (multiplayer patch). So it's pretty well now-or-never.___________DS is a brutally unforgiving game. You are dropped of in the middle of nowhere, in a foreign world, no idea about anything, except that night is coming. You will die. but you will learn, and live to day two. then day 4, then 7, then 22 (trust me you're gonna die on day 22 the first time). but you learn, you progress, a little bit, a little bit more. You try this mushroom, nope - not good. But cook it, and it is good. There are no quick save / reloads, no retries, no mistakes because you will be greeted with the realities of permadeath and a new world generated, Day 1. The reason that I love it, is that it's open ended - the goal is to get through until tomorrow, and that is always the goal, and it never, never ends. It's often a slower pace than FPS, and you pick days dedicated to exploring, resource gathering, or building better defenses. You gather. You plan. But when the stuff hits the fan, it's all on, and if you get through it, it feels like an accomplishment, and brings a huge feeling of quiet (is that it? are they all gone?) and satisfaction, because, well, it's all you, and the odds are stacked against you. That, right there, might just be the reason this game is so great.Should you buy it? Is this game for you? Probably. Should you wait for it so go on special? I wouldn't hold my breath. Check out some Let's Plays. Read some reviews. ask an IRL  [In Real Life] friend if you can have a jam (you'll want to put 20h aside to start to get a feel for the mechanics of this game. Anything less wouldn't be a fair assessment. That's how deep it is). But if you want something challenging, rewarding, and a game that is designed around long-term play, you have found it.			"

												There's a definite element of horror to survival games. It could be the fear of a wild animal tearing apart your fragile corner of civilization, or simply the sickening realization that you planned poorly and you're going to starve to death. Don't Starve capitalizes on both of these fears and more, pitting you against a stretch of nature that isn't just inhospitable, but actively seeks your destruction. And if that sounds stressful and downright painful at times, you should have a good idea of what you're getting into.Don't Starve starts you off with a spread of characters to choose from (with more to unlock) and world customization options, and then deposits you into an isometric wilderness. Just about every object in the world is interactable and will become important to your survival and prosperity, but the initial steps are simple enough. Flint and twigs make tools for chopping wood and mining stone, which can be refined further into building materials that unlock new equipment options. You'll be setting up fully-featured camps but be aware that cabins and castles aren't in the cards... the best you can do is walls and some simple flooring.This feeling of permanent exposure is important to the atmosphere, because you are never fully safe in this cruel world. There's a pervasive sense of ancient evil to everything, from the twisted trees to the dead-eyed spiders to the writhing tentacles beneath the marshes. One key to survival is light, because without it the pitch-black night is certain death. I'm not just waxing poetic here, if you get caught in the dark for more than about five seconds, you die. But even a roaring campfire is no guarantee that marauding wolves, angry frogs, or far larger things won't end your life.Death is where the real tension of the game is, because death is permanent. No do-overs, no checkpoints, no reloads. When you die, that character and that world are gone. Now, permadeath has proven to work for short roguelikes but a game where you spend hours exploring a world and building a settlement is a whole different ballgame, and it's here that Don't Starve threatens to lose most of its audience. Dying in this game really, really, really sucks, because it's always from something perfectly avoidable, comes so quick, and wipes out literal hours of progress.So why beat your head against this game? Because as long as you DON'T die, it's an excellent survival simulator. You'll never reach a point where you're fully comfortable in the world, and there are always greater beasts and scarier places to overcome. Even the most basic materials remain relevant as your mastery over the land grows, and while you gain new ways to make gathering resources quick and painless, you still have survival tasks to complete. Eventually you'll be cultivating farms, researching artifacts, and preparing for harsh winters, all of which are involved and gratifying goals.You'll have to deal with some trial and error in finding the best ways to survive and use what you find, and that can mean some frustration as you learn to deal with food spoiling or beekeeping or other surprisingly lethal pastimes. But once you do there's a big, strange world to explore, and that's really only the beginning. There's a story mode hidden out there in the wilds that you'll only find once you master survival, and getting through THAT is its own grand adventure. Wrapped up as it is in charming hand-drawn graphics and rich sound design, there's plenty to keep you invested in Don't Starve. It's a game that asks for a lot of patience and understanding, but it's one of the few that really earn it, too.			"

												So the winter is almost over, and thanks to the crook pot I'm doing pretty good.And then the hounds came.I heard their houls in advance and prepared myself to deal with them by equiping my spear and grass armor.The beasts arrived and they numbered at least 6.The ghost of my dead sister tried protecting me but the beasts overwhelmed her, but not before she took down 2 of them.Unwilling to give up I ran a short way to a pack of Beefalos. I kited the hounds tru the pack and made them fight each others.I survived the hounds, but how long will it be until something else gets the best of me?----This game is AMAZING!It's hard, but with knowledge you can survive.I feel that there is little luck involved. Either you learn how to survive or the game will eat your character.The graphics are AWESOME!I love the ""Tim Burton style"" and the creepy victorian feel!I bought this game at a Christmas sale and I recomend you do the same.

												Fun and obscure, survive as many days as possible. Passing through the seasons, including a harsh winter that will kill him cold!Varied characters with unique characteristics facilitate their adaptation to the game. From various animals, such as rabbits common to more rare and buffaloes. Of course, without leaving out a dear friend and companion Chester.The gameplay is very simple and easy to understand, which can complicate a bit is the selection of items. Many materials and raw materials that you collect throughout the day, and this opens up new combinations and creating tools to help you on this journey. Worth it if you're a fan of survival kits.So buy this game as soon as possible and test how many days you managed to survive 20? 100? 1000? ... "

IntroThis game was developed and published by Klei Entertainment. This game has received positive ratings from critics and users alike. Its mostly compared to other games like Minecraft and Terraria where the goal is survival. The main difference is that in those games mentioned above you are digging deeper and deeper and its usually about getting resources from the depths of the world. This game on the other hand is about utilizing resources on the surface for survival. Which brings about many difficulties as a result since you cannot hide in a cave for the winter.Difficulty:The permanent death component of this game really adds tension to surviving and trying your best to live the cruelty of the world. The difficulty really feels tailored made once you actually get into all the settings for making your own world. You basically have options over all enemies and resources to customize the world you desire in a fashion that you would want to explore it in. By having the player able to change the difficulty dependent on variables to such a degree they have made this game fun to replay over and over.WorldThe world can be medium to grand depending on what options the player chooses. However despite the size you end up with you will always feel like there is plenty to explore which is a important component of this game. The idea of exploring for resources, gathering them and utilizing resources to survive is important.CraftingThe crafting system was well done and has plenty of diversity of what you can create to enhance your odds of survival. Its interesting that you need the labs to first construct the objects but are able to construct them anywhere after your first time.GraphicsThe art direction is actually really good, the eeriness of the graphics combined with its other components really makes it stand out from other games, if you were to show me a ton of games i would never confuse it for don't starve.

												Don't Starve is an indie game in the somewhat crowded genre of ""survive a hostile environment by crafting"". I bought it just as it went out of beta, drawn mostly by the TimBurtonesque graphics.I feel I gave Don't Starve a fair chance, investing 13 hours into it, although the prospect of abandoning it felt tantalizing after just 5. I have to be honest: 13 hours is far from enough to experience the most sophisticated tiers of crafting. It’s unfortunately more than enough to resent the experience and I’ll soon get to the reasons for that.But first, the positive. The initial impressions are excellent. The graphics are intriguing and can best be described as what a children’s pop-up book could look like if it was designed by Tim Burton. Almost all of the game's elements (animals, plants, …) are delightful and original. The only flaw in the graphics concerns some of the ground’s textures, which are slightly pixelated, at least on Full HD resolution. Music is rather sparse, but the sound effects are realistically bucolic and I loved the idea that when your character “talks” (in reaction to one of your commands), he/she does so with the sound of an orchestral instrument (luckily, with English subtitles)The first couple of hours with the game are great. You feel very free exploring your environment, and yet captive of the timing: night comes all too soon! At the very minimum, on your first day, you need to collect a couple of food items (even as weak as berries and carrots) and get enough material to make a fire, which itself requires an axe (that you also must craft on the first day). The next day, you must to learn to balance three vital gauges: heath, satiety and sanity. Should any of them reach 0, you’re history. Speaking of which, let me introduce you to your new nemesis…PERMADEATH! If you've played roguelikes in the past, you two have already met. If not, let me explain. Permadeath means that when you die, there is no pressing a load button and re-starting from a safe point from the past. The game allows you to save your progress, but only when you quit, so that you don’t have to play a full game in one session. But should you cross path with the Grim Reaper, Don't Starve will mercilessly and meticulously destroy any save file that might inhabit your hard drive, forcing you to go back to the very beginning each and every time you die. In many games, this is not problematic. Many roguelikes are fun to start again over and over, because their random world generation often comes up with a unique situation and/or because you can try a completely different strategy, maybe by creating a character of a different class.The problem with Permadeath in Don't Starve is that there aren't many different strategies in the beginning. Sure, after some in-game days, you can specialise your crafting in one way or another, but the first real-time hour will always be kind of similar. Which means it’s not fun any more after a point, and you’ll start to really dread the endgame, for the wrong reasons. The point of a crafting/surviving game like this, especially one where you have to figure out most everything by yourself, is to experiment, to try crazy things and hope for a reward. But here, with no way of knowing in advance if a new enemy is fair game or completely badass, experimenting often means dying, and being punished by re-playing the same boring first days.You’d be forgiven to think that Don't Starve's unlockable characters alleviate the above-mentioned problem. But you’d be wrong: they mostly add a bit of flavour to the game, but don’t offer any real potential for strategic diversification. As if repetitiveness wasn't enough, the world generation algorithm hates you. The algorithm basically creates a huge map made of different “biomes” (forests, plains, swamps…). A biome has a specific population of animals, plants and other resources. Some of those resources are really basic building blocks for crafting, yet the algorithm sometimes takes great pride in placing the biomes that host them very far from you. You therefore often have no other solution than to spend several in-game days running around without crafting anything useful, just because there is no gold or even plain rocks, anywhere near your starting position. Judging from my experience, it's not a rare occurrence. There are some interesting special features disseminated across the map, but they’re spread fairly thin. In the end, it's hard to understand why such a huge map was needed in the first place.The last major complain I have is perhaps partly inherent to the genre and therefore not entirely the game’s fault: an almost complete lack of information. I already explained how not knowing anything about an enemy could mean death by experimentation. But it’s the same for almost each of the game’s features. The crafting recipes are mostly public, but the uses and strengths of the crafted objects are not. So, I've crafted a helm or an armour: Just what difference does it make? Beats me. So, I see my sanity declining dangerously. Why? What can I do to improve the situation? The game never tells, leaving the player to try things and not always finding a satisfactory answer. There is a fan-made wiki that you can consult if you’re curious about this or that aspect. But it's still very difficult to find just the information you need without having other secrets spoiled for you at the same time. I really wish the game would give you clues, even infrequent and vague ones. At the very least, I expected the game to explain the controls, how to move my character or rotate the view. Turned out, I needed to visit the official forum for that too!Overall, I was extremely disappointed with Don't Starve. I find it hard to recommend to anyone, save maybe the most patients among you who don’t find repetitive grinding objectionable. It’s a shame really, because for the purpose of this review, I read a significant part of the Wiki, and there are some really neat ideas. But more of them should have been used to diversify the starting strategy and they also need to be spread less thin across the map.			"

Hold Me !! See i love this game!!! Don't Starve is a Indie/Adventure/Survival/Crafting/Sandbox game. I also love games like this that are Small in size and a good bit of content to keep the player engaged...even if you die over and over and over you will keep coming back for more lol The art style in this game is very whimsical and real good with a lot of good animations.The controls are done real well and have found no issues with them so far.I recommend a controller for this game it makes the game a bit more relaxed and faster to switch through the menus.This helps also in crafting and eatting and so on and so on.I also recommend getting the DLC also to add more to this already impressive game! The game also has Steam Workshop also so there are a good bit of mods and stuff to add to it!!!And also i think its real good they are also giving the new Stand Alone DLC Dont Starve Together FREE to all that bought Dont Starve !!! Even though i bought the Dont Starve MEGA BUNDLE (Came with it BETA) on the xmas Steam Sale lol I say if you love a good indie survival game ,i say pick this one up ASAP!!

												I blink. I appear in a strange new world only to be suddenly confonted by a sleek man wearing a rather dapper suit and top hat! I was confused and scared, yet somehow comforted by the man, probably due to the strong sence of security he held. I could roughly make out the words: ""Say pal, you don't look so good."" ""You'd better find something to eat before night comes!"" his figure then swiftly decended into the ground in a puff of smoke. I trembled, I had somehow braised my knee, as I rose to my feet, my head dizzy and aching. i didn't have a clue how I got here, I only knew that I had to find some food and some supplies to make it through the night. Frantically, I began to run across the luscious meadow in search of some food that I could ravage.After what seemed hours, I finally spotted a bush that contained some sort of red, exotic berry that I could pick. As I approched the bush It became clear to me that the berries could be poisonous, despite their decieving looks. However as I looked up to the sky and took a glimpse of the savage birds circling me, I saw that the only viable option, and inevitable, was to rob the bush of its resources. I reached for the crimson berries, my mouth watering, when out of the blue a majestic turkey looking creature sprung from the bush, stole the berries and made its escape with great speed. I set off to chase the gobbler, that is what I had come to call it due to its adept ability to steal berries, however realising it was beyond my reach, I took off in another direction looking for another cache of food. Hours later the sun began to set and the birds flew away to some distant land as if they were afraid of something. I had aquired a vast quantity of sticks, flintstones and grass tufts on my travels, but still no food. I had lost all hope on finding any source of sustenance and my chances of survival, yet the image of the dark, sleek man was the coal in the furnace of my shrivelled body. Suddenly a rare sight in this harsh world: a dead rabbit; mine for the taking. I lifted its limp corpse as saliva built up in my mouth. It was time. Without realising, a dark blanket covered the sky in a matter of seconds, envoloping my body in total darkness. But I didn't care. I became a feral beast and ripped into the lifeless rabbit with my teath, tearing its flesh from its body. However I felt a tickle on my leg, something had brushed passed me. I took no notice and continued with my soul rejuvenating meal. Before I realised my legs were ripped out of their sockets, cold blood splattering across my face. I screamed for help, but only recieved the soft, lonely chirping of the crows. I lay there for a few seconds reviewing the few hours I had lived, cuddling what was left of my rabbit, before my head was pulled from my neck in a slight struggle. In my last few seconds all I heard were the wicked screeches of the wind and the laughing of the dark, sleek man.Brilliant game with a fantastic community, I love this game and is one of my all time games. I can't wait for the multiplayer and some more awesome things that klei will produce. 10/10			"

												So far my favorite game ever. TF2 coming in at a close second, this game. THIS GAME. I cannot express how awesome and entertaining this is, and just to top it off it's easy and fun to mod! (I modded the game myself, not so much now) The amount of content those updates in those 6 months of free updates was just immense. The fact we HAD updates for 6 months is amazing in itself, and now we're getting a DLC! I cannot wait for the amount of content that'll probably overwhelm me... BUY. THIS. GAME.			"

												This game is the epitome of obscenity. It starts off innocent enough, promising a nice ""build-to-survive"" experience, until you glance at the clock and realise you've lost most your day. It takes a fair bit to get into the swing of things, having to learn how to play from scratch as there is absolutely no hand-holding in this game. But it still somehow remains simple enough to grasp quickly, and yet complicated enough that you continue to discover new things with each play. First time I managed to work out how to not die immediately, I lasted 16 days, until death by giant bees. The rage I felt to then have to start again, from scratch, in a new completely randomly generated world left me unable to keep playing. And yet, same time the following day I had returned, if not out of desire to play, as much as a desire to flip the birds at this game, so that it knows it has not beaten me yet. Highly addictive, very engrossing, and overall just a really awesome concept. I definately would recommend this game.			"

												Don't Starve is the kind of game with a steep learning curve, and a process of discovery which can only truly 8e analysed through trial and error. This is a recurring theme, too, as the Game is permanently Permadeath, and is incredibly unforgiving. Admittedly, I did only get this game for the pre-order Hats for tf2, but I must say I haven't been disappointed. Don't Starve is small and easy to run on even the oldest computers, and a good way to pass the time if you are unfortunate to not have access to multiplayer games (Like me ;-;). The design scheme is sinister and eerie, but never actually scary. The game is all about surviving, and is more about managing resources than anything. Multiplayer was always a heated de8ate, 8ut finally the developers have decided to add it to the game, finally. So, with more DLCs and Multiplayer to look forward to, the game is only getting 8etter			"

												One scientist, nature, wilderness, night, cold, food, dangers, friends and enemies. All is good as long as you ""don't starve"". The amazing visuals (Tim Burton like artwork) and music sets the tone well for this masterpiece. In Don't Starve they tell you nothing about your adventure as it unfolds. You will start out with no knowledge, and will run around grabbing objects until you find out how to build things. Whenever you discover something new, it adds it to a list of item to build. This is truly fantastic progression.Don't Starve is a incredible game and with the updates they keep putting out every few weeks, this is a game that I will keep playing for a very long long time. 10/10			"

												""So much to do, so much to see""Don't Starve is a beautiful challenging survivor indie game.In this game you explore the world and craft different things and of course don't die.This game is also little bit humorous and it keeps getting updates, so it's fun to play and it has many hours of gameplay.In Don't Starve there is currently 9 different characters (11 if you buy the Reign of giants DLC) with their own unique abilities.When you die you can always start a new save with a different character, and the world is always different.

												The concept art of the game gives it a unique vintage look. I'ts a funny indie survival game.Let's resume the gameplay: ""You wake up and you've realised that you are lost in a forest, what will you do?"". The gameplay is basically that, you have to survive as many days as possible by collecting resourses, crafting stuff and eating food that you collect/craft. Also remember to put some lights at night.			"

												I cannot recommend this game enough. I've had it since it was in beta over a year ago and I still consitently play it. The addition of Workshop was ingenious, so even if you feel the default game has gotten a bit stale, you can spice it up a bit with a plethora of mods.This was my Game of the Year for 2013, and it is definitely worth its very reasonable price.

												A surprisingly immersive and aesthetic game that is effortless to get into and play for hours on end. It's entertaining for hardcore gamers and casual gamers alike and as much as it is engaging to play alone, it is also fun to play alongside others even without DST. I can easily run it on a laptop not built for any type of gaming which is a huge plus especially for a game so well rounded. This is one that I recommend anyone curious to try out at least once because the odds seem to definitely be in favour of your liking it. Please be warned that it is extremely addictive. Those who have enjoyed Minecraft or frequent games where the object is building or/and surviving etc will be thrilled with Don't Starve. Have fun! ;)			"

												TL;DR: skip to the verdict at the bottomThis game is a masterpiece. It truly shines in comparison to the other modern survival games.The art style really fits with the game's setting, making for one of the best immersion experiences out there.Other survival games *cough* The Forest *cough* give you a handful of starting items and tips when you press the magnificent ""new game"" button.Well,no,♥♥♥♥ you, The Forest.In Don't Starve,you are told literally NOTHING about the enviroments that surround you,what can kill you, or what is edible.It is the authentic survival experience, where you wake up in the middle of nowhere, with absolutely no idea of what you are going to do next.That brings me to the learning curve. It is a really harsh and unforgivable one (Dark Souls style),but once you get used to it, and that should be after your first 5 worlds created, you will get the hang of what's what in the world of Don't Starve.Heat kills you, hunger kills you,spiders kill you,pretty much never ask yourself the question ""what does that thing do?"".You will regret it a short 10 seconds afterwards.Where the gameplay can't do the job, atmosphere is further more created by the Tim Burton-ish twisted art style,with a slight touch of a cartoon character design.This game is also a true teacher. In my humble 30-ish hours of trying not to starve, I learned that frustration never leads to something good,so don't get mad the first 5 times when you die,it's part of the game, and it's a healthy method of learning the ropes and the mechanics.Basically, the trial and error system would be the best description of your first playthroughs.The game is full of new content, it makes sure that you always discover something just when you tought that there couldn't be more to it, so don't worry, it is NOT a short game, nor one with an empty open world.The DLC, Reign of Giants and Shipwrecked, expand the content of it to whole new levels,easily adding 60 more hours of gameplay to the 50-ish of the original content and the 100+ ones that mods add, and (I can't believe I'm saying it), they are worth their full price.Verdict: If you want a serious survival game with tons of content and an expansive open world, tough with a harsh learning curve, but that is worth your time, Don't Starve is perfect for you.Actually,scratch that,Don't Starve is for you no matter what kind of survival game you are looking for.Just try it,because I'm giving it a 10/10.

												Okay, first thing first. Thank you for the gift, George.At the first glance, I don't know anything or have any ideas about what this game is supposed to be (well, no instruction, almost no tips, nothing, only funny dialogues when clicking on certain objects), but that all makes sense, and it's quite interesting.- You have an inventory to (of course) store things to help you survive (light up a fire, foods - including flower petals, seeds, carrot,...).- You have basic recipes to make useful tools like axe, traps,... for what? The player must figure his/herself.That being said, I have survived for 5 days. If I have time, I will re-install this thing. It's a good game, but I have something else to play also. I will continue play this later on (and they provided a CD Key to redeem on Google for every single copy).Oh, no achievement, sad, but no.			"

												-Rabbits are trolls-Night is no time to rest-No animal is innocentDon't Starve throws you into the wild, and uses everything it's got to kill you, literally. Did you build a farm? Good because I hope your well fed because were going unlease a pack of angry dogs at you. Did you kill those dogs, did you? Well, you just ran out of food and to get more you'll have to go across the other side of the map. Oh, good your still alive, then I guess we can test this forest monster on you. Don't Starve guides you to progressively find intuitive ways to survive, but with perma-death around the corner, lurking behind your every shadow, you'll be doomed to start over again. That's right, Don't Starve challenges you to cheat death.Recommend purchasing the 19.99 bundle or the mega pack...Now who wants to go make some science - Cave Johnson, founder and CEO of Aperture Science...

												In this clever, strange and unforgiving surivival game, you have one job over all else:DON'T STARVE.With that being said, it's perfectly fine to:-Surivive.-Die.-Fight off spiders.-Go insane.-Have an army of Pigs.-Cheat Death.-Annoy Maxwell.-Be a Gentleman and a Scientist at the same time.-Become a pyromanic.-Have a twin sister that's a ghost.-Be the strongest there is by over-eating.-Be a humanity hating robot.-Wonder why you aren't in your library.-Have a talking axe and a dark secret.-Become the weakest Mime there is, but hey, balloons!-Get murdered by pengulls.-Learn to respect nature the hard way.-Try to escape.-Have the slim chance of getting destroyed by a giant Deerclops.-Start a forest fire.-Scream a refrence while getting chased by bees.-Find a herd of Beefalo.-Get run over by a herd of Beefalo.-Play a cruel version of Splunky.-""WHY ARE THERE SO MANY SPIDERS?!""-Fail.-Try again.-Get farther, but fail again.-Unlock secrets.-Tense up when you hear howling in the distance.-Become who ever's a playable character in the workshop.-Wonder what happens when you jump in a wormhole.-Get hunted by a fashionable Walrus.-Science!-""OH, IT BURNS!""-Get hunted by robots protecting statues.-Many other wacky occurances-Realise you can never win.Yet dispite all that...You'll laugh. You'll yell. You'll wonder why you even bought this game in the first place. But you'll retry, and retry, and get better. Then realize that you haven't even touched the mulitplayer or the DLC.10/10			"

												Excellent game, a quick run-down of the pros and consPros-Deep gameworld with alot of hidden and interesting things to find within the depths of the game-Excellent design, game art, and audio-Soon to have multiplayer. Yay!-Replayability-Sates the need of putting things in boxes and organizing a perfect base defense and structure system-Really never know what your going to find exploring a new area-Beefalo.-Interesting crafting system-Good valueCons-Somewhat steep learning curve-Lack of tutorial means finiding a new monster deep in a playthrough could end up killing the player and losing all progress, no tutorial also makes changing of the seasons, or meeting a new monster, deadly for the unprepared.-Gathering of resources can become tedious, but the better your base, the less need you have for random resource hunting.-Permadeath can turn off a new player quickly, ex. surviving through winter, then getting murdered by the end of winter boss, often the total loss of progress can be disheartening.-Really could have benefited from some sort of in-game explaination of the game world and wilson's plight, there is a cinematic trailer, but it isn't at all in game.OverviewAll in all this is a great game, but it takes patientience and persistence to be good at surviving, I consider myself pretty decent at the game without mods, and I still die random non-creature deaths due to random events, and often die in caves because of the high difficulty they can have *cough* depthworms *cough* I probably wouldn't reccomend this to casual, console type gamers, unless playing ""Dont Starve Together"" with an experienced friend or the like. But to anyone who likes a little challenge and has some time to play, this is a very well made game, and quite entertaining.  Plus if you find it to hard, you can customize world generation to make the sandbox mode much easier and forgiving, and the steam workshop has lots of great mods that can make the game more enjoyableI would consider it one of my top 10 personal favorite games			"

												You may say I didn't play a lot of Don't Starve on pc , it's because I had some problems with steam so I jumped on Don't Starve console edition on the ps4 ( a must have on the ps4 ;) ) . Now that my steam works I can make an honest review :) Pros: -Don't Starve has a large world so you can explore a lot (sandbox world) it's great . If the map is too large for you , you can always change the setting to a smaller map.-The crafting is just brilliant and don't always follow logic . -There is an unlimited amount of things you can do (I'm not kidding ! ) . -There is different season .-Don't Starve world has a dark twist ... ;) -You can unlock all 9 characters and they all have a different quality than the other . If you want more character , you can always get some from the steam workshop (People have a lot of imagination) . Pros/Con: -When you die , it's REALLY frustrating but then you want to make another character and try to get much further than the time before . Con + Guide's link :-The only problem that you'll encounter the most for a begginer is : They almost never gives you hint on what to do . It's not that much of a Con if you like doing everything by yourself but it can become very frustrating . So I'm going to give you the link of one of my friend's guide . It's really helpful and he's a pro at Don't Starve :)Link:

												It's a game where you don't starve.But, it's more than that.These days, games are just for entertainment value and fake praise. That's cool and all, but, this game does more than that. In this game, you not only eat, but you explore a randomly generated world, ranging from the aboveground and underground, plus many biomes to explore and traverse, like the Forest, Savannah, Swamp, etc.There's also a wide range of different characters to unlock. Some unlock by gaining EXP (Which you earn when you die or other reasons), or when you do a in-game action, which unlocks them!Plus, this game is updated regularly, with all new kinds of new content to explore and discover! There could be simple bug fixes or changes to items, or even something big like a new biome! This brings the player back so they can explore the new content and see what it does and how it's affects them!This game reminds me of an arcade game -- you see how many points you get (or, how many days you can survive), until you eventually die. When you do eventually die, you may ask ""How the heck did I die!?"" But that's the fun in it! As you progress, you face greater and more challenging things to face and survive from! And, by dying, you learn more about the game, so you'll want to do it again and last longer and longer!So, that's my two-sense on this game. It's overall a fun little experience those Cod and Minecraft fans should experience, so they can see that there's more to life than gunfire and a bad game! "

												If you enjoy playing survival games; you'll love Don't Starve. In this game you will die a lot and realize how much this game hates you. However, for every death you will gain knowledge of the game and experience to unlock other characters whom all are different and unique. You start off by collecting many items such as wildgrass and twigs so that you can survive for the first couple of nights but, the game get progressively harder with each passing night which makes this game so challenging. Once you die in this game, the game deletes your save file and you have to start all over from scratch but, the games world generator always keeps the game fresh and new for you. The community workshop also has many mods to help assist you in learning the game as well as adding new characters that already exist from other games,shows or even just made up.For some, Permadeath in this game is what ruins it. For others it gives the game a more realistic feel to the game. There are various guides and tutorials on Don't Starve but, I highly recommend not looking at it because the beauty of Don't Starve is finding out yourself the ups and downs. There are also various ways to give you an ""extra"" life such as touching the pig alter or the life giving amulet.Here are some of my experiences of the game:-1st time playing- Day 0: I spawn and start collecting items. I see a pig alter unsure of what it does and avoid it. I see an odd white sphere out of the ground and proceed to head towards it. I am ambushed by spiders and die.Day X (Can't Remember what day): I see the odd white sphere which I know now is a spider nest. I approach the nest and kill the first spider that greets me. The other 2 come out of the nest, eat the meat of their fallen brethren and proceed to chase me.Day 35: The Deerclops is chasing me and has killed all the beefalo with 2 hits. I proceed to shoot a fire dart at him which kills him, and starts burning all the drops from the beefalo. I run to the drops panicing and die to the fire from all the drops. I respawn from one of the pig alters that I had previously touched and immediately get ambushed by 6 hounds.Day 48: While I am collecting berries from the row of berry bushes I had gathered, it starts to rain. After a couple of minutes a lightning bolt hits one of the nearby trees burning all the bushes. Today is sad day.11/10 would attempt to survive again			"

												First of all, I'd like to point out that I have atleast 20+ hours game time on this game but played it mostly outside steam.This is one of those games that was given a unique touch on it's style. So, if you're the type of person who looks for ""something different"" in games then, this one is for you.Don't Starve is a survival game with an art inspired from Tim Burton's works. Now don't get that statement get to you as it surprisingly fit the game overall. You are dropped in a random-generated world and start of from them. The game has no tutorials but its easy to get the gist of the game while at the same time It's hard to master.Controls[+] The game works well on both mouse/WASD controls depending on your preference.[+] Zoom in feature.[+] Full controller support.Sounds[+] Atmospheric OST.[+] Good choice of SFX for small things like picking flints.Graphics[+] Tim Burton style. The art for characters, monsters, and objects blends well with the world.Balance[+] Challenging. You can spend a lot of hours playing the game and you will still have a hard time surviving for a long time especially for winter.[+] Different kinds of monsters, objects, and resources spawn near you each time you start off a new world.[+] You will have to do more than just picking up items and cutting pine trees if you want to craft advanced items.[+] Multiple characters to unlock. One has more advantage than the other but still keeping the balance to keep the difficulty of the game.Others[+] Dialogues to keep you from getting bored playing in a gloomy atmosphere.[+] Huge in-game content.[+] The type of survival game where survival is your real concern.[] No story. Although it doesn't need one, it wouldn't hurt to have one.[-] It could use a short and justified tutorial for some players who can't get into games quickly.[-] Craftable materials appearing and disappearing while moving away from machines can be confusing at times.

Don't Starve begins in Full Screen but you can immediately access options to change to windowed mode.  Windowed mode is borderless so you can access your desktop without exiting the game.  No colorblind settings were in the options.  Mouse only gamers can play with ease.  When you start this game you may not see your friends or family for weeks...  the game is just that good!  Everything can be controlled with simple mouse clicks, a few keyboard buttons can help you lower your right clicking and adjust camera settings.  You can left click to move your character collect objects or attack.  For keyboard only gamers the news isn't as good.  You can walk using wasd & collect items with space.  My problem came when trying to access build menus.  I personally never found a key to access them and looking through forum posts I failed to find a solution.  If keybindings do become available,  I'll definitely update notes here!			"

												A very challenging and fun game, Don't Starve brings us the creativity of Minecraft and the adventure of Terraria and mash them together with some lovely art. You play *mainly* as Wilson, a scientist who was whisked away into this hellish world of violent trees, annoying hellhounds, and a deadly night. Although this game is quite challenging, and yes, frustrating, it is a lot of fun to play and experience for yourself. There are gameplay mechanics such as sanity, hunger, and weather. As you see more disturbing things, your sanity drops, making shadows and other hallucinations appear at night, and eventually, at day. Hunger is, obviously, a big problem. As you go throughout your day with food in your inventory, it will decompose and spoil. To combat this, you either eat it or store it in an ice box. Even so, your food still isn't completely safe in the ice box. Finally, there is rain, lightning, snow, and more snow. As the winter months draw near, you will be forced to stay near your fire unless you have the proper attire. Each and every enemy in this game is basically out for your head as well. The hellhounds will come every once in a while to remind you to stay on guard. Swamps come alive with deadly spiked tentacles that lash out if you get too close. Pigmen will defend their brethren to the death if need be. All of this comes with a grim reminder that to survive, you must always be alert, unless you want a beefalo horn shoved up your bum. 9/10 overall score			"

												This game is HARD.  You get thrown into it with no tutorial, no explanation and no help.  Not gonna lie - I ended up looking a lot of things up at the beginning because I don't deal with these types of games very well.  However, you learn quickly and it gets to the point where you don't care why you're in this other world, why there are shadow creatures trying to kill you, etc.  You just have to survive.  There's a lot of item collection and the opportunity to build bigger and better defenses, offenses, etc. There's no real right or wrong way to play this game.  You will probably die a lot but there is tons of replayability.			"

												Don't Starve is a 2013 action-adventure video game with survival and roguelike elements, developed and published by the Canadian indie company Klei Entertainment. The game was initially released via Valve's Steam software for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux on April 23, 2013. A PlayStation 4 port became available the following year and further versions for iOS and mobile phones are under consideration. Downloadable content titled Reign of Giants was released on April 30, 2014, and a multiplayer expansion called Don't Starve Together became free for existing users on June 3, 2015.[1]The game follows a scientist named Wilson who finds himself in a dark, dreary world and must survive as long as possible. Toward this end, the player must keep Wilson healthy, fed, and mentally stable as he avoids a variety of surreal and supernatural enemies that will try to kill and devour him. The game's ""Adventure"" mode adds depth to the sparse plot and pits Wilson against the game's antagonist, Maxwell.Time by time, you unlock more valuable and specific-abilities characters.'Rate: 11/10			"

												This game really turned me against myself. A part of me really liked the game, while another was eagerly waiting to get off. Dont Starve is a survival game that blends a unique style of artwork with a fasinating story. By all means, the story is very well done and the gameplay is not bad, and if you like survival this is the game for you, but somewhere it just failed. It failed when it came to replay value, or how much you can play a game after you have finished it once. i felt that it started getting repetetive, doing the same things over and over for the same objective. Overall, i do recommend this game to anyone who loves survival, but i would only buy it if it were on sale.			"

 Don't Starve: Shipwrecked  is a standalone expansion to the base survival game  Don't Starve . Let it be known that I have not played the original game to any extent and my impressions are based on the expansion and its content.  Narrative  The narrative is entirely freeform and allows the player to create their own story according to personal playstyle. Your enjoyment in this regard is mostly limited to your own imagination. However, each playable character has his or her own personality quirks, quips and unique gameplay interactions. For example, my favorite character is a snotty librarian who is able to bypass certain tech restrictions due to her vast intelligence and in exchange is unwilling to eat spoiled food.   Gameplay  Due to the nature of permadeath games, the player's response to death is paramount to whether or not the game succeeds. When the player inevitably sees the ""You died"" screen, frustration will be a natural response. However, does the player feel enticed to try again? Has the player learned valuable information that will serve to prevent the same death from occurring?  Don't Starve: Shipwrecked  succeeds for the most part in this regard. For example, at a predetermined time a certain mob will spawn and attack the player. This acts as a test to see if the player has adequately prepared. The first time I had to fight this mob, I instantly died - I was  not  prepared. How could I be? I did not know that the pounding footsteps and the shaking ground were signs of my coming death. However, during my second attempt, I realized that this certain mobs' movements were incredibly predictable and burdened with a long attack animation. I kited them and dispatched them with ease. Five minutes later, while congratulating myself with a hearty vegetable stew, I was punched to mincemeat by a enraged ent revenging his fallen children who I had unwittingly used as my kindling for said stew. And so the ouroboric cycle of punishment/information/success/punishment continued. During the downtime when you are not being chased by rabid sharks or angry buffalo, you will spend your time traveling from island to island in search of new materials, new technologies and establishing bases of operation. There is also a beautiful settings menu with ample customization options for certain mobs/events/seasons/resources to be tweaked, increased or even removed. Do you really love picking berries? Increase the berry bush seed. Do you HATE @#(%@^( KLEPTOMANIC MONKEYS? Remove the monkeys... Or just feed them a banana next time, recruit them permamently, and start a primate civil war. Watch their monkey huts burn down; watch the baby monkeys scream for mercy while you lounge by the shore sipping some iced tea and listening to Rage Against the Machine. Sensory  The art style looks like the baby of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and American McGee's Alice: sharp lines and bright, contrasting colors all wrapped up in a twisted design. You will never look so good being mutilated over and over again. The sounds are interesting, unique, and did not devolve into repetition. However, the musical soundtrack needed more variance - I eventually listened to my own music and was perfectly content. Conclusion  Do you enjoy being slapped in the face repeatedly by someone other than your wife? Do you relish the idea of convincing monkeys to murder each other with their own feces? Are you titillated by the notion of spending five hours building an empire only to die from a coconut falling on your head?  Do you enjoy complex games with a myriad of gameplay elements which allow you to play your own game against the game? If you said yes to the above then  Don't Starve: Shipwrecked  is a game definitely worth dying.			"

												Picked some flowers, dug up a grave, found a gem, made a ice wand, ate some pork, burned a pig villiage, killed the pig villiage survivors, went through a worm hole, went back throught the worm hole, ate some berries, sat down, made a backpack, cooked some rabbit, shaved a beard, went insane, saw shadow people, lit a torch, ran form shadow people, torch ran out, watch my arm get torn off, died.

												Let's make it quick: I believe Don't Starve is the best sandbox survival game in the market. Whatever the price, the lower the better. Just buy it. The DLC as well, especially the multiplayer standalone expansion: Don't Starve Together. Why?Because it's really well made right from the start. Don't Starve has a very robust system in place within the gameplay. Despite being a survival game, it plays out almost like a 4X strategy. To survive, you need to eXplore the world. eXploit its riches, eXpand yourself and your base of operation, and eXterminate the enemies that threaten your life. Except you're just playing a guy, not an empire or somethingThe visual is fantastic. It has a very distinguished art style that people can easily recognize. The animation is smooth like a cartoon on TV. The characters are all unique and plays very differently. The monster are varied with its challenge and the world, oh the world... It pose a lot of question. It begs to be explored.It's really great that the devs didn't cop out with retro pixel art like a lot of other indie game out there and it really shows. Very few of those game looks decent and most simply look terrible. Don't Starve is a proof that hiring actual artist is worth it.I absolutely have fun playing the game and can't reccommend it enough.EDIT: I nominated this game for Steam ""Steam Best Use of Farm Animal"" Award			"

												This game is addicting.The style of the game in my opinion fits this scenario and the humor behind it is clever.The game offers you countless hours of fun and plenty of stuff to do around.One thing I love about it is the fact that once you're dead..you're dead.This makes you stay in constant fear of losing all of the progress and this fear only intensifies with the progress you make.Again,the number of things you can do are almost countless.You can set a whole forest on fire just because you want to or because you want to kill something that is after you!You can explore caves and fight bats and spiders or just build yourself a small town from which you can sustain yourself without exploring.You can choose to be a explorer and wander from one place to another to try and discover new creatures and new resources.The replay ability of this game is insane due to the fact that the game has tons of good mods and that the devs put so much work into releasing a lot of free updates.Also the game randomly generates the world,that means you will never have the same experience twice.

												Jeeeeeeesuuussssssssssssss, I just love this game. When I first booted it up, I was perfectly normal about it. I didn't think much of it in the game menu, but immediately when I spawned in my first world, a man appeared and said I have to prepare food and shelter before dark, I am on my own, and he drops me off in the middle of nowhere. Right when I saw him, I cracked a jolly smile. The man was tall, in a suit, holding a briefcase, and with dark brown hair. Sound familiar? Yes. Very. What? Dafuq? Not familiar? Well, let me give you a hint. GMAAANNNNN. Yea, NOW, does it sound familiar? required resources are randomly scattered along the terrian, and different biomes containing many useful resources. The great thing about these resources, is just so cool. Picked up something useless? Not possible. Everything has it's own purpose. I just love that. When The day turns to night, EVERYTHING GOES BLACK. Im not kidding you, EVERYTHING goes black. And you get hit by... something... And you die in a matter of seconds. This, of course, can be avoided by building a torch or a campfire, which are very cheap items. There are so many good things about this game, if I listed all of them, this review would be 45 paragraphs long, so I'm just gonna stop writing here. I highly recommend this game and if you have a spare 15 bucks, buy it. Immediately. Or I'll eat you. Well, anyways thanks for reading, goodbye!			"

												Very addictive and unique game that really makes you feel like you are accomplishing something when you do it right, and punishes you when you do it wrong. Expect to fail the first dozen times you play, but it is just a learning curve. If you stick it out you WILL live through that first winter and when you see it rain for the first time after a winter of snow, or when you see the Redbirds come back the feeling you will get is worth the price of the game. Only made it to day 67 so far and the reason I died was because I decided to explore a swamp in winter, stupid idea. I never felt like the game screwed me over, it is always poor planning that does you in, and that is what makes this game great in my opinion.			"

												Minecraft as a rouguelike experience drawn in a style I associate somehow with the works Tim Burton. It's funny, dark, difficult and pretty addictive. First time you die after a new personal record streak of survived days, you'll find yourself cursing and frustated...for about 10 seconds and then restart the game. Highly recommended for those who enjoy rouguelike and sandbox games. Also, the devs are updating the game with new content constantly. One of the few games I have in my library I'm always looking forward to see what's new.			"

												One of the most fun and addicting games I've played. Originally played console version on PS4, but had to pick up the steam version to play on my computer. The controls are great once you get used to them. There are an endless number of things to do, and every time you play, you discover something new. It's a little confusing at first, but stick with it and you get better with each playthrough. This has quickly become one of my favorite games. Great community support and mods in the Steam workshop as well!			"

It's a dark, twisted survival game where even the friendly pigs will eventually try to kill you.

												If you don't have this game in your library yet. You have to get it. It's an amazing sandbox and survival game with Tim Burton-esque art style. You'll never get the same world twice, and the adventure mode is really challenging. If someone tells you that they already did everything in Don't Starve and have less than 10 hours, they're lying, there's TONS of stuff to do, Get through winter, fight bosses, explore the caves and the ancient ruins, and if you get bored, assemble the Wooden Thing and change characters in a new world to make it a much challenging or different experience. The devs are amazing and keep the game fresh. Currently waiting for the Fall DLC. They also try to respond to all e-mails personally as well as comments on their Facebook page. Also since the addition of workshop you can improve your game and have a lot more things to do. I love this game and every aspect of it. 10/10			"

												It really is one of the best indie games ever made. You can play it for as long as you want, because you can unlock more characters with their own personalities and possiblities. The good things about this game are:- A random world generator - You will never play on the same map again! Yes. NEVER.- You can customize your world - YOU pick if you want frogs, trees, rabbit holes, long day, long night, short winter, etc.- New characters to unlock - They have their own possibilities and personalities.- The game has got a sense of humor and nice graphics- It isn't really expensive and worth the moneyNegative things:- The game can get too stressful - If you build a big house with a fireplace, stone walls, science machine etc. and if you die... Well, you can get very disapointed.- Literally everything can kill you in this game - Even frogs!- After some time of playing you will simply get bored - But hey, you can always generate a new map!So yeah, Don't Starve is a very nice indie game. If you're a fan of such games - It's a must-have for you!			"

												10/10Easily the diamond of the survival genre, with so many unique and wonderful ideas.  Don't starve is a unique take on said genre, with an almost 'cute' gothic tim burton esque aesthetic containing characters that literally exist purely to make your life a misery, chase you, eat you, crush you, sting you, hunt you, steal your ♥♥♥♥, evict you, destroy you and your base, backstab you, become mobile npc bases that still hate you and there is even an npc that goes on a spree looting the map of all resources. I can remember when this first came out and played from like 7pm until about 4am one time and i loved every second. The game starts you off with no tutorial or explanation to anything at all. You are required to fend for yourself in this unforgiving land of permadeath and bees, and if you are the more casual sort of player i'd highly recommend giving the wiki a look as it may explain some things. You must fend for yourself, build a camp, set up crops and as the title implies...don't starve. But starving is the least of your worries. Everything in this game exists to murder you in ways you never thought possible. On top of that, you must worry about your sanity, temperature and health as well. Too many spider bites and you'll die. Been out in the night for too long? You'll go insane and even the shadows will be out to kill you. Oh look, it's become winter! Good luck, because you'll need to wear some nice warm clothes or you'll freeze to death! The game does have some less than lethal additions to it as well. You can come across villages of friendly pig men who you can befriend and trade with, which is wonderful since they are can sometimes be farmers, giving you free resources, food and even defence as the pig men are rather hostile towards monsters.This game really is bursting at the seams with content here and the maps are even randomly generated to ensure that no playthrough is like another. Even if you manage to ""beat"" survival mode by finding all of the tele-portato parts an exploring the cave systems for super duper loot, you can always play campaign for increasingly hard scenarios that are really fun as well. Avoid bees. Avoid all the bees.			"

A while back I reviewed this as boring, basic and lacking. And it was. I played during the first days of release, and didn't give it enough time to get interesting. After sinking a ton of hours into this and still finding new things to want to check out, mess around with, explore and unlock, it's safe to say Don't Starve is a well made and interesting game.It's stacked with charm and intrigue. It still has a dead end in terms of discovery, tech and gameplay, like any survival or city sim game, but it's going to take you a lot longer to get there in Don't Starve than most other games. It's also fuelled by lots of strange little gameplay mechanics and items that you find along the way.I haven't even touched the DLC yet, and I'm not the greatest fan of survival games, but Don't Starve has definitely given me my moneys worth after investing a little time and effort.Pretty boring survival game. Don't Starve starts off with the same feeling you get playing Minecraft for the first time: You want to collect food and items to survive the first night and it's pretty exciting and fun.Unfortunately this is about it, and after the first few days of experimenting and finding out what everything does all you're left with is exploring and fighting. Fighting never really seems very exciting and has no real purpose other than maybe collecting items, and exploring seems like a waste of time since it doesn't help you survive any longer (which ultimately is the goal of the game). As a result this game gets boring very quickly and there doesn't appear to be much to do.Pretty boring survival game. "

 Long Story ShortDon’t Starve is an extremely difficult masterpiece that will take you 50+ hours in order to learn how to survive in this unforgiving universe. The art style is unique and the sounds/music is beautiful and creepy.  The game play is outstanding and it will, whether you want it to or not, draw you in for hours of game time without giving you a chance to take a break. You’ll probably starve in real life before you can put your controller down. It’s without a doubt a 10/10 and is one of the few games I think couldn’t even be improved upon. Long Story Long- The Game PlayDon’t Starve is a survival game and therefore your only natural objective is to survive. This is accomplished by keeping your sanity, hunger, heath, warmth, and sogginess in check. In order to do so, you’ll gather resources, make your camp, plant crops, craft recipes, etc. in order to create a working outpost. The game will constantly become more difficult as Maxwell, the villain, sends his hounds to attack you, you run out of any resource, and then there is the ever looming threat of winter. Variations to the game playThis game is almost 100% customizable whether you want more or less tall birds, no winter, or if you want to commit suicide by making it permanently night.  There are also several unlockable characters that all have different stats, starting items, and uses. Lastly, you can, if you’re lucky enough to find a rare portal where you’re able to switch to adventure mode where you are plopped in a premade world, opposed to the randomly generated worlds in survival mode, where you attempt to live past the more increasingly difficult worlds you’re put into in order to make it to the next and, eventually, toss Maxwell off his throne of lies!Music and SoundThe creators of Don’t Starve cut no corners when it comes to the music and sound effects. The music is beautiful, exiting, and darn right creepy depending on the circumstances. In fact, me and my roommate once did a scientific experiment in order to see if playing frightening music, in this case music from Don’t Starve, at night while we were asleep would affect our dreams or not. We both had nightmares. The sound is also perfect for whatever action is happening. I often want to eat my food reserve just so I can hear Wilson munching away at the meat or kill a spider so I can hear it shriek.ArtThe art style for Don’t Starve is completely original and shows character for objects through its harsh strokes or gentile lines. Combined with the music and sound, the art gives the player a perfect atmosphere that, in my opinion, has never been matched by another survival game.DLC and Don’t Starve TogetherThe DLC for Don’t Starve, Reign of Giants, adds craftibles, items, enemies, and even two whole freaking seasons! If you ask me, this DLC adds difficulty and challenge to this already challenging game and, unless you’ve played lots of survival games, I wouldn’t suggest using it till you’ve at least made it till winter in the normal version. As far as Don’t Starve Together goes, it adds a little content as well as making the game significantly easier. I’d suggest you’d get it if you’ve already bought and liked the original but find yourself wanting to shake things up by tossing in some other players. ConclusionGame play- 10/10. Music and sound- 10/10. Customizability - 10/10. Art style- 10/10. DLC- 10/10. This is the best survival game I’ve ever played or ever seen played.  It’s addicting, entertaining, and challenging. Without a doubt it’s one of my top ten favorite games. It’s also one of four games I think is as flawless as humanly possible.  Oh course, like all games, there is those who won’t enjoy it. So if you’re someone who doesn’t normally enjoy intense, extremely difficult games, the most likely won’t find Don’t Starve appealing. However, to anyone that doesn’t fall in this category, I’ll say this: Don’t Starve is a chef-d'oeuvre, a masterpiece beyond words, perfected in every way, and I can’t suggest it enough. Final rating- 100/100 one of the few perfect games on this earth.			"

												YES! YES! Another Minecraft themed game, not first person, not 3D but that's what makes this game unique, Almost as good as Minecraft if not better. In this game, you are given a character (you unlock characters later) and you need to survive for as long as you can, picking up resources that will aid in getting you a weapon or Light Sources and helping you in battle. There are lots of food for you to pick up which in my opinion was limited in Minecraft. This game also gives you access to Mods so you can download Mods from the steam workshop which i find helpful especially the mods that have a neverending light source. I am loving this game. This game lets you save your progress, Food is much easier to find than in Minecraft. Some of the features are better than Minecraft already. This is a 2D Minecraft! Simple as that. I definitely recommend you buy this game because it has come to the point where every Steam user MUST have a copy of this game. 10/10 Fricking Awesome			"

												Don't Starve is one of those games that put you right up on the difficulty roller coaster making you learn as you go with no real direction as what you are supposed to do. This lets you explore things slowly as you begin to get better at surviving and unlocking new characters along the way to keep the game a bit more fresh. The Reign of Giants DLC gives you more unique items and adversaries to play with.Overall, this game is great. One of my personal favorites on Steam.			"

You are going to want to cook this food with fire. You are also going to want to build tools like axes, pickaxes, etc and harvest quite a bit of raw materials. Then you are going to want to build science machines in order to build better tools/survival gear/weapons.Combat is fairly basic, click and run is the general tactic. I really think this is a wiki friendly game despite spoilers. You should learn about what items you want and how to craft them by searching a wiki.This is really a fun game.  The Devs have released a ton of content and fixes since then and continue to update once a month or so. And the good part is if you have a low - end pc you can run it though with the netbook modus.

												In its minimal and simple atmosphere, Don't Starve succeeded where many failed: delivering a balanced, challenging and story driven survival game.As the obvious main focus is to survive (and how hard it can be at the beginning!), the player will progress through a story that has an impact in the game (trying to avoid any potential spoilers).The survival machanism is traditional and unique at the same time:There are many resources to loot, and several items can have multiple uses (for example pine cones can be planted, used as fuel to feed the fire or become crafting material); exploring the land around you not only gets you to secret or story-related areas, but also signals how the world changes due to nature rhythm (for example seasons will progress and according to them resources may grow again faster or slowlier, the day/night cycle will change), moreover, it is always best NOT to explore during the night: the land becomes completely dark, pitch dark, and creatures will literally devour you unless you have a source of light, so it's best to build a safe place and dedicate the night to crafting and refining materials you gathered in the day.Crafting and researching new ""technologies"" is, of course, the vital part of the game. You start with some basic knowledge of craftable items, but you need to build scientific buildings (and stand next to them) to unlock more advanced options.The grotesque atmosphere is one of the winning points of this game: everything is weird and questionable, from totem-adoring pigs to crawling shadows. The overall feeling of Don't Starve is similar to when you read a fantasy book, curled up in your bed sheet as a thunder storm is raging from afar.If you love survival games, dark settings and challenging stories, get this game!

												Wow.....I knew I would enjoy this game...but I did not expect to put 250 + hours in it and still going! I had not played minecraft before this but it is cleat that Don't Starve takes the survival aspects of that game and totally runs with it...making the experience more brutal and tense. It is hard because you die...alot. But around the 12th time or so you start to learn what to do and what NOT to do. Once you pass the amount of days you've stayed alive...you feel a sense of accomplishment! Then you just try to beat your record over and over. But the game isn't just about that...there is a mysterious charm to it and very deep! There is a story even! Its hidden. Also, there is additional game modes that can only be accessed by putting time in the game and exploring. There's too much to say about the game....to newcomers...I would say give it time and enjoy the challenge and charm...try new things and eventually the game will click for you! I give it a 10/10....amazing job Klei!			"

												This is the best survival game I have ever played. If you love survival, you are not doing yourself any favors by avoiding this game. It throws you to the wolves and does not hold your hand. Yes, the graphics are cartoony, but dont be fooled. This game will test your skills and you will die and die and die again. Grab the DLC's and you have a beast of a challenge to survive. Especially the new Shipwrecked DLC.I have owned this game for years and still keep coming back. The mechanics are deceptively simple, pick up as much stuff as you can and start trying to figure out how to survive. Not starving is only one priority. You will want to set up a camp and start doing science to unlock the best stuff. You will also have weather and heat and cold to contend with on top of the fact that nearly everything will try and kill you in one way or another. Caves add another layer of challange to the game with multiple levels of darkness and monsters to explore. You cook, build, explore, fight, and science the ♥♥♥♥ out of things to try and survive.Use Wiki or Youtube to help get started.Overall this game is one of my favorite all time games. Do yourself a favor and buy it now if you dont own it.			"

												I've been playing games since I was 8 years old. I'm 21 now and I can tell you that this is one of the best games I have played in my entire life.With that said, I want to tell you why this game is so good.1st and most important of all is; this is a survival game. Meaning hard difficulty and permanent death. Even though, you can customize the world to your liking and survive with your conditions. The default version being the intended difficulty.2nd is the gameplay. You can move with clicking your mouse, just like in any Diablo-esque games. You can move with ASDW (which I prefer and recommend). It's simple to play and is very responsive. The game is simple in graphics and has really good animations (meaning anyone can play it!). The music and sounds are awesome but they might become repetitive at some point (at which you just turn them off :D). This may be one downside that bothered me a bit, but it is not a big problem at all.3rd is the game itself, you are placed inside a world where you are only told that you should look for something to eat. Don't starve is not nearly the only danger you should look out for. You have to stay warm in the Winter, stay cool in the Summer, protect your things, avoid monsters, kill monsters, survive giants, maintain sanity. But more importantly, you build structures, walls, farms, protective structures, traps, weapons, tools. Furthermore, you explore secrets, caves, biomes, animals, monsters, items! There are so many options in this game to explore. I have 40-ish hours on this game (for now) and I have only explored barely half of all the things that can be done. I haven't even customized the starting world yet! I've been playing default untill I got the hang of it. But the number of settings and customizations you can make to your world are nearly endless! You can also unlock other characters which all have different perks and abillities.4th and last are the community mods that can expand and improve your game greatly (I'm using 8 mods at the moment). Not to mention the upcoming multiplayer that will allow you and your friends to experience this survival game in a world that has your rules and settings.I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes: survival / fighting / building and crafting stuff.Best regards, Devon.

												Don't Starve is an absolutely awesome survival game with a mesmorizing soundtrack and genuine dark, mysterious -- and sometimes satirical aura surrounding it.You start off with no weapons, no protection from the elements (aside from the preset clothing the character of your choice is given, which I will get more into later), and most of all, little knowledge as to where in the heck you are -- or how you got there (unless you watched some of the trailers.)You are spoken down to by this mysterious and dapper being sporting a traditional suit 'n tie, very reminiscent of the ""G-Man"" from the Half-Life series, he addresses you with a few words, and then poofs into nonexistance -- though you'll meet up with him in the near future.Don't Starve may SEEM like an absolutely pointless survival game with an infinite number of days, and that the clock won't stop ticking until you die (permadeath is a real thing, and you can't come back unless you've crafted yourself an effigy!) but fret not, there's more to this game than meets the eye!After what might be hours and hours of grinding, you'll find yourself coming across a variety of different scenarios - what looks like towns inhabited by xenophobic pig-men, stone ruins patrolled by mechanical 'robots', and much more. You'll find mysterious objects like ""Box Thing"", ""Ring Thing"", and they might just be miscellaneous objects you can just throw around and never pay any further mind to.. or they might be the key to 'beating' the game.My experience with the game has been absolutely splendid, I've encountered moments when I've been absolutely mobbed by armed pig-men, nearly scared to death by what looks like extraordinarily large turkies which pop out of bushes, and nerve-racking moments when my characters sanity begins to deterioate, causing haunting figures to appear..But lets break it down, shall we?PROS - A Survival Game: But a more well-designed and optimized one, constantly managed and won't be forsaken like what happens to most survivals.. (looking at you, DayZ)A Neat-o Crafting System: Items can be either very simplistic or slightly trivial to create, starting off is quite easy - mere flint and twigs and you have yourself either a Pickaxe, Shovel, or Chopping Axe, and can now chop down all them trees! (""Take that, Nature!"" -- Wilson)Insanely Vague Story: This can go both ways; some people enjoy a story that's fleshed out, has alot of dialogue, and is clearly presented to you, but not this game - the game itself doesn't provide the player much information to work off of, conclusions will have to be made on your own end, and there are plenty of wiki's that'll help you further understand the game.Wild Encounters: There are alot of things to see in this game, from the occasional mysterious item surrounded by 'Evil Flowers' that'll drain your character's sanity to wormholes that'll consume you whole and transport you to a different part of the map. (Wormhole transport systems are great, yo.) Not to mention the shifting of seasons, an abundance of sinkholes leading to caves, and with the addition of DLCs, you could be taking down colossal giants or sailing the seas. You could also purchase ""Don't Starve Together"" (free if you've already bought the base game prior to the DLC's release) and try and survive with friends, or random people on the interwebs!A Variety Of Characters: Wilson is the preset character, and has no other special abilities other than the ability to grow the most manliest of beards (I mean, what more do you need than that, right?) but there are also little old ladies, muscular men afraid of the dark, and even a little pyromaniac girl and her dead sister at your disposal. All with their own unique abilities.CONS -Tedious Gameplay: There are people who have yet to beat the game despite having weeks logged into it, YouTubers still at the first stage whilst on Day 300, so on and so forth. So if you can't handle devotion or have commitment issues.. might wanna steer away from this game a bit.Rage Factor: The rage factor in this game depends on your progress, really. I wouldn't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ if I was brutally slaughtered by a spider on my first day.. but if you're the kind of person that has over 50 days, collected the items that'll help you progress through the game's ""story"" and are mistakenly killed by one of those ♥♥♥♥-headed frogs, well.. I'll set up a prayer circle to mend your broken heart and sanity.Game Length: This goes along with 'Tedious Gameplay', but just take a gander at the people who've actually 'beaten' the game and the hours THEY have. Or just go on YouTube and see for yourself.TL;DR - An absolutely phenomenial game, the music makes it all better. Don't buy it if you can't handle the whole survival concept, permadeath, and sheer overall length of the game.Graphics/Art: 4.5 out of 5Gameplay: 5 out of 5Story/Lore: 2.5 out of 5 (if not researched) 4 out of 5 (if researched)Overall Grade: 4 out of 5 "

												It's not so much 'Don't Starve', as it is don't stay up too late, don't poke those bees, don't follow those footprints, don't ♥♥♥♥ off those cows, don't lick that spider.. ect.From it's visuals to it's gameplay, this is a game that I simply love, but also cannot force myself to give a lot of time.

												If you often lament about you as a player having low control over high-level events in a game or over the game environnement, this is the game for you.Don't Starve is a survival game and a nice sandbox: go explore, gather stuff and make the best possible use of ressources by combining them in one way or another.The artistic direction is endearing (think of Tim Burton works, for instance) and comes with some welcome sense of humor much needed in that cruel game world - you will die again and again.Last but not least, the developper support on this game deserves praise, there have been tons of very valuable updates to the game.

												This is my favorite survival game ever. Even if you're not into the 2D graphics the gameplay is super easy to get started with but really tough to master making it *IMO* very fun. Everytime you play you'll have a slightly different expirience as the ""world"" is randomly generated so there's a lot of replay value here.When you're getting started the base game should be enough but once you have mastered winter you'll need to upgrade to the ""Reign of Giants"" DLC.9/10PS: If you're having a hard time mastering the ""kiting"" technique and want an easy way to get started play as WX-78 and increase the number of clockwork robots in the customizeable world settings. The gears they drop will keep you going until you've got a decent base and having to kite them will teach you a lot quickly.			"

												For lack of better words, this game is perfect. Don't Starve is one of those games where you have heard about it for a while and decided to try it. After playing for ten minutes, you say "" This is pretty fun"". Those ten minutes quickly change to more large, regrettable numbers. Overall, buying this game was one of the best $15 I have ever spent.			"

												This game's art style is really what caught my eye in the first place, so I thought I would buy it whenever it went on sale.   Basically this is a game of survival and there are many things that can kill you. Your character is thrown into a world of vast wilderness and left to fend for himself/herself. Each world is randomly arranged and have random spawnings, keeping the game pretty fresh and new. You gather natural materials like sticks and rocks, make tools like axes and shovels, make traps or weapons to catch animals for food, set up campfires for survival, etc.  In the game you have three things you want to keep in check when surviving: Health, Hunger, and Sanity. If you lose your health, well, you can die. If you lose your hunger, you lose your health and die. If you lose your sanity, you start seeing things. Eventually your hallucinations become violent when you're insane and can hurt you. You can also unlock different and unique characters depending on in-game events or accomplishments.  The art style of this game in my opinion, is very unique and eye-catching. The game is very smooth and doesn't lag alot in general. (depending on how your computer is running though.) It does crash sometimes though. (I've had it crash twice on me.) I have also found a few glitches in the game (before Reign of Giants.)  This game gives you alot of chores for survival to keep you occupied, though sometimes it does get repeative. The worlds in Maxwell's Gate are the true challenges, whether its going through endless winters or rain. Or even hunted by hounds. Every world is filled with multiple monsters and critters to kill or survive from. There are also tons of material to collect for tons of creations you can unlock and survive with, giving this game some variety if you get that far. I really love the different characters in this game too, each one having their own charms and personalities. (My favorite character is Webber.) At times I get alot of creepy vibes from this game, especially at night when my sanity is getting low. And accomplished vibes whenever I survive from stuff. This game does have its charms, but it also has its fair share of flaws. Some of the flaws with this game is the repetiveness when trying to survive multiple times. Dying is definitely a big disappointment, especially when you get pretty far. This was not meant to be a very easy game though. The farther you get, the harder it gets. I would also say that some of the music (mostly in reign of giants) is a little too...cheesy, in a way? (I suppose its meant to be like that but still,) And some of the character's voices (which are instrument sounds) get a little annoying at times. Like Wilson's, for example, and when he gets hurt. The things they say give them alot of personality though. Especially Wendy. One more thing, sometimes (especially when you're a newbie) you encounter things that you have no idea how to deal with unless you look it up. (Which I suggest doing research before eating any of those colorful mushrooms unless you want to do it yourself.)   One last thing I have to say about this game is this: It's not for everyone. Some people (like me) will really like this game, and others might think its as boring as heck, everyone has their own tastes. So, if you're interested in it, I suggest checking this game out and maybe watch other people play it. Its a very fun game and can get time-consuming, I'd say its worth a buy. 8/10.Another thing: Multiplayer is comming soon! :D			"

												We are all familiar with the stereotypical grunting, primitive, idiotic caveman. But have you ever tried going outside (bear with me, we're all gamers here) and trying to make a simple tool with only rocks and sticks? Given the fact that they were born into a world where it was kill or be killed and every day was a fight for survival, it's incredible what the cavemen managed to accomplish.In Don't Starve, you take control of a scientist named Wilson*, who has just been thrown into a world as deadly as those the cavemen lived in. However, you have the advantage of knowledge. You know what fire is and how to make it. But you better make it quickly, because the night is fast approaching, and unlike the cavemen, your stars and moon do not provide light. At least, not enough to keep the shadows away.Welcome to a world of survival, where terrors lurk around every corner, where hunger and madness can prove more dangerous than wild beasts, where death is always a few steps behind. Can you gather the resources you need to defy your own doom? Can you build, research, and advance, all while keeping hunger and madness at bay? Can you build a civilization to stand the test of time? Oh wait, wrong game. Anyway, the world of Don't Starve is filled with horrors and dangers. And that's not even including the winter.Oh, yes. Winter. The most dangerous time of year. Perhaps you thought you were safe from starvation with your bountiful crops of fruit and vegetables. But when the ground freezes over, the plants become stagnate. Now, right when you thought you were safe and secure, you find yourself on the brink of disaster again. For winter is the season of the hunt. But what are you? The hunter? Or the prey? Brace yourself. Winter is coming.Wait, wrong thing again. In any case, this game is a must-have for those who love surviving by the skin of their teeth. The art style is reminiscent of Tim Burton animated movies, making the game truly unique in its field. The gameplay is great, either with keyboard and mouse or with the steam controller. At the time of writing this review, I've played 70 hours of Don't Starve, and I've only scratched the surface. Maybe that's just because I suck at it, but even so I enjoy it immensely. And I haven't even gotten started on the DLC's yet!*Wilson is the default character, but there are many others, including Willow the Firestarter, Wolfgang the Strongman, and Woody the... well, you'll see. ;-)			"

												This Great Wilderness survival has grown a lot in the past few months, at first we were told that we needed to collect food as to not die, but we slowly learned through regular and exciting updates that the games 'badguy' maxwell has a few secrets. Play through the adventure mode learning who maxwell is, what the island is and how you got there, imagine Lost but in a slightly dark cartoon style.I prefer just simply trying to survive in a hostile environment containing vicous hounds, terrifying nightmare monsters, deep and dark caves and a whole world of nasties that want you dead!

												Excelente survival lleno de contenido y con considerable dificultad. No sólo tenés que cuidarte de no morir de hambre, sino que también tenés que cuidar tu estabilidad mental, tu vida, el no morirte de frío, que no te parta un rayo en las tormentas, que no te quedes a oscuras, etc. Cada día el juego se hace más complicado y los mismos varían su duración según las estaciones, a la noche sí o sí necesitás estar en una zona con luz o la comés en 5 segundos, literalmente. Se pueden recolectar cientos de cosas y con los mismos craftear otras cientas, todo con un útil uso. Con respecto a la comida, podés cocinarla en cualquier fogata y más adelante hacer recetas en el crack pot. La misma se pudre si no la consumís, aunque la guardes en la heladera, cosa que sólo retrasa el enpudrecimiento.El modo aventura consiste de 5 ""mapas"" que presentan un reto, por ejemplo en uno es todo el tiempo invierno. Le da un sentido al juego con el final, el cual dudo ver porque es bastante jodido que lo pase.Es un excelente juego que da para cientos de horas por su infinita rejugabilidad y encima está a muy bajo precio, aparte de estar genial. Un MUST HAVE en toda regla.			"

												Well, Don't Starve Together, the multiplayer expansion of this is out, but it doesn't mean that this game is bad. It's a survival game. It's like Minecraft, but not in the slightest. This is the game that gets all the DLC that Don't Starve Together doesn't get. Also, the boss health in this version is smaller than in the Don't Starve Together game, so if you want to play alone, this is what you should get. Only problem is that the base game doesn't get updated anymore, but Don't Starve Together does. The DLC costs like 3 or 4€, i think. And the fact that the base game doesn't get updated, doesn't mean that the DLC doesn't. Fu*king cash grabbers. "

-Quick Review-Don’t Starve raises the bar on “survival games”, while many games hold your hand, or let you have an easier game mode, Don’t Starve is actually the opposite, when I start to lose in don’t starve, I feel the game kicking me while I’m down.


YouTube™ Video: Atratzu Reviews: Don't Starve - But he's still very Hungry 

			Views: 92		

			Atratzu is blessed and plagued with a very active metabolism, this is good because he stays skinny... but he's always hungry and trying not to starve. Tired of my puns yet?		

-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  ""Say pal, you don't look so good. You better find something to eat before night comes!"" Those are words to live by. I haven’t actually finished the story myself, I’m still working on that, (I prefer to just explore and try to live as long as I can). I would recommend the trailer[s] to anyone who would like to know more about the story.Some things just aren’t able to be put into words, and the trailer with the conversation between Wilson and Maxwell is just summed up best by watching the trailer.


Well, I found the door... too bad I'm a sucker for punishment. *walks away*

Game Play: The controls are quite straight forward, you can control how your character moves with ASDW, or by clicking on the ground/objects, or click and holding down the mouse button. Your inventory is very limited, but I can’t complain about that, it simply requires you to make backpacks/chests/etc.There are three “resources” to juggle in don’t starve: Sanity, Hunger, Health. As the game itself implies, don’t let yourself be hungry for too long, once your hunger drops to zero, your health drains very fast until you die. Once your health is gone, you’re dead. Sanity is an interesting resource, but I’ll let you find out why for yourself if you get the game.


New Defenses are successful!

Price: Don’t starve costs $14.99 (as of July 25, 2014) and the DLC “Reign of Giants “is $4.99. Apparently this summer there’s supposed to be an expansion to allow the game to become multiplayer, I’m looking forward to playing with friends on this great survival game.Thankfully for those who already own the game and the DLC, you don’t need to worry about buying anything else, but for those that don’t own the game; the price will be increased to $19.99. I’ve put 52 hours into the game so far, I have no doubt I will go back to playing more of this game, so regardless of when you get the game I feel the price is very fair. Conclusion: I used to say that if I had to own only one game, It would come down to a three way tie between ""Minecraft"", ""Terraria"", and ""Don't Starve"". All three are excellent games, and all three have different play styles, Don't Starve is probably the most unique.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=395630283------Edits and updates------Edit/Update January 13, 2015:Here's the URL to see my review for Don't Starve TogetherEdit/Update September 18, 2015:Added screenshots to the review.Here's the URL to see my review for  Don't Starve Reign of Giants DLCEdit/Update February 29, 2016:Added YouTube Video Review Link!

												I already reviewed this game, though I didn't do it justice the first time. This is by far the most addicting game I have ever played, and its stood strong for three years since its release back in 2013, and given that I have managed to survive for over 250 days in a world I generated two months ago, I felt it proper to give my overall thoughts on the game in general. I still recommend it for someone looking for a challenge, and anybody interested in this should definately give it a try, since it does offer a lot that other survival games do not have. On top of managing hunger, you need to manage sanity loss and health as well, making for a challenging experience. With Reign of Giants and Shipwrecked DLC, you can further expand your worlds with new challenges and items to craft. With an endless until you die Sandbox mode, and a portal to an Adventure Mode that offers six harder more challenging worlds, the replayabillity is near endless, with each world generating a completely different world layout every time.Also, if you end up liking this and would like to play it with friends or strangers, I'd suggest to take a look at Don't Starve Together, the standalone multiplayer version of Don't Starve, complete with all new content and the Reign of Giants expansion content already included with the game.

												This is a very tentative upvote on my part.There isn't anything objectionable about this game; the aesthetics are excellent, the system in place is very well put together. However, I think this is much a case of YMMV on if it's fun for you or not. In my case I found myself searching for a goal and not finding one, which borked any reason I might have to continue playing beyond the first 10 or so runs. Sustaining interest by burning down the forest all through the night can only work for so long.If you are considering buying this game, look to the mechanics as you make your choice. Do you enjoy a procedural world where the only thing to do is gather resources and survive as long as you can? Then this is the game for you. If you need a goal the game gives you to work towards in order to maintain your motivation to play, then bypass it.			"

												With almost 400 hours played I really, really like this game.  The combination of discovery and fear (fear of hunger, darkness, insanity, etc) are a wicked combination.My one recommendation to those playing is to _not_ consult the wiki for clues.  Experimentation and discovery can be really fun.			"

												This is best survival game ever made. No info + no tutorial = best gameplay ever. There is always something new to find, new tool to craft or some new animal to surprise you. Gamers don't care about graphics (which is alternative and epic) but about gameplay and this is best example!			"

												This  is one of best survival games I ever played, bwith really cool art style. First time when playing you don't understand how anything work and die just because of the night monster, but after trying multiple times you survive more and more days even reaching over 100 days. Definitely one of the best indie survival games on Steam.			"

												I already reviewed this game, though I didn't do it justice the first time. This is by far the most addicting game I have ever played, and its stood strong for three years since its release back in 2013, and given that I have managed to survive for over 250 days in a world I generated two months ago, I felt it proper to give my overall thoughts on the game in general. I still recommend it for someone looking for a challenge, and anybody interested in this should definately give it a try, since it does offer a lot that other survival games do not have. On top of managing hunger, you need to manage sanity loss and health as well, making for a challenging experience. With Reign of Giants and Shipwrecked DLC, you can further expand your worlds with new challenges and items to craft. With an endless until you die Sandbox mode, and a portal to an Adventure Mode that offers six harder more challenging worlds, the replayabillity is near endless, with each world generating a completely different world layout every time.Also, if you end up liking this and would like to play it with friends or strangers, I'd suggest to take a look at Don't Starve Together, the standalone multiplayer version of Don't Starve, complete with all new content and the Reign of Giants expansion content already included with the game.

However, I think this is much a case of YMMV on if it's fun for you or not.

												:dsham:Isometric view survival game with quite unique, memorable art style.As you may imagine from the title, focus here is on non-combat survival - fighting hunger and adverse environmental conditions like weather or darkness at night. Granted, monsters are out there to get you as well.The game is rather open ended, no clear goals other than survival, although there's an adventure mode to find, which is a more focused challenge.You're definitely meant to discover things yourself on the go, through many deaths of you, forging mad in-game survival skills in fires of hell. If you're looking through guides, wikias, videos... you are somewhat missing the point and missing out great deal on the intended ""fun"".And good riddance, as far as I am concerned, and wikia contributors be praised. Otherwise game is very unfair, puts constant pressure on you, demands great deal from you yet explains nothing, all the while throwing curve balls at you from all possible directions simultaneously and just waiting for any suitable moment to sucker punch you with extreme prejudice. And on top of that this is perma death. You screw up royally, you're out of luck, and have to start from zero on a new random world (but hopefully with more experience now to do better; also I should say there's a way to secure resurrection, but not like it's fool proof, so the royal screw up is always an option).Seriously, eff that noise. I'm pretty sure die hard fans who went through this without any external help are suffering from Stockholm syndrome.As you may see I'm not entirely a fan of the frantic gameplay and main design decisions in general, but I cannot claim the game is bad. What it wants to do, it does very well, and it's an interesting experience to get out of your comfort zone, change the pace a little. Although I did get me some external help on how to survive in this hell, missing a lot of the intended ""fun"", I had some quality time nonetheless to appreciate this title and I don't regret it.It's not really that hard to set up some nice sustainable camp and a variety of defenses from weekly wake up call, you can even set up reasonable supplies despite your main focus here - food - being perishable... It's just that at some point this becomes a chore that prevents you from doing the real good parts. At least IMHOI had way more actual fun with, say, Terraria, which has quite a different focus - on combat and exploration, with ample addition of creative projects you can undertake, where gathering up resources is a means to an end not your primary worry. I guess I like to mess around in games, especially such that promise sandbox experience, at my own pace, rather than being constantly rushed and pushed and with perma death looming on the horizon to make me lose my entire progress. For the latter, I'd rather play some rogue-lites with well balanced pacing.You may probably get bit philosophical about this and claim this game gets it real... Too real for my taste, I guess. Where's my goddarned escapism, eh?Oh, a final thought, though - the above mostly concerns default settings, but actually the game is extremely configurable so once you do get the taste of the intended default experience, you can tweak practically every aspect of the game a lot to match your tastes and perhaps make it easier or even more difficult. Workshop support also something to consider, and official DLC that adds two more seasons, overheating on top of freezing and some other elements, is also something to mix things up. So despite my whining above you can really get a lot from this title, so give it a shot if you have a chance.:dsham:			"

Don't Starve isn't like alot of games, theres no tutorial and no singluar way to play it. Don't get me wrong the game has it's shortcomings and is still changing alot, especially since the Reign of Giants DLC was released but the beauty of Don't Starve is a combonation of its amazing art style and the amazing unique gamplay style that makes Don't Starve great.

I think there could be more craftable items.2. Extremely unforgiving. I think there should be some mechanism that allows you to get back to base from the resurrection stone otherwise it gets too hard if you die in winter.Overall, its an excellent game and I have made 4 of my other friends buy it as well.

												Let me start this review by telling you how I absolutely LOVE this game. Do note that this review contains spoilers and stuff that might ruin parts of discovery and fun in the game I cannot put my love for this game in words but I will try to explain some points of why I believe this is the revolutionary game that help video games progress as form of art.--------------------------------------First of all let me start by telling about the social commentaty this game makes. I know it's hard to see the social commentary in a game where you're all alone in the wilderness but it's there to be found. The social commentary is subtle and told in a very dark soul-ish way which is leaving hints and bits of information that the player figures out. There are multiple parts implying that the silent protagonist is a female-to-male transgender. For example the protagonist has very feminine jaw and chin. He also has feminine hair with lots of volume. Another not so noticed part is the depression in his eyes. Many think the depression is from being alone in the wilderness and darkness of the world. Well they're wrong. It is from the depression caused by being transgender and being oppressed by white cis men and women.---------------------------------Now to the story of the game. I know this is hard to believe for most people, even the most diehard fans of the game, but the game doesnt actually happen in wilderness but inside the person's dreams. The story is very metaphorical about everything. The safety of fire means support of loved ones when transitioning to opposite gender. The angry animals of the wilderness represent the people who are against his transitioning into a man. The neutral animals/critters are considered bypassers. Those are the people he is able to interact without the people being rude/different towards him just for being transgender.The day and night cycle represent the mood swing caused by hormones in transition. While this is not social commentary, it tells about how reality reflects to his dream which the game is. This mechanism is one of the subtle things that make this game a masterpiece.------------------------------We're done with the story now, lets progress to the gameplay.The gameplay is something completely fresh. You start of in a hostile world of no comfort, like transgender person is before getting his/her support for transitioning. Slowly you start gathering materials to get fire. The materials represent bits of trust you build up with other people. Fire represents, like I earlier explained, the support. This is a big gameplay aspect that makes this game extremely good.Another excellent game mechanic is the hunger mechanic. Hunger reflects upon the character's need for love. If he is let without love, he will most likely die. In the dream he isnt just likely to die if the hunger for love isnt fed, he will die.-------------------------------I know this might be shocking to even most diehard fans but everything in this review was researched for a very long time. I spent countless hours finding out all of this and much more. I didnt include everything I found out in this review because I wanted to keep this as a Steam review and not a full review for a bigger site. If you're hungry for more information and stuff I've found out, just ask me.This concludes my review and I strongly recommend everyone to play this.If you're big fan of art games, this is a must have.

												Okay, here's something based on a true story - My first death in this game was due to stravation. It's the name of the game, I'm just that great of a player.Don't Starve is a nice little Indie game, I like it and I reccomend others to try it as well. At first I thought I wouldn't like it because I thought it just had the same concept as any other survival game, you get materials, don't die, and build stuff. I actually compared it to Minecraft. That was a mistake. This is obviously nothing like Minecraft, and it even isn't as generic as most other surivial based games. When I first started playing I fell in love with the game. It was fun learning how to do everything, exploring the world, and trying not to starve. The art style is nice and unique and gameplay aint half bad, I personally use the keyboard and the mouse, but it can be played completely with your mouse if you want to and it had controller support as well.Most people will probably skip the single player game and get Don't Starve Together but I suggest getting Don't Starve as well. It can prepare you for playing co-op in Together as you learn the ins and outs of everything, that and the fact they are two completely diffrent games in terms of conent.Don't Starve Together only has the base game and some asepcts of the Reign of Giants DLC, along with some Don't Starve Together exclusive conent. The base game however has 2 DLCs thus far, Shipwrecked completely changing the game as if it was a full conversion mod, and also the base game has Adventure Mode, in which you put your skills to the test to surivie the world and solve the puzzles to finish the game.This game is endless hours of fun and it's quite easy to get started and find yourself doing good. The only downside is that when you do die (for good) You loose your world and everything and you have to start over, I personally don't like perminant death but I've gotten used to it in Don't Starve because sometimes you get even better world spawns and finds then you did on your previous run. Also the lore now is a little bit outdate as the lore in Don't Starve Together is the canon lore, and you can't dress up with skins in the base game. Some monsters are really hard to fight, so if you look to actually move up from fighting spiders and beefalo, you will find a challange in fighting them, that's really the only time the game gets hard other then that it's pretty relaxing.The small downsides apart, the game is great and worth your time to play. Great time killer. Also mods can make your life easier if you do struggle with the harder monsters like I do. (who thought hounds were a good idea?)			"

												This is one of those game i looked at and said bleh who would want to play this... Well with the beauty of steam sales  myself and this game met and we decided to crawl into a dark corner with each other and play...So why would i recommend this game? First of all it's pretty smooth i mean yeah it's a 2d game in a 3d environment but hell it runs nicely. The game gets challenging to survive and the world is random. The magic of Steam Workshop makes this game replayable.For this game, and the steam sale for $3 it's amazing. Would i recommend it for $15? I wouldn't, but yes i do see this game to gave lots of replayability to it.			"

												The title says it all. Don't Starve is one of those addictive survival games, delivering you with the idea that your character(s) lives are at stake. Alike many other survival games it aims to make the idea of food a priority, and the rest will seamlessly fall into place. However Don't Starve wouldn't be complete without its amazing mod support, in which you can build new stuctures or delve into new stories. The options are endless! Some of the mods can't support some of the options in the vanilla game, causes crashes and save wiping issues. Faced with alot of hideous monsters and natural dangers, Don't Starve is one of the best survival games on the market!Pros: Fun survival, great mod support.       Cons: Mods can cause crashes, would love to see it multiplayer~8.5/10~			"

												A great survival game with many hours sunk into it.  I'm not too fond of the giants DLC however -- while it adds many nice new features, I find it makes the game much too heavy on it's 'perma death' genre.  Chances are, you will lose your sanity and die before you're able to explore many parts of the game.I recommend starting by customizing your map settings...disabling the giants and perhaps even lowering the rate at which your sanity lowers.  Unless ofcourse, you're the gamer who enjoys dying over and over again...then the default settings should be ideal for you.I still enjoy this game and find myself comming back...there's also a decent mod community in steam's workshop.

												Don't Starve is an indie game about...not starving. Or getting killed by spiders. Or werepigs. Or stupid, randomly spawning dogs...or, well, there's a lot of ways to die in this game besides just starving, and I'll leave it at that. Overall, it's a rewarding, if not incredibly challenging, experience.Usually, indie games are highlighted by either their story, design or gameplay, which may prove significantly more innovative or intriguing than your average AAA game. That's why we buy them. Don't Starve is...a little bit different, to say the least, in that it's not all that inspiring in terms of story or gameplay. Here's the story: you don't want to starve, and also there's this dapper looking gentleman who appears to be channeling the ghost of a douchy harmonium. In terms of gameplay, point-and-click or use WASD to move around and interact with your environment, etc, etc. It's nothing that special.BUT! The design and presentation of the game make up for this apparent lack and reveal that the game itself is not nearly as lacking as it may seem to the wandering eyes of you potential buyers. In terms of design, its quirky, dark, funny and heavily Tim Burton-ized. The art style is simple enough that it doesn't overstep the abilities of its indie designers but still appears fresh, pretty and new, and each character you unlock through surviving longer and longer is unique, with his or her own set of perks and weaknesses that can be amusing, annoying or just plain scary. There's a girl who's dead twin literally follows her around, or a lumberjack with a possessed axe and a dark, beaver-based secret. Personally, I hope for more characters to be added to the vanilla game or perhaps as DLC because the current roster gets unlocked pretty quickly on an good three or four runs through the game. Still, these characters are more interesting than what you'll pick up from most games at this price.And when you do delve deep into this game after many, many, many trial runs, you'll discover that there's actually a lot of lore and story to this world. This mostly begins after entering Adventure Mode (and if you die in this mode, it doesn't affect your progress in the sandbox world), which can be done by opening a door randomly generated in any of your played worlds. You progress through five unique and challenging worlds, and along the way, you get a chance to see some of this lore and will probably hunger for more. Don't Starve leaves a lot more questions unanswered than I would like, but it's all to the cruelly addicting benefit of the game itself.Finally, I should address the difficulty of this game. You probably won't make it past the first five or so days on your first try without customizing the world. It's not an easy game, lacks any form of tutorial at all and all enemies, from bosses to weak spiders, can be found in the overworld on Day 1. Yes, there are one-time respawn points if you find them, but if you die, then it's over. Sometimes those respawn points don't even spawn. Your forty days of surviving through the turmoil of winter? Screw it! Never happened! And that does kind of suck, but it all adds to the tension and atmosphere of the game itself. You don't get a tutorial in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ woods! No one saves you when you decide to attack a herd of water buffalo with a stick of meat! And that mushroom over there? What does it do? Oh wait, it drains all of your sanity and makes shadow creatures in your head eat off your face. That'll learn ya.So yes, Don't Starve is difficult, especially during the winter months. But this is a survival game about surviving in a magical survival forest full of pop culture references and musical instruments. It's not supposed to be easy. And I'll tell you, there's nothing more rewarding than making it past your longest survival time. And if it's too hard, then you can tweak the spawning in a customized world so that only friendly bunnies and happy flowers populate your world. And occasionally, Satanic trees possessed with the vengeance of a thousand sundered splinters will pop up and absolutely wreck everything you hold dear and precious, as was intended by the Founding Fathers.

												Wandered far from my house on the second day of winter, my thermal rock gave out, I lost half my health, but made a fire to hunker to. Got cocky and tried to get back to my home, and then froze to death. All for some gold.Pros: Replayability: This game almost makes you want to hit retry, and if you find yourself bored, download some mods. DLC: Reign of giants is a DLC that changes how you play your game, adding 2 seasons, and a handful of new mobs to farm, kill, or be killed by.Roguelike: This makes the game exciting, if you were to respawn constantly It would detract from the difficulty of the game(IMO)Cons:Minor bugs that screw with my control settingsOverall I give this game no rating because ratings suck. Buy the game if you like roguelike games. Please don't get it if you have the intentions to play something similar to minecraft.Webber is the best...			"

Don't Starve is a survival/resource management sandbox game, and whether or not you enjoy it will depend largely upon how much fun you can have in said sandbox. The game is largely undirected; you're literally dropped in a field and told, fittingly, not to starve to death. After that you gather resources, craft items, and try to find a way out of the strange world you inhabit.There's a lot of game to explore. Each successive world is randomly generated and all are thus challenging in different ways. Nothing is ever explained; you learn by doing and exploring. Sadly, the various characters you unlock change things minorly at best, and the core gameplay never really changes: collect things, craft things, try not to die or go insane (and, with the new expansion, try not to freeze or overheat).Don't Starve good game, but not one I liked. I found the resource management tedious, and although the exploration and investigative elements were compelling, the constant ticking clock of starvation and insanity and freezing and overheating was too oppressive for me to enjoy myself.

												At first when I saw this game I never thought much about it. Until one of my friends modded it a few months ago. Now at that time I had no clue on how to mod videogames, and was too lazy to do so. Until a couple of months ago I had tons of free time, and decided to give modding a try. After yet another friend brought this game I was reminded of this game. So since I've been modding 3D games such as Left4Dead2, I decided what the heck, I'll buy this game and give the modding at try.After playing a none-custom game, I died the first day from not getting up a fire up in time. This made me want to try again, this time I survivaled 3 days, dying by going insane from not knowing how to keep sane. But with each new game I learned how things worked and what creatures are friendly and need to be avioded. After playing it a few hours I have found that this game is INCREDIBLY addicting.The world randomly generates so every play through is a new experience, keeping each game feeling fresh. You never know when you'll spawn in the middle of nowhere, in a rich in resources pig village, or right next to a spider nest or pack of blood thirsty hounds. Not only that, since I do own Reign of Giants dlc you must watch out for the seasons, if you customize your world settings to be more advanced you may be a unlucky person to spawn in summer or winter, where you can easily overheat or freeze to death. The game is unforgiving, it tries it's hardest to kill you but with each gameplay you learn to survive longer.The game has a very unique-looking style. It reminds me a little of a Tim Buton-like style, and it's very nice to look at. The creatures are creative too, along with each character you can unlock with their different abilities. I then tried my hand at modding the game and found that it is VERY easy to mod. Now I do have more experience modding harder games so those without modding experience might take a little longer to learn than someone will some experience, but since the games community and the games staff is generous and very willing to help you with modding it. You'll defiantly get the hang of it eventually. There are also plenty of videos to help you out with it.I defiantly reccommend buying this game, it is worth every penny. With multiplayer coming out soon you'll be able to enjoy the game with your friends.			"

												Tim Burton meets Gathering / Crafting adventure game goodness.This game captures my imagination like very few others. What it lacks in immersion it makes up for in truckloads of creativity and art originality.Some of the mechanics feel a little ""left by the wayside"" such as combat, which to me has always seemed to work a little haphazzardly. But the exploration and curiosity factor are so over the top its very easy to forget such things might get in your way.The music and sound fit perfectly with the art style in a melancholy yet purposeful romp through a dark and twisted wonderland of putrid or warped settings.I've had a blast playing Don't Starve, on and off Steam. Don't let my Steam playtime fool you, I'm a long standing supporter of Don't Starve and highly recommend it to anyone with a penchant for slightly warped or morbid yet humorous adventures.			"

												For what I played in the demo only, I could say it is totally my type of game of survival and environemental survival so far.  I hate not having had enough time with it...  :)  But I guess it was the whole deal with a full week-end (if ever I would had stayed home longer ;) ).Usually I flee demon related games within the exception of Diablo.  But this one so far in my full hour deserved all the attention I could put in it.  No tutorial but all too intuitive you end-up well immersed too.EDIT 24th May 2015I finally have the game and found the portal to stage 2 a couples of time.  No matter how long my game last (Normally now between 15 to 27 days in-game), I still marvel at discovering new things and tricks and I don't want to apply yet mods to fully discover this world and new strategies and how to pass winter.  I don't think I can ever being bored with it.  Just having some things more urgent to do IRL than quench my need to survival or quench my need to prove my ingenuity.  But yet I never yet seen the like!  It is fun, yet intuitive and just enough realism to see all seasons for a crafty enough player.  ;)			"

												This game's nice. Full of bloody surprises and you will be dying, again and again, then you finally learn how to play, set up a camp, harvest vegetables and create yourself a fluffly warm hat made of bunnies. You will mind your own business and avoid all the evil monsters. Maybe even invent stuff with your newly built science machine. SO HAPPY! Then a group of pinguins appears and you out of all the happiness can't resist to pet them. They instantly kill you in return. I didn't even visit places like worm holes and caves, the world is just too cruel. It's fun, just a little disappointing when you loose all your efford so easily. I like that you can modify the world to decrease the amount of evil in it and increase the number of carrots, before you start the game. Still, this one's a nerve kicker, I give it 7/10 "

												Review written after purchasing the DLCAbout the Basic Game:Alright lets get it straight and simple: the basic game is an extremly hard, easily modable and overall fun survival game. Interesting mechanics, good combat mechanics, and in general no items are completly useless. Even if you allow your food to rot because you do not have a fridge yet to slow spoilage down it will still have a use as fertilizer. Every damn item has a use in this game and that happens not that often. No item is outperformed by another one. Each of them have flaws. Even ""inferior"" stone/flint which break more easily have a nice advantage over gold tools: They are alot cheaper to craft. Though the concept of gold tools is kinda stereotypic because gold is a really soft material... oh well. Oh and btw, you dont want to be in the darkness without a light.Creative and unique enemies with relativly decent movement patterns which will hit hard if you do not respect them as a propper enemy (though the regular spiders are a bit weak), fairly expensiv but powerfull ranged weapons, a good, well balanced armor system and very lovely characters to play with. You can even play as the main antagonist ""Maxwell"" if you finish the game. Each character has its own unique abilities giving him perks to support his survival in some way and having disadvantages making certain things harder. For instance Wilson: That character is unlocked from the beginning. He has very well balanced stats and as a special perk he grows a beard. Doesnt sound that special right? But the beard can be shaved and used as an effigy of himself in order to give him another try in case he dies. And extra lifes are EXTREMLY HARD to obtain in the game. Other characters like Woodie, a canadian lumberjack, has a fear of birds and therefor looses sanity near them, but brings his own unbreakable axe, a HUGE advantage over other characters. Also he is ""cursed"" which affects him at certain days (not spoiling too much).So after hinting on sanitiy theres also a very inspiring sanity/insanity system. Surviving in a lone, strange world with different laws of physics can be harsh. Where everything you encounter might kill you you might turn insane. Well thats the case in the game: You slowly loose your sanity if certain events are happening. For instance if you are in the dusk, exposed to certain terrifying hostiles or if you are close to some ""evil flowers"" which are poisoning the air arround them letting you go insane slowly. As sanity drops the character begins to hear weird noises, voices and starts hallucinating draining his sanity further. Once he is over a certain threshhold those ""hallucinations"" manifest and you have to fight extremly powerfull, otherworldly monsters who could have come from Lovecraft himself. Those ""shadows"" are able to teleport and as already said hard to kill. You have to gain sanity by doing ""sane"" things, like picking a few dozens of flowers, then throwing them away (well however that should keep you sane), wearing civilized clothes or killing said shadows. You need to be insane once in a while in order to survive alot better because said shadows drop a very usefull material. Lastly I like to point out the weather/season system: In the standard game without the DLC there are 2 seasons: Summer and Winter. Summer is relativly easy, you basicly setup your camp, gain materials, fight monsters, survive. Winter turns the game alot harder. You will start freezing without a fire or propper clothing, have trouble finding food (good luck farming in winter) and a giant mob called deerclops will spawn at some point who has to be killed in order to protect your camp and your hard work. Winter plays completly different then the regular seasons.And theres alot more content to explore then those highlights I listed up + the community really produces high quality mods for the game.So now to the DLC:I hate DLCs... usually. But if its that well done and for a price of 4.99$ then I can just say ""Go ahead buy it now"". It adds the remaining 2 seasons and turns summer into a drought. In spring you have to fight with dampness of your character because of frequent rain. Summer is a drought which means plants will wither and dont yield food, heat will affect you badly similar to winters cold, trees, plants, mobs, items on the ground, you etc will combust once in a while if its burnable and faster food spoilage will occur. Autumn is by far the most peacefull season... untill you encounter the Giant in autumn which is extremly hard to fight. He is basicly a far stronger version then winters deerclops and has a ""beserk attack"" where he (or it) will rush towards you destroying any contraptions you build and derooting trees. He will eat any food he can find if left alone and only turns hostile if you hinder him from eating. Thats just 1 giant. There is 1 giant for each season now, and the deerclops for winter got rebalanced and got a powerfull ""icicle erruption"" as a stomp attack causing icy spears to appear infront of him out of the ground. With all the new seasons, new giants/bosses and new survival mechanics... basicly all the content comes a heck of more items. Again all of them have uses and none of them are completly useless. And all of them are very balanced. Overall a very good ""DLC"" which I would rather call an addon because of the sheer mass of content it dumps on you. Oh and you get to play 2 new unique, high quality, characters with unique abilities. No reskins or anything like the stuff you get from bigger ""AAA"" companies. This DLC worths the money and is a great addition to the main game. I highly recomment getting both, Main game and DLC, its an awesome, joyfull yet extremly hard game. If you fail and die you lost everything if you dont have any kinds of resurrection methods. Its the thrill of loosing anything which makes the game really fun. And there are alot of mods out there, some just adding new items, some which add completly new ""levels"" to play as. Or just unique characters like a Weavile, The red Soldier (Jane Doe) from TF2, The Heavy from TF2, several LoL Champions or completly original characters with unique abilities (William J. Dannigar (hopefully I wrote that name right)). So go get the game if you want a challenge. Its fun and really enjoyable.-Sigma.			"

												A very great game. Has a bit of a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes a pretty fun game. The crafting system is very good; along with the mechanics. The art style and music is unique and really adds to the game.9/10 would definitely recommend picking it up.			"

												The game is indeed a great survival adventure and I don't regret wanting it and then buying it at all, but I also can't deny that I'm pretty disappointed in developer's choice of not supporting ""Steam achievements"". I like tracking my progress and my dedication for a game through those achievements, and displaying those was often the only way of showing off. I don't mind the perma-death and the frustration that comes with it, it's a survival game after all. It reminds me quite a lot of those WC3 survival maps, which is a good thing cause those were really fun, but also of Faster Than Light because of the frustration and perma-death parts.Anyway, the game is awesome, artsy without getting fancy, complex without getting complicated, and incredibly addictive. I can hardly wait the arrival of the multiplayer mode too.			"

												For what I played in the demo only, I could say it is totally my type of game of survival and environemental survival so far.  I hate not having had enough time with it...  :)  But I guess it was the whole deal with a full week-end (if ever I would had stayed home longer ;) ).Usually I flee demon related games within the exception of Diablo.  But this one so far in my full hour deserved all the attention I could put in it.  No tutorial but all too intuitive you end-up well immersed too.EDIT 24th May 2015I finally have the game and found the portal to stage 2 a couples of time.  No matter how long my game last (Normally now between 15 to 27 days in-game), I still marvel at discovering new things and tricks and I don't want to apply yet mods to fully discover this world and new strategies and how to pass winter.  I don't think I can ever being bored with it.  Just having some things more urgent to do IRL than quench my need to survival or quench my need to prove my ingenuity.  But yet I never yet seen the like!  It is fun, yet intuitive and just enough realism to see all seasons for a crafty enough player.  ;)			"

												Many survival games are a play it and you're done experience of the been there, done that quality. Not this one. Literally every playthrough is a new experience. Randomized land and creature spawn means one play may be much easier or much harder than the next, depending on what you get. Will you have enough lumber? Will there be enough prey? Too many spiders? Will you camp and be attacked by hounds your first night? Will you even find enough stuff to make a fire your second night?! And of course, if you're having too much trouble with something, you can customize the world and turn that creature off for a playthrough, OR you can up the chances of encounter to test your skills if it's getting boring. This combined with the colorful character options (every one has a personality that determines what they think of everything, and some are downright hillarious), means this game neve rgets dull or tiresome. I always find my way back to try my hand at lasting a bit longer. So far I'm up to 9 nights. My hint? Never camp near a pig village. No matter how tempting. Full moons just -suck-, The mods available through the community are amazing as well and I very much recomend a look through of those also!			"

												At first when I saw this game I never thought much about it. Until one of my friends modded it a few months ago. Now at that time I had no clue on how to mod videogames, and was too lazy to do so. Until a couple of months ago I had tons of free time, and decided to give modding a try. After yet another friend brought this game I was reminded of this game. So since I've been modding 3D games such as Left4Dead2, I decided what the heck, I'll buy this game and give the modding at try.After playing a none-custom game, I died the first day from not getting up a fire up in time. This made me want to try again, this time I survivaled 3 days, dying by going insane from not knowing how to keep sane. But with each new game I learned how things worked and what creatures are friendly and need to be avioded. After playing it a few hours I have found that this game is INCREDIBLY addicting.The world randomly generates so every play through is a new experience, keeping each game feeling fresh. You never know when you'll spawn in the middle of nowhere, in a rich in resources pig village, or right next to a spider nest or pack of blood thirsty hounds. Not only that, since I do own Reign of Giants dlc you must watch out for the seasons, if you customize your world settings to be more advanced you may be a unlucky person to spawn in summer or winter, where you can easily overheat or freeze to death. The game is unforgiving, it tries it's hardest to kill you but with each gameplay you learn to survive longer.The game has a very unique-looking style. It reminds me a little of a Tim Buton-like style, and it's very nice to look at. The creatures are creative too, along with each character you can unlock with their different abilities. I then tried my hand at modding the game and found that it is VERY easy to mod. Now I do have more experience modding harder games so those without modding experience might take a little longer to learn than someone will some experience, but since the games community and the games staff is generous and very willing to help you with modding it. You'll defiantly get the hang of it eventually. There are also plenty of videos to help you out with it.I defiantly reccommend buying this game, it is worth every penny. With multiplayer coming out soon you'll be able to enjoy the game with your friends.			"

Don't Starve is a survival/resource management sandbox game, and whether or not you enjoy it will depend largely upon how much fun you can have in said sandbox. The game is largely undirected; you're literally dropped in a field and told, fittingly, not to starve to death. After that you gather resources, craft items, and try to find a way out of the strange world you inhabit.There's a lot of game to explore. Each successive world is randomly generated and all are thus challenging in different ways. Nothing is ever explained; you learn by doing and exploring. Sadly, the various characters you unlock change things minorly at best, and the core gameplay never really changes: collect things, craft things, try not to die or go insane (and, with the new expansion, try not to freeze or overheat).Don't Starve good game, but not one I liked. I found the resource management tedious, and although the exploration and investigative elements were compelling, the constant ticking clock of starvation and insanity and freezing and overheating was too oppressive for me to enjoy myself.

												Alot of people say this is if Tim Burton invented minecraft, but I compare it to terria the more I play it. It's a top-down survival with a sense of despair. I love the simplicity of the art direction it's dark but charming.It's got nice mod support, but I'm gonna say 2/3rd of the workshop is just totally OP OCs or furry charaters with such little changes that It's basically Wilson( stock charater, he's not a bad option, he grows a beard that helps him with the cold and it can be shaven to make an item that could save your life) but without the beard.It doesn't have multiplayer which some people have a major proplrem with, but I sorta like it because I don't have the patience to keep my friends on par with what I do and it allows your friends to learn the game, which makes a dark and scary world not as scary.Definetly recommend it, but it can be annoying having to go through the begging of the game and get your base camp set up. Don't (starve) be overwhelmed by the cast of charaters, you die enough get to give them all a chance.			"

												If anything there is to say about Don't Starve is that it's probably the best survival game out there at this moment. Besides having a very interesting art style and a great sense of humor, there is a large amount of things to craft and the resource gathering sates the kleptomaniac in me. All those grass and twigs you spent the past 30 min picking up? Yea you're going to need them. Unlike games such as Fallout where you can kind of just pick up things you want and avoid small drops, you're going to want to get everything you can. Nothing you find in the game is worthless, every drop and resource has a purpose which is a nice touch. There is an extensive wiki on this game, so if you need to know the use of a certain item or a crock pot recipe it's all available to you. I have to say a few things. One is that if you're dumb like me and didn't know that charcoal is burnt wood, let that be an indication of how to get it (Crock Pot is one of the most important items to survive well past winter). Two is that you might want to get the mod that shows your status (in numerical value) and shows the value for food. It may make the game less frustrating while not taking away from it. Third is that this is a game with perma-death (although there are multiple ways to revive yourself) and dying is the only way to earn experience to unlock most of the characters. Either way as you can tell I've sunk a large chunk of my time into this game and I highly recommend it.			"

												First time playing, makes it to day 22 and is doing quite nicely. Already activated a touchstone and I have a camp set up for the night. Lets get some spare wood. Gets the wood and hears thundering footprints as a giant pine ent (level 3 treeguard) walks into the campfire light. O.o wtf is that. Dies. Respawns at the touchstone only to get killed by a herd of mating beefalo. Takes a moment to soak in that I just got 4 levels in 1 go. Starts a new round with Wolfgang.No lie, this game is beautiful.			"

												Dear people of steam.This is by far my favorite survival game I allways keep on coming back for more I mean I am doing a youtube series on this game now. through out the entire game you always survive there is never a point where your not thinking about getting food or fighting the next attack of hounds. I would recomend this to whoever likes survival games it is in my opinion the best there is.			"

												It's very fun to play, its like a adventure game mixed with a survival game, all the mob's are very interesting but one thing thats very tedious is the fact that the Mobs do so much damage with just one blow and the fact that your health regenerates so slowly. But all in all its a enjoyable game, and i would recommend this game.			"

												If you are a fan of sims,like survival games,have a love for Tim Burton styled graphics,great humor, and detailed game play mechanics then look no further. This game has a lot going for it .Game comes with adventure mode and sandbox mode.In adventure mode you go from world to world surviving til you find all the pieces of a item that takes you to the next world.The game has a ending in adventure mode so its worth doing if you wish to see it.There are different characters in the game you can play as each with their own plays style.Some characters can only be unlocked in adventure mode but with the power of mods you can unlock all of those characters if you wish.Speaking of mods,the game is quite mod friendly and has many mods on the steam workshop for your pleasure.You need to know how to do slight lua scripting if you want to do some beefy mods,but tweaking value sets of items in the game is easy to learn.You hunt,set traps,gather resources(pick things,chop down trees,etc),grow crops,fight mobs,lead pigs,herd beefalo(a sort of bison),make camps,dry meats,fish,craft items,etc in the game.The game has 4 main status types you need to worry about; Hunger,Sanity,Freezing, and Soggy.To take care of hunger you eat.Sanity is a interesting status because when you start to go insane you being to face new challenges that can end up killing you.The world itself starts to look different and does more than just look different. There are various ways you can treat your sanity as there are ways that can make you go insance.Freezing, occurs but only during the fall - winter season and can kill you if you do not keep yourself warm.Soggy is a condition that affects food and fire, you do not want soggy food trust me..There is far more to this game than even I explained in this lengthy review.Still not convinced? Watch some lets plays on youtube or just have blind faith in my opinion :PP.S. Don't Starve together incorportes many of the vanilla content for co-op but incorporates things not found in the vanilla game and even its DLC expansion Reign of Giants.As of this review Don't Starve Together (a standalone co-op sandbox) is in beta status.

												Frustrating, and yet a great game to play! You got 1 life, and thats it! Don't starve is a very fitting name for this game, hunger will be one of your greatest opponents, but sanity comes in great as a second! At night, when the creepy monsters come.. When you're nearly dying of hungry and slowly start to go insane. That is when things start to get creepy! Where did that music come from!? Stay off my campfire! Oh no, My torch just ran out.....The art is simple but appealing, reminds me of Tim Burton a bit. The characters speak an amusing jibberish, and all of them have great up- and downsides depending on your playstyle.This game may cause some rage-quits, but it is very rewarding to stay alive! .. My Rage quit: . After i set my own farm on fire by accident with a very nervous Willow (character, who loves fire a tad too much) my hp started to drop because i was starving without my crops. A few minutes later 3 hounds came and ate me. Damnit! Mother of all ragequits.. And yet i started to play again within a day. It's just so appealing. The Reign of Giants DLC is fun, but not my cup-o-tea. I prefer the normal version. But it is fun to mix and match up at times, i would still recommend atleast trying it.			"

												Personal Rating: 9/10Yeah, that's how good it is. When it comes to gaming I hate most games, I didn't like Saints Row 4, Payday 2, Call of Duty and I'm sorry to say that I didn't like Dota 2 all that much, just haven't had the time to sit down and play that game.But, on with the review at hand. Don't Starve. I got this game for £4.07 which is an absolute BARGAIN in my opinion. This game is truly amazing and it's in my top 15 games of all time.Playing this game made me realise a few things. Firstly, this game is beautiful. I can't find anything wrong with this game. The art style, beautiful, the music, fantastic, the characters, extraordinarily made, designed and animated.This isn't a review, this is a praise report, I love this game as I'm a HUGE fan of survival games and I put my hands down when I say this is the BEST SURVIVAL GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED.

												can't say much about this game.. I only spend 11 hours and it's should be considered  as quick playing :)this game is really something. I like all Klei games (i have one less favorite though, it was mark of the ninja.. i' m bad at 2D stealth) and I watched their videos on youtube. This game is about survival of the fittest, it's you and harsh environtment. once you died, you died forever and have to repeat again from the beginning (unless you use mod that allow load on last save)I really like the capability of modding the game! I have to be honest, I still can't survive more than 20 days in-game so I use the mod I mentioned before to make the game ""easy"" as I want to see the ""feature"" and memorize them before playing ""harsh"" modepro:- great sound effects!- good graphics- great gameplay.. you should play without guide.. don't use them :)- it's updated! and together dlc will be free after early access- and it's discounted now (it's winter/holiday sale when I write this)- community mod supportcon:- nothingI rarely write nothing in con. this game is really great and you should buy it :)9/10!

YouTube™ Video: Steam Review E31 Don't Starve and Don't Starve Together 

			Views: 177		

			Don’t Starve & Don’t Starve Together: Don’t Starve & its multiplayer component, Don’t Starve Together, is an indie sandbox survival game of the weird & mysterious variety.		

Don’t Starve & Don’t Starve Together: Don’t Starve & its multiplayer component, Don’t Starve Together, is an indie sandbox survival game of the weird & mysterious variety. Developed & published by Klei Entertainment. The gameplay is simple which is pretty common for Klei, the controls are nothing special which isn’t bad, the gameplay itself is mostly fun although I have some personal gripes with combat.But, first, let’s talk about the graphics, the game is an isometric 2.5D game, with this really intriguing dark pencil drawn art style, the fact that the world of Don’t Starve itself is this mysterious & weird world also lends itself to this type of art style. The music also reminds me of this sort of twisted carnival feel, with lots of weird strings & brass instruments used to set the tone, characters also speak with mashed up music tones from different instruments, sounding mostly unpleasant.So as it’s about survival, you’ll brave all the elements of the seasons, the ever present drain on your sanity & your belly grumbling. Don’t Starve also features plenty of dangerous creatures as well as some neutral ones ranging from the Pigmen to the aggressive fish like Merms & of course with the Reign of Giants DLC, Giant boss monsters like the Deerclops. It’s a pretty challenging game, don’t expect to survive very long with your first forays into Don’t Starve, you’ll die plenty of times but, never unfairly so, as you learn the game you will become a better survivor & the game rewards you for how long you survive by unlock more characters to play with a total of eleven to choose from all with their own strengths & weaknesses. The story of Don’t Starve is only accessible through the sandbox mode which you start in, if you wish to know how to get there, you’ll have to experiment to find out.My only real gripe is with the games ‘combat’, you interact with the world mainly with the mouse, you can hold the spacebar to pick up nearby objects which is really handy, you can use the mouse or keyboard to move around, but, when in combat, I only ever was able to use the mouse, this is a problem, since the world is flat it is very easy & common for things to get in the way. This is only exasperated when things are hectic, it’s very annoying when there is multiple enemies. There are several ways to avoid combat, but, when you must it’s a pain dealing with multiple enemies at once. Other than that gripe the game is just pure fun, the multiplayer part was so simple to setup I can’t find anything to complain about, it’s the whole single player game with friends up to six & it’s easy to use plus you get two copies for the one price so it’s pretty cheap. I personally love Don’t Starve, it was a bit to get into at first, mostly because I was failing a lot at the beginning, but, once I gave it a serious shot I began to get better & better & could survive a very long time before dying, if you like survival type games in general definitely check this out, if you don’t like a challenge, or don’t like indies (for some reason) or just don’t like things that aren’t 3D ultra-graphics & “realistic” then steer clear of the quirky world of Don’t Starve, for the rest, we’ll be trying to survive despite the odds. Its $14.99 USD which is a pretty good deal, I’d recommend getting the bundle with the Reign of Giants for $18.99 USD which will give you a ton of stuff, or get the bundle that comes with a copy of Don’t Starve Together which includes the Reign of Giants DLC & bring a friend along for the ride! Thank you Klei Entertainment for awesome deals on awesome games!TL/DR; Don’t Starve is a wonderful survival game that doesn’t take itself too seriously but does offer a serious challenge for new comers. It’s got a very unique art style. The game is simple to play & simple to run with the sandbox goal of ‘survive’, it holds no hands & still expects you to succeed, it’s a fun game, & its multiplayer component Don’t Starve Together makes the experience even better with the ability to bring friends along for the suffering. I highly recommend check out both titles, they offer good deals for the single & multiplayer experience, unless you can’t stand the look of the game, or need that “realistic” approach to survival then check out Don’t Starve & Don’t Starve Together! -Double Thumbs Up from Royial			"

												Growing up under illegal sovjiet rule I know this theme very well and found myself very much at comfort with the gameplay and, esspecially now that we are victims of the EU and have a plague of Arabs, Polish and Turks in our land too. It is a very realistic game right down to the accurate simulated model of sanity and the effects that you may have when running from a lot of angry foreign creatures who live only to kill you. For some this game is only a game but, for me it is a tool to test my survival skills in varying scenarios that may be fall me or, any other person on the street here.			"

Don't starve brings a lot of genres/games together. It's quite tough being able to survive and stepping up to the next levels. Actually that's what makes this game so interesting, the challenge.You can have 5, 10,200 games in Don't Starve but they will always result in a different outcome.			"

												This is a wilderness survival sandbox featuring lovecraftian horrors pig men jackalopes and other strange things. You start in a sandbox mode shanghied by the mysterious maxwell and can work through an adventure mode within the sandbox.You have 3 stat bars health hunger and sanity controling these stats is the key to surviving as long as possible. You build prototypes of new equipment and structures to advance in the game and increase your probability of long term survival. This is not another minecraft clone and is an awsome game despite lack of multiplayer. Hunting gathering trapping beekeeping crafting fishing herding, all possibilities in this immersive game. Overall definatley worth the price if you like sandbox games and survivalism in general intruiges you, give this game a try.			"

												Bought it on sale. Not my type of game however the artwork and the price convinced me to give it try.  I liked it very much, was surprised to see myself enjoying this type. I love the dark and random comment by the characters as my favorite is ""I cut it down in prime time of his life"" after harvesting grass.  Quite simple, just dont starve.			"

												Even after 10 hours of gameplay, I can say for sure that Don't Starve is a very good game, this game includes a Steam Workshop where you can download mods from other players, and with the release of Don't Starve Togheter (Currently in Early Access, it's gonna be free to all the owners of the game when it's finished, more informations here: http://dontstarvetogether.com/) You can even play online/with friends.

												This is a great game, I've suggested it multiple times to anyone watching my twitch channel while playing it. It's got an amazing Tim Burton-eque art style with plenty of survival aspects. The world is randomly generated so you'll not get the same map multiple times unless you wish to (there's an option to retry if you die on current map).Many people ask, ""How do you get further than 10 - 20 days""? Practice, play the game, it's a survival game. Explore, craft stuff and mainly look at your surroundings for what's most helpful (beefao).Overall I'd recommend this game to anyone who loves Survival games, give it a try and if you get stuck there's an always growing wiki page for the game. You're going to die, it's a feature.			"

												Highly addictive game. 9/10.A lot of great character/game mods.One things that annoys me though is spider,frogs, and the furry creature with an eye ( not sure what it is though ) , they attack you even though you don't bother 'em.Also one thing that i think would be great for this is achievements. Like i think it'd be great if there was 'cause some of us players would want to have 'em.Edit - shipwreck early access review- This dlc is just amazing and it just makes the game 50% more fun and better than it already is.Jellyfishes, crabs and coconut coming from a palm tree, I mean what can we possible not like?

												Don't Starve is one of those games where the only word that justifies it's quality and content is ""perfection"". It is such a complete experience, it has everything you would want in a survival game, and the level of content is monumentous. The one thing that really makes this game a treasure is the simplicity. What? You might ask. I will try to explain:The UI/ menus are perfectly uncomplex. They are neat, responsive and incredibly easy to navigate as everything is very well organized.The inventory spaces are placed neatly at the bottom of the screen and are always available to you. you have the option of organizing your materials into a few groups with slight spaces between lots of inventory slots. The clicking + dragging mechanism makes this process so much easier. I often organize all my edibles into one group, main building materials into another and tools/ armours/ weapons into another. The crafting system is also very easy to grasp. You can click whatever it is you want to build in the menu to the left and see what kind of resources you need to craft that item, with pictures of the actual items which makes the whole identifying process a breeze. The map is excellent. You can see (as far as you have travelled) key locations such as berry bushes, forests, different biomes e.t.c... You can also see where you've built stuff, if you have. This is very important if you don't want to get lost!The actual physical game map that you travel on is amazing. Resources are easy to find, click and collect. Your main tools (hatchet, pick-axe and shovel) require the most basic resources so you will easily be able to replace them without much hassle. This is also probably the only game where people won't question your pathological excitement over poop.Trust me, you will have so much fun just collecting hordes of resources and then putting them to use and generally just trying to survive another day. The game does get difficult, especially if you have the expansion enabled, which offers a whole new and exciting experience, but even if you fail, you'll want to immediately start again and perhaps learn from your previous mistakes and do things differently. I simply cannot find one negative aspect in this game, it is, as I said before, perfection. "

												I highly recommend this game. It runs very smoothly and quite fast. Dont Starve can be very dark and funny in its own ways.It took me some time to fully understand what I needed to do exactly, but once you start playing frequently, you should understand it. I also love all of the workshop items that can be put into the game, many characters, and stuff to help you along in your survival. This game is perfect for me.			"

												This game is amazing. The style is incredibly cool, the music is great, and the gameplay even better. I cannot find the words to accurately summarise the level of awesome Don't Starve is, it's just absolutely brilliant, in so many ways. As you get no tutorial, no hints (apart from the obvious - don't starve!), it is a game of figuring stuff out at first, and there are so many things to expore, find, and craft! Seeing as you can customise just about everything in your world before you start a game, there are endless possibilities when it comes to difficulty, and not to mention, the dreaded Adventure mode which will make you want to gouge your eyes out with a rusty spoon and throw them at the treeguards while you scream with the fury of a thousand suns. If you like survival, base building, hillarious puns, exploring, crafting, and not having a game tell you exactly what to do at all times - Don't Starve is for you. 10/10 in my book!...Apart from the treeguards. F*** you, treeguards.			"

												You will die a lot, you will learn from your mistakes then die again, you will make your own world easier but you will die again and then repeat till u get gud. It's like Dark Souls but in 2d sorta. Also best feeling is to find an Eyebone you will understand when you find it and how he makes things just easier.Some basic things i wanna say what it hasGame lets you customize your own worldLets you mod the gameBuying DLC also gives you more mod support.Gain experience to level up and unlock special characters in game.Collect cards on steam.Ain't much to say i suggest to watch some videos before buying it to see if it fits your needs.This one is singleplayer version of the game don't mistake it from Don't Starve Together.I gotta say in this game experience really matters if you play it for the first time. LVL 1 is  basically your first time you have no idea what to do just collect stuff as you level up you automatically will understand how the game works and you will progress with game experience. Thats how i started.Game can be really random sometimes you never know what you gonna encounter, it could lead to your death or it might help you stay alive a bit longer. I highly doubt it.Well thats what i have to say not much coming in my head as usual. See other people reviews they make more sense.			"

												Love this; survival in a very real sense - word to the wise, YOU WILL DIE. Don't let it put you off, it's part of the learning process. You should find the game far more entertaining if you don't resort to the wiki for everything and just try to see how you can do each time. Several characters to unlock with very different strengths and weaknesses (and in some cases very unusual abilities)Randomly generated worlds each time means you have to scout fast and set up shop somewhere with plenty of local resources, you can starve, you can freeze to death, you can poison yourself, you can get attacked by angry wildlife, you can burn to death, get trampled, or eaten.

Though, one thing that would make this game so much better would be adding multiplayer. Those of you who play and enjoy this game, just imagine playing with a friend or two, it would be great! Also, please make a way to create your own characters in a simple way, such as a ""Character Creation"" option, where you can draw a character in each frame, change their sound to one of the character sounds, and choose their heath, sanity, hunger and other stats.

												You're dropped into a world with no tutorial, no narration, no guidebook.  Simply click on things, find out what they do, combine them with other things, and LEARN.  This game is brilliant in its simplicity and depth.  With each death, you learn a little bit more about how to survive for longer.  My only complaint is that once you figure out how to survive, the game can stagnate and become rather dull.  Sure, you can make up your own endgame goals, but I wish there was better endgame content.			"

												Don't starve's game mechanics are pretty simple, but the amount of craftable items and mobs make it a very challenging and enjoyable game. Getting through the adventure mode is very difficult and requires making good strategic decisions all the way through. One stupid mistake and everything you struggled to create is gone. HARDCORE.The ""Reign of Giants"" DLC adds to the difficulty of the game thanks to a lot of new elements, one of the most significant being the introduction of two new seasons.I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenging/original gaming experience.

Simple but vast.Game's perma-death is much of a challenge rather than a difficulty, which makes the players learn from what to do in every game until they can survive for long.The worlds are big and full of many things to discover.Mobs have different varieties and difficulties which makes the game more thrilling.Graphics are well-designed. Even though it is in 2D art, the artists didn't fail to keep the ""spooky"" feel in the game.Sounds are nicely played, although the crafting sound is a little bit deafening.Background music suits the seasons and the mood of the game well.~~There's just a lot to explore in this game!

												At first I had thought Don't Starve would be easy, but I soon found out I was way wrong when a tree suddenly turned into a giant monster and murdered me on Day 17. I honestly was not expecting that. That bad experience was not in vain, though. Now I know in my future lives not to chop trees at dawn (seriously, don't). This is a good example of how you must learn from your experiences in order to do well in this game. The only way to succeed is by trial and error, and although it can be extremely frustrating when you lose everything, that is kind of what makes the game fun; knowing such a fate is possible puts you on edge. Also, the mod support is amazing. Getting new mods is literally 3 clicks away, and you can then easily enable/disable them from a convenient menu at the main screen. This is truely a great survival game so buy it if you're in to that kind of stuff, and good luck.			"

A tutorial is honeslty not needed though. You can quickly learn the basics through trial and error, exploring new combinations of actions. The ui layout is simple, you have various characters to choose from and even a short minimod available if you choose, which is awesome even for how short it is. I originally saw this on a game stream a friend was watching and had to play it. I am not sure if this still works, but I was able to take my game key and register it within a chrome app so I can even play quick games in my chrome browser at no extra cost. Amazing replay value.

												This is basically the premier ""survival game"", and barring a few classic roguelikes it is also the premier randomly generated game. It owes these high honors to its extremely long development and constant updates, bugfoxes, and balance patches. It's important for a randomly generated game to have a significant amount of content in order to keep replays fresh and exciting; I'm sure it was for this reason that the developers did not stop when the game was merely ""adequate"". My only complaint is the occasionally inaccurate diablo-style controls that occasionally force the player to learn some strange workarounds.

												Don't Starve harnesses all of the successful elements of other sandbox survival games and tweeks them to create an atmosphere that is unsettling, urgent, and charming all at the same time. Overall, the game is very well executed. The world the game is set in is at first very brutal, very unforgiving, and there is little-to-none tutorialization. When you eventually start to gain a foothold, the experience can be extremely rewarding. Character perk sets and the ability to customize the world generation and cycles add lots of replay value.

												I have a very soft spot for this type of games. You start in the wilderness, destitute and alone. You gather, you hunt, you hoard, you craft, you create, you survive. You build an entire civilisation on your own, and what was once an unknown and terrifying place becomes your home, your conquered land, where you have become the apex predator.			"

												Don't Starve is easily one of the best indie games available on Steam.In a nutshell, Don't Starve is a rogue-like survival game aimed specifically to punch you in your nuts so it can give you a taste of permadeath. It's main pros are:- A library of characters to choose, from Wilson, a intrepid scientist who can grow a beard, to Woodie, a Canadian lumberjack who has a terrible curse. - A immersive world full of things ready to be discovered, and possibly ready to wreck you up while it's at it.- A vast army of creatures that can possibly either help you or hinder your chances of survival.- Unforgiving deaths. You ♥♥♥♥ up, you die and restart. All of these combined make for a great game and it's easily reccomendable. Not to mention that Klei Entertainment, the company behind it all is fair and produces high quality products and they're trustable as a team.Oh yeah, I almost forgot.

												""AH ♥♥♥♥ HOUNDS!"" i yelled, running through the woods in my attempts to escape the beasts. nearly bled out from making mysterious 2 legged pig men angry. What did i do to deserve this harsh world? Everything is fubat. Tree monsters hide in the forrests, spiders all over the place, insanity growing, hunger rising. Now this. Will this finally be my un-doing? To loose all i have gained onlt to start a life anew in the constantly hostile world. Only comparable to that of a schtizophranic mind. Beasts roam wild and all is dangerous. So few are the safeties of the fire in winter, and so rare is the safety of defences at night. Scavenging was hard enough to survive for the first few weeks. Now im going to die bie these blood thristy hounds of hell, or wherever such beasts were created. WAIT! a hole in the ground! I must get to it in order to survive. I jump down, only into darkness. Insanity is building, i see things in this dark tunnel. What awaits on the otherside? When i awaken my eyes, i am in a land i have yet not seen. My pursuers may not have easily given up, so i must run. Run fast, run far; only that i could if my stomach wasnt so empty, aarg i must have something to eat. Thankfully theres some bushes, but is that....a spiders nest? with little strength left, and a spear in hand, I make the short path to the dangerous bushes. To so i dont allow my self...to dont starve.9/10 for immersion: Very dangerous gameplay, you must be quick to think, or die from the elements of this vast and wierd place. I must say even being experienced in survival games, the night times in here are terrifying and detrimental to your health if you are un prepared to venture fourth in such time.10/10 for creativity: Very different sense of survivalism, if you like turkeys to be hulking 2 legged beasts, and any sort of socialness to be between a living pot following you, and pigmen. This is definitely for you.8/10 mechanics: Simple to use, as simple as click to move, use, everything else you need to know. Though i had alot of problems with picking up items behind other items. Which quickly became a nuissance.			"

												Don't Starve is a really simple and easy to learn survival game which I have really been enjoying. You can alter the difficulty yourself through options such as making the days longer (as it is easier to be attacked at night) and preventing the change of seasons (as your character may be effected, such as by freezing in winter), which can allow you to quickly learn the games mechanics to progress to an increased difficulty.The aim is to simply retrieve resources and craft items to aid you in surviving in the wild as long as possible, but as the world changes with each new game you allways face the challenge of exploring the new land and, if you're struggeling or need tips, the community is full of guides and advice for new players to help you survive longer.Although I have'nt played too long yet, I've still been enjoying it loads and would definately recommend this game to anyone and everyone!

												This game is plenty of fun delivered in a highly stylised fashion. There's more depth than you first expect; the game can be somewhat difficult and unforgiving at times, but it's always enjoyable.The only thing I'd recommend is to take it slow; don't rush in expecting to kill everything in sight and survive simply by stabbing and punching stuff. You need to build yourself up first before you can take on the big game.On top of that, the game has a good modding community; everything from new items, to tweaks to game mechanics to make things far easier or much harder, new fan-made characters and even total conversions (the base game comes with an official surivival horror themed TC).Overall, Don't Starve is well worth the money.

												My review is based on all expansions, not really vanilla. I was attracted to this game due to its art style and cute little Chester. Little did I know this artsy survival game had more to offer than most survival games I've played. Unless you have ROG you're missing out on a lot of content. Don't Starve is far from forgiving, at times you might feel the developers had an evil laugh when coming up with ways to kill us helpless survivors. Don't Starve ROG feels like vanilla to me now, playing Don't Starve itself is not enough to give the game its justice, in my opinion. Don't Starve has a lot of depth, if you're more than just a casual there are so many different things to do on this game besides survive year one. (If you can make it past summer) I do wish, however, Klei put more effort into end game (other than caves OFC) I also feel SW is lacking as an expansion but all in all the price for this game in general feels awfully low for something so wonderful, I would've paid a lot more. If you don't like surviving on your own make sure you give DST a try, the community is great, I prefer Don't Starve over Don't Starve Together but that's just my cup of tea. PS, too the noobs, if you're sceptic due to one death causing your world to be erased, there are items you can craft or things you can find in order to have several lives, not only that, but also mods. The mod community for this game is HUGE, if you ever find yourself bored or feel like you need the game to be a little easier, you could try using mods. Some mods completely change Don't Starve, some make the game easier by adding items and characters, or tweaking things, other mods make the game harder. Don't Starve is a great game and the developers are fantastic and helpful.			"

												'Don't Starve' is a fun wilderness survival sandbox full of science and scary dark arts of magic. This eerily stylish hand drawn game can be easily be modded through Steam Workshop. With the options of modding, this game can be even more challenging or can played very casual and also includes 'The Screecher'  a total-conversion horror story mod made officially by Klei Entertainment. (gameplay similar to Slender)couple downsides to this game are: First time noob gameplay can be difficult because of no ingame beginning tutorial or inventory items (unless modded)Gamesaves permanently delete itself when played character dies (unless modded not to).This is a kind of game you can enjoy replaying multiple times with the many playable characters and adjustable settings on its already random map generation. I definitely recommend this to anyone who's into survival/sandbox world games.			"

												This is a constantly challenging game where you pit your OCD against avoiding complacency. In order to survive you must prioritize your tasks and continuously adapt.

												Absolutely amazing game, that will have you coming back for more every time you die! At first I bought it just because I enjoyed the art style during a steam sale, had no real expectations of how the game play would turn out. In short, its one of the best survival games I have ever played. Always something to do, something to improve, an adventure to go on, MORE FOOD TO GATHER, and before you know it its day 200! And to top it off, now you can struggle to survive with friends in Dont Starve Together! One day I will fully explore a cave!			"

												I don't know of too many survival games that are more rewarding than Don't Starve. You are given the tools to scavenge and hunt and naturally discover new crafting options. You're encouraged to fail if only to establish the bounds of your abilities in this game. Several hours sunk into the game both on here and PS4 version.			"

												For such a simple objective--not starving (or dying by creature, cold, heat, darkness, or other means)--this game is extremely rich and complex.  It has two modes; a sandbox survival mode in which your goal is simply to explore and become self-sustaining, and an adventure mode in which your goal is to overcome harsh environments to complete a machine to move to the next world.  You can play either in the spirit of discovering how to construct, create, and build everything yourself or consult and external reference for help, but either way, you'll be presented with a challenge that will keep you occupied and wanting to go a little further for weeks.  I highly recommend it!			"

												With a title like ""Don't Starve"", you'd think you'd only have to worry about finding food. And you would be sorely mistaken. The maps are randomly generated, so what was a problem for you last time you played might not be such an issue for you now. That said, the things that came easy last time may not be so simple this time. For example, I frequently found myself running out of food on my first few attempts, while things like developing new technology came easy. However later on food was a bit easier to find, but I had trouble finding the stone and gold needed to unlock new recipes. THEN once I'd finally found a balance, I made the foolhearty mistake of taking too long to light another torch at night. This game is extremely difficult and while normally a frustrating mechanic such as having to start over everytime you die would put me off, I found myself going, ""Well, that sucked. But I wonder what's in store for me next time?"" If you're like me and love a good adventure, even if it tests your patience a bit, check this title out. You won't be disappointed.			"

												Don't Starve is a really simple and easy to learn survival game which I have really been enjoying. You can alter the difficulty yourself through options such as making the days longer (as it is easier to be attacked at night) and preventing the change of seasons (as your character may be effected, such as by freezing in winter), which can allow you to quickly learn the games mechanics to progress to an increased difficulty.The aim is to simply retrieve resources and craft items to aid you in surviving in the wild as long as possible, but as the world changes with each new game you allways face the challenge of exploring the new land and, if you're struggeling or need tips, the community is full of guides and advice for new players to help you survive longer.Although I have'nt played too long yet, I've still been enjoying it loads and would definately recommend this game to anyone and everyone!

												I strongly recommend this game.  Reminds me of Minecraft's first few minutes/hours where you're scraping to stay alive, but this is harder, and more rewarding, minus the building for the most part.  The art style is great, very atmospheric and fun to watch.  Though no in-game instruction is given, the difficulty of picking up on how things work isn't bad, after a couple deaths, you'll know how to progress through the first few days.  That's my one gripe, dying starts you over, with no save game, it automatically deletes it for you.  This lends urgency to your quest to survive, which I like, but the first 3 days or so take half an hour, and there's not much variation in during that time, so it starts to feel a little repetitive.  But after that, there's tons of cool stuff, so it's a minor annoyance.  Also, to be fair, I wouldn't have to play those first three days so many times if I'd just follow the direction, ""Don't Starve""			"

												This game is plenty of fun delivered in a highly stylised fashion. There's more depth than you first expect; the game can be somewhat difficult and unforgiving at times, but it's always enjoyable.The only thing I'd recommend is to take it slow; don't rush in expecting to kill everything in sight and survive simply by stabbing and punching stuff. You need to build yourself up first before you can take on the big game.On top of that, the game has a good modding community; everything from new items, to tweaks to game mechanics to make things far easier or much harder, new fan-made characters and even total conversions (the base game comes with an official surivival horror themed TC).Overall, Don't Starve is well worth the money.

I am not the type of gamer who wants to sit through an introduction on how the game is played, or the 20 minutes of intro scenes. This game takes all of that away and leaves you will really unique game play where you have to constantly keep up with your hunger, sanity, and health.

												My review is based on all expansions, not really vanilla. I was attracted to this game due to its art style and cute little Chester. Little did I know this artsy survival game had more to offer than most survival games I've played. Unless you have ROG you're missing out on a lot of content. Don't Starve is far from forgiving, at times you might feel the developers had an evil laugh when coming up with ways to kill us helpless survivors. Don't Starve ROG feels like vanilla to me now, playing Don't Starve itself is not enough to give the game its justice, in my opinion. Don't Starve has a lot of depth, if you're more than just a casual there are so many different things to do on this game besides survive year one. (If you can make it past summer) I do wish, however, Klei put more effort into end game (other than caves OFC) I also feel SW is lacking as an expansion but all in all the price for this game in general feels awfully low for something so wonderful, I would've paid a lot more. If you don't like surviving on your own make sure you give DST a try, the community is great, I prefer Don't Starve over Don't Starve Together but that's just my cup of tea. PS, too the noobs, if you're sceptic due to one death causing your world to be erased, there are items you can craft or things you can find in order to have several lives, not only that, but also mods. The mod community for this game is HUGE, if you ever find yourself bored or feel like you need the game to be a little easier, you could try using mods. Some mods completely change Don't Starve, some make the game easier by adding items and characters, or tweaking things, other mods make the game harder. Don't Starve is a great game and the developers are fantastic and helpful.			"

												To all those who say there is no story, you obviously have not played enough. Inside the game there is an ""adventure mode"" which is basically story mode(and very challenging).Crafting is a primary part of the game. It starts very simply — you'll pick up items in the landscape to construct simple tools, necessary to break down more raw materials. The system expands all the way from grass and twigs up to scientific machinery, complex farms and magical devices. The tech tree has enormous depth and room for experimentation, all dependent on your priorities.I recommended this game to anyone who wants to have great time for a couple of hours.			"

												Awesome game, favourite survival game of all time. It is so great cause you have such a big choice of what to do. If u wanna survive on only meat go for it, on only carrots and so on. When dawn comes it's time to step away from the fire and head out on adventure. It is great that there are diffrent characters, and that they all are diffrent. The style and art of the game is really cool it makes the game dark and a bit spooky. Sometimes you can get a really annoyed with this game, especially when a pack of hound comes or when you die, but there is something that always keeps dragging you back. I would recomend this game to most people but you have to put in some time to the game to learn to survive in this world. It is also a great game to play while whatcing a movie. And remember to eat anything you can find so you Don't Starve.			"

												IT'S NOT MINECRAFTThe name of the game is really deceiving as starving is one of many ways to die in this game. I'd like to point out here I was expecting something like old Horde game - you stay in a camp, build your defences during the day, defend at night and reap your rewards.It was not the case as instead the developers gave me a game about survival and exploration. I have to say that second ""X"" part is really crucial for the game, as in early stages you will starve or freak out if you don't collect a lot of food, branches, some little stones that help you start a campfire. This game makes you watch out not only for your hit points but hunger level and serenity as well. Strange things happen if you become insane.Gameplay also brings you back to point'n'click adventure games where you had to find out what can be combined with what. Here it's similiar, it's trial and error with a bit of punishment, but keep in mind: this game is not an extreme hardcore self-destructive masterpiece. The learning curve isn't any steep. It's just a pleasure.As the days go by you learn new things, which gives you a lot of satisfaction. Surviving more and more days also gives you that feeling of progress, because there are new characters to unlock (with different abilities and stats).The downside to this game is that it's kinda cryptic at times and thanks to random generators you can either be in a very good starting position or a very bad one, but usually it doesn't go as far as spawning you next to a lvl 9001 mob which one-hits you.I can recommend this game. I'm not exactly a fan of survive, craft and explore games, but it still gave me some nice memories and I will certainly play it again.			"

												I really like the game. It's easy to just start playing, you can use the mouse for everything (particularly crucial for me with repetitive strain injury so I can't do much typing). If you dip into it without preparation (reading forums and the wiki) it's pretty brutal. Permanent death, and frequent! But that just makes it very addictive. I've survived 130 days and can keep my character fed but I'm still being killed by the later hound attacks. There's so much in the game. I like the insanely demanding resource-management against the clock aspect of it. I'm constantly planning and refining new strategies and trying to be more efficient. Inventory-management with so many resources and relatively little space (15 slots main inventory soon fills up. Even with a backpack and Chester I'm still running out of room for everything) is a constant pressure. There's always a hundred different ways to go with each problem. For example, with hound attacks, I've tried toughing it out in melee (works if not too many hounds), hiding under the berry bush hat and hoping the hounds get distracted and killed, and running like a mad thing, hoping they start attacking other monsters on the way. Those are just the most obvious strategies. I could use darts against them (hopefully not taking too much damage if I take some hounds down at range) or build tooth traps with the hounds' teeth they keep dropping when killed, or find a way to get my character resurrected when the hounds kill me (there are at least three ways to resurrect I can think of offhand). And the monsters and their interactions can be so amusing. When I find a beefalo herd, I sometimes take time off from the relentless grind of survival just to watch the baby beefalo playing or sleeping. It still cracks me up.			"

												This game for me was a huge surprise , first impressions was like Tim Burton made this game. The environment is so cartoonist and dark, very nice. Well like the game name says, 'Don't Starve', this is our main goal, survive, make our own corn field, survive the winter - Winter Is Coming - and fight against some animals. Days will pass on DS, and are only 3 things that can kill you, hungry monsters or if you get bored. And why i say this? Well, like in any survival game you need to survive, but you need to build things and some times take a long time, and you may have luck or not to find those material fast. After some in-game days, you can specialize your crafting in one way or another, but the first real-time hour will always be kind of similar. Which means it’s not fun any more after a point, and you’ll start to really dread the endgame, for the wrong reasons.Another inconvenient could be the world generation, you can get a nice world like a few meters away from you, you find a boomerang and some provisions or you have generated a bad world and you won't find anythng good.This game also lacks on some details like not having a mini map on Hud and others things, but don't worry to much because there are mods that you can add to the game to make it perfect. Now the biggest things the game should have, Multiplayer! This has been asked so many times and the answer is always no, but i kind understand it because is a survival, and you should survive alone. I'm pretty happy with this game and although i don't have many hours i expect to play more on future, also huge amen to Klei Entertainment for making such awesome game! ~ 8/10			"

												The Base Game of Don't Starve, has a lot of things to do, and many items to obtain and craft as you progress through the survival mode. It also has a story based mode, which guides you through some of the toughest worlds, to unlock 2 of the characters you cannot unlock by dying. It's art style matches the many situations you'll be in and the sounds are crisp. I reccomend this game to anyone who wants a game that builds difficulty and maintains it. You'll be lucky to survive a week on your first attempt.			"

												Don't Starve is easily one of the best indie games available on Steam.In a nutshell, Don't Starve is a rogue-like survival game aimed specifically to punch you in your nuts so it can give you a taste of permadeath. It's main pros are:- A library of characters to choose, from Wilson, a intrepid scientist who can grow a beard, to Woodie, a Canadian lumberjack who has a terrible curse. - A immersive world full of things ready to be discovered, and possibly ready to wreck you up while it's at it.- A vast army of creatures that can possibly either help you or hinder your chances of survival.- Unforgiving deaths. You ♥♥♥♥ up, you die and restart. All of these combined make for a great game and it's easily reccomendable. Not to mention that Klei Entertainment, the company behind it all is fair and produces high quality products and they're trustable as a team.Oh yeah, I almost forgot. Hounds are little annoying ♥♥♥♥♥ that will be happy to ruin your day.			"

												Review of Don't Starve : Survival games are somewhat my thing, even though i am not good at them, i manage and enjoy playing them!Most survival games are repetitive, like the same world/maps...etc, But not Don't Starve, it is a pandora's box, each gameplay is not the same!The survival in this game is based off 3 thingI) Hunger : it is obvious that a survival game without a hunger meter is no survival game, in this game, there are two ways to get food :1\Hunting2\ planting II) Health : every game has this so there's really no point in explaining!III) Sanity : This is what made the game challenging, you have to keep yourself sane, that is by many ways, but the only one i've discovered is gathering flowers!So let's recap the whole thing : + Single player ( there's a multiplayer version too will be free when you get the game at this time )+ Workshop ( mods )+ Art Style (so you do not have to worry about needing a killing machine PC to play this game)+ Actual working DLC ( Adds a few monters and stuff, so it's worth it to improve the gameplay, but i strongly suggest you get the DLC when you get truly bored from the game )+ Replayable ( since each gameplay is not the same )+ Not a slight bug in sight= Fair XP system+ Many vanilla Characters that differ in skills!So that's a 9/10 i suggest you get it!

Each day that passes you scurry off trying to gather as many things as possible and hope that your base is in a safe enough spot. The achievements and points system is easy enough to gain and progress fast. As you explore this vast land you'll encounter creatures, friendly beasts, mysterious entities and the weird, wonderful and scary abilities of Mother Nature and the human body.I'm only on day 13 but I've already built walls, floors, a fire and tools for building and crafting.

What do when you aree starting up the game you think to your self ok this is how im going to survive and then you see OH ♥♥♥♥ I CANT FIND THIS 1 THING THAT I NEED TO F'ING SURVIVE or ""WOW I finally did it I made the dream base!"" then you get attacked my a pack od wild dogs and then your dead. then you come up with another Half ♥♥♥ thought and say ok i'm doing that for now on and then you do it then you get killed by a living tree (tree Guard). So then you make another bullet proof plan then you do it (or don't because OH ♥♥♥♥ I CANT FIND THAT 1 MATERAIL) then you die by THE ♥♥♥♥ING DARK I MEAN LIKE WTF. *sigh* you do it again not die by the dark then die of huger or hupletherma or by ANOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING TREE or by a 1 eyed bird because you grabed its egg. oh and when you die you gain Xp and if you get you will unlock a charecter and that charecter my be a bit better or a bit worse then the other.They are also adding multiplayer to this game which can be good or bad on they make it. I leave you with this this game is a ♥♥♥♥♥ and it will contune being a ♥♥♥♥♥ untell you make the pefefect idea on how to survive (oh and there is mods that suck ♥♥♥♥ must of the time unless they have 4 to 5 stars.)

												I wasn't too sure about this game when I first saw it.  Then I saw the pocket edition for my phone and decided that I would give it a try.   It took all of 5 minutes for me to realize that I HAD to have this on my PC.  I bought the bundle of the original game,  Reign of Giants, and Shipwrecked. I cannot put this game away.   I think it's totally possible that this game got its title not because of the starvation that can happen in the game but the starvation that can happen to you in the real world when you start playing this game!  I love the exploration that this game puts you through.   I have resisted the urge to watch videos or get tips online because the ""not knowing what's going to happen next"" aspect really adds to the experience.   Please do yourself a favor and buy this game.   It's well worth the price for the intense HOURS of fun,  stress, frustration, and obsession that you will experience while playing.			"

												I really like the game. It's easy to just start playing, you can use the mouse for everything (particularly crucial for me with repetitive strain injury so I can't do much typing). If you dip into it without preparation (reading forums and the wiki) it's pretty brutal. Permanent death, and frequent! But that just makes it very addictive. I've survived 130 days and can keep my character fed but I'm still being killed by the later hound attacks. There's so much in the game. I like the insanely demanding resource-management against the clock aspect of it. I'm constantly planning and refining new strategies and trying to be more efficient. Inventory-management with so many resources and relatively little space (15 slots main inventory soon fills up. Even with a backpack and Chester I'm still running out of room for everything) is a constant pressure. There's always a hundred different ways to go with each problem. For example, with hound attacks, I've tried toughing it out in melee (works if not too many hounds), hiding under the berry bush hat and hoping the hounds get distracted and killed, and running like a mad thing, hoping they start attacking other monsters on the way. Those are just the most obvious strategies. I could use darts against them (hopefully not taking too much damage if I take some hounds down at range) or build tooth traps with the hounds' teeth they keep dropping when killed, or find a way to get my character resurrected when the hounds kill me (there are at least three ways to resurrect I can think of offhand). And the monsters and their interactions can be so amusing. When I find a beefalo herd, I sometimes take time off from the relentless grind of survival just to watch the baby beefalo playing or sleeping. It still cracks me up.			"

												I went into this game thinking it would be something like Minecraft or Terraria.Boy, was I wrong.A survival/crafting game that mixes together crafting, survival, and psychological horror (in a sense), this game was a refreshing change of pace from the world of ""straight-forward sandboxes.""  The world is alive with all sorts of flora and fauna to gather and hunt, but not all of it will just accept their fate of becoming your next meal.Will you be able to survive the purgatorial landscape as you struggle to live on through the night?  Or will you succumb to the horrors of the night that will turn the hunter into the hunted?Overall, I give this game 5 live-saving fires out of 5			"

												I love this game so much already that I decided to play it for about six hours and then drop by just to leave a good review. This game is like a twisted combination of a survival and adventure game, yet every time you play it you get a completely different experience that is definitely worth your time. There are so many different things going on in this game that it's a bit overwhelming at first, but there is a bit of a learning curve and it all gets easier after the first hour or two of gameplay. If you are at all hesitant about purchasing this game, do yourself a favor and buy it now.			"

												This game is truly amazing.I found this game and bought it back in may, and I do not regret it. I've had many fun and exciting moments when playing, and in the beginning, as a noob, it's even more fun and at the same time 'scary' to explore the world and all the interesting stuff that happens (?!).The point is to not Starve (obviously) on an island where an evil man called Maxwell puts you. The island is full of things that want to kill you, as well as resources, food and so on. Time counts in days, thus, you can see how long you've survived and try to beat your records. There's no achievements or such. Just follow the one and only rule, ""Don't Starve"", and you'll loose many hours in this amazingly, fantastic game. "

												Review of Don't Starve : Survival games are somewhat my thing, even though i am not good at them, i manage and enjoy playing them!Most survival games are repetitive, like the same world/maps...etc, But not Don't Starve, it is a pandora's box, each gameplay is not the same!The survival in this game is based off 3 thingI) Hunger : it is obvious that a survival game without a hunger meter is no survival game, in this game, there are two ways to get food :1\Hunting2\ planting II) Health : every game has this so there's really no point in explaining!III) Sanity : This is what made the game challenging, you have to keep yourself sane, that is by many ways, but the only one i've discovered is gathering flowers!So let's recap the whole thing : + Single player ( there's a multiplayer version too will be free when you get the game at this time )+ Workshop ( mods )+ Art Style (so you do not have to worry about needing a killing machine PC to play this game)+ Actual working DLC ( Adds a few monters and stuff, so it's worth it to improve the gameplay, but i strongly suggest you get the DLC when you get truly bored from the game )+ Replayable ( since each gameplay is not the same )+ Not a slight bug in sight= Fair XP system+ Many vanilla Characters that differ in skills!So that's a 9/10 i suggest you get it!

												At first I had thought Don't Starve would be easy, but I soon found out I was way wrong when a tree suddenly turned into a giant monster and murdered me on Day 17. I honestly was not expecting that. That bad experience was not in vain, though. Now I know in my future lives not to chop trees at dawn (seriously, don't). This is a good example of how you must learn from your experiences in order to do well in this game. The only way to succeed is by trial and error, and although it can be extremely frustrating when you lose everything, that is kind of what makes the game fun; knowing such a fate is possible puts you on edge. Also, the mod support is amazing. Getting new mods is literally 3 clicks away, and you can then easily enable/disable them from a convenient menu at the main screen. This is truely a great survival game so buy it if you're in to that kind of stuff, and good luck.			"

												I absolutely love this game. You get thrown into the world with absolutely no real tutorials, just the challenge to try to not starve to death, or die from insanity. A tutorial is honeslty not needed though. You can quickly learn the basics through trial and error, exploring new combinations of actions. The ui layout is simple, you have various characters to choose from and even a short minimod available if you choose, which is awesome even for how short it is. I originally saw this on a game stream a friend was watching and had to play it. I am not sure if this still works, but I was able to take my game key and register it within a chrome app so I can even play quick games in my chrome browser at no extra cost. Amazing replay value.

												This is basically the premier ""survival game"", and barring a few classic roguelikes it is also the premier randomly generated game. It owes these high honors to its extremely long development and constant updates, bugfoxes, and balance patches. It's important for a randomly generated game to have a significant amount of content in order to keep replays fresh and exciting; I'm sure it was for this reason that the developers did not stop when the game was merely ""adequate"". My only complaint is the occasionally inaccurate diablo-style controls that occasionally force the player to learn some strange workarounds. In conclusion if you're not Not Starving yet why aren't you Not Starving?			"

												Don't Starve is a wonderful survival and exploration game for the ones who crave adventure. Durring the day, You are free to do what you wish. At nightfall, Stepping into the pitch black of the night will get you killed. Make a campfire, or be adventerous and explore with torches and a miner hat!

Simple but vast.Game's perma-death is much of a challenge rather than a difficulty, which makes the players learn from what to do in every game until they can survive for long.The worlds are big and full of many things to discover.Mobs have different varieties and difficulties which makes the game more thrilling.Graphics are well-designed. Even though it is in 2D art, the artists didn't fail to keep the ""spooky"" feel in the game.Sounds are nicely played, although the crafting sound is a little bit deafening.Background music suits the seasons and the mood of the game well.~~There's just a lot to explore in this game!

It is gameplay wise, it may seem like other ""survival"" games out there, but this one is really different. On the first look, you may think ""Oh damm.. it is a Minecraft copy"", but that opinion is far from truth. On conceptual layer they are both simillar to each other, but on the gameplay leyer they are completely different. They got completely different priorities expected from a player.My Walkthrough Guide:

												I've always liked survival games. They are rare, very rare to come upon on. The game is sort of like other survival games like Minecraft. However, people can't make copies of it like they can with Minecraft. Don't Starve is good in it's own little way. I reccomend this game to anyone who likes exploration, hand drawn graphics, or mysterious you-never-know-whats-gonna-happen games. The game is challenging and fun. It has way more variety than Minecraft when it comes to animals. I'm not saying that Minecraft is bad, but Don't Starve is a bit better than how it appears. You would know if you played the game.

												(Experience: unlocked 7 out of 9 characters)(Time spent: 22 hours at the moment)(Bought price: Gift from friend)Don't Starve - and its DLC Reign of Giants - is a spectacular survival game that definitely nails the 'see-how-long-you-can-survive' aspect. The amount of craftable stuff keeps every run fresh and fun. This includes: weapons and armour to fend off monsters, firepit and crock pot to cook your meals, science machine and lightning rod to extend your survivability, and so much more!This is a game that tests how well you budget your time, Each day consists of a day and night cycle. By day, you can harvest food and materials but by the time night comes around you'll find yourself having to cook enough food to feed your stomache. And, if you manage to survive your first day, you get to repeat the whole process all over again, and thus, it tests how long you can live as long as you Don't Starve.Bottomline: This is a game that you should ABSOLUTELY try out, if just to see why it is so popular among many fans.

												Combining the aspects of survival, adventure and sandbox into one game full of mystery and wonder makes this well worth playing. Since every world you play in is completely randomised, the adventure never stops as you explore, fight and survive as you delve deeper to find every little thing to do and uncover. So, if anyone out there is up for a good challenge, then Don't Starve is the one for you. Plus, with the Reign Of Giants DLC coming out soon, you can be sure to be surprised and running for your life as you discover what this game has in store for you...			"

												I am out of words to describe how amazing this game is. The depth in gameplay will keep you entertained for a very long time. If you think you know everything, something else happens and once again may decide your fate. At the beginning it all looks easy, manageable, etc... but you really have to prepare for everything and beyond to make it through. Don't write it off as childs play by the cute graphics. This game is serious. Highly recommend.			"

												(Experience: unlocked 7 out of 9 characters)(Time spent: 22 hours at the moment)(Bought price: Gift from friend)Don't Starve - and its DLC Reign of Giants - is a spectacular survival game that definitely nails the 'see-how-long-you-can-survive' aspect. The amount of craftable stuff keeps every run fresh and fun. This includes: weapons and armour to fend off monsters, firepit and crock pot to cook your meals, science machine and lightning rod to extend your survivability, and so much more!This is a game that tests how well you budget your time, Each day consists of a day and night cycle. By day, you can harvest food and materials but by the time night comes around you'll find yourself having to cook enough food to feed your stomache. And, if you manage to survive your first day, you get to repeat the whole process all over again, and thus, it tests how long you can live as long as you Don't Starve.Bottomline: This is a game that you should ABSOLUTELY try out, if just to see why it is so popular among many fans.

												I wasn't sure if I'd like this game or not initially but I was always interested in it. Now I want to kick myself for not picking it up earlier.  Its a pretty tough game to navigate the first few times, and I'm still trying to survive winter but I get a little closer every time.  I appreciate the fact that once you die the world is gone, but it does discourage me to not play for a day or two afterwords. Once I start it back up though I'm hooked right back in.Its funny how often things can go completely wrong in this game (I'll just attack that beefalo annnnnnd I'm dead) but adapting to bad situations and managing to survive despite the odds against you is really satisfying.  It almost reminds me of the first time I played Minecrraft survival, except much harder, and also much more rewarding.  This game is good at creating memorable moments and it makes exploring really fun.  Just buy it already.			"

Simple but vast.Game's perma-death is much of a challenge rather than a difficulty, which makes the players learn from what to do in every game until they can survive for long.The worlds are big and full of many things to discover.Mobs have different varieties and difficulties which makes the game more thrilling.Graphics are well-designed. Even though it is in 2D art, the artists didn't fail to keep the ""spooky"" feel in the game.Sounds are nicely played, although the crafting sound is a little bit deafening.Background music suits the seasons and the mood of the game well.~~There's just a lot to explore in this game! Can't wait for more updates! :)			"

												At first I had thought Don't Starve would be easy, but I soon found out I was way wrong when a tree suddenly turned into a giant monster and murdered me on Day 17. I honestly was not expecting that. That bad experience was not in vain, though. Now I know in my future lives not to chop trees at dawn (seriously, don't). This is a good example of how you must learn from your experiences in order to do well in this game. The only way to succeed is by trial and error, and although it can be extremely frustrating when you lose everything, that is kind of what makes the game fun; knowing such a fate is possible puts you on edge. Also, the mod support is amazing. Getting new mods is literally 3 clicks away, and you can then easily enable/disable them from a convenient menu at the main screen. This is truely a great survival game so buy it if you're in to that kind of stuff, and good luck.			"

												I absolutely love this game. You get thrown into the world with absolutely no real tutorials, just the challenge to try to not starve to death, or die from insanity. A tutorial is honeslty not needed though. You can quickly learn the basics through trial and error, exploring new combinations of actions. The ui layout is simple, you have various characters to choose from and even a short minimod available if you choose, which is awesome even for how short it is. I originally saw this on a game stream a friend was watching and had to play it. I am not sure if this still works, but I was able to take my game key and register it within a chrome app so I can even play quick games in my chrome browser at no extra cost. Amazing replay value.

												Don't Starve is a wonderful survival and exploration game for the ones who crave adventure. Durring the day, You are free to do what you wish. At nightfall, Stepping into the pitch black of the night will get you killed. Make a campfire, or be adventerous and explore with torches and a miner hat! Beware however, death in this game isnt just a simple click to respawn. Death means you must start all over again, in a new world.Oh, and a word of advice: Dont play with fire.			"

												This is basically the premier ""survival game"", and barring a few classic roguelikes it is also the premier randomly generated game. It owes these high honors to its extremely long development and constant updates, bugfoxes, and balance patches. It's important for a randomly generated game to have a significant amount of content in order to keep replays fresh and exciting; I'm sure it was for this reason that the developers did not stop when the game was merely ""adequate"". My only complaint is the occasionally inaccurate diablo-style controls that occasionally force the player to learn some strange workarounds. In conclusion if you're not Not Starving yet why aren't you Not Starving?			"

												This game is plenty of fun delivered in a highly stylised fashion. There's more depth than you first expect; the game can be somewhat difficult and unforgiving at times, but it's always enjoyable.The only thing I'd recommend is to take it slow; don't rush in expecting to kill everything in sight and survive simply by stabbing and punching stuff. You need to build yourself up first before you can take on the big game.On top of that, the game has a good modding community; everything from new items, to tweaks to game mechanics to make things far easier or much harder, new fan-made characters and even total conversions (the base game comes with an official surivival horror themed TC).Overall, Don't Starve is well worth the money.

												Totally got immersed with the world of Don't Starve the moment I started playing it.Survived for 36 days so far without dying and boy oh boy this game is so much fun and at the same time friggin hard. Went exploring around, met some penguins who tried murder me. Then came winter! Apparently, I build my base next to a walrus camp without knowing and that blob sent his dogs        and was blowing darts at me with 100% accuracy. Killed his dogs and chased him and it took forever to kill him since        he was running away.            Survived two more days after that then ffs a giant abominable cyclops with horns destroyed my base! My point is everything in this game hates you and tries to kill you (If you try to hurt or kill them) Either you get killed by living tree monsters, bees, warthog looking animals, penguins, spiders or you die if you starve. Oh and the Tim Burton visual style for this game suits it very well.Overall, 10/10 for this game and is a must have for those who like Survival games genres. "

												My review is based on all expansions, not really vanilla. I was attracted to this game due to its art style and cute little Chester. Little did I know this artsy survival game had more to offer than most survival games I've played. Unless you have ROG you're missing out on a lot of content. Don't Starve is far from forgiving, at times you might feel the developers had an evil laugh when coming up with ways to kill us helpless survivors. Don't Starve ROG feels like vanilla to me now, playing Don't Starve itself is not enough to give the game its justice, in my opinion. Don't Starve has a lot of depth, if you're more than just a casual there are so many different things to do on this game besides survive year one. (If you can make it past summer) I do wish, however, Klei put more effort into end game (other than caves OFC) I also feel SW is lacking as an expansion but all in all the price for this game in general feels awfully low for something so wonderful, I would've paid a lot more. If you don't like surviving on your own make sure you give DST a try, the community is great, I prefer Don't Starve over Don't Starve Together but that's just my cup of tea. PS, too the noobs, if you're sceptic due to one death causing your world to be erased, there are items you can craft or things you can find in order to have several lives, not only that, but also mods. The mod community for this game is HUGE, if you ever find yourself bored or feel like you need the game to be a little easier, you could try using mods. Some mods completely change Don't Starve, some make the game easier by adding items and characters, or tweaking things, other mods make the game harder. Don't Starve is a great game and the developers are fantastic and helpful.			"

												I strongly recommend this game.  Reminds me of Minecraft's first few minutes/hours where you're scraping to stay alive, but this is harder, and more rewarding, minus the building for the most part.  The art style is great, very atmospheric and fun to watch.  Though no in-game instruction is given, the difficulty of picking up on how things work isn't bad, after a couple deaths, you'll know how to progress through the first few days.  That's my one gripe, dying starts you over, with no save game, it automatically deletes it for you.  This lends urgency to your quest to survive, which I like, but the first 3 days or so take half an hour, and there's not much variation in during that time, so it starts to feel a little repetitive.  But after that, there's tons of cool stuff, so it's a minor annoyance.  Also, to be fair, I wouldn't have to play those first three days so many times if I'd just follow the direction, ""Don't Starve""			"

												The game starts out maddening but as you figure out exactly how to play and what strategy you're going to follow it becomes completely addictive. Love the graphics, the ambiance and how the game actually feels different when you change characters. It can be frustrating when you put so much time and effort in and then lose it all when you die, but I think that is what the game is about. It doesn't pull any punches and it is incredibly challenging. Makes it feel all the sweeter when you do make it further or learn a new trick that gets you a lot further.			"

												To start off, this game is widly addicting, if a bit frustrating at times. Fans of sandbox games would love this kind of game, with such a high scale of replayability. Trust me, with permadeath, you will be replaying this alot. Most of the game is infinite resource farming, after a while on a single world. With many characters to test, so many items to find, and so much to do, you will get lost while playing this game. If you like a challange, or ANY kind of sandbox/survival type game, Dont starve is worth the low price tag. 8/10.			"

												I strongly recommend this game.  Reminds me of Minecraft's first few minutes/hours where you're scraping to stay alive, but this is harder, and more rewarding, minus the building for the most part.  The art style is great, very atmospheric and fun to watch.  Though no in-game instruction is given, the difficulty of picking up on how things work isn't bad, after a couple deaths, you'll know how to progress through the first few days.  That's my one gripe, dying starts you over, with no save game, it automatically deletes it for you.  This lends urgency to your quest to survive, which I like, but the first 3 days or so take half an hour, and there's not much variation in during that time, so it starts to feel a little repetitive.  But after that, there's tons of cool stuff, so it's a minor annoyance.  Also, to be fair, I wouldn't have to play those first three days so many times if I'd just follow the direction, ""Don't Starve""			"

												Single handly one of the best games I have played in a long time. I love how you are thrown into the world and told nothing about how to get by. I am not the type of gamer who wants to sit through an introduction on how the game is played, or the 20 minutes of intro scenes. This game takes all of that away and leaves you will really unique game play where you have to constantly keep up with your hunger, sanity, and health. After playing for a few hours, I realize how much more to this game that there is. If you have $15 to spare on a game, this would be a good choice!			"

												The game starts out maddening but as you figure out exactly how to play and what strategy you're going to follow it becomes completely addictive. Love the graphics, the ambiance and how the game actually feels different when you change characters. It can be frustrating when you put so much time and effort in and then lose it all when you die, but I think that is what the game is about. It doesn't pull any punches and it is incredibly challenging. Makes it feel all the sweeter when you do make it further or learn a new trick that gets you a lot further.			"

I really like the crafting and gathering in this game the bunnies are cute and furry and the enimies are super scary... buuut this game can really make you rage.  Permadeath with make you punch something after losing your 6 hour + game to a stupid mistake.  I have lost a ton of characters to just forgetting about something like poison or not healing before a fight.  The game gets better with additional playthroughs and you will see very different worlds each time.  The game has changed a lot since launch and I think klie is making even more content.  I don't think I have ever seen a single player game with so many free content patches.			"

												Love this; survival in a very real sense - word to the wise, YOU WILL DIE. Don't let it put you off, it's part of the learning process. You should find the game far more entertaining if you don't resort to the wiki for everything and just try to see how you can do each time. Several characters to unlock with very different strengths and weaknesses (and in some cases very unusual abilities)Randomly generated worlds each time means you have to scout fast and set up shop somewhere with plenty of local resources, you can starve, you can freeze to death, you can poison yourself, you can get attacked by angry wildlife, you can burn to death, get trampled, or eaten. Enjoy :DHighly recommended!			"

												Nice little game.  If it was multiplayer, I would say go full price, but you should catch this when it is on sale.  It also includes a second game mode that is worth checking out that plays kind of like the ""Slenderman"" horror minigame.  It is challenging, at least in the beginning while you are trying to figure out how not to starve to death or get murdered by darkness.  The second character you unlock basically allows you to play endlessly, so if you want a good challenge, try skipping her.  Also, the game seems to ramp up difficulty the more days you survive, which I know sounds typical, but the game lends itself to a feeling of opening new areas for higher difficulty instead of time-based difficulty progression.-It plays like a point and click hack n slash in an open world, but no traditional rpg elements.-The art is cute and works well with the play-style. -Craft to survive.  Bang on a tree to get wood for a fire, build an axe or pick, even a snare to catch dinner.-If you have played DayZ, Rust or one of the other Survival Horror games, then that is what you can expect, but in an isometric, 2D environment which is a refreshing pov shift for a genre I enjoy.

												This is one of my favorite games! I love the look of the game, and have enjoyed it since it was first released on steam. Though, one thing that would make this game so much better would be adding multiplayer. Those of you who play and enjoy this game, just imagine playing with a friend or two, it would be great! Also, please make a way to create your own characters in a simple way, such as a ""Character Creation"" option, where you can draw a character in each frame, change their sound to one of the character sounds, and choose their heath, sanity, hunger and other stats. Other than these two things, 5 stars!			"

												Don't Starve.  Sounds simple enough.  Also, don't go insane.  And don't get eaten by hounds, smashed by Tree Guardians, crushed by the Deerclops, hunted by MacTusk & Son, stung by killer bees, bitten by spiders, slapped by tentacles, mauled by were-pigs, or even stampeded by Beefalos in heat.  Got all that?  Well, then you're going to need some supplies.

												Don't starve is 2d survival game with a gorgeous art style that looks like Tim Burton movies have turned into cartoons. There is a sandbox mode, where you try to survive as long as you can, as well as an adventure mode with a minimal story. There is also a wide variety of crafting (as well as cooking) which is neatly organized into different tiers.While the game's purpose is quite simple -not to starve- you get no handholding whatsoever. Your character is stranded in an unknown world, where you need to figure out what to do in order to survive. This can result in several deaths initially, as well as loads of hilarious situations which inevitably occur when you run around poking things. Don't starve is mostly unforgiving to your mistakes -which can end in permanent death- but rewards you with unlocking several characters with unique abilities, in order to spice up your gameplay. There is an option to tweak several world aspects as well, if you are looking for a more casual sandbox experience. I should also mention there are constant updates and a workshop community for this game.Definitely recommend it, if all the above are your cup of tea :)			"

												To all those who say there is no story, you obviously have not played enough. Inside the game there is an ""adventure mode"" which is basically story mode(and very challenging).Crafting is a primary part of the game. It starts very simply — you'll pick up items in the landscape to construct simple tools, necessary to break down more raw materials. The system expands all the way from grass and twigs up to scientific machinery, complex farms and magical devices. The tech tree has enormous depth and room for experimentation, all dependent on your priorities.I recommended this game to anyone who wants to have great time for a couple of hours.			"

												You're dropped into a world with no tutorial, no narration, no guidebook.  Simply click on things, find out what they do, combine them with other things, and LEARN.  This game is brilliant in its simplicity and depth.  With each death, you learn a little bit more about how to survive for longer.  My only complaint is that once you figure out how to survive, the game can stagnate and become rather dull.  Sure, you can make up your own endgame goals, but I wish there was better endgame content.			"

												Awesome game, favourite survival game of all time. It is so great cause you have such a big choice of what to do. If u wanna survive on only meat go for it, on only carrots and so on. When dawn comes it's time to step away from the fire and head out on adventure. It is great that there are diffrent characters, and that they all are diffrent. The style and art of the game is really cool it makes the game dark and a bit spooky. Sometimes you can get a really annoyed with this game, especially when a pack of hound comes or when you die, but there is something that always keeps dragging you back. I would recomend this game to most people but you have to put in some time to the game to learn to survive in this world. It is also a great game to play while whatcing a movie.

												Every single aspect of this game, feels as if it has been developed to its absolute best, finding a true balance between, a wonderfully creative survial based game, and amazingly unique graphics.This game has superbe replay value, and you feel as if after every death you learn something, which makes you not even care that you have possibly lost dozens of hours of gameplay, since you will want to continue playing, despite having to start over. Eventually, you will learn the secrets of the game and then, you break a wall, that you were constantly hitting, and boom.The game starts...			"

												Don't Stave,A lot of prep work is put in to helping one have an easier journey and survive, but it is challenging. This challenging side of the game makes players have to use time wisely and manage their resources. Don't Stave Dlc,The Dlc is amazing, it adds a fair bit in gameplay and items to use in the world; plus it spices the challenge of surviving.The mods for the game are great and add tons of different content, like leveling RPG elements of fantasy characters.Overall Great game, challenging, but fun and a lot of different mods if want to try something different. 8.2/10			"

												It's like fishing, people mostly don't get why some of us spend so long on this kind of game.It gives me that ""empty box"" inside my mind which I'd stare for hours, like waiting a fish to get hooked - like a meditation of some sort, of course until the world wants to kill me with frog rains.

												 Don't Starve is a unique little pop-up book different from many sandbox games. Like many sandbox games, this one allows you to make your own goals, but unlike said genre, these goals might be impeded by the world's terrain and weather (and even your own sanity). The world's unforgiving nature forces you to manage your needs before you can handle your wants (which can get very frustrating at times), but is very rewarding once one can manage the game's mechanics. Don't Starve knows how to handle the risk-and-reward mechanic, which is one way the game can get you out of your comfort zone. Hunting tough enemies like Mactusk and Co. and treeguards can reward you with useful items, like the walking cane (for the impatient ones) and living logs (for the magicians). It is a rogue-like, so those who don't like starting over should be extra cautious about their actions. All in all, Don't Starve is not a game for everyone, but it's well worth the purchase for strategists and survival enthusiasts.			"

												Don't starve is a great survival game that feels a bit like a darker, harder 2D version of minecraft (you need to collect, build and progress in order to stay alive). If you enjoy learning stuff the hard way and constantly improving your style of playing then this is definitely a game for you, but if you don't enjoy working hard and losing everything you built up over and over again by dying afterwards (you will always die sooner or later) then this is no game for you... Would definitely recommend this game to the more experienced and determined gamers amongst us.I had so much fun I nearly starved to death myself because I couldn't stop playing!			"

												Between minecraft,terraria,rust and alikesdon't starve stands out as a survival game with great art design,different mechanics and interesting history.Death is a real consequence and it's definetly not comparable to minecraft's hardcore modesince don't starve has a way wider progession system with multiple goals.8.5/10 I think the only thing Don't starve needs at this point is bigger worlds.

												Don't starve is a single-play survival game, where you each death gain xp to unlock different characters in the game, but if you are interested; you can add mods, which can spice things up(unlock more new characters, NOTE some of them may have bugs, so it is at your own risk to add them). There is also ""Don't starve together"" which is a multi-player version of the game, that is also enjoyable and funny to play with friends. The mechanics(crafting,gathering and exploring) is simple, which is one of the things I like about the game. Great game overall; Should you buy it? YES! you should :)			"

												Don't Starve is a game about surviving and well, not starving. You search the enviroment collecting necessary items and sometimes even non-necessary items. You encounter monsters. You craft things. It's a game. There are multiple characters. I love it.Pros, things that are good.- Multiple characters with different traits and abilities!- Much replayability!- There are lots of mods to make it even better.- New updates frequently!- GREAT DLC!Neutral, things that can help you and not help you.- Randomly generated world. You could have tons of food, flowers, trees, flint, rocks, other great stuff. And then you could get no food, flowers, trees, flint, rocks, ect.- You play alone. You may have trouble surviving, but you can go at your own pace.Cons, things that are bad.- Day 9 - 11, it's random, gives you hounds to fight.- There are lots of dangerous monsters.Overall, there are more pros than cons, so I reccomend this game to people who like survival games.
