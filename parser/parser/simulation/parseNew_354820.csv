												Not a good game, I got it thinking it might be like the roller coaster tycoons. I would give it a two out of five, the only things I knew how to do were build, order supplies, hire, and fire.			"

												Prison Tycoon Alcatraz is yet another corpse in the Prison Tycoon series that keeps on stinking up the morgue - which in this crap metaphor is Steam. The UI is awful, the graphics are atrocious, and the gameplay - once you've got your guards and prisoners and assigned jobs - consists of sitting around twiddling your thumbs. It's charmless and borderline unplayable if you have any concept of fun. If you want a decent prison game, might I suggest Prison Architect instead.			"

												got this game played for 2 hours and i was board good idea but it lacks depth as there is very little management involved and a long time sitting doing nothing as a fan of tycoon style games in general i would give it a miss. maybe ive been a bit quick to judge but i thought there was going to be alot more to manage			"

												Although these negative comments are justified, I'd like to point out that when the game runs it is pretty much a blast to play. At first I thought I was playing just another ""Typhoon"" video game, but man once that music kicks in and you're running a prison like the god you are... it sends you into orbit. One thing that makes this game stand out is it's ability to help you loose weight. That's right! You'll be having so much fun playing, you'll plumb forget to eat at all! All this game needs is multiplayer. I'd love to compete with my many friends in online. Maybe I could even meet a nice girl while playing online. Her name is Dorris she's ma best girl I'm gonna marry someday. Well I gotta go. This game just finished downloading so I'm gonna go try it out!Good Luck			"
