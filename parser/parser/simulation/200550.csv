												Its the same with every kalypso game on here; I see a game I think I'll like and i has so many negative reviews that I don't buy it till its on super sale one day. Then I love it. This isn't dungeon keeper. I don't know what dungeon keeper is, but scanning the negative reviews will tell you that people bought this game not called dungeon keeper, and then discovered that it isn't dungeon keeper, and were very upset.This is a dungeon-making/ time management/ strategy game. It's pretty easy, but fun and a good time killer. There is a lot of micromanaging. That's what the game is; managing things. Managing and building. Gameplay is pretty much the same as the last dungeons but with more objects and upgrades and a different story. It's fun, really, if you like time management and city building or dungeon building sims.			"

												Do you want to be your own dungeon master? Ever have that itch to kill heroes and not finding a way to scratch said itch? This is the game for you!!!! Although it does get tough. Its NOT a Dungeon Keeper CLONE. Its more like the Sims. Editing the levels to make your level unique is easy to use. Maybe people don't like this game because it is fully 3d and has similar controls to a 3D design program. So far, it's has entertained me for about 3 hours and that is more then I can say for many other games. $7.49 for the gold edition was a good price and I would recommend this game to other users. $30 isn't a bad price could be $20 and it would be perfect			"

												I love this game!!But sadly, it needs more content. More dungeon decor, more maps, and a revamp of skills for ones Dungeon Lord of choice.It's like they took the sheer awesomeness of decor and skill/ability selection of the first game and flushed it down a Multi-Player sewer, thus robbing a sadistically funny single player/ custom game experience.Buyer beware, the first game Dungeons was much better. This game may just be a spiritual sucessor, and very much following the theme of creepy ways to rob would be adventurers.That being said, I love this game!!!  It still has a core of disappointing fun, at a reasonable price point. But only when on sale.Definitely worth picking up for below $15. Good wholesome hero slaying fun!!!			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed playing it. Has more freedom of control and design then dungeon keeper. Both making/decorating your dungeon and controling your dungeon lord to hunt heroes is a lot of fun. Only fun braking difficulty I experienced was constant soul gathering need and racing with heroes for endless leveling, leaving you always needing to push yourself harder untill immenent defeat from op heroes rather then having fun. But I guess no dungeon boss stays undefeated after all..			"

												Firstly, don't believe that Dungeons is a Dungeon Keeper remake.  It's not.  Dungeon Keeper was about massing armies of minions and then trashing the incoming heros with them.  Dungeons is more about indirect hero management (very much like  a Dungeon Master in D&D) and this is no bad thing.Actually I prefer the concept of Dungeons far more than I did Dungeon Keeper.  Are there enough piles of loot for hero's to find?  Are they being adequately challenged by you minions?  Is the dungeon decor affecting them?  If yes then torture the statisfaction right back out of them!  Maniacal Laughter(tm)The problem I have with Dungeons is that it's seriously unpolished.  Trying to target the correct hero with a spell can become an excerise in twitching the camera until you can finally get the cursor to select him.  The early game generally moves too slowly and is the same process over-and-over again.Your commandos need micro-management.  They'll happily stand by and watch as the Dungeon Heart is destroyed next to them rather than attacking.  Which becomes more of a problem if one turns off the horrible voice acting; then it's hard to notice the heart is under attack.Imps sometimes can't be bothered to mine out walls - 6 imps running around uselessly won't mine a wall bang in the middle of my dungeon.Autosaves are a mess, instead of saving at meaningful checkpoints they're sometimes saved on a timer.  I've played for two hours in a dungeon to discover the last autosave was in a previous dungeon.  Which bring me to my last point.  The early game is tediously slow but the whole game could have been faster paced.Unless you know what you're getting and are really looking to play Dungeons - The Dark Lord then I can't recommend it.  Which is a pity; it had the potential for greatness.			"

												I like the idea of Dungeons, but there's so many issues I have with the game that I can't recommend this game.  It's not that it's a bad concept, I mean be a dungeon boss, and rule with an iron fist.  Ok.I like the gameplay mechanisms, build out the dungeons and entertain heroes.I'll even accept the stupidity of that last statement.  Your dungeon is there to entertain or get heroes ""excited"" then you can kill them and get soul energy. What I can't stand is how the game actually plays.  The concepts are great, and in fact they even mix up the gameplay.  You'll run a dungeon, but you'll also run through ""dungeons"" or caverns and then explore.   That all works in theory, however the fact is the ""what am I supposed to do"" is often unclear. After the first full level (which contains 3 different objectives, each relatively understandable) the second area has a cave you're supposed to explore.  When you get to the end of the cave, you're told to wait and hold off the horde.  So I did that, and new entrances to my dungeon open up.  It's apparently a part of the game where you hold be an ever increasing enemy until some time limit runs out and you can proceed.And all my enthusiasm for the game dropped quickly.  The first issue with this map is that the map is poorly laid out, and this is the third real dungeon you run.   The second is there's just entirely too many enemies thrown at you, there's not even a good layout to get them because the minute they see you, they forget about their ""needs"" and rush your lord.   The third is that it's just mindless waiting.   And then suddenly I lost the game, I couldn't find anyone attacking my heart, there's no clear indicator who is doing it, though the game keeps telling you someone is attacking your heart, after three laps of the very small room, I realized, I was going to lose and there was no way to find the guy. Ok so there's challenge, but let me explain why I didn't try again.  That level took over an hour and a half to get to that point, and there's an auto save (thank god).... it's from the beginning of the area.   The game expected me to play through an hour and a half of mindless goals.  There's no information about how close I was or how long I have to wait, just an order of ""wait"".  There's no way to speed up the process.  There's just ""waiting"". And the waiting is LONG, 90 minutes or so of waiting for nothing to happen?  No thank you.   The autosave that only saves once an area is a problem, but the tediousness with that last area I think drove me insane.  I like the idea of the game, I really do, but the fact is the game just feels poorly implemented.  There's enough little issues I have with the game, and the over abundance of effects, that I couldn't really feel what was actually going on. This is a game that works when the player is given clear goals and a clear path to those goals, even if the steps are a little obscure.  Instead of that this game revels in unclear goals, and a path that you either learn in the tutorial, figure out through trial an error, or suffer because you don't know. Even when you're doing everything right, the game is never ""very fun"".  The heroes in the game seem to have more excitement then the player, which seems like a mistake.   In an RTS game I can enjoy myself because I have to constantly manage the battlefield, or I'm waiting for a big battle to happen, but in this game, the game almost plays itself, you only have to step in and murder heroes after they're happy, but the thing is they become happy from you doing nothing, so you're constantly waiting.   It's not even interesting to watch the heroes, which could have helped, instead you sit on your hands after building a dungeon (which also takes time as the goblins have to dig through the wall) and wonder if you could be doing anything else. Honestly because of that, I can't even think to recommend this game because of all that. (not to mention the game's 'story' is just Lord of the rings, but honestly, I kind of liked how they played with that lore, it's a shame that the game was so dry that I can't even fully get invested in the story)			"

												A solid worldbuilder in which the primary goal is to upset NPC adventurers who stumble into your lair. As a mad scientist, I can definitely appreciate that, though the fact that the game spends a good half of its time spouting ""AM I FUNNY YET?"" jokes at you is kind of a downer.			"

												Dungeons - The Dark Lord is a 3/4ths top down dungeon digging, operating, micro managing game with most of the emphasis on micromanaging instead of digging.On the surface it looks pretty much like the old Dungeon Keeper series of games. However, in the 3 dungeon 2 hour tutorial, you'll learn its about 'entertaining' heroes that invade your dungeon and then killing them for their soul points or whatever. The heroes are attracted to certain things. Some want gold, so you need to let them collect gold before you kill them. Others look for armor and weapons from your forge, invading magicians look for your library. Still other heroes look for combat, to either take punnishment or dish it out. Thieves will come to disarm traps. It is all about making them happy to enrich their soul. So you can kill them, have your imps... I mean goblins take them to a prison where they can die. You can also torture them for bonus soul points!With soul points you can buy things to make your dungeon more prestiegous to bait heroes in certain directions. The more prestiege you have, the wider your reach. The wider reach helps cut into rival dungeon keeper territory in multi player. You can also use soul points to level up your character's skills and magic, but really, you're pretty overpowered even if you do not upgrade anything.Like Dungeon Keeper, you have a dungeon heart. If it dies, you lose the game. This will happen in multi-player, but not the solo campaign. Everything is like Dungeon Keeper, but without charm and it all seems like so much work. Keep a hero happy then kill him. That's a new level of micro management I don't care to get into. Plus the voice acting is terrible to bad if not annoying 'A hero is about to leave your dungeon with a smile on his face,' says an imp... I mean goblin in a dreadful voice.The first dungeon of the tutorial just lets you guide your character through combat and its an easy 20 minutes. Very misleading as to what the game is. The game doesn't really show you what its about until 30 minutes into the tutorial and then its actually interesting. You put things into empty rooms instead of building rooms like Dungeon Keeper. A forge becomes a forge, because you put forge equipment in there, not because you insta-make it with a forge room like Dungeon Keeper. Again, its micro management to a higher level. Everything you put in a room has a use, such as quality, efficiency and speed. The heroes will keep coming, they don't stop so like a factory your goblins need to be quick and churn things out before a hero comes looking for a book, but because the last hero took a book, there are no more books, so that hero wanders through your dungeon, wondering where are the books? And there are no soul points when your creatures kill him.So its all for soul points. Who cares? Get more soul points to get more stuff? Its good for competitive multi-player, but that's not how I want to spend my time. While this game looks like Dungeon Keeper, and plays totally different, I'd much rather play Dungeon Keeper 2 with all of its charm and great voice acting. A lot of the ideas and mechanics in Dungeons: The Dark Lord are good, but its just too much micromanagement for me.I'd rather dig, explore and send waves of minions invading after heroes.			"

												In Dungeons you make a amusement park for heroes. They enter for free. Then they admire decorations and steal some loot or gold. When they try to leave you must club their heads and throw them in a prison. So you can collect resources to further upgrade your dungeon themed park. It's kind of a weird mix between Rollercoaster Tycoon and Dungeon Keeper. You are better off just playing those two.			"

												This game is improved enough over the base game that I feel comfortable recommending the game at its current price (I got the base game + all DLCs + this Addon for $7.50.This is a refinement of the base game.  Everything is improved, and the only thing lost is the rpg-like skil tree... which is a shame, but everything else more than makes up for it (imo).It's very moddable.  The game just never got enough traction for any worthwhile mods to be created.  It would have been a good idea to create some modding tutorials, but that never happened (edit: I was wrong about that).  A shame, because with the proper mods this could have been a brilliant D&D Sadistic Dungeon Master simulator -- which no game does better than this.EDIT: Everything that's available on modding this game can be found here: http://www.droolingfanboy.de/projects/dungeons/wiki "

												Everytime the game starts it reinstalls the VC Distributables.  Then when it finally loads up it's some crappy Kalyspo Launcher that forces you to make an account to even play single player.  Then you finally get in, and if you adjust any display settings the game isn't smart enough to go to windowed or change resolution on the fly, so you have to exit out and deal with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ VC Distributables and launcher.

I found that the heros came in too thick and too fast and that they get harder quick. A lot of the enjoyment I would have had building a dungeon and filling it with nasty things was lost in the constant struggle to make sure I kept up with the swarm of heros (at no point did I feel it possible to be on top of things).I may yet play it some more but unless a update or expansion drastically alters the balance (or even just allow for more control over the game pace) I can't see myself being able to recommend this game.

												I wish I could like this game. Really... I mean, the gameplay went through some improvements.But the dialogues... the plot. I hate it thoroughly. It's okay to make references to something once in a while but let this be said.You can NOT - I repeat - YOU CAN NOT - make a game entirely out of references.And this is what this game seems to be. A force-funny remake of Lord of the Rings.If you copy at least make it nice afterwards and do not pretend to have made it bad on purpose. I have counted SIX tauntingly bad LotR referals in the first two levels and this obnoxiously unfunny ♥♥♥♥ of a ""sidekick"" does not improve the situation with his horrible voice and ability to point out the obvious.I managed to get used to the playstyle and it's better in the ""The Dark Lord"" version, compared to the normal game. It's a good game. I want to keep ranting but I'll run out of letters soon. Gameplay: Good, enjoyableDialogues, story, jokes: ""Line up and shoot""-tier.(also: game <3 crashing)			"

												does not even come to to what dungeon keeper 1 or 2 had going for it. The fact is you have these timers on evry hero portals once opened the respawn every 30 secs or so. Than you have to make them happy by putting treasures in the correct places same with traps and wall effects , Etc, Etc. Than if you dont personnally kill the heros there is a penalty of how much Happiness you can grab from them. heros often have a spawn point tht starts open near where the games starts you having a jail. All the clutter of running your leader around to each loacation in timne to stop heros from getting away and the fact that any new heros helps any with gold escape makes this game neigh unplayable. get dungeon keeper 1 or 2 and have 1000 times more fun.

												This game had the chance to be good, but they ♥♥♥♥ed it up.The main problem in my opinion lies within the idea of the game, to make a dungeon is fun and to see heroes trying to invade your dungeon failing is also fun, but trying to appease those heroes and only building as many defenses that the heroes stay satisfied is not fun, it's annoying. If you could appease all heroes with everthing you put into your dungeon it could be fun, because then you could build your dungeon as you desire it but like this it doesn't work for me.A secondary problem I see is the control you have over what your character and the goblins are doing on the map, you have none, when your playing with more than 1 character you have even less. The reason for this is:- Goblins only do the orders you made beforehand but you have zero control over what they're doing first, so you have to do 1 order at a time or you just have to hope that they do the important thing first, but if your doing the ""one order at a time""-thing you don't have time for anything else.- Chracters can be controlled ok, they even attack automatically what attacks them what is good, but if you have more than one character you can't do anything as you want because you can only control 1 character at a time so the others just follow the one you're controlling around and are most of the time not even near enough to help in a fight, also because of the automated following around you can't let the unused character defend the heart or any other important place.The implementaion of a pause system, where you could manage your dungeon while not being stressed because time is running out, would also have helped to make the game at least ok.Because of the points made above I don't like this game.

												Umm this game was out 2 years before Dugeon Keeper and if you like buying gems for minions then waste your money. This game is mad fun, yes it is not a major multiplayer game and is more like a sim builder. It is hard too, there are so many heroes at some levels you don't know what to do.

												Dungeons: The Dark Lord is the sequel to Dungeons, the game where the more evil you are, the better! There are a slew of exciting new features, including four-player multiplayer in four modes! Along with the addition of multiplayer modes such as Deathmatch and King of the Hill, there’s now the ability to play as some of the game’s popular bosses (Minos, The Dungeon Lord, the Zombie King and more) in multiplayer, along with the addition of an extensive single-player campaign, a new dungeon setting and 25 new prestige gimmicks.

												Feels very rushed. The campaign is very short, but still pretty good. (Kudos for the Dialogue.)

Exaples: Goblins run all over the dungeon to drop off gold when you have a lord standing just next to them, but he/she's not selected.

												Played this a lot in a none steam version, but decided to get this one for completeness sake as well.While it's a perfect Dungeon Keeper replacement, it does have a lot of fun under the hood.Graphics are good enough. The humour is weird and goofy. The story is simple, but fun. The whole lure heroes in to harvest their souls is an odd game mechanic, but you got used to it. Most levels are well designed with a few bad apples in between. Combat is rather rudimentary, but there is enough other components to the game for that to be forgivable.			"

												Well lets see a game designed to build a dungeon, fill duneon with loot make dungeon satisfying to heros, let said heros come in get loot and satisfation. then send out monsters to beat heros and get your loot back and tourture them and take the satisfation back.

This is a sequal to Dungeons, not a sequal to or remake of dungeon keeper, so if you bought the game believing that and are now ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off about it, then the idiot screw up is your fault not the developers. Hating the game and giving it a bad review based on a game its not a sequal to or meant to be, is idiotic. It's not the most gripping or attention holding game ive ever played, which is why ive only logged 3.6 hours but it was mildly entertaining.

												Alright I'm going to start off and lay this down for the incompitent thinking they are getting a remake of Dungeon Keeper. You are NOT and getting this game expecting that (like with any inspired by game) You will be sorely disappointed or pleasently surprised.That said and havinhg never played Dungeon Keeper; I enjoyed the game, it has a fair pace that the player can control by keeping gates closed or opening to change the flow of heroes though once opened it sets the minimal pace. Some things I liked about the game for the short time I've played it is four playible characters with uniqe minions, amusing story mode, and decent voice acting for the time (2010).I will admit it has some downsides to it too; What game doesn't now? This however I do not take from the experience in the least. There's a few minor bugs, like the goblins running around aimlessly till you tell them to dig out a large enough section of wall (Rarely happens and rock doesn't count as it cannot be dug out), monsters not always going after heroes, I think this has to do with lair and hero corilation. And odd camera controls (fixed with a mouse).Above all I'd at least rate this 7/10 as it does have lots of potinial to grow and recieve much TLC, but if you go in thinking it's a remake then don't bother, I saved you $19.99, but if you want to play it for what it is, its own game inspired by Dungeon Keeper, then I think you'll find it enjoyible.
