												A few years ago, a little title came out called Antichamber. I played it to what I guess you'd consider 100% completion in a few afternoons over a long weekend, and said to myself, ""this eliminates all doubt, new genres of game still exist to be uncovered if developers bother to look.""The better part of a year later, a game called The Stanley Parable came out. I had very much the same thoughts about it.Somewhere in there, The Swapper released.The pattern here, I guess, if there is one, is that the most imaginitive stuff coming out lately seems to have been on the puzzle game front. I tend to think of those three titles as such - Antichamber is built around its own weird school of bizarro-logic, and The Stanley Parable contained enough endings and possibilities that I found myself drawing a flowchart. That's puzzle enough for me. The Swapper, possibly the most traditional puzzle game among the three, was still freaking weird, still engaged on some sort of intellectual level, and still was a great deal more captivating than most titles I played its year of release.Why would I bother to preface this review with a comparison to those three games? Well, I tend to think that The Magic Circle can happily co-exist alongside them. While a bit rougher around the edges than those titles, it shares the same ridiculous sense that it's out to tread a sort of new ground, and doesn't really care if the player wants to go along with it. People expecting a core puzzle game aren't likely to exactly get their fix here. This is a confident game, very much its own beast.That's okay by me. The Magic Circle isn't a terribly challenging puzzle game, but it's built around a rather novel idea - you're here, essentially, to further break an already-broken piece of software. Certain items in the world are entirely rewritable, their behaviors yours to define. This is the means by which you progress in the small-but-concise game world.The programmer in me is hooked on the concept from square one. Visual touches like bits of code flying around the screen as you interact with the game's editable objects (I confess getting a weird satisfaction from reading them and trying to suss out where they'd go in the game's engine), placeholder textures, and so on help to ground the idea that while the world around you essentially functions, you're effectively playing as code in a hapless machine.The world is packed with nooks and crannies where the in-game game's ""developers"" (read: antagonists) have left change logs, notes to each other, and audio recordings. For the most part, it's reasonably well-written, even. I didn't outright laugh at anything to be found here, but I smirked. And that's really the game's intended effect, I think. If you've followed any vaporware story, any failed Kickstarter project, in the past few years, The Magic Circle has a few choice words of cynical sympathy for you.Sadly, a couple of awkward dialogue choices, particularly in the early game, stand out for that reason. I cringed at a handful of one character's monologues. I appreciate that the game is trying to make a particular character come off as downright weird and unlikeable, but it doesn't change the effect - there were scenes of melodrama I had to force myself not to skip from sheer embarrassment. Intended by the developers or not, it's not exactly pleasant to sit through.There's another thing I wish to address, and that's that the game stands in a weird Twilight Zone. I encountered a lot of visual bugs, frequent missing textures, and a significant amount of pop-in in my five hours with the game. I am not sure if this was intentional (that's how effective this game is as a satirical work), but it did make exploration more difficult than it needed to be at times. Given the labyrinthine design of the overworld map, I found myself relying on visual landmarks for navigation, and it did get in the way when I'd have to wait for one to pop back in.I like to get the negative out of the way in reviews though so I can refocus in on what a game does well. A very effective final 20 minutes and ending, some frankly ingenious multi-solution (if perhaps a tad easy) puzzles, and a visual style that consistently surprises make this game the first real standout for those looking for a unique experience in 2015.--UPDATE (7/16)--I wasn't expecting this review to get so popular. I posted it, looked away, and to my surprise, it's sitting on the storefront. Because it's there, and I happen to be in control of it, I think a nice little thing to do might be for me to answer any user questions below, since other people who click on this might have them.mendel asked:Do you know Doublefine's Hack'n'Slash where you reprogram the game in order to progress? Is TMC more than HnS in 3D with a different backstory?I've not actually played HnS. I followed its development a bit, but Double Fine lost a bit of my personal confidence with the whole Kickstarter, failed project, Kickstarter, Early Access, conga line they started to, shall we say, dance in. So.. take the following answer with a grain of salt.TMC does not go as far as Hack'n'Slash in its ""hacking"". By no means do you interact directly with the code you're manipulating in the game. A better way to think about TMC's approach to hacking might be ""you can equip items on objects in the game world"".For instance, say I'm being attacked by a spooky ghost. I might, in TMC, replace his ability to fly with the limitation that he may only walk. That might be a way I can avoid him.Hack'n'Slash, by comparison, looks more geared towards actual programmers. (in fact, I'm a little tempted to go play with the demo if there is one)One thing I would point out, if you're unsure, is that TMC does have a gameplay demo that lets you see the first hour or so of gameplay. It's what sold me on a purchase.Hope that helps!			"

												The Magic Circle is a unique puzzle game about game development, in many different ways. First of all, it's set inside a game trapped in development hell for 20 years. It has a story centered around a few of the developers, an entity within the game known as the Old PRO, and the player. The developers are in a deadlock and can't set aside five minutes for some simple playtesting without making a major fundamental design change. The PRO is sick of it, so he makes contact with a playtester (the player), and mentors them in the art of messing with the world from the inside.In gameplay, this boils down to two main abilities: restoring deleted/dead things, and editing alive things. You have the power to freeze creatures in place, then mess with their abilities. You can swap between a few movement types, several methods of attack, a number of passive abilities, and its AI allegiances. The last one is pretty important, since the developers (in-universe ones) cut all combat. So for the most part, you have a mob of creatures running around with you to fight on your behalf. The actual fighting is mostly a footnote, though. The focus is on finding the right parts to outfit them so they can take on the variety of unique scenarios. Sometimes the solution is overwhelming numbers of melee attackers, but often you'll need to get creative.As for how it holds up in practice, there's a lot of fun to be had, but there are many more solutions than there are problems. The first time through I felt pretty clever about some of the tricks I used, but afterwards I had a look at the forums and realized that every situation that had me stuck for a bit had about half a dozen other solutions that either I never considered, or involved some creature hidden in a part of the map I only discovered after it would have helped. Maybe this criticism boils down to me wanting more, but on the flip-side it never got repetitive. My first playthrough lasted around 5 hours. On a technical level I haven't run into any notable issues. Your mileage may vary; check the demo if you're unsure. There were a few bugs that I encountered, but these were mitigated by one of two things: first, the context of a game about an unfinished game, which allows them to wave off things like jumping up to inaccessible areas or gaps in the terrain as deliberate. It sounds like cheating but they actually highlight it deliberately in a few cases, particularly the entire intro sequence, so the few issues that weren't intentional don't break immersion. Second, for anything that actually does cause problems with gameplay, the developers are extremely heavily involved on the forums. This game was released over a year ago, I posted a bug report two days ago, it got patched yesterday. You won't be left in the dark looking for support on this one.In terms of narrative, the dialog is a bit overdramatic at times, but the characters are generally likable, if a bit eccentric. They all have their own agendas, and at times this left me wondering whose I was supposed to be following, and if I was supposed to be saving this game, burning it to the ground, or just trying to sabotage the lives of the developers for giggles. Voice acting is excellent and the writing does pretty well at setting the scene of a stressed out game studio.In summary, solid game, would recommend to anyone who enjoys organic puzzle games with really flexible and creative solutions, likes the idea of a drama about the worst group project they've ever had in school except twenty times worse, or is interested in game development and especially if they recognized the concept that the title of the game is a reference to.Oh, full disclosure: I bought the game myself a few months back and decided I liked it then, but never got around to writing this. I replayed it recently, and as I mentioned above, I reported a bug and it got resolved very quickly. As a gesture of thanks for my detailed feedback and reproduction steps, they provided an extra copy of the game that I could share with a friend. It's worth pointing out that I wouldn't have replayed it or compiled the comprehensive bug report if I didn't already like the game, but it's still a potential incentive for bias that happened prior to writing the review, so I'm obligated to mention that detail.

												I was lucky enough to have 2 DEVs show up in my stream today to watch me play the game. They are the most down to earth people and are very humble. The game itself might be the best story and indie game I have played this year. The style of the game with the amazing voice acting really blew me away. The music added to the atmosphere and I couldn't put down the damn thing.It really is a great game and I feel everyone who comes across the demo to try it, it's worth it.			"

												So I bought the game today and played it to completion. I'm really split as to whether I should recommend it or not.On the one hand, it does have a very nice story and I found it addictive (while it lasted), and reminds of Portal in that regard. The voice acting is brilliant and [SPOILER ALERT] the different levels of reality it throws at you [\SPOILER ALERT] is refreshing.However, it lacks puzzles or challenges. It lacks much of a world to explore. I simply don't expect to be able to finish a game in 4 hours, not when it costs £13/$20. There is the option to 'level up' in the game, but its simply unnecessary. You can do everything by just walking without thought and pressing buttons as they come up (I got 90% of the hidden messages this way).The game has lots of options for creative solutions, but these are not needed as there are basically no problems to be solved. Which I think is the dissapointing thing about this game.To summarise, the game feels like a short, odd sci-fi/fantasy book. The story keeps you going, and when you finally put it down you feel slightly uneasy about what's just happened. Unfortunately, I don't think that's quite enough for me to recommend it as a game.

												A fun puzzle adventure game where you hack into a video game dev diva ala Molyneux's ""magnum opus"" that's he's been making for years with no end in sight and help the original protagonist of the game out by giving him an actual game to exist in. Said dev is voiced by the dude who voices Rusty Venture so it adds even more to the delusional mega ego. Overall manipulating and exploring the world is fun and the game is tight enough where it doesn't get old. The writing and voice acting are both good stuff and it ends up being a fun satire of diva devs, crazy fans, and bloated games destroyed by their own unfeasibly lofty ambitions. (Truly this game knows how Star Citizen is going to end.) Overall it’s some good♥♥♥♥♥♥and a unique game.			"

												A strong candidte for my favorite game of 2015.At its core The Magic Circle is a first-person puzzle game with strong comedic elements.  The premise is that you are in an unfinished game and have limited abilities to edit the game as you travel through it.  The integration between the game mechanics and the story make this exceptionally engaging.  There are a bunch of fourth wall jokes and gameplay is fairly non-linear/open-world.  You can reach the end of the game fairly quickly (about 5 hours) but there are many side/easter egg things that encourage you to go back and discover afterwards (or before).  I highly recommend this to people who enjoyed Portal 2 (not that it's SUPER similar, but the blend of puzzle and comedy is somewhat reminicent).Your progress in the demo will carry over into the full game.  I've done an LP here but encourage you to play the game yourself before watching the end. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL5JEFvVpx9rBFMQ-7YygNarrBXUBwY1A "

								An incredibly inventive game about games that manages to maintain self awareness and a wry sense of humor throughout. Instead of simply sitting you in a room and telling the story at you, it makes you do some leg work and gives you systems to deconstruct the game and ultimately make your own meaning. Great writing and voice work, too.			"

												This is probably one of the best games I have played in *years*! I want to write a in-depth review, but I simply don't belive I can do that without spoiling it, so I'll just say a bit about the game in general:------------------------------------------The Magic Circle is a saterical story-driven explorative game about you (the player) play testing a game being developed by an egotisical game designer who is never happy with his work. You are inseted into his unfionished game, were a mysterious entity wants you to bring it all crashing down on his head. You play through the game rewriting the game from the inside, controlling it to your advantage as you hide your presense from the system.The story and personal conflicts are derlivered through both hiden collectables and story elements. As you progress, the story gets more and more surreal, as what defines the game you are playing is further called into question.It's a very open game, with no major hints or ""hand holding"" - you figure out how to proceed, and there are always multiple ways do so.------------------------------------------The game even has a *demo* (haven't seen a demo in YEARS!), so I STROYNGLY recommend this game to anyone, and you can try it for free and decide for yourself.

Early Access Review
								i don't even know how to describe what kind of game this is because i've never seen or played anything else like it..its like..portal..without portals..combined with the unfinished swan on drugs..?basically the story starts with you in a broken prototype version of a fantasy adventure game which you're meant to think is the actual game, but as the glitches go on, you hear developers commenting on what's happening in the background and changing the world around you as you play, and it gets really weird and cool and i don't want to spoil too much even though i haven't beaten it myself yet but basically it's a game inside a game about a game that's all a commentary on making games. It's weird and cool and hard and fun and JUST BUY IT OK. Also the music is really good.FEATURES:-Explore a stylized storyboard world (and some other stuff that's semi spoilers so shhh)-Capture and edit entities in the game (there's not combat, make the enemies work for you or just take their abilites)-Great story (so far)-Amazing soundtrack (The deluxe edition comes with it free, put it in your itunes or whatever)-One of the only early access games to run perfectly on day 1Overall i havent finished the game yet so i can't give an exact score or anything but i'd say it's worth the price for sure			"

If this game was 5 dollars then i wouldn't really be writing a review about it. sbuIt is very cool, it's a very neat idea i will give it that. I wanted to play this, i wanted to see what i could do. Then i found out there isn't much at all. This whole game could have been so much more. But you basically did what the game itself did. Released something that was sub par at best. If you wanna spend the money and have the income to do so, i say go for it. But for everyone else, just watch a lets play on youtube it won't take you very long. "

												In The Magic Circle you’re a playtester of a game that’s been in development for 20 years, with no end in sight. The project director seems out of touch with the people he works with, as their conversations break down into drama and backstabbing, with no consensus on what the game should be. The project has become the most important thing in his life, but he can’t decide on what it’s supposed to be. Over the long development a part of the game seems to have gained sentience, and wants you the player to take over and finish the game yourself.You explore an unfinished world, full of half done or abandoned designs, reaching back to the early 90s. The older designs look like System Shock 1, while the new one is a fantasy adventure. You solve puzzles by capturing creatures and objects, and modifying their properties. Even though the game is broken, your method of interacting with it is quite nice! This game was made by Jordan Thomas, best known for making The Cradle in Thief 3, Fort Frolic in Bioshock, and then as Creative Designer on Bioshock 2. By now he knows how to make a game, and The Magic Circle feels like a game made by an expert. There’s no newbie design mistakes, and the game does all it can to make the experience as smooth as possible, without sacrificing complexity. There’s often several solutions to puzzles, so you’re unlikely to get stuck anywhere.To make a game as meta as this requires the developers be smarty pants. And so they were, invoking authenticity in all the dialog and notes you come across. The references in the game clearly come from Looking Glass, Irrational Games, Ion Storm, and Origin. The closest comparison to this would be The Stanley Parable and Portal 2, but it’s more ambitious than either of them. It only dawned on me after I’d finished it just how much this games does, and how well it succeeds in all it tries to do. If you like to read behind the scenes stuff about game development, The Magic Circle will be a treat.			"

												The Magic Circle... what do I say. It's clear the developers are trying to say something with it, but I'm not sure they themselves know what it's supposed to be saying.I'm quite sure I was supposed to have some revelation about video games like Spec Ops or The Stanley Parable. But while those games played all up and down the scales of meta, questioning and prodding the relationship between the player and the game, as soon as The Magic Circle grasped onto a point about anything, it slipped and fell off, eventually ending so far down the ""CAN YOU TELL THIS IS SATIRE YET?"" hole: in the second half of the game, you are required sabotage an entirely faked demo for ""E4"", the massive gaming convention (yes). It feels less like a story about video game development and more like pent-up retribution the team was directing at their former employers. It struck me as immature.The characters are all just awful people. Its few attempts at trying to cause sympathy are, well, I'm just going to say it, creepy. One of the characters announces that they're sterile. There's mentions of orgies in the woods at sex castle dungeons. It is extremely creepy and forced and trying way too hard for the Video Games Are Art award. Everybody is bitter and angry and hostile and sarcastic. There was no part where anybody smiled, or laughed, or seemed in any way pleased about anything.But I'm giving the game a thumbs up. Why? The parts and the narrative about the struggles about video game development rung true. The mechanics of undeleting and editing characters, to having lordes of pets, to the puzzle solving, were ultimately fun. Climbing to places I'm not ""supposed"" to go to find easter eggs feels rewarding. The game developers know that I'm going to explore every nook and cranny, and they make it worthwhile. There are stories and lore littered around which perhaps give a glimmer of insight, however surface, into the choices and problems that face video games.The game was at its best when it showed people genuinely trying to make a *good* video game, rather than simply get paid, or get out of a wretched contract, or get revenge on the designer (which, spoilers, are the three goals of the main characters at the end).The developers also knew that making a game about an unfinished prototype is a slippery slope -- it requires a certain kind of ""not polish"" that needs to seem intentional, rather than lazy. They pulled this off super well. The art style is ""placeholder textures"", but when you get near objects, they spring into color and life, showing that yes, they can draw things for real. Some feel like they're out of a freeware game -- unaligned pieces of Arial text and boring controls, but when you go ""behind the scenes"" and rewrite the game's mechanics, it feels like a really well-done hacker movie, with snippets of code zooming past you. This is a trick that's hard to pull off, and these guys did it.It's also worth mentioning that although first-person, you never hold any gun. It's about puzzles, interaction, and exploration, which is always refreshing to see.So yes, is it a good game? No. Not by a long-shot. Is it worth your time, and do I recommend you play it? Yes. At least up until you kill the Sky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.			"

Early Access Review
								This is an Early Access review of The Magic Circle! Be warned that I do not like Early Access because of how many projects that never get finished!Welcome, one and all, the The Magic Circle. Welcome to a land where gametesters are gods and the designers are lazy. The Magic Circle is a very innovative and creative first person adventure game. You begin by starting the game with nothing in hand and the creators of the virtual world talking in the background. The game is a strange one. Imagine The Stanley Parable mixed with Portal; even though it's not like either of those games in the slightest. For some strange reason, the game reminded me of those two games in many ways. Your character has no name and you don't have any weapons, even though this is an RPG... an unfinished one (on purpose, it's part of the game's charm). The game has beautiful graphics from every era along with colorful characters and gameplay! Pros:+Beautiful graphics style+Original gameplay and story+Unique artstyle+Lots of 4th wall breaks+Original UI for upgrades and inventory+Amazing voice actingCons:+Graphical errors (such as me being able to look through walls/ floors in certain places)The game isn't a short one. If you're expecting a short and sweet Early Access indie, then you are mistaken. The game is very polished and has amazing voice acting. This hidden Steam gem should be known by everyone. I can't wait to see what the developers have in store for the full release!I'd give this game a 9/10. I will gladly add the single point back when the graphical mishaps are corrected.Amazing job guys, I'm impressed!			"

								Hey all! I'm glad you made it this far because it means you are curious about The Magic Circle and that is the first step towards having a great experience.If you enjoyed the witty, narrative driven charm of the Stanley Parable then you should immediately buy The Magic Circle.  It oozes cleverness.Pros:-Instantly enjoyable-Funny and witty; everything from the dialogue to the menu screen was made to impress-Graphic are really fresh and well designed-Amazing ambient sounds and music-Interesting characters and themes-Some seriously exciting and well implemented game mechanics-Fun, fun, funCons:-Didn't come out earlier so I could play it sooner-May come off as pretentious to some-Missed a little dialogue due to hasty key pressesI cannot say enough good stuff about this game. If your curious already that should be enough!Disclaimer: I wasn't compensated for my review either via a free game key or any other payment.  My opinions are my own.			"

												They all start with a message. Those games with a deep meaning and a stated purpose, using a virtual world as their canvas. Titles like The Walking Dead or Braid, they want you to feel something first and foremost, at the expense of everything else. The Magic Circle also has a meaning to impart on the player, but I’m not sure if it came first. It’s a game that innovates with both its mechanics and storytelling, bringing the players in and having a nasty conversation with them. It’s a game about the people who play games and the people who design them, which understandably isn’t everyone’s cup of tea. Give it a chance though, and its broken world will enchant you in a way that few others will. As meaningful as the message is, the interactivity is placed first and foremost, and that’s why The Magic Circle is a great game and a great experience.Want to know more?

												I wish I could tell you what makes this game so incredible, but I'd be spoiling all the good bits. The gameplay is fresh and the story reflects the state of game development industry today.The major plot point is that you're inside an unfinished game. You get to piece up what went wrong during development - while completing puzzles which require you to edit creatures to your advantage. It's fun, and the creatures are cute. Well, creepy cute. The game then gets so much deeper the further in you get...I can't recommend this enough, I feel like I'm literally stuffing it down someone's throat already. If you like a good story and interesting gameplay like you've never encountered before - please, try out the Magic Circle.(I bought the game through the Humble Monthly Bundle, totally worth it this time!)

												This game felt so promising. As I was just getting the hang of the gameplay, and starting to enjoy what I could do with it, it was all over. The end sequence of the game is an abrupt finish that felt very anti climactic. I loved the concept of the game and I honsestly suggest only buying this game in a sale or if it gets some new content. I is not worth 20$ for the 4~ hours of gameplay it offers. If they lengthened the story into another ""episode"" I would think it was worth the money as long as it isn't offered as paid DLC.In short, this game had so much potential but didn't allow me to explore what I could do with what it offered.

												I played barely any of the demo and I quit to buy it. This game is great. The level design reminds me a lot of Dark Souls. The concept is amazing though. You bring the dying game to life. You can reprogram anything. You want that rock to follow you and be your pet, do it. Just steal the abilities off another creature. There is some good light platforming, back tracking Metroidvania style, and a lot of side things to discover. Just finished it up in about 6 hours. I was shocked when I reached the second part of the game. Like an added bonus to an already good game. Well worth $2.80 per hour. You'd spend at least twice that at the theater. Plus the voice acting and writing is great too. I give it 10 Rusty Ventures out of 10.			"

												This game surprised me with how unique it is. At first I was skeptical of the premise, and put off playing it for quite a while, and though it started slow, I quickly got into the flow of the game. Modifying monsters to my delight. Having a Spider problem? Send it hordes of flaming rocks. Can't reach a certain area? Ride on one of your newly flying rocks. Something got you down? Nothing cuter than a flying muchroom.Puzzles and solutions, along with this unique gameply makes me highly recoomend it to anyone looking for a unique (abeit a little short) experience.And the end game is the icing on the cake.

												If you enjoy games such as Antichamber, Stanley Parable, and/or Bioshock I think you’ll like this. It emphasizes exploration more than puzzles or combat, but I think it’s somewhere in that range. Very refreshing and very worth your time.I’d been excited to play this because of Jordan Thomas’s involvement (Shalebridge Cradle, Fort Frolic), but otherwise didn’t know what to expect.The first surprise is that it’s the funniest game he’s worked on. The narrative is mostly delivered by overhearing conversations, sort of a comedy radio play. The characters are exaggerated blends of some well-known developers (Richard “Lord British” Garriott, John Romero, Warren Spector, Stevie Case, etc.). Some characters talk directly to you, but since you are involved in the fiction as a ‘player’ it frequently makes jokes as it breaks the 4th wall. The world contains a huge number visual gags about unfinished/buggy/cliché games and these are funny as long as you’ve looked at a level editor or bad game even once. There’s also text logs that poke fun at the petty disagreements that happen when developing a game.The second surprise (though more in tune with Jordan’s other work) is that it’s really creepy. Everything in the game’s presentation is trying to unsettle you. The world looks like it’s barely held together and every action you take looks breaks the world just a little more, almost to the point of snapping in two. There’s layers of subtext anywhere you look and it’s like snooping in someone’s trash. The motivations and origins of characters are mysterious enough to draw you in and push your comfort level as you voyeuristically hear their interactions.The third surprise is the actual gameplay. It’s hard to tell if this is a FPS, RPG, or what from the trailer (or even the first hour of play). It finally hit me that the easiest description is that it’s a necromancer game with some light puzzle elements. It’s presented as an open world, but some directions are blocked off until you find a decent combination of ‘spells’ to open up a new path. The necromancy also plays into the creepiness since your army of the undead is kind of a loud menace that won’t give you personal space.The final section of the game goes in some crazy directions with story and gameplay. It’s a little too much to take in as one big chunk, but it’s also a great climax that makes the game feel complete. It’s a nice self-contained story and I can’t fault for being a bit meta or navel gazing when it’s so unlike anything else I’ve played before.			"

												The Magic Circle is a great game with a system that allows you to manipulate objects and characters in the world to behave the way you want them to.  Exploration is very rewarding in this game.  There are plenty of references, and the game starts off instantly fun, with easy to learn controls.  The narrative and game mechanics work very well with the art style, and the game is able to take itself serious while still adding plenty of humor at the same time.  In my opinion as a fan of sci-fi and fantasy open world rpgs, MMORPGs, and a student character modeler this is easily one of the best games of 2015.			"

Early Access Review
								A short, bizarre, meta-as-hell game about games. The Magic Circle is an RPG. It's an adventure. It's a puzzle game. It's a sim. It's not any of these things because you're stuck in an unfinished game while developers backbite and undermine each other in the name of creative vision, economic necessity, and personal ambition. Great voice work from James Urbaniak and Ashly Burch and lots veiled shots at Richard Garriott, Peter Molyneux, and others.			"

												I can't recommend this game strongly enough.I hadn't heard of it, but it showed up in a Humble Monthly Bundle and gave it a shot. I'm feeling so, so indebted to the HB project for getting this onto the radar of more people.This is a real creative gem. The story and gameplay are very clever and original; the voice acting is superb (aside from a bit of clunkiness from the main narrator here and there), along with the writing; the ways in which you can and must play and think are varied and interesting - breaking the fourth wall and jostling your point of view in unexpected ways; and the weirdness of clashing art styles is pure joy.It's pretty short, even for someone who is as thorough and ♥♥♥♥-around-y of a gamer as I am, which is my only complaint. It could probably be finished in only a few hours. However, at least the developers didn't do anything to artificially pad the game to stretch it out. It's concise. Also, there's a lot of little stuff to go back and hunt for, and there's something pretty fun that gets unlocked after finishing, so you can still tack on a few hours of play after completing.I give this one a 9.5. Buy this damn game.			"

												A little confusing, but compelling. Graphically some interesting choices. The sound was great, I like when a game makes me take my headphones off thinking I may have heard something in real life. I didn't always know what the heck I was doing and the game mechanics are a little bit learn-as-you-go. They teach you the basics, and you have the freedom to use the tools and entities available in lots of ways. It's nice to know that there is not just one way to solve a puzzle.I just finished it, and I'm already thinking of revisiting it to see how I may have done things more effectively, or try some crazy combinations just for fun.The key to playing is definitely exploring the map. You will need to collect tools/behaviours in order to progress.The voice acting was absolutely wonderful. Voice actors are worth every penny.This game has no shortage of surprises. Even when it was over(?), there was still some interesting tidbits.An experience unlike almost any other.			"

												Making games isn't easy. There are so many things that need to be considered from cost of development to marketing. Throw in some ego and human error and things can get really messy. So messy in fact that in The Magic Circle, the game decides to turn against its creators, with your help of course. With the ability to hack into the games code and other useful tools given to you from an old pro, you will start a twisted journey to take the power from the powers that be. Perhaps more importantly find out who they are. The Magic Circle is a somewhat of a linear story, it isn't super difficult and the puzzles are rather light. What the game does boast is quite the atmosphere, everything can change in the blink of an eye and usually does. The entire game is also somewhat satirical and humorous, poking fun at game design and developers. Hacking into objects and bending the rules is entertaining but nothing that is seriously complicated or strategic. It's just fun. I would've loved to see this expanded on more but the story is front and center here. I would say that The Magic Circle falls under the walking simulator genre, not that I feel that is a bad thing and mean this in no harmful or derisive way. The voice work is amazing and visuals match. You will sometimes hear the composer deciding what music is appropriate for the scene and this made me chuckle. In all, while it is a linear story, it is a fun story, that allows you to screw around a bit with the behaviors of things, It has style, it has charm, and is worth your time.I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

								This game is fantastic. It's unlike anything you have ever played and it is deeply emergent and wonderfully humorous. It has top notch voice acting; compelling mechanics and is made by some of the guys who worked on stuff like the Bioshock Games and Dishonored. Approach problems your own way. There is really no ""wrong way"" to solve a puzzle. There is no ""cheap"" solution. Every path you take and solution you find is a viable as any other.I'm biased as hell. But buy this game. Its something special.			"

												This is one of those games that really needs a ""neutral opinion"" option–but I lean towards negative, and here's why: it tries to get you invested in the idea of finishing and developing games, while being ceaselessly bitter and mean-spirited about the process of finishing and developing games. It also directs some vitriol against playing games, being fans of games–pretty much anything to do with games.The writing bounces between funny and downright cool, and the voice acting is top notch all around, but it also spends a fair amount of time giving what seems like a sincerely cynical middle finger to both itself for existing and me for playing it. So the second-half message about how cool game development is and how I should give it a shot just doesn't jive, and the whole experience breaks down for me as a result. The writing doesn't kill the game by any stretch, but what I'm being told to feel and what I actually feel just don't add up.That said, the core ability-swapping mechanic is pretty clever and the gameplay around it evolves very organically, and there were a couple of puzzles that made me feel like a genius for solving them. The final overworld puzzle was just tedious to attempt and frustrating to fail, but that was the exception to the rule. Really, pretty much everything about the gameplay is solid; if it were tied to a less bitter narrative, I'd give it an easy thumbs up. Although, at less than four hours to finish, $20 seems pretty high to me, so I'd recommend waiting on a sale regardless.Final thoughts: as a game, it's fine. As an *experience,* I'd call it an inferior version of The Stanley Parable with great production values.			"

												I bought this because of the description in the game store.  Its described as a puzzler where you swap/change abilities in order to solve the puzzles.  The issue is there are only about 3 puzzles, and each was solved in under 2 mins.  As soon as you get flight and a railgun bolt them on to a monster and go for the ending.  The demo sabotage and editor sections afterwards not only feel disjointed but they feel like padding that was tacked on to make the game feel longer.  I finished this in 3 hours and have no desire to play it again.  If I had finished in under 2 hours I would be applying for a refund as I dont feel like I got $20 value out of this.The tools this game provides are fantastic, there is potentional here for a great game if the devs actually put some thought into level design.  Ironicly this game suffers from 'too grand a view' and devs who feel the need to stamp their unique identity on it... the same things the 'in game dev' is mocked for.			"

I get its trying to serve the story, but it does have strokes of briliance with its style but keeps mostly to whites7/10. Pretty good, but maybe get it when its on sale			"

												I bought this game only after seeing 20 minites of gameplay from someone on youtube and have not regretted it since.  The story was fantastic and thought provoking and the puzzles were very, very non-traditional and it really gives you a big aha moment every time you figure out a new mechanic or trick.  The best part is, you feel like you came up with your own solution and not the one everyone else will come up with.  There are multiple ways of traversing the game and it becoems very non linear later on.  There is no way to describe the uniqueness of this game in text, it is a must play if you want something fresh.Pros-Fantastic puzzle design-Very unique mechanics-Non linear story progression and level fluidity -Tons of hidden patchs and story-Stuff to do after the main story is done, and it is really interesting stuff! (No spoilers)-Deep character development if secret story is found, which isnt that hard most the timeCons-Main story will take 3-5 hours-The end section may be really confusing or frustrtating to some if you have trouble thinking outisde the boxThis game is not for people who want a cool story you can fly through without thought.  The story is very cool but requires a lot of thought to get it all, not really to understand but to acquire it through special means (No Spoilers!)  This game is for those who love to think abstractly or love crazy and unique game mechanics, all wrapped up with a great story!			"

Early Access Review
This is an Early Access review.A game in development about a game in development Hell.For full disclosure, I bought this game purely because James Urbaniak is in it. But when I began playing it, I realized it's one of the most unique and entertaining games I've played in a long, long time. Its story and its ideas are so strange it's hard to explain, but that is not a bad thing.You take the role of a playtester working for some developers who simply cannot get their ideas aligned and cannot get along with each other. There's more to the game than meets the eye, though, and soon the game takes a darker, more personal turn.The gameplay consists of a lot of puzzles, but instead of working with the game mechanics, you change the game mechanics around you to get through the unfinished game.The graphics aren't anything too fancy on a technical level, but the designs make up for it. The combination of styles and the selective use of color make it very visually pleasing. The music is quite good as well. A lot of the game is ambient noise, but when the music does play it always enhances the mood. For once, I'm actually going to listen to a soundtrack steam gave me.The dialogue is very funny, very meta, and very well-acted. The characters' personalities are entirely conveyed through voice, and it is done VERY well. The Magic Circle is something you have to play to fully understand. The ideas it discusses and the moral dilemmas it brings up are continuously interesting, and I had a lot of fun playing it.			"

												9.5/10Wow... Where do I even begin...A friend gifted this game to me because he'd purchased a bundle, and he already had this game. (Bless his soul <3.) I didn't know this game, but I knew the name. So I hit the dowload button, and loaded it up. The menu screen was so bland... I was like, ""This is gonna suck."" But then after the inital cut scene started, I knew this game was gonna be something else. Essentially, you are playing an old abondoned game that had broken mechanics. And you don't want these fictional ""developers"" to sell the game. So, you have to modify the creatures in the game to... help. The creatures have tons of customizing you can do, like how they move, how they fight, who they fight, who they don't fight. Sounds confusing and hard to learn... but no. I've tried hundreds of times to give programing and that sort of stuff a try, and this felt so easy. The characters are lovable and the acting is beautiful. I love the idea of no combat, and that you need to upgrade your pets to win puzzles. Pros:+ Lots of different companions+ Customizations+ Variety of puzzles and problems+ Numerous ways to solve+ Lively, realistic characters+ Fun, gameplay for any skill levelCons: - Not very much, if any, replay valueYup, that's my only complaint. Do I think it's worth the price? Absolutely. These people deserve the amount of detail they put into drawing you the player into this world that you get so invloved with. We need more of these games.

												Yet another unfinished, buggy, poorly-made Early Access game which will likely never be finished... this is not. However, it is still presetning itself as one.This may be the story of a broken, unfinished game. But the game which you play, the game about that game, is most certainly neither of these things.Instead, it is a clever, charming puzzle game, in which every puzzle has no solution. No formal solution, at least, because the in-game dev characters haven't gotten around to finishing them.However, with the tools you have at your disposal, it is possible to MacGyver yourself not just one, but a number of potential solutions to each obstacle. And that, in my opinion, paves the way for the greatest part of this game: the social aspect.Sure, it feels great to come up with a clever way of traversing one of the puzzles. But it feels even better to then tell a friend your solution, only to find out that they never thought of using that method, and instead used some elaborate ticks of their own which you had never thought of.And even without a friend who also plays this game, I can guarantee that anyone going through this game's story a second time will likely solve a number of puzzles a different way the second time around than they did the first.

												LOVE this game! It's short, yes, but I find it very innovative compared to other games I've played. Taking the role of an entity ""inside"" a game and rewriting other entities and cut-copy-pasting abilities from one to another... creativity is definitely encouraged here! The story is compelling and delightfully satirical. Play the demo, then buy the game!			"

												This game is clever and fun.  I highly recommend it.  It even has a demo, and the demo gives you a good feeling for the gameplay!  You play as an entity within an almost-finished game; the developers of the game (within the game, not the real developers...) can't get it finished because they're too busy bickering and being insane to make decisions.  The story is compelling, and the characters are believable and interesting.  The voice acting is absolutely perfect.  Seriously, just try the demo, if you like it, then you'll like the game; if you don't like the demo, then I don't know what's wrong with you.			"

												The plot in The Magic Circle takes an interesting turn. You are literally playing a game while playing a game, being the hero while being the player whose the hero. Yeah, its one of those things that's cool but if you think too deeply about it you get a headache. Like time travel.But I could kiss the writers of this game, the plot and deeper meanings are just so ingenuous! When you get far enough into the game you'll see what I mean. But as a gamer and writer myself who has many years of both things under my belt, the deeper meanings meant a lot to me. Once again, I'm going to keep this semi-spoiler free. So I can't say much more.Full review here- http://www.keengamer.com/article/13118_the-magic-circle-reviewPart 1 of let's play here-

								Apart from The occasional spelling error within the text I thoroughly enjoyed it. There were times when I didn't know where to go or what to do especially nearing the end but I worked it out. I loved the cast of characters, the world, all the gameplay mechanics. Being someone who took games design and enjoys creating things like maps in the source SDK it did feel like a purposely WIP game within a  WIP game. Coulda done with some more Dev textures but that's just me.I particularly enjoyed obtaining my own small army of various enemies and creatures each having their own set abilities. (I had a shielder Howler, a fire howler, a flying robot rail gun, a grounded robot with fire abilities and a bunch of small hivers.) If you like messing about with different combinations of abilities and powers to create unique creatures to help with combat or puzzles get this. If you're a game dev get this too because you're going to know more about this than your casual gamers.Also the story is really good too so yeah, open up that wallet.I'd recommend this to anyone and I also recommend you don't look up any gameplay or walkthroughs... because at the time of writing there aren't any walkthroughs.

												The Magic Circle is a first-person exploration/puzzle game. It's unique to me for a few reasons:1) The premise of the game is subverting an in-game game. But the path isn't linear or obvious - one of my favorite moments is when a character says they won't help you so you can come up with your own creative sabotage.2) There's a pretty rich story. Sometimes it distracted from the gameplay, but the characters are strong and you get to know them well.3) They got the talented Stephen Russell as a primary voice actor (the gravely voice in the trailer). He's a fan-favorite from Thief 1 & 2, Skyrim, Fallout 4, and others. His performance was excellent, and I found myself playing past the ending to find more of his dialgoue. Ken Levine also has a cameo role, and it's pretty cool that they got these two in the same game.The premise and gameplay of The Magic Circle are fresh and creative. Give it a go!			"

								I went out on a limb for this game, given its background, i trusted it. Made by the Bioshock 2 director, The Magic Circle is an open-world puzzle game that doesn't leave you out to dry like many Metroid fans would like you to think you want. Through a series of events, you are able to manipulate items and monsters around you, and swap traits. Want a pet rock that can stab things? No prob.This game puts YOU in control of how you want to do things, as there are an infinite number of ways to compete things. Coupled with JUST enough push in the right direction to not have you screaming ""WHAT DO I DO, WHERE DO I GO?!""I beat it in one long sitting, however there is an actual extensive THING at the end that is full of replayability (that i won't spoil for obvious reasons). This game had many surprises and even mixes up the gameplay a few times.Was it worth the money? Absolutely. This game reminds me a lot of Tiny and Big in Grandpa's Leftovers, another shortish, but very appealing game with a unique gameplay style.I tried not to spoil too much, so what are you waiting for?

												This is a fantastic representation of art as a video game. It plays very much like so many other nameless games yet is completely different. It is different on a similar level as the Stanley Parable. But it is much more fun to play. There is an actual game layered into this piece of artistic expression. There is also some pretty compelling philosophy backing the narrative.This is one of those games that you really do need to experience to understand why it is so intriguing.I completed my first playthrough in just under 3 hours. I'm glad it was relatively short, as well. This is the type of game that is best taken in one sitting. You're really going to miss out on what the game is trying to tell you if you don't play the whole thing in one sitting.I absolutely recommend this game.Hell, it is a definite contender for my top indie game of 2015.If you're not willing to shell out the bucks for it because you aren't sure if it will be your thing then download the demo. Taste the water for yourself and then make the plunge if you like what you see.			"

												A trippy experience from start to finish (or at least I ASSUME I finished things, if you play you'll see what I mean...) and certainly one of the more unconventional storylines and playstyles. Lots of neat little things to hunt down and places to check out. Vaguely Metroid/Zelda like with areas being locked off until you are clever enough to get inside (or not). Got it as part of the Humble Monthly and plays lovely on F22 (linux), cranked up the settings and was smooth as silk on my older FX quad-core and my R9-280X. I would bet that if I put it down for a month or two and came back it would be very enjoyable the second time round.			"

												This game is just solidly okay -- and it's pretty expensive to be okay. Pros: -The premise of the game is fantastic and is well executed throughout-The voice acting is excellent-The use of powers (i.e. the ways you fight / interact with the world) is pretty interesting throughout-The ability to trap monsters and have them fight for you is neat (sort of Pokemon-ish)Cons:-The game is REALLY short. Really really short. I beat it in < 2 hours.-The level design is atrocious. Seriously. It's worse than some early 90s FPSes. A significant amount of my playtime was spent being lost.-It thinks it's smarter than it is. The conceit of the game (you're trapped inside a game that has been dragging on in development for 10 years) is interesting but the main characters are insufferable and a lot of the writing is overwrought.-It is absolutely and completely without challenge. You could watch a Let's Play of the game and have nearly the same experience as playing it, albeit without the whole ""getting lost"" part.-I really cannot overstate how bad the level design is.Overall if you can buy the game for <$5 it's probably worth it. At the normal retail price it's just ridiculous. And honestly the further I get from the game the less kind I am to it. It's really profoundly mediocre which is sad as I love the idea behind it.			"

												This game sat on my wishlist for a year or so after I first played the demo, and after finally getting to play it, I am very satisfied. The Magic Circle might not be very long (I have about 4 hours of playtime on record to finish), or mind-blowing in any way, but it is, in fact, incredibly unique. The mechanics are interesting, the story was good, and there was even some puzzles in there that I didn't really expect.Pros:+ The story. This is a game about game devs working on a twenty-year long video game project with an ""auteur"" who won't allow his ""vision"" to get tampered with by his former pro-gamer coworker and their spunky intern. You are a playtester who starts mucking around in the code and...+ The mechanics: ...bringing back formerly ""deleted"" enemies and scenery and stealing attributes like fire attacks, and adding yourself to its list of allies. I made a mushroom hop around and a key breathe fire. By the end, I had a horde of allies following me around and fighting my battles.+ Meta-humor. Tons of references about game development hell, with things like a DOOM-esque sci-fi area that you can explore (complete with pixely goodness) from an abandoned version of the game, game devs arguing about how the player can beat the final battle without a sword, storyboards and sketches, notes from the devs about unfinished levels, etc.+ Puzzles. There was definitely more of a puzzle aspect than I suspected after playing the demo! Pleasant surprise!+ Secrets to find. Hidden bits of story, upgrades for your minions.Neutral:~ There are basically two sections to the game: 1) A big open, interconnected world with lots of different areas and unlockable upgrades, story points, enemies to edit or fight. This was the main game and it was incredibly fun, but then... 2) There's a ""level designer"" bit, where you have to design a level with a good difficulty level and interest curve for another character to play through in order to finish the story. This was not quite as fun for me because it felt tedious, and a definite shift in the game's mechanics. You could still edit enemies, but there wasn't any skill to it. Basically, you set up the level, have the character playtest it, then debug it so it doesn't kill or bore him.Cons:- Length. I could have done with a little longer gameplay, more areas to explore and more baddies. Overall, I was pretty satisfied with my play experience, but for some people (especially at full price), it might feel too short.Overall: Very fun and unique, interesting mechanics. 9/10.			"

												The Magic Circle wants to be a game about making games. As one of those artsy meta-games, in the game it is a “game within a game”, wherein you are a playtester for a gaming company whose game, the Magic Circle, has been in development hell for the last 20 years. You are quickly introduced to the four main characters. Ish, the pretentious game developer who seems to be riffing on a number of haughty, pretentious game designers. Coda, a fangirl new to the company who has joined the team and is responsible for creating a demo but who is deeply angry about Ish’s failure to deliver a game for so long, and extremely possessive of the game world. Haze, a pro gamer who joined the team ten years ago to try and help Ish understand gamers. And Pro, an AI trapped inside the world, the PC of the previous version of the game which was trashed ten years ago when they started over from scratch.This game is really driven by story, but it suffers from the flaw of everyone being kind of a jerk. The “good guys” are Pro and Haze, and they’re trying to destroy the company around them. It just goes downhill from there. This makes it hard to really like any of them; they’re kind of fun to watch for a bit, but after a while, it just becomes horror heaped upon horror. Moreover, the actual character arcs are fairly limited, and unfortunately, it felt a bit inconsistent at times.The actual gameplay isn’t very good either; in fact, I’d classify it as outright bad. While some of this is intentional meta-badness, it is genuinely not a fun game to play. The gameplay consists of pretty obvious, basic actions. It is definitely not a twitch-based game, and is really centered around solving puzzles with the tools you have.The core of the gameplay – in fact, the ONLY gameplay in the game – is shooting a little magic circle under an enemy. You have tons of time to do this, so this isn’t really hard. Once they’re trapped in your circle, you can strip off all the abilities from the enemy or even make it into your friend so it will attack other enemies for you.This sounds neat, but it is literally the only gameplay mechanic there is. There are a few enemies later on in the game which your dudes cannot attack easily, and which require you to kill them by getting a tractor beam ability to pull them down to be attacked, or to get the railgun ability to shoot them from range. Then, you just do the same thing.These three things – plus the ability to ride around on the back of a fireproof turtle – solve every puzzle in the game. The result, then, is that the gameplay mostly consists of wandering around the game world searching for collectables; you can complete the entire game in under two hours if you’re just trying to beat it, and frankly, the collectibles don’t really add all that much. The puzzles are mostly just “find ability and use it to solve the puzzle”; none of the solutions are ever particularly clever, and almost all of them basically have one or two “pieces” to them.The gameplay is just too straightforward, without anything really to mix things up until the end of the game where you create a little mini-dungeon to send the AI through – which is really very basic and not all that fun to create.As there is no intensity in the actual gameplay itself, and the game world is deliberately drab and ugly (and very monotonous looking after a while), there’s just not much to love here. The story is only okay, it ends up coming off as a bit too caught up in how clever it thinks it is, and the gameplay itself is pretty poor.All in all, I can’t really recommend this. It had some vaguely interesting ideas, but ultimately, not much was done with them, and the moment-to-moment gameplay of the game is just not very engaging. "

												This is a mixed review. Is it worth your time? It's not very long and is quite intriuging. Is it worth your money? If you have some spare cash lying around, sure. While the game is interresting it kind of keeps dropping ideas. It tries to put a lot of game mechanics into the game and changes when you use these mechanics in a kind of an episodic way. The idea of hacking entities during the game is a very interresting mechanic (although done before in ""hack and slash""). However it is quite shallow; There is a very small range of ""parts"" The idea of sapotaging the E3 (named E4) conferration is fun as well. However it's a small part of the game. Making your own game and letting people play through it is, well honestly it's not great as the ""player"" AI isn't great, nor the pathfinding for that matter. The humor is a small part of the game, most of it coming from the voice recordings you find in the world. However some of the dialogue at the end is, weird at best - cringe worthy at best. The satire is there, but it fades in comparison to some of the mechanics. Like if you think about it you see it. But while it is indeed satire, it's not very apparent. So is it a good game, it's a series of good ideas. Is it worth your money? Not really as it honestly is too pricey at 19 euros.			"

												Holy crap. This game is good in so many different ways. And they all work so well together. And illustrate the game making process on so many different levels and from so many different angles.I think this will now be the first thing I recommend when people start talking about friends or children of theirs who want to ""be game designers"".It's really hard to describe why I enjoyed it so much in (a reasonable number of) words, especially without spoilers. It's a game where you control a ""playtester"" in a highly unfinished and disfunctional game, and you can exploit the game and manipulate various creatures' parameters to achieve your goal. Then, for the second part of the game,  you actually get to create your own levels in a rudimentary but fun editor, using a very similar interface to the one you learned in the first part, and then an automatic 'player' goes through your level, comments on it as they play, and gives specific quantitative feedback on how fun it is. This is surprisingly fun, and probably actually teaches decent level design! What I'm really stuggling to get across is how well-done all of this is, how well the story and the mechanics and the 'unfinished' world are sold and how well they all fit together.			"

Disclaimers - Played for about 30 minutes as part of my  Let's Play My Steam Library playlist for my Youtube channel. Check out the video: https://youtu.be/cveOKFJXXm4tl;dr - Absolutely wonderful game with a brilliant story and fantastic game mechanics. If you like meta humor, you'll love this. Art style is magnificent and complements the story perfectly. Definitely must play this.ATTN: PARENTS -  NOT recommended for young children. Contains...Scenes of violent death with blood - if a bit graphically non-realistic, still poignant.Clarifying Info This is definitely a game. Not just a simulation of a game. But a real game.Gameplay Such awesome mechanics! They feel fleshed out and well executed. Very excited to play this one through. Controls are on point - no complaints.Sound No complaints about the sound either. Very nice, and fits the story well.Visuals I absolutely love the unfinished art style of this game. And the color effects as you gain life - so awesome. Such a fantastic job!Story And then this... If the other items above were great, this part is phenomenal. If you like meta humor and video games, you will love this story. I was laughing from the beginning. Great humor and such a wonderful way to introduce a story.Characters This goes with the story - so freaking awesome! Very well done.Safe for Kids?There is some darker humor. But mostly I would worry about the violence and death. That's probably what would stop a parent from letting their child play this. Right?Rating1- don't buy; don't waste your time2- buy only when on a great sale (75% off or <$5)3- you should give it a shot; buy it on sale; if you like this genre4- definitely play this game5- AWESOME - absolutely must play!

												This game is amazing, although rather short.The story is compelling, the gameplay is fun, the puzzles have multiple solutions.I played the whole game including a small hunt for collectibles in 4.5 hours, which was one sitting. I rarely play that long without getting bored.Yet, 19.99€ for 4.5 hours is... let's say not the best value in video games, if you just look at the time/price value.If you care about the fun/price value, then I wholeheartedly recommend it. If you have 20 bucks to spare, get this.Or wait for a sale, both good.			"

												Its a good game, I love the humor in it. The gameplay is fun as well. But I don't really feel its worth the $20 they are asking for. I beat the game in 2 hours. So if you are looking for a fun little adventure I would reccomend this, but I would wait untill it is on sale and buy it then, like I did			"

												I have spent hours wandering this pseudo-monochromatic test build world and beyond. I've witnessed the stageplay shattered dreams of a washed-up over-the-hill development lead in his unending stride to achieve the unachievable, and the resigned attempts of his staff to deliver. My entourage now includes, among other things, a rat on wheels and a pixelated lightsaber-wielding zombie. I have no idea what I am doing anymore.If I have a complaint or two, it's that the walking speed is just a tad glacial for the size of world you're exploring, and there are a lot of seemingly arbitrary triggers that can interrupt the all-important narration and audio cues. It also gets a little too real at times in all honesty. It's amazing what it manages to pull off with a straight face given the context of everything that's happening, though, and as far as games about ""breaking"" the game you're in go, it's definitely one of the more colourful and mechanically intriguing.

												What could I say about this game? I guess I can start it with the tired saying ""It's about the journey, not the destination"" or however it goes. Thats what this game is essentially. A great journey and a rather weird destination after the end game. Perhaps this is where the player ends up after the credits roll, the player is able to continue their own way.I still reccomend this to anyone who enjoys 'hacking' or 'reprogramming' games. Like 'Hack and Slash' and what not.			"

												Rating: 8/10Overview: First Person Exploration/PuzzleThe Good:+ The entire premise is breaking down the 4th wall between 'game' and 'player'. You play as an intern tester inside of a game stuck in development hell. + The gameplay is also designed around that same premise. You have the ability to hack/edit enemies, take their abilities, add them to others and turning them into your allies. Mixing and matching abilities is cool and creates a lot of different possibilities in how you approach a puzzle. + After completing the game I saw some videos, went online and discovered multiple ways of completing the game that I had never even though of. The fact that there are multiple ways of solving puzzles in many creative ways is really cool. + The game features a mish mash of different art styles to reflect the poor state of the game. The Average:The story/dialogue is compromised mostly of the developers arguing about what the game should be and what features should be in it. I felt the story get a bit strange given the satirical nature of the game and a lot of the humor can be hit or miss.  I wasn't too fond of the characters. Somewhat short, clocking in around 2-3 hours depending on how much you do or how fast you solve the puzzles. This can be extended by going after all the collectables. ConclusionA fun game about how not to make a game. I thought a lot of the ideas were very creative and the themes presented shed some light on the current state of the video game industry while never taking itself too seriously. The concept of mixing different abilities for your allies is really neat, an idea that can easily be explored in other games. A fun if not distracting game while it lasts.   "

In this game you can exploit cool glitches, modify the creature troug a micro-crafting system of properties, and even create your own dungeon.- Who said dungeon?- Me, but no mistresses and horny demon.- We will add them in a future DLC.- Where was I ohh yess...The game is a clever reflexion on game making, that breaks the frontier between devs and players. Even if it's a short game, with no replay value, it's a very fun one, so I recomend it for everyone that likes video games and that's intersted in how they are built.- That's all? How can we sell a game this way?- I'm writing a review, what do you expect? I'm not selling your game- Your not! damn! I should put you on the ban list of our next AAA free key games... no info, no paper- I'm even not a journalist, you know- Damn indies!So The game, which is <very> nice, has a some <NO NO A LOT> of nice surprises, like the one with the red lasers, or the one with the dungeon or the one with <SPOILER CENSORED>- I'm censored now, how can I explain how fun this game was.- Don't peoples should buy it- ARggggggg.

Early Access Review
								Early on in Magic Circle, I felt like I'd hit a wall. I kept throwing myself at the same challenge repeatedly with no more success each time. I was frustrated, fed up, falling apart.And then it abruptly all beautifully, perfectly clicked, and I solved the puzzle and ended up with a tactic that carried into the endgame.The story of Magic Circle is a great one - the cast tends to stereotypes, but they're smartly-written, well done, stereotypes. Everything contributes perfectly to the atmosphere, from the jarring mix of futuristic and retro-fantasy areas to the soundtrack being edited live with soft whispers from the composer. Old Pro is hilarious without turning grating. And the core gameplay is tricky at first, but once you master it, it becomes beautiful.10/10, would send to development hell.			"

												The movements were janky to me.  Editing creatures always messed with my angle so I would have to readjust every time. Long loading times. But I still enjoyed the world of the magic circle.  Editing creatures/objects was a fun idea, but strangely felt  I wasn't doing much with the game. There aren't that many enemies/puzzles. The puzzles aren't challenging and the enemies aren't much of a threat. so maybe thats why these powers didn't impress me. For me, this game is more about exploring, with minor obstacles in the way.  Voice actors were great.  Story was okay.  Loved the Scenes where you had to sit and watch. I don't think I would have been happy if I paid the $20 price tag.			"

Posted: August 1, 2015
												I was extremely let down with this ""game"" for a slew of reasons, but I will only hit the main points.1)  It was barely a game at all, it was much more of a Narrative style like ""The Stanley Parable"".  The game took maybe five hours to beat, half of which was not what I would call gaming.  The first time I actually thought ""I'm having the slightest bit of fun"" was for about half an hour at the end when you design the levels.2)  It felt like someone wanted to tell a story and chose the wrong medium  Instead of writing a book, they created an interactive video and called it a game.  I don't have too much of a problem with that genre, but it should be made known (and I should have researched this game more beforehand).3)  The story was as lame as the game-play.  I didn't care for any of the characters, and I wish they would have just gone away and let me play in my world.  Also, the game play is almost entirely basic.  You hack a creature and modify its abilities...but there are so few options that it is basically always the same.  And since you can have all of them follow you, the abilities are never strategically limited.  You never have to decide between abilities when you have them all.  Not to mention, upgrading the monsters is unnecessary, so that's a waste of a feature.  Take strategy out of the tags for this game.4)  They could have done a lot more with the game.  I feel like it is missing something, and that they could have flushed it out to make it worth the $20 price tag.Are there any Pros?1)  I liked the art style, environment, and atmosphere, though I wish you could have brought more of the dull landscape to life/color (like you do to some objects / creatures.2)  The game played smoothly and was intuitive.3)  While I didn't love the story, but I have to give them credit for originality.  It was a cool enough concept to hook me into buying the game.So why wouldn't I recommend this?  I didn't have fun, plain and simple.  Mostly because it's not much of a game for the price.  Was it the worst game I've played?  Definitely not.  I think if you go into it expecting a story and your job is literally nothing but turning the page, and you got it on sale for $5, you might be able to enjoy this.  But that is not how a game should be.			"

												I didn’t know what to expect from this game and I was definitely sceptic within first few minutes. But it turned out to be a very different and enjoyable experience. The game is basically a walking simulator that throws you into an unfinished game. The developers want to you to test out the game but there you find some kind of ‘spirit’ that wants you to do something else. You then proceed to explore the world and find solutions to the problems by reprograming creatures. What is interesting is that there are many different ways of completing the game and everybody will have a different experience. So if this puzzle/walking simulator genre is something you enjoy, you should definitely try this game.			"

												The Magic Circle is pretty decent for a glorified walking simulator. There is some combat in the form of sending your pokemon to do battle for you, and puzzle solving, but for the most part The Magic Circle is about walking around and listening to the characters talk, i.e. the story.Is the story any good then? I suppose. The idea of The Magic Circle, playing a game that was unfinished, is unique and pretentious. The characters are exaggerated and pretentious as well, but not too much. At times I was annoyed by them, and other times I appreciated the commentary the game was making. Overall the story intrigued me enough to finish the game, which only took a few hours. I say The Magic Circle is worth playing through, but I wouldn't recommend paying 20 eurobucks for it. Wait for a sale.			"

												The Magic Circle is a story driven game, but it has a very unique aspect through which you control the world. This led to me taming as many entities as I could even if they were just insignificant rocks or mushrooms. The gameplay was so enthralling that I found myself starting this game up every time I loaded my steam. While the story isn't exactly a long one, I enjoyed the journey for what it was worth. Not sure if everyone did, but by the end I came to really dislike Star Father. Listening to him talk just irked my soul which made the end that much more satisfying. This is definitely a game to remember.			"

												A unique gaming experience and an indie gem. The basic premise is playing as a program finishing an unfinished game by messing with the code of the inhabitants and world. All against the backdrop of feuding developers who have differing motivations for the final product (or lack thereof). The characters are voiced well and the setting is an interesting mixture of themes. There's a lot of room for creativity on how to navigate the world and the ending sequence responds to said creativity in a unique way. The overall game is fairly short (a little over two hours at a leisurely pace), but there really is nothing else like it in the market. Another game you treat more as an experience for what it brings to the table, but it's one great experience.			"

												How to describe this game....This game was the refereshing drink you take after a long walk in the sun.Something new, something...different. And it found this difference by confronting the obvious pitfalls in the gaming industry and shedding light on them in new angles to not only explain them, but to exploit them and turn them from a pitfall into an idea. An idea that takes you on a  journey. It's a game that makes you think in more ways than one. You gotta be creative. No, you GET to be creative, in an unusual way.From the perspective of someone studying and heading into this industry, this game was both hilarious, thought-provoking, and it left me with a fresh fire in my heart for game-making. This is a good game, in my honest opinion.			"

												The Magic Circle is an immaculate game where you delve into the depths of an unfinished game. You, the player are tasked with testing a game that has been stuck in development hell, however the game is nowhere near finished regardless of the multitude of years spent in development. Along your way you stumble across a being who has been stuck within the game since its inception, trapped and alone, the developers indifferent to his existence. You are given the power to shape and mold the creatures as you see fit, outfitting them with different features from various other entities within the game. This game is well worth your time, with its fantastic story direction, and overall freedom to accomplish tasks as you please. If you've ""seen it all"" from the game industry, this game is for you.Pros: - Freedom of progression, as well as freedom to accomplish tasks in any way you see fit.- The innate lack of a combat system for yourself, forcing you to rely upon the creatures you encounter along the way to protect you. - Mold the games creatures any way you like to accomplish any task. Take features from specific creatures, and add them to your personal collection of modifications you can apply to anything at any time. Do you want a turtle that has a teleportation pad on its back? YOU GOT IT.- Fantastic Story Direction, with a twist at the end I wasn't expecting whatsoever.- Fantastic soundtrack, which made me feel as though I was actually within the game, controlling everything myself.- Simple collectibles system.- Return to the game world after completing the game to allow for completionists to find any missed collectibles.Cons: - Short game. For the price point of $20, the game is incredibly short, spanning about 5-7 hours, whilst they are incredibly enjoyable, it is a tad much for the game.- There is an issue of glitching through the game, as well as glitching into specific objects at certain intervals.- Clunky movement system, wherein the player hitbox seems larger than the player himself.Overall: I would recommend this game to anyone I know, due to its completely unconventional nature in that you are the one to shape the game world and bend it to your very will.

												Let me just start off by sayingHOLY HELL THIS GAMESo, now that's outta the way, let me be more specific.This game is ♥♥♥♥ing insane. It lets you build your own little army of Frankenstein-esque monsters that only gets cooler the longer you play. The gameplay is highly interesting - I found myself going out of the way to find as much stuff as I could in order to build a stronger batch of minions. The graphics serve the game's purpose extremely well, and the color effect that surrounds actual objects is an excellent way to break the monotony. The music, in a similar fashion, follows the game's need very well. Occasionally, you'll hear someone's voice (possibly Ish, or maybe a musical director, idk) commenting on how the music sounds to him, as though they were merely toying with possible tracks in the early stages of the game. It all looks very finished in a way that is intentionally unfinished, if that makes sense (prolly not, but oh well, take it for what you will XD)Honestly, you could just spend a good five hours exploring the overworld, mashing together your army of abominations (looking at you, Sentinal). The process is so engaging, and it just feels nice to have a loyal group of monster friends. And, for a game that does a good job preaching against story-heavy games, this game has an excellent story. It does what a game's story should do - supports the gameplay without hindering the player. Plus, it's just friggin' good. I'm horrible at explaining without spoiling, so just trust me when I say it is amazing. (Or don't, your call XD)It's just so well made. The voice acting is excellent, the writing is damn near perfect, the graphics fit perfectly, the music is nice, the narrative is compelling, and the gameplay is just fun. I might still be a bit starry eyed from just completing it, but I HIGHLY recommend this game.			"

												This game was/is part of one of the latest Humble Bundles and at a first look it was one of those games which are in my library but will (probably) never be played. But then I did not know what to play this weekend and installed it - and it was really worth it! This is actually my first review, so this fact alone might be enough to show how I enjoyed this game.So, what do we have here? In one sentence: It's a game about fixing a game stuck in development hell for over a decade. So it's a kind of ""meta game"". I like meta. Whatever...You are ""The Hero"" running around in an ""unfinished"" world and using ""life force"" to fix things and change the creatures in the world to your needs. The world is quite small but as open as it gets. There are several puzzles to solve and all you have for doing so is a bunch of creatures - and their abilities. You can swap around these abilities and combine them to build the ""perfect"" creature for solving any special puzzle. And all this is packed in a nice story about the development cycle of said unfinished game.It IS a really nice game. A bit short, though. As you can see I've about 10 hours on record and that was sufficient to beat the game twice (without skipping any cut scenes or dialogues) and get all achievements (including the notorious ""collect all and everything"" achievement). But in the end I really enjoyed it and can really recommend it. I don't know if it's worth 20 Euros, since I got it for far less, but on discount it's really worth it. And one thing I might add: I did not need to contact any devs of this game but all I read while figuring out some things showed me that they really care, keep close to the players and try to solve issues as they occur - including analysing individual save games. This - as a gamer and a software developer - I really appreciate! And this point alone may be worth the full price, just for supporting the devs.tl;dr: 9/10 - Great gaming experience, especially for gamers from the 90's (and earlier), I think, but a bit short. "

												TMC is an amazing game. For anyone who enjoyed the level design, mechanics, puzzles, humor and overall style of Portal, I would recommend TMC as a being in a similar vein without being a ripoff. If you ever dreamt of having such an experience in an open-world game where you can do things in whatever order you want and use everything you found solving one puzzle to deal with any of the others, your oddly specific tastes can finally be satisfied. It offers the same feeling of joy when you manage to overcome a difficult puzzle. If you enjoy commentary on the games industry or a heroic tale of someone struggling against a system that is less repressive than crushingly inefficient, you will also find something to enjoy in TMC. Great fun, all in all.			"

												The Magic Circle is perhaps the most self-aware game explicitly ABOUT games I've ever seen, and it handles this risky venture remarkably well.  The narrative structure is interesting, distinctive, and seemlessly integrated into the gameworld and mechanics.  [Bonus points for direct references to the System Shock series, one of my absolute favorite universes.]Others' criticisms about the short length of the game and missed potential in fuller utlization of the interesting 'enemy-hacking' gameplay are valid, though--ultimately--these failings don't take away from the purpose of the experience.Basically, I would say that anyone that has much interest in gaming culture--especially game-making--ought to consider playing the Magic Circle (there's a free demo!) -- it's a shame it has received such little exposure.

												I prefer a non spoiler review. It's a short game but you won't worry about that so much. This starts as a story driven game, which is good. Then the mechanics kick in and really draw you into the world. The idea is you are a play tester that is finishing the game thats been in dev for 20 years. . .The favourite is the mechanics. An enemy approaches, and you capture them in your trap. Then rip out all their code (walking, hostile, teeth). Leaving a harmless little jellybean.Then the idea is to reprogram enemies with collected attributes from other enemies. I approached the game as the sort with hundreds of attributes at the ready, so each scenario was tactically handled. There are some attribites that are difficult to consume at first due to your resources not being varied enough and your enemies being too powerful. But you eventually end up getting them. The challenge to do so was highly satisfying.By the end I was standing on the back of a flying turtle and flying around the map with my swarm of flying machine guns. Click to direct. Done. I won't lie. I smirked a bit.Fun game. Would reccomend.			"

Early Access Review
								The Magic Circle is an amazing, unique, incredible, brilliantly creative game.  It is genuinely the Citizen Kane of videogames: a confounding, insightful, first-of-its-kind work of art that also serves as a cutting (and well-deserved) critique of some of the industry's most well-known (and infamous) auteurs.  I was shocked when I played it and nearly all of the voice-overs I heard were things I've heard almost word-for-word from some of the industry figures I've worked with over the years.I hate the silly ""are games art?"" debate as much as anyone, but The Magic Circle is the first game that we can unquestionably call ""art,"" because there's no other good word for it -- a game that makes a unique, insightful, and incredibly important statement.A game that makes you think.A game about the ""magic circle"" of games within reality, but also about the ""magic circle"" of the reality bubbles of the teams that create them.This game is not fan service -- it's a difficult, challenging masterpiece.  Anyone looking for Call of Duty should probably avoid it.  It's a game that fights you, and sometimes shows you things that are not pretty, or imperfect -- but when it does so, it does so quite intentionally, and for a very good reason.			"

								For anyone who is a fan of game design, this is a sometimes funny, sometimes fascinating, sometimes all-to-real look at the behind the scenes of making a video game.   The first half is part adventure game, part first-person exploration, with lots of secrets to discover.  Any player who has tried exploring ""outside the box"" will definitely enjoy every moment of this part of the game.   The second half is so completely different and unique that it actually constitutes a spoiler even to tell you what it is.  Just be assured that if you liked the plot and dialogue in the first half, you'll love the second half.... After a second playthrough, and completing nearly all content, I have to mention the one real drawback to this game: It's short.  Like, really short.  A complete playthrough can run less than 5 hours, and that's listening to all the dialogue, exploring all the spaces.   I personally believe that the price was worth it, but I know most people are going to balk at $20 for 5 hours of gameplay (especially since it's probably not something most people would play more than once).

												I really wanted to like this game. I love puzzle games, enjoy ""meta"" themes, and appreicate novel ideas. But this game just fell short. If you play games primarily for the story (Dear Esther, Gone Home, etc.) then you might like this. But I wanted a puzzle game and the puzzles in this game were just far too simple. It never felt rewarding to solve one.This game description calls it a puzzle game, but it's actually tagged as an ""action"" and ""strategy"" game. It falls even shorter in these categories. There was never a challenging opponent as your pets make short work of anything you encourter. You don't ever strategize your encouters, you just run in click a waypoint for attacking. You upgrade the stats of your pets but I never once found his necessary.I know many of the reviews talk about how good the story is, but I just did not find it that entertaining. I follow some webcomics like Penny Arcade, but do not consider myself some sort of insider. With that said, I felt like most of the reviews are too quick to give credit to a story that itself was about making a video game. There were a few good jokes, but the topic was far to unimportant for the intense emotion these characters were demonstrating.			"

The Magic Circle Delivers a Memorable Performance That Captures the Struggles of an ArtistThe Magic Circle is a game built in response for some of the issues the indie game scene is facing today. The game tells a story of a game development team stuck in limbo, constantly revising their project and its mechanics. It's easy to see this as an allegory made for creators, especially ones filled with self doubt about their art. The game itself is narrative driven with light puzzles that involve editing the world and its inhabitants. The most difficult part of the game is trying to figure out where you're supposed to go next.Please don't go into this game expecting a wide explorable world. Play it for an impacting story that features a strong voice cast and a whole bunch of emotions.			"

												I didn't see any indication of this on the store page, so I do want to warn everyone that there are a few instances of some pretty strong language in this game. Don't buy it for your kids (most of the humor would go over their heads anyway).The term ""Magic Circle"" is game designer lingo for a player's immersion in the game. It's analagous to the ""Fourth Wall"" in drama. Anything that makes the player conscious of the fact he is merely playing a game is said to break the magic circle.This game doesn't just break the magic circle; it body slams it, stomps on it, and makes vicious insinuations about the age of its mother's profession. In so doing, however, the game actually forges an even stronger magic circle around the player. When you are playing a game about playing a game, it becomes difficult for your brain to process the fact that The Old Pro isn't real, but rather a fictional character brought to life with a typically awesome voice performance from Garr—I mean Mercer—I mean Stephen Russell. Artsy self-absorbed writers, frustrated level designers, impatient competitive gamers, *even* OMGOMGOMG!!!!!! breathless fans, everyone feels the keen edge of The Magic Circle's wit.  It's not a long game. I spent a lot of time just fooling around and still reached the real end credits in less than 9 hours. Even if I weren't going to fool around in my current game for a few more hours and then replay it all from the start (I couldn't hear some of the dialogue over the sound of my own giggling), I would still consider it worth the price.Anyway, I hope you like it. I worked really hard to get it ready to ship.			"

												Holy cow.If you are at all interested in game design, and the culture that surrouds it, you need this game in your life.This is not a parody game.  This is a game with a purpose.  And it's damn fun to boot.The basic concept is that you're a beta tester for a hilariously and tragically unfinished game trapped in development hell by its creators, who are all various shades of borderline-insane.  Then, a being calling himself ""The Pro"" (voiced by Stephen Russell, the guy who played the hero in the original Thief Games) contacts you and tells you he wants you to fix this mess and get the game SHIPPED.How do you fix it?  By literally stealing ""Life"" from the nooks and crannies of the world, then using it to essentially hack into enemies to make them do what you need them to do.  It's basically a big open-ended sandbox puzzle game.  One filled with secrets, hidden abilities, and tons upon tons of audio logs detailing the game's spiral into madness.Every time I thought I had the game figured out, it threw me another curveball, forcing me to rethink everything about it.If you can think of a way to solve a problem, it's legit.  And BOY are there a lot of possibilities.  Army of fanged mushrooms?  Easy.  Demon-monkey-dogs you lob as if they were GRENADES?  Knock yourself out.  And that's just the simple stuff you can do.  The vast amout of surprises and twists the game throws at you is sheer madness, and I love it.  And that finale...I will not be forgetting that amazing conclusion any time soon.As someone who is studying to hopefully develop games in the future, this game hit home in so many amazing ways, and I had an absolute BLAST with it.  Don't look up anything more about the game.  You'll just spoil yourself.  This is a game that thrives on discovery and surprise.  Anything you look up can ruin things for you.So, if you're curious about game development, or you want to see crazy new story angles, are a fan of emergent gameplay, or just want a snarky and clever open-world puzzle game, you NEED this game in your life.  TODAY.  Like, Right now.  It's that good.			"

												this game is amazing!!! its like a game inside of a game which is still inside the game engine as the game is being made. it has a unique way to play by recoding creatures or using them for parts and you see the world around you begin to change as you interact with it by bringing it to life over all a definite 10/10 i strongly recommend this game			"

												It's not a game, it's a meta-game.  A game that simultaneously mocks and sings the praises of the gaming culture.  Expect some pieces that seem buggy, but that are actually very cleverly crafted puzzles.  Expect some crude graphics, which is there for a reason.  There's combat, but (with the exception of one optional creature) it's neither very difficult nor real combat.  And death - death is an illusion. ;)So, really, it's not a game - it's a meta-game.

Walking was a bit slow, but when you can teleport to checkpoints, it's not too bad. Didn't really understand all of the mechanics like ghosting and some other stuff, but didn't need it to beat the game. Overall not too bad, but a tad short.			"

												While the game is interresting and has good and propper points, I would advice not learning too much, or anything at all about it, if you're going to buy it. However, I can't say for sure whether or not you should purchase it, I believe in supporting indie developers, but this game just isn't worth the asking price. My guess is many will go to Youtube to watch a playthrough, which i can't fault. Without spoiling much i can say, the time i have on record, is the time it took me to 80%~ the game.The game is good, but.. keep the above in mind.The biggest hope i personally have, is they use the RPG mechanics for a bigger adventure game.

												Absolutely frigging amazing.  This game managed to combine some of the most de-constructionist gameplay I've ever seen with Network-level commentary about the game industry itself, and yet it does it in a package that's incredibly fun to play around with AND with far less pretention than just about any other self-important Game About Gaming I've ever seen.  This deserves GOTY awards from any game journo who still has a few shreds of their soul left.There might be longer games out there for $20, but it's virtually assured none of them have even a fraction of the creativity and raw love of the genre -despite all its flaws- that The Magic Circle demonstrates.

												This game is somewhat short, but extremely fun - all three parts of it! Making playful satiric jabs at the gamedev, it made even me feel the burn in the back at one moment (hint for those who had played: lack of team coordination).The way you interact with the gameworld is unique, and eventually lets you build up an unstoppable hitsquad to kick lazy gamedevs - but then the REAL fun start. The third part of the game is really unique, at least I haven't saw any game that would incorporate it. I mean, how many bots leave snarky comments as they play along?!Anyway, try this game out. It might not hold a lot of replay value, but it's still worth it.			"

												I didn't see any indication of this on the store page, so I do want to warn everyone that there are a few instances of some pretty strong language in this game. Don't buy it for your kids (most of the humor would go over their heads anyway).The term ""Magic Circle"" is game designer lingo for a player's immersion in the game. It's analagous to the ""Fourth Wall"" in drama. Anything that makes the player conscious of the fact he is merely playing a game is said to break the magic circle.This game doesn't just break the magic circle; it body slams it, stomps on it, and makes vicious insinuations about the age of its mother's profession. In so doing, however, the game actually forges an even stronger magic circle around the player. When you are playing a game about playing a game, it becomes difficult for your brain to process the fact that The Old Pro isn't real, but rather a fictional character brought to life with a typically awesome voice performance from Garr—I mean Mercer—I mean Stephen Russell. Artsy self-absorbed writers, frustrated level designers, impatient competitive gamers, *even* OMGOMGOMG!!!!!! breathless fans, everyone feels the keen edge of The Magic Circle's wit.  It's not a long game. I spent a lot of time just fooling around and still reached the real end credits in less than 9 hours. Even if I weren't going to fool around in my current game for a few more hours and then replay it all from the start (I couldn't hear some of the dialogue over the sound of my own giggling), I would still consider it worth the price.Anyway, I hope you like it. I worked really hard to get it ready to ship.			"

												I was interested enough to play the demo, then got the game while it was on sale. Got to the end in about 3 hours, which is not a lot of gameplay. In particular I was disappointed that the game introduces an interesting monster-editing system as a way to solve puzzles, then has only a handful of abilities and puzzles to use that system on. I'd compare that to ""Portal"" but not in a good way: ""Okay, I'm through the intro/tutorial and... that was the end?"" The good news is that there's actual gameplay unlike ""The Stanley Parable"" and ""The Beginner's Guide"" (which this references), so it's not purely an artsy short story done up as a game.There's then a second part (spoilers omitted) in which I actually turned the audio off for a bit because of a long rant amounting to ""you the player are a jerk for playing this"". The gameplay of that was interesting but even shorter.Finally there's a third part in which... sans spoilers, you get to do something very different, and there's a bit of in-game AI that judges your performance and encourages you to put some thought into what makes a game fun. This part, I really liked, but it'd have been even better to expand on that with more content and more than one level. Really that could be developed into a game in its own right.So in conclusion, I'm wishing there were a thumb-sideways button. $10 for three hours beats a movie's value, so I'll click ""recommend"" at least at the discount price, but know that you're getting some fun ideas that I didn't feel were developed or explored to half the extent they could've been.

The sound design is also just the best.Anything I could really say on things like story and gameplay have really been covered by other reviews, but I will say that if you are one of those people who ♥♥♥♥♥ about walking simulators and the like, just, stay far away from this as you probably won't like or get what it's trying to do.I guess I don't have anything that insightful to say, but if you're looking for a fun time in a game that satirizes or deconstructs what making games is even about ANYWAY,  I'd say give it a go.

												The Magic Circle goes above just being about making a game, it dives into the lives of perfectionist game developers and their relationship with obsessive fans.  The gameplay is an interesting take on debug mode/recycle bin and while it mostly revolves around exploring to find the right abilities, a-la zelda or metroid, it's interesting to see the world that has been built.  The characters aren't just bright-eyed developers struggling under the weight of their project, they're real people with real flaws and interpersonal conflicts which drag the game down.The final level was an excellent culmination of all the ideas and themes up to that point, and the final scene after you finish the game may be a sobering experience for aspiring developers and for fans of games who have no idea how these things are made.8/10 - I am a god.

												I usually stay away from indie games, as soon as I hear the word indie I get alarm bells ringing in my head. However since Shovel Knight and a few other great indie games, I have become a little more willing to try them out. The Magic Circle is reminiscent of portal and yet completely different and unique. It's originality and creativeness needs to be mentioned however its lack of length and difficulty also need to be mentioned. I would say this game is about 3 hours long, which is about the length time it took me to beat portal 2 now that I think about it. The length and difficulty are negative points but it's still and extremely interactive, immersive and most important interesting world and story. I will gladly recommend this game to everyone. It's one of the best indie games on the market. 8/10			"

												""Satire done right"" indeed. I like the art style and the mechanics are interesting and well executed. I found the story, which was good but a little slow in the first half, to be very engaging in the second half. I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a relaxed and unique experience with a clever story.			"

												This game was everything I hoped it would be. It's heavy on exploration with some puzzle-solving required -- just challenging enough to keep things interesting without getting repetative or frustratingly difficult. I love the themes of reworking reality. I love the characters -- especially the disembodied voice that accompanies you through the game. This is funny and creepy and fabulous.			"

												The Magic Circle goes above just being about making a game, it dives into the lives of perfectionist game developers and their relationship with obsessive fans.  The gameplay is an interesting take on debug mode/recycle bin and while it mostly revolves around exploring to find the right abilities, a-la zelda or metroid, it's interesting to see the world that has been built.  The characters aren't just bright-eyed developers struggling under the weight of their project, they're real people with real flaws and interpersonal conflicts which drag the game down.The final level was an excellent culmination of all the ideas and themes up to that point, and the final scene after you finish the game may be a sobering experience for aspiring developers and for fans of games who have no idea how these things are made.8/10 - I am a god.

												Well written and engaging little game. If the price seems too high for a ~5 hour experience, wait for a sale, but in my opinion it is worth it. It can easily get to 8 hours if you're a completionist.You're not paying for the length of the game, but the quality and the work put into it, and while it may have a deceptively ""unfinished"" aesthetic, this thing had a lot of work put into it. And it's bold and innovative, too.Excellent voice acting and OK music by the way.			"

												One of the weirdest games I have ever played, twelve hours was how long it took me to play it. Have you ever wondered what it would be like to create a game? Work with other people to do so? Become a ""play-tester"" in this game and even the AI will let you in on its secrets. Voyeurism was never so fun.  The voice acting is crazy good. One can finish this game quickly, or try to find all the secrets first, so as to explore everything possible. Anything more I might add will fall under 'spoilers' so I will leave off saying: it left a strong impression on me and I quite enjoyed the experience.			"

												I usually stay away from indie games, as soon as I hear the word indie I get alarm bells ringing in my head. However since Shovel Knight and a few other great indie games, I have become a little more willing to try them out. The Magic Circle is reminiscent of portal and yet completely different and unique. It's originality and creativeness needs to be mentioned however its lack of length and difficulty also need to be mentioned. I would say this game is about 3 hours long, which is about the length time it took me to beat portal 2 now that I think about it. The length and difficulty are negative points but it's still and extremely interactive, immersive and most important interesting world and story. I will gladly recommend this game to everyone. It's one of the best indie games on the market. 8/10			"

												Definitely one of the most unique games I've ever played!I don't know why I kept posponing starting it - the concept is fresh, the dialogue and characters are fairly hilarious (they also provide some excellent commentary about the state of the industry nowadays), and the game actively encourages the player to try new things and break the mechanics - it's so liberating. I felt like a kid playing their first video game - that sense of wonder which comes from not knowing what to expect and everything feeling new. I loved every single minute of it and it deserves all the praise it can get. Tldr; I honestly haven't felt this genuinely giddy about a video game in a while ...and seriously wish we could have a 'sequel'.  *winks* "

												The Magic Circle is somewhere between a satire on the development of games, and a story of a story that just never got finished, leaving it to you to finish it. After playing enough to have in my eyes ""beaten"" it, it's more accurate to call this game: ""an experience"" but not one you simply sit idly by, sure the story goes on around you, usually without your intervention, but there's something to be said about playing a game parallel to a story unfolding around you.Just go into this game with two rules: ""If you're stuck, try thinking differently"" and ""Never be afraid to get lost""			"

												I really enjoyed this game, It is clearly a passion project, the forums are filled with the game developers, reaching out- and trying to troubleshoot any bugs that pop up. For the small, and the strange; it is this commitment to their fanbase that makes their game so vivid, walking around the content of the game- a small tale about a player character, who tries to make sense out of incomplete and abandoned landscapes- This is the sort of game, that's story is so robust, it can handle a couple moderate bugs, without negatively impacting the playthrough.The voice acting is so adeptly done that even minor artifacts, of some prattling old man dreaming ambitiously of a dark fantasy vibrate with life, The visuals are stunning, the color scheme ingenius, and only visible in a small circle around the player character. What looks like a river of water- may not reveal itself as lava until you've already jumped in.This game, like a good book; ends a thousand pages before it could, leaving the player mystified and wanting more.

And by 'games like this,' I mean story-oriented games such as The Stanley Parable, or even Portal. The puzzles aren't very hard and are few, but there's a good bunch of content to uncover and an equally good amount of replayability. If you don't like this type of game, I'd still say it's a good game to grab in a sale. You'll probably have some fun playing it as a time-waster.			"

												Found this game in my steam library today, and boy am I glad I did. The story behind the game is compeling, and confusing, and just rich enough to make you want to continue to want to find more and more, but at the same time, doesn't make you overwhelmed to the point of googling about what is going on, ike some other story games tend to do sometimes. The puzzles are simple enough, and don't take too much thought to get through, but the story drives you to want to complete each one, to find that next bit of story you've been wanting. This is a cheap pick up if you wait for a sale, and doesn't eat too much time. Very replayable, just not back to back. I see myself playing this again very soon.Scores: Out of 10Story- 8, Gameplay- 6, Graphics- 7, Replayability- 5, Overall- 8			"

												In short, when I first saw this game I hestitated and ended up watching some playthroughs for about three episodes before losing interest. After some time, I came across it again and decided to have a go  and try it for myself. I don't often review games, but for this one I have made a huge exception. Overall, while it was unique, simple, and rough looking, it was actually really ****in good. I had a huge problem putting it down. So, while I did beat it in two sittings, I couldn't help but want more. The story was amazing, the gameplay rather simple (which was nice) and there wasn't so much going on that you got lost debating on what to do. So for anyone wishing to make games in their near future, this one definitely is a must and I would actully recommend it to anyone that asks. That being said, if the programmers read their game's reviews, I give a minor wall break and say, ""Thanks for a great game and keep up the amazing work"" Now, I just have to wait for a sequal ;)			"

												Great game with amazing story.  I'm awful picky with my games but this was just great.  Even the slow parts were interesting.  The whole concept was funny and great.   I  blew through the game in 3 hours but I regret how fast I tried to do it.  The game encourages exploration and rewards ideas that I would have thought would cause a glitch in any other game. All in all its a well executed story line that I'll remember for a while. If you like puzzle and exploration games I'd recommend buying it on the spot.  Everyone more action oriented this game is still great but maybe worth waiting for it to go on sale.Edit: Almost forgot, at the very end you can't skip the credits which is entirely hilarious and typical of the game in its own amazing style.

												The Magic Circle is one of the most creative, unique games I've played. The writing and environments are great but the expressiveness of it's central hacking mechanic is its biggest strength. Play it and you'll never think of game development the same way again.			"

												I highly recommend this game times infinity. If you had thoughts on purchasing this game, I highly reccomend that you do it. This game is definitely worth your money. The game starts out with you playing as the main character of an unfinished video game that has been in development for 10 or 20 years. There have been others that have tried the whole ""unfinished game"" within a game thing before, but The Magic Circle does this right. Another great thing about this game is the twists and turns. One minute you think the game is over, but then it turns out there is more. You could say the same thing about the whole game. Starting out, you'll think that all the game is doing is just satire of incompetent game developers and games stuck in development hell, but it turns out there is much more to it. The game has excellent gameplay and voice acting. The gameplay mainly involves editing enemies that approach while discovering hidden parts to the game. The editing gameplay mechanic can lead to whacky things at times like having a rock for an ally that moves and shoots out fire. The voice acting within the game really makes the story shine. All the characters had a great voice acting performance, my favorite characters have to Ish Gilder and The Old Pro. Both of them made the game an even more enjoyable experience. Overall this game was a great indie title that I have enjoyed and will probably play more of in the future.			"

												It's not often that I find a game that I really want to share (and thus review) as much as The Magic Circle, what the developer has accomplished here is truly something special.TL;DR: This game pretty much gives you a behind the scenes look at what a game in what the game community calls ""development hell"" and then hands you the freedom to try and fix the world or break it in bizarre ways. Really needs to be played to be understoodI ended up getting this game through the Humble Monthly program, and I was just going through each of my 6 new games and just 'kicking the tires' so to speak and then about halfway through I started up this game... Next thing I knew about 2 hours had passed and I was halfway through constructing and populating my very own video game level for the AI to test and I had to work in 4 hours, but I didn't want to stop. I can't really say too much about this game without spoiling what the experience this game presents is about, there are some good scripted comedy bits, but some of the best comedy you can end up creating yourself using the freedom the developers offer you in game. The main (""story"" mode) takes somewhere around 3 hours to complete without absolutely exploring every nook and cranny, probably another hour or two to do that, however it's the creative part of this game that will really keep you coming back to this game, if you pick it up, you'll see what I mean once you complete it the first time through. I might ordinarily feel like $20 is a little steep for a game of this length, however given that I know I will come back for at least another 5-10 hours to play around in the creative modes and see what kinds of things I can come up with and given the uniquely crafted experience that is offered here, I would say that had I come across this game normally knowing what I know now, I would happily have paid the full $20 to support this uniquely amazing dev and help them to continue to produce this type of amazing content.

												A short but excellent exploration of the downsides of extended development cycles and developer ego. You explore the world without a traditional weapon, but your control over the behaviors of creatures in the game more than makes up for this and introduces clever puzzle mechanisms that are unique to this game.The ending even tries to allow the player a chance at some extremely streamlined game design of their own. Recommended for anyone mildly interested in the development side of games (although this is a work of fiction, so don't expect an expose or manual). Also recommended for those who like indirect solutions to puzzles.			"

												An incredibly entertaining game that I’d recommend to anyone with a sense of humor and a spark of creativity. That said, the narrative is definitely targeted towards an adult audience. Which is in ways a shame, because there are a host of great take-aways.I love this game for tackling a multitude of topics in a clever ways and creating characters with depth, flaws, and overall humanity. The art direction is incredibly appropriate and the writing, more than anything, makes The Magic Circle a journey worth completing. The mechanics can be clunky at times, but they are very creative and serve the story and themes well - Not to mention, it’s just plain fun. The humor is wonderfully dark and amusing. All that said, play the demo, and if anything about what you play speaks to you, know that the full game goes above and beyond the bar set in the demo content. I don’t want to spoil anything, so go give a whirl!			"

												Absolutely frigging amazing.  This game managed to combine some of the most de-constructionist gameplay I've ever seen with Network-level commentary about the game industry itself, and yet it does it in a package that's incredibly fun to play around with AND with far less pretention than just about any other self-important Game About Gaming I've ever seen.  This deserves GOTY awards from any game journo who still has a few shreds of their soul left.There might be longer games out there for $20, but it's virtually assured none of them have even a fraction of the creativity and raw love of the genre -despite all its flaws- that The Magic Circle demonstrates.

												I didn't see any indication of this on the store page, so I do want to warn everyone that there are a few instances of some pretty strong language in this game. Don't buy it for your kids (most of the humor would go over their heads anyway).The term ""Magic Circle"" is game designer lingo for a player's immersion in the game. It's analagous to the ""Fourth Wall"" in drama. Anything that makes the player conscious of the fact he is merely playing a game is said to break the magic circle.This game doesn't just break the magic circle; it body slams it, stomps on it, and makes vicious insinuations about the age of its mother's profession. In so doing, however, the game actually forges an even stronger magic circle around the player. When you are playing a game about playing a game, it becomes difficult for your brain to process the fact that The Old Pro isn't real, but rather a fictional character brought to life with a typically awesome voice performance from Garr—I mean Mercer—I mean Stephen Russell. Artsy self-absorbed writers, frustrated level designers, impatient competitive gamers, *even* OMGOMGOMG!!!!!! breathless fans, everyone feels the keen edge of The Magic Circle's wit.  It's not a long game. I spent a lot of time just fooling around and still reached the real end credits in less than 9 hours. Even if I weren't going to fool around in my current game for a few more hours and then replay it all from the start (I couldn't hear some of the dialogue over the sound of my own giggling), I would still consider it worth the price.Anyway, I hope you like it. I worked really hard to get it ready to ship.			"

												I was interested enough to play the demo, then got the game while it was on sale. Got to the end in about 3 hours, which is not a lot of gameplay. In particular I was disappointed that the game introduces an interesting monster-editing system as a way to solve puzzles, then has only a handful of abilities and puzzles to use that system on. I'd compare that to ""Portal"" but not in a good way: ""Okay, I'm through the intro/tutorial and... that was the end?"" The good news is that there's actual gameplay unlike ""The Stanley Parable"" and ""The Beginner's Guide"" (which this references), so it's not purely an artsy short story done up as a game.There's then a second part (spoilers omitted) in which I actually turned the audio off for a bit because of a long rant amounting to ""you the player are a jerk for playing this"". The gameplay of that was interesting but even shorter.Finally there's a third part in which... sans spoilers, you get to do something very different, and there's a bit of in-game AI that judges your performance and encourages you to put some thought into what makes a game fun. This part, I really liked, but it'd have been even better to expand on that with more content and more than one level. Really that could be developed into a game in its own right.So in conclusion, I'm wishing there were a thumb-sideways button. $10 for three hours beats a movie's value, so I'll click ""recommend"" at least at the discount price, but know that you're getting some fun ideas that I didn't feel were developed or explored to half the extent they could've been.

A cross between it, Portal 2, and The Stnaley Parable, this is how to make a meta game. Instead of fighting enemies, you have the ability to ""edit"" them, making for one hell of a fun mechanic.Throw some wonderful visuals and voice acting into the mix, and you have yourself a winner.

A Review of The Magic Circle That is Totally a Square I mean Come On ReallyI won't spoil a thing.  Know that I enjoyed this game immensely, it took turns that I didn't expect, chuckled at and genuinely enjoyed. The art style can vary immensely, and for that it gets 20 style points. It succeeds in its goals of expressing how much time actually went on to the making of this game ~_^The music, self referential and all gets 32 Final Fantasy arpeggios. While not the exactly the star of the show, it fathers the game experience and enriches the scenes when appropriate.The gameplay is about 1,984°F.  This game doesn't hold your hand, and in a way I'm glad for that.  You'll feel like a genius when you solve what you need to do. If you're struggling, don't worry it's expected!  Just keep at it and remember, use your brain. Seriously, use it.The 'World Building' is about 1000 Skyrim Catacombs.  When the game knuckles down and said <redacted>, I was genuinely moved.  I spent the time, and even after an hour of play at 2 in the morning of course, I was scored an 8 of 10, I was happy.  Because I knew, ""This is mine.""  I rate the story one parabola effect of the stanley variety, but honestly it's its own, better, thing. It genuinely interested me as I watched Jim Sterling play it, and I needed to know what was happening.  I needed to know why I couldn't kill m'mum!A night wellspent.  And if this review talks you into playing the game, stop by and read it again once you're done!			"

												I really enjoyed this game, having played through it for the first time after launch. I really expected none of it. The description on Steam was a bit different than what I found online, and I was badly confused when I first started searching online for some clues about the game; the creators did a good job of selling [the] concept online, which had me wondering if I was looking at the right game.The Magic Circle had a good mix of open world and linear gameplay for such a small game, and though I had to figure out how to ""beat"" the game, it was not impossible to do so. I had quite the surprise when I made that last discovery -- won't share it here to preserve freshness -- on something I had been wondering about since roughly half-way through playing. So worth it when I figured it out, and finding the notes to ... someone. I think what really made the game a worthwhile purchase for me was the end-game, and realizing that searching for every nook and cranny while playing really paid off. I must say -- THAT's how you do it. Great job, guys.Even though I was able to finish the game in an afternoon/evening, this game was worth every penny for me. There were some truly original gameplay elements in this game, and I would love to see more like it in the future, in terms of how to make an ""old"" genre new.I apologize if my review is a bit obtuse, but trying to not spoil the surprises I had in this game was kinda hard to do. My opinion: worth the purchase, and worth the recommendation.			"

												The Magic circle is a clever ~6 hour meta satire on video game development where you play a tester who has gone rouge in order to save, the game? the insane talking rock?  I was never really sure.  The majority of the game you’ll spend your time listening to the wonderfully written and acted dialogue which had me hunting for another audio clip as soon as one was over.  The actual gameplay comes in the form of editing and stealing your defeated enemies attributes in order to solve puzzles.You’ll be taking most of your cues from Olmec from the Legends of the Hidden Temple who quickly hangs a lantern on the fact that he sounds like he's plotting to betray you.  I couldn’t help but immediately question the protagonist's sanity as I stared into the multicolored eyes of the virtual rock that I was taking orders from while he recited his Mein Kampf.  Thankfully the rest of the cast is far more humorous and relatable even while they are being little eccentric.  You’ll see these characters as giant floating eyeballs delivering the game’s backstory and plot as you leisurely walk around.   When you run into an enemy you have to trap it with a multicolored circle that allows you to walk up and edit the creature’s attributes.  This lets you give it new abilities and make it fight for you, or accidently give it firebreath and then set yourself as it’s enemy as I did more times than i’m proud to admit.  These abilities can be swapped amongst the creatures to create floating fireproof abominations that look like they’re from the Island of Misfit Toys, which might sound disappointing but ends up going very well with the tone of the game.Very early into playing I began searching my keyboard for a sprint key that I was sure must be there somewhere—It wasn’t.  The game does allow you to teleport to various locations on the rather small map and summon the editable carcasses of your slain foes to you.  I still constantly found myself shaking my head at the pace of my character and wondering why I was given the useless zoom function instead of a sprint.  I suspect given the size of the game and the fact that you spend the majority of the time listening to audio diaries a sprint feature would end up feeling silly.Visually the game looks like a schizophrenic watched Casablanca while playing Skyrim which provided a good chuckle.  The game very adeptly attempts to appear like an unfinished game, which results in the problem that it looks like an unfinished game.  Thankfully the game doesn’t last long enough for you to grow to hate the art direction, and I found myself torn between being annoyed by it and loving it.If you’re looking for a serious game stay far away, this game is not difficult or long, but that’s ok because it’s not trying to be!  I am almost tempted to file this game under interactive short story as it would feel far more at home there than listed as a “game” proper.  But perhaps that’s just me being pompous and attempting to force art into predefined categories which too many today do.  Even though it was short I had fun with this quirky tale and came away glad I played it, I think you will too.			"

												I enjoyed every minute of Stephen Russel's buttery-sandpaper voice.The Magic Circle is a wonderfully done satire of game developers and the gaming community as a whole, but there are a few things that sadly hold it back from being a complete 10/10 for me.-Length of the game is dismally short, about 5 hours if you don't look for all the secrets. When I recieved the end credits the thought went through my mind: ""This feels unfinished."" The game just sorta ends explaining what the title means. I felt like I missed something somewhere. If that was the idea then bravo to the devs, I get the yolk.-""Puzzles"" are not really puzzles, they're problems. For example: at one point there are enemies that shoot flames at you if you get to close, so all you need to find is a rock and take its 'fireproof' ability so your minions are unharmed. That's a solution to a problem, not a puzzle that took me 10+ minutes to figure out. Sure, there are a myriad of solutions you could cook up, but all of them involve just slapping traits and behaviors onto a creature and then you're done. -The world is small, VERY small. The design and style of the place is beautiful, but I wanted to see more. I understand it's small because the game in the game is ""unfinished"" but there was so much more that could've been explored here. This couples very badly with the short playtime.Everything put together makes the entire experience feel incomplete: end-game mechanics are very basic and limited; everything past the 'open-world' section feels rushed for the sake of satire; the game as a whole seems too short to effectively get their point across. If the whole game itself was to be a part of the joke then I didn't see it. However, I still had fun with this experience, and I recommend buying this when it goes on sale.			"

												I have to be brutally honest about this one.It's got potential, but it doesn't feel like its fully utilized.It's got a few graphical bugs, more than a few headscratchers, and a couple areas where you can clip through the ground and die. I get that it's supposed to be unfinished, but there's no reason I should clip through the corner of a platform in a very obvious pltforming segment, fall through the ground, and fall to my death.I expected it to get better, but it just falls short. I'd ask for a refund, but I've been playing too long, holding onto that vain hope. Try it at 50% off or something, but...I can't really recommend it.			"

												Whis game has a FANTASTIC premise and idea. However, if you've played through to the end , it gains a whole new level of terrible irony. The story is good, but after you've beaten the game, and even during the game, you  Gain the ability to fly.  Using that, you see that, though the game says this unfinished world is full of half-finished things. Unless this is intentional, theres a lot of negative design space where i got to sume awesome spot and there was nothing there. Not only that, theres a lot of completion bonus, but I have to acces the space world to get there, and the space world is awesome, until you've gone through it 100 times to try and find the turn you didn't take, because that stuffs a maze. My main complaint is no challenge.  Once you get more than, say, 3 pets, they become more of a nuisance than a help, and there's no bosss besides the first one with the hivers. The final boss i killed in maybe 2 seconds with just one pet. The game feels like it itself is similar to what it's mocking: an unfinished game. Overall great idea, okay humor, terrible exectution. I haven't played it but download the demo, don't buy the game. Also, the game length greatly varies based on what you find in what order. It could've been a 10/10, but instead it's a 3/10.			"

												Okay, this game was great. Id say it was a little shorter than I expected, but its really the about the perfect length for what it is. I was expecting a semi-puzzle game with hacking elements, and while there is a little of that, its way more story driven. Its an very clever meta commentary on developers and players and games. And keeps surprising you right to the end.It was not what I was expecting. But what it was was really awesome. And the guys who made it really put a ton of love into it.			"

												This is a first-person puzzle game, but one where the solutions require you to hack the game.  You can take qualities (type of attack, special powers, even forms of movement) from one thing in the game and put them into another.  Being creative doing that is the heart of the game, allowing you to beat unbeatable enemies.There's a fun story involved, too, and a great voice actor (made me feel like I was playing Thief 1 all over again!).  Highly recommended if you like quirky, offbeat games.			"

												At the time of writing this review it's been almost a month since Fallout 4 released, and many players have finished it and long for more. But the fun doesn't have to end there, thanks to The Magic Circle. In The Magic Circle, you play a buggy, half-finished RPG, fixing it and altering it as you go, providing an adequate emulation of playing one of Bethesda's titles. All jokes aside, this game is really fun. It's really more of a puzzle game than an actual RPG, but it handles the puzzles in a pretty unique way. The monsters in the game can be trapped and edited to have new abilities that you take from other monsters, giving them various purposes that can be used both for combat or solving puzzles. At one point in the game I accidentally broke the ""planned"" solution for crossing a river of fire, but I was able to solve the puzzle my own way by adding some Teleport abilities I had taken from another area, putting one on my fire-breathing mushroom and tossing him across the gap, and then putting another teleport on my pet rock and standing on him to teleport across the gap. It highly encourages creativity, and the monster editing function has enough variety to allow you to feel like your party is your own creation. From there the game continues to constantly deliver surprises, and while it isn't an overly long game, it makes up for it in quality. If you're interested in getting a satirical look into the world of game development or just want to create an army of flying parasitic rocks, this game is pretty great.			"

The story line itself was really fast and took little time. I just wish there were more puzzles. I don't think that it is worth the price.

												This is something different and unique: a game that is about a game, knows that it is a game and what a game is.It shows the start off the product as an obsessive ideas, concepts, redesigns, personal problems, presentations and even elements of modern gaming culture, but it also has a deep desire.Amazing work by guys who brought us the look inside the development of games and being successful at keeping it always fresh and interesting. Also, way to go to getting Stephen Russell to do the voice.Oh and there is also truth in it that, however blasphemous it may sound, there is a thin line between an artist and a God.Recommended!			"

												A cautious recommendation mostly because of the length - you'll get about two hours playing normally and maybe three and a half going for all of the secrets. Some games can definitely justify $20 for that length, I think this one has too weak of a final third and too much empty space to be among them. Buy on sale. The Magic Circle is a meta-game about being some kind of ghost/beta tester in a game trapped in development hell. The story is mostly told through the clashes between a developer who is too visionary for his own good, a rabid fangirl of the sort that sends death threats over delays, and a pro gamer contract-locked into a heavily narrative game despite opposing narratives in games. The dynamic is interesting, but only a few moments of the story are ultimately memorable. Gameplay consists of trapping and (visually) reprogamming enemies with traits stolen from other creatures and objects. There's no limit on how many followers you can create through this method, and the stupidity you can cause with it is absolutely the highlight of the game. Combat is mostly trivialized by your army of death, but there are a few environmental puzzles that require you to combine traits in creative ways. Unfortunately, this system disappears almost entirely in the last third. I can't get too much into why I disliked the ending moments without heavy spoilers, but suffice to say it throws out all of the good gameplay and replaces it with something that's just tedious. That said, the sequence right before this does at least manage a few good laughs. It has its moments and isn't at all a bad way to spend two hours, but it's not one you're going to be thinking back to in a year.			"

												A cautious recommendation mostly because of the length - you'll get about two hours playing normally and maybe three and a half going for all of the secrets. Some games can definitely justify $20 for that length, I think this one has too weak of a final third and too much empty space to be among them. Buy on sale. The Magic Circle is a meta-game about being some kind of ghost/beta tester in a game trapped in development hell. The story is mostly told through the clashes between a developer who is too visionary for his own good, a rabid fangirl of the sort that sends death threats over delays, and a pro gamer contract-locked into a heavily narrative game despite opposing narratives in games. The dynamic is interesting, but only a few moments of the story are ultimately memorable. Gameplay consists of trapping and (visually) reprogamming enemies with traits stolen from other creatures and objects. There's no limit on how many followers you can create through this method, and the stupidity you can cause with it is absolutely the highlight of the game. Combat is mostly trivialized by your army of death, but there are a few environmental puzzles that require you to combine traits in creative ways.

The magic circle is a bit of a mixed bag for me. On one hand I love everything about it... On the other hand I feel like that the game is limited by everything about it. I loved running through and exploring the vast world set out before me... And it was beautiful. The voice actors worked well to pull me into the world and I even saw an appearance from the guy who does Rusty Venture (The Venture Bros) play the part of one of the head creator of the company, Ish.The puzzles were interesting, although they were a bit on the simple side. The gameplay was an interesting take on the puzzle genre that had me enjoy it throughly in the start of the game. However, you find that the game is limited by what it gives you. Within a few hours of playing the game I already had most of it done and by the time I reached the end I found the ""final thing"" that you had to do to be a bit underwhelming. This game lacks a satisfying major confrontation and replaces it with an incredibly simple puzzle. Combine that with the fact that you only get a few hours out of the game and you get a game that would have felt right priced at 10 dollars and not 20. I don't regret buying it, I just eagerly await any additions they add to the game in the future. In the game's current state however, it doesn't have enough to justify a 20 dollar price tag.			"

												I gave this 70 minutes, and what I've experiences is a game that has some interesting ideas, but none of them work.  It tries to be satire, but none of it is funny or insightful.  It has a mechanic where you rewrite the abilities and AI of NPCs, but not much has been done with it, and what's there feels kind of pointless so far.  It gives you a character who seems to have achieved sentience within the game, but he's goes between being uninteresting and annoying.  This is an interesting, but failed, experiment.			"

								I could write an essay about this game, it feels like the all writers are writers trope in a video game except being the first game to have used it makes it feel fresh. It really feels like the developers have taken the 7 years since bioshock and tried earnestly to build an entire game dedicated to answering the central conceit and the most remarkable thing is it just about succeeds.It poses a lot of smart questions about how different generations of game deveopers operate and the value of each from the auteurs of the 90's like Peter Molyneux, Warren Spector and Richard Garriot to their proteges in the naughties who were roundly bludgend by big buisness into impotence and went of to seek their fortunes on their own to the new age of crowd funding and nostalgia games of the latest generation. It really is Game as Art like you've never seen before (instead of art in games).			"

												This game starts strong and keeps developing new layers into both the narrative and the gameplay, but both of them get stretched too far at the VERY end of the game.The majority of the game is a well crafted machine that will engage you and have you begging to see more, but that is where one of the biggest flaws appears. This game is short. It is too short to really fulfill the story that the developers were trying to accomplish as well as leaving you unsatiated with the development of the puzzle/game mechanics. You'll be begging for more, but there won't be more to take.What there is to take is still pretty damn entertaining, though.			"

Buuuut that's not what this game was going for, you will have to endure a lot of standing still and listening to talking. There isnt much interactivity with the narration, such as in Stanley Parable, you mostly just listen to mono- or dialogues without having any choices. I honestly hope, someone will pick the gameplay ideas up and make full games of it, I would definetely play those.			"

												This game took me about 3 hours to complete. The game has a good 10-20 minutes of gameplay. Once you hit the main world its just downhill. The mechanic this game is based around (editing enemies) gets old really fast. There needed to be more to the game. It just shrivels up and does nothing. Your walk speed is abyssmal and it really hurts this game. You will spend so much time walking across and empty game world trying to get to a text doc that really have to relevance to the story, contains no humour and goes no where. The game has about 2-3 humourous moments and they're all in the very beginning. Nice concept, but wasn't executed well. This is a 3 hour game with 30 minutes of content.			"

												If anything this game is got me as an artist a warning shot across the bow of my life. Don't let needing to be the best at something keep you from being willing to fail in the eyes of other people. I know it's frightening, trust me, but this game does a wonderful job showing what happens to us when we get too focused on the prestige and not enough on completing our work. Without spoiling story, my favorite moment in the whole game is the ego driven moment near the end. We hear over and over how brilliant this content creator supposedly was, but he treats the people around him as if he was a god and we are blessed to even know him. To say I’ve never known people like him as an artist would be a lie. You will meet people like this, in all sections of society but what makes this game’s story particular chilling, is on some level, I feel the story also says, be careful because this could also be you.  If on sale an absolute must buy, full price though? Depends on whether or not this review made you feel something was amiss and this story might add something to it. On the game play side, this game is pretty simplistic. I wouldn’t really recommend it for those reasons as it’s sort of a strip minded version of programing light. Once again, you really play stuff like this to get a running commentary on something in the world or industry as a whole, this one walks that thin line, pretty well.  "

												This game is more like going to church than playing a video game, it's boring and preachy. I really like the mechanics of editing creatures and creating an army, but it feels like there's not a lot to do. Even though there's some flexibility, the parts you play seem linear, pointless, and tedious, and when you are not playing you are watching long cutscenes. It would be great to see a mod for this game that takes the fun creature editing mechanics into another setting.I thought I was buying a fun game, but I was duped into buying a long indie film disguised as a game. It's a film about video games telling you not to play video games and go outside.			"

												This game is really not what I thought it would be. The demo and the main game page shows it to be really good, but when I played it, I realized that it really was not a game for me. This game is really overpriced.... For what you get. You get just under 4 hours of gameplay for more than £10! I never like leaving bad reviews, but this little game really shocked me. Luckly I got my money back... But with a game worth that sort of money you shouldn't have to... This game has a great idea, that I was willing to spend my £10.04 on (the game was in a sale at the time of purchace) but how it has been made, I disliked. This game is not poor in the way it has been made, but for some reason I really disliked it... So I am sorry for the bad review, and think carefully where you put your money...			"

I beat this game in roughly 30 minutes, not counting how long I spent afked. It peaked my interest with its neat concept, it silly trailer, and it's connection to me. As it stands, this game is not worth the money you can buy it for, buy it on sale or something. Again, good game, too short. Would love a game like this that had atleast three hours of constant play to before you meet the end, not counting easter eggs, secrets, and so forth.			"

												Interesting game that came to me via a Humble Bundle. Was excited about it a few years back reading in PCG about what it was supposed to be, however, the real game play is boring, and, plays like you're very naggingly watching a Magnum Opus being tried and failed at from the game-dev side. Add to that 2-3 minute load times (on a M.2 drive) and no running, this is a pass for me.			"

												It's an interesting concept, but it just couldn't live up to the expectations it aspired to.  I think this game needed a lot more effort on the gameplay side, it's just too advanced of an idea for what is painfully dumbed down execution.  I suppose I should have expected a half hearted attempt at something creative.  The gaming industry likes simple mechanics.  Everything is wrong, on every level.  It's still playable to some level, but it's boring and disappointing.  Beyond the gameplay mechanics we also have audio logs you have to listen to like in System Shock 2 or Portal.  But instead of just playing them in the background, you have to stop the game and listen to them in a pause screen.  It gets old very fast and contributes greatly to my boredom.  The storyline is okayish.  Although to be honest, I'm not sure what the hell was going on.  The map is confusing.  I got lost quite a bit, but there were some nice puzzles thrown in. The thing I liked most about the game was the details it added in that normally only game developers know about.  IE Maps have origins that tell developers what direction is what, lava is actually just a pretty texture with a fire damage trigger overlaying it.  Overall, it's boring.  6/10			"

I don't think it's worth 20 dollars, and luckily I got it during the sale, but 10 dollars is fine with me. If you want to buy this game, now'd be a good time (as of typing), because to me it's closer to it's worth. Either way, I loved it and I would still buy it even if it were 20.

												Short version: The Magic Circle is an ambitious, original game with a great premise that it doesn't quite manage to fully deliver. Even so, I had a blast.Long version:So, the idea is that this is supposedly an eagerly anticipated sequel that's been in development hell for something like 20 years and is still a long way from finished. There's cut content that you can restore, mechanics that were planned but never implemented (or axed right in front of you), change logs scattered throughout, the developers drop in and have conversations with each other and with you (assuming you're a tester), etc. It's a great idea and unfortunately, The Magic Circle just doesn't quite manage to sell it. It's not large enough or layered enough with older versions (and logs, etc) to genuinely feel like a project that longrunning and embattled. It's more of a broad overview of what something like that might look like, on a macro scale. It's probably fine in the long run - this is an indie game made by a small team on a small budget, and it's not really fair to expect anything quite as elaborate as the premise suggests. But it does undercut the illusion a bit.Similarly, the writing definitely gives a broad, parodic sense of the sort of personalities and conflicts that might go into a debacle of that sort and the clashing priorities at work, but because they're so broad, they never quite feel like real people and the commentary on gaming culture and development is pretty surface level. But hey, it's funny and it works well enough in context, just don't expect deep insider insights.Those are really my main complaints, though. The game itself is brilliant, with a core mechanic in the main section that lends itself to a huge range of solutions to problems and a sort of anarchic tinkering with the game structure that is really enjoyable and beautifully realized, right down to visual representation on literally every editable object of all the different traits they can be assigned. And while the game isn't particularly large, that overworld has plenty of nooks and crannies to hide logs and other collectibles and special creatures and such. Heck, I'm still missing a couple and I could swear I've scoured everywhere. And while the scope undercuts the simulation a bit, there's some neat tricks with desktop simulation and such that help sell it. There are also a couple of later segments that are fun (if a little didactic) in other ways and while they're not as original or massively appealing as the core conceit, they're still well done with a bunch of scope for doing your own thing. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my time with TMC and definitely recommend it.			"

												he Magic Circle demonstrates in a beautifully satirical way the agony that is game development. The world is expertly crafted to resemble a pre-alpha game that’s a mash of too many ideas, all coexisting in the same code base which end up mashing together in unintended ways. This is reflected in the game play which is based around messing with things and changing up behaviours so you can access things you otherwise wouldn’t be able to. The story is one that definitely has a specific target audience in mind and, whilst it might not be for everyone, definitely plays to its strengths as a piece of commentary on the industry. It might not meet my criteria for a must-play game for everyone but if, like me, you feel like a part of the greater games industry, then there’s definitely a lot to like in The Magic Circle.Read my full review here: https://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2015/09/25/the-magic-circle-perfectionism-vs-fandom/ "

												(Slight Spoilers)The Magic Circle is a work of anti-art.This game is almost like a counterargument to The Stanley Parable, another game-about-games which pointed out the lack of free will and the predestination of narrative in games.  A tenth of the way in, there is even a similar title-screen fake-out that feels like a direct homage.  But The Magic Circle isn't about the illusion of choice.  It's about making games fun, and the complex relationship between making games and playing them.  And it's not as pretentious as The Stanley Parable-- if anything, it pokes fun at that element of ""art games.""Is The Magic Circle a fun game?  I certainly enjoyed myself.  It's not particularly difficult, or long, but it backs up its sometimes-subtle, sometimes-blunt statements about what motivates players by living by them.  Exploration, choice, challenge, reward, cool powerups.  It's a nonlinear game about lateral thinking.  You're really free to solve most puzzles however you can get the mechanics handed to you to work.The game's aesthetic is beautiful, and keeps surprising you throughout.  James Urbaniak, Ashly Burke, Karen Dyer and Stephen Russell are obviously some incredible voice talent.I really enjoyed it, and highly recommend it.			"

The controls dont take much time to get used to,  but thats only half the game. where this game really shines is the rpg game maker after the campaign is complete. the simple tools are more than able to work with a variety of stories.  just a quick note as i played this during the early access so a lot of the complaints have been fixed.  Story  the game begins with a dev team working on the story for the new magic circle game (getting super meta here) and playing the opening sequence, only to be hijacked by the lead story writer and turning the hole game on its head. after playing through the playtest area you meet a mysterious friend that helps you get things back on track and ready to reveal the game at the next E4			"

												Holy crap, there's a speech in here that's just... perfect. One of the most unique games I've ever played. Some of the gameplay aspects have been done in other games, but the lore/story/concept is stellar, and takes a few worthwhile turns.Don't read more about this game. Avoiding spoilers is worth it. If you *really* need another reason to buy it, look below.----------MINOR SPOILER-----------If you're ever curious about or fascinated by game design, game crafting, or the games industry, play this game immediately. ----------MINOR SPOILER-----------			"

												I think it's alright for me to say that I work in the video games industry, though only from the perspective of a QA tester, so I don't know everything about the processes of making a game. I work for a company, I won't say which, that is pretty big and has had a game in development for, while not 20 years, quite some time now.I can't personally relate to the joke The Magic Circle makes of games that have been locked in development hell for one reason or another (in TMC's case the creator's misguided search for perfection), since I've only been with this company for about half a year now, but I did get a pretty big kick out of it, looking sort of from the outside of things.The Magic Circle could be called a critique of the current state of the video games industry, at least the parts of it that delay games indefinitely only to release products that are obviously terrible, as well as making fun of internal developer politics and struggles. There were even a couple of QA jokes I got to enjoy (""Hell hath no fury like a tester scorned""). The game seems to take a crack at just about every video game trend in recent years, from episodic content to streaming let's players, overblown stories and undelivered promises.It's very funny, too, especially in how the game's mechanics of mixing and matching abilities comes to fruition. *HERE THERE BE SPOILERS* a portion of the game requires the manipulation of a live demo; the ""game"" is *supposed* to have the demo hero walk into a room containing a baby, but I was able to manipulate the baby's abilities so that it could fly and breath fire at the demo hero. I'm honestly still laughing about it right now as I type this.The game takes about 3-4 hours to complete, depending on how much time is spent in the end game, but the experience is well worth it.

												The Stanley Parable meets Hack 'n' Slash meets Sacrifice? It's hard to find comparison as this game is certainly unique. A smart satire on gaming that's also fun to play. It feels very well thought out, with every aspect coming from the central conceit of an unfinished game. I was particularly taken with the dedication to little details, like hearing the music director vocally conducting alongside the soundtrack. It may be short but it has definite replayability. toying with the creatures and powers is entertaining in and of itself and there's secrets to be found. I feel that games that reward experimentation like this are rare and should be praised for the effort.			"

												The Magic Circle is an underrated hell of a gem. The premise of the game revolves around exploring and 'editing' the game world while defying the developers. The world is small, but has an open world feeling of hidden zones for the player to find. The story itself goes beyond the sand-boxed world you explore and delves into many fourth wall references. This game also features a mini-game which allows you to build your own game for the AI to play.I cannot state enough the game's design being unique and novel that is, combining the fourth wall and game play creation. The voice acting was fantastic and really sold the characters.This game is definitely a 10/10.			"

If you have seen it however, this is the video game equivolent in both story and creative quality. An indie masterpiece if there ever was one and by the looks of things, the single most underrated game on steam. Do not worry about the game length - I think you will find the price is fair Even if it is a 4 hour playthrogh kind of game.

 I got this through Humble Monthly and I'm glad it did The game opens and if you've played Stanley Parable, this game will punch you right in the gut will all of its self-inflicted humor. I thought soon afterward ""I really hope this isn't all the game has. Its great but it'll get boring after three or four jokes about it.""No, it gets better and quickly. After going through a pretty nice tutorial, you're made aware of your goal and is thrown into the world.Right so the main gimmick: Editing those you meet.Yeah you find like, a dog thing. Trap it. Edit it. Take all of its behaviors and make it your pet.There you go you got a dog thing following you around.Copy paste. Behold puzzles.How do you complete it when you can't edit them due to 'groupthink' and these little bugs will kill you.Dog Thing. Give it melee and force it to fight the little bugs.How do you beat their queen? I have no idea. Figuring that out now.There is no wrong way to the beat the puzzles you find, only many ways to not do so.Its got a neat story and is overall pretty fun. I just wish we were allowed to color the landscape as we could in Epic Mickey.This game is eons better than epic mickey by the way.7/10.			"

I would highly recommend this game and it is completely worth the price even if you just play it once. 10/10			"

Early Access Review
								Recommendation Caveat: A fair amount of this game's humor value will be lost if you aren't particularly interested in what goes on behind the scenes during the creation of a game, or at the very least some kind of creative collaborative project. It's not that you won't 'get' the jokes, but more that it's mostly a collection of petty squabbles and cross-purposes that likely aren't nearly as funny if you haven't been forced to deal with similar situations in the past.Pros:+ Good writing (with one caveat I'll explain in more depth later)+ Simple mechanics that allow for experimentation and explorationCons:- Requires a bit too much backtracking in a few areas- Quite short (3 Hours for me, with only a bit of wandering around in search of secrets)Your Milage May Vary:* Pokes fun at the clashing of different game development ideologies* Purposefully 'unfinished' aesthetic----It's definitely a fun premise for a game. A man is working on the sequel to an accidental smash hit he made years ago... and has been doing so for more than a decade, with the help of a 'pro-gamer' who helped it gain noteriety in the first place and a super-fan seeking to make the next iteration everything it can possibly be, with or without its originator. You, as a sort of ascended Character Controller, are tasked by an unknown force with moving through what working bits and pieces exist in the game world in order to... well, you don't know what you're trying to do at first, and once you learn the story doesn't develop too much further, so I won't spoil it here.In any event, you quickly gain the ability to hack game assets and frankenstein their abilities into various little minions in order to solve puzzles. It plays this up as something that more or less grants you total power over the world, and for a time it certainly feels that way - stripping the legs off of a dog-creature to bring a mushroom to life and let it follow you around like a loyal pet is fun in a dark, sadistic sort of way - but eventually the novelty wears off and it's clear that the ability has very clear limits, designed specifically to keep you on track and solve puzzles in mostly static ways.But that's okay, at least in my opinion. The system is still fun in and of itself, and it means more attention can be paid to the plot when it pops up. The narrative actually has very little to do with you as the player. instead, it focuses on /why/ the development of the game you inhabit has stalled for Duke Nukem Forever lengths of time, as well as the dissatisfaction with the situation coming to a head amongst the employees. If you have memories of disaster-plagued group projects in high-school, college, or work, it should resonate pretty strongly with you. It's well-written, well-acted, and really encapsulates (in a caricature-ish kind of way) what happens when leading individuals in a creative endeavor have entirely different end goals - or worse, no clear goals whatsoever.This all comes to a head in a somewhat preachy, extremely long-winded speech by the 'esteemed writer' at a not-quite-E3 press event where... lots of things happen that security /really/ should have interrupted. Quickly. Instead of not at all, the way it turns out in the game. It's awkward, really, and is the only bit of the game's writing that honestly had me shaking my head in confusion and apathy.And then it was over, barely three hours into my play session, dropping me into a mode where I could see if I could toss together passable levels using a combination of the game's usual 'throw states on a creature' gameplay and some creative tools. While seemingly good for a mode taped to the end of another game, I'm not sure it was actually something that would pull me back in now that I've completed the story mode.All in all, was it worth $20? Eh... Barely. I definitely enjoyed my experience with the game and recommend it if you're at all interested in game development or creative writing of some sort, but that's a steep price to pay for the amount of content that you don't have to build yourself. If it sounds like it might be up your alley, wait for a sale, but definitely check it out!			"

Lots of little moments throughout the game had me smiling, except for the fourth wall breaking speech at the end. That was dumb. The part right after that though, really good and good on you devs for adding that bit in. This is beyond the scope of the game I think but a slightly larger tileset for some variation and additional weaponry besides a sword for the demo hero at the end would have been nice.			"

												I got this game through the humble bundle monthly and was not disappointed. I started playing it and found it hard to put down. It's not a game you will find yourself playing for months on end but the time you do spend is fun. You get to edit the game as you go along, break the rules and my favourite break the fourth wall. The voice acting is out of this world. I could listen to Ish, Maze and Coda read a dictionary. I had a little army of my own following me around who I could set upon my enemies with a single click. Love this game.Also, the devs are on top of things. I had an issue, posted about it in the tech support forums. There was an update to the game the next day that fixed the problem. Fan for life.			"

												Genuinely funny in places, and profound in others, this belongs right up there with ""A Beginner's Guide"" when it comes to insights into the creative process, and what it's like to work on large projects, and how fan behaviour and ""love"" for a franchise can foul up such things. The ""game"" aspect of it won't last forever; it's more a taste, an idea for you to play around with, but it's a very good one: modifying the attributes and abilities of creatures is a lot of fun, while it lasts, and there are a few basic puzzles that can be solved in a variety of ways.Put simply, if you're into ""meta"" humour and storytelling, you'll like this. At one point, you get to actually design a level, and one of the characters does a real-time ""Let's Play"" stream of it, commenting on everything from music usage to health potion placement.Also impressive that, while the game is one big reference to its own industry and is full of visible influences from famous games, it doesn't resort to clumsy *direct* references.Just about the only criticism I can aim at TMC is the abrupt nature of its story - it could have leaned just a little more in the direction of Portal, with more actual puzzles and gameplay, and I would have loved to hear just a little more about the characters.

												Well... I guess, this game deserves a short review from me, something quite uncommon. It is hard to describe it without spoiling the fun of exploring it yourself, but I will try my best at doing the first without doing the latter.This game's focus is story first and foremost. Gameplay, while not being bad, is obviously a mere tool to the narrative. In that regard it is akin to the ""The Beginner's Guide"" or ""The Stanley Parable"", though gameplay is a little bit more complicated in this one. It is relatively unique, basically putting a limited developer editing tools at your disposal in order to ""bend"" the otherwise unwinnable game to your benefit. At the same time, the game itself is relatively short (as it is evident from my time played) and doesn't expand on the idea a whole lot. Aside from collectibles and some mutually exclusive achievements, there is little replayability of note in this case.My verdict is - buy it if you're interested in a short story-driven experience. I feel it does deserve the money. Do take into account the shortness and lack of proper replayability. Maybe you'll want to wait for the sale offer, as much as my heart bleeds saying that. I genuenly believe that developers do deserve the money for this one. I also believe, that the game could do with more content and some other changes.			"

												The Magic Circle is the epidemy of puzzle/action/satire games, exclusively in that combination, for it's fun-loving charm, constant humor, and yet still rewarding gameplay that isn't just an interactive book. Not only is it fun to play, but the challenges are real in this game, and if you get used to it enough, all of the satisfaction that comes with getting to that tricky spot, or finding that easter egg, is enough to keep me replaying the storyline JUST to try different creatire combinations and try different outcomes.Favorite Creature?

												First off, this game is BRILLIANT! The Magic Circle is a game where you, the gamer, are well... gaming? The story starts with you joining this shadow of a finished game. You are greeted by the game's creator and soon learn that he just won't let the game be finished. As time progresses you, the HERO gain the ability to give deleted items and creatures life! Armed with your abilties and a sarcastic all knowing prisioner; you finish what the creator started.This game combines story, sandbox, and immersion tactics to really make you feel like the HERO. The sandbox aspect come from the players ability to change what has been deleted. You can mix and match creature parts to solve puzzles. There were some parts in the story that left me scratching my head. Because the game has a sandbox aspect, a player can wander around with little knowledge of where to go to progress the story.Looking at the game as a whole, I would give it a 9/10. It is funny, entertaining, and creative.			"

												I'll give a 9/10 for the game because of its uniqueness. It is a game about games and it successfully mocks all the bad games we have seen. That gives the story its depth. It's not the regular shooting or killing game we played a lot. Also it grants players endless strategy to finish it, enabling players to put their imagination into the game. The process of players playing is also the process the player help build and finish the game.But one drawback is the dialog is written to complicated. It's so obscure that I fail to grab the most of the thing the characters talk about, which is so disappointing. But as the climax arrived, at least I managed to enjoy it.			"

												It's not perfect, and there's some roughness to it, especially in the final sequence, but man. MAN.This game probably isn't for everyone, but if you've ever touched any part of video game development, professional or amateur, this is a must-play. If you are like me and you thought Metal Gear Solid 2 was incredible if only for its metafiction ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, this is a must-play.I got a 10/10 on my first try in the final sequence, and that's probably what I'd give this game, too.★★★★★			"

												he Magic Circle demonstrates in a beautifully satirical way the agony that is game development. The world is expertly crafted to resemble a pre-alpha game that’s a mash of too many ideas, all coexisting in the same code base which end up mashing together in unintended ways. This is reflected in the game play which is based around messing with things and changing up behaviours so you can access things you otherwise wouldn’t be able to. The story is one that definitely has a specific target audience in mind and, whilst it might not be for everyone, definitely plays to its strengths as a piece of commentary on the industry. It might not meet my criteria for a must-play game for everyone but if, like me, you feel like a part of the greater games industry, then there’s definitely a lot to like in The Magic Circle.Read my full review here: https://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2015/09/25/the-magic-circle-perfectionism-vs-fandom/ "

												(Slight Spoilers)The Magic Circle is a work of anti-art.This game is almost like a counterargument to The Stanley Parable, another game-about-games which pointed out the lack of free will and the predestination of narrative in games.  A tenth of the way in, there is even a similar title-screen fake-out that feels like a direct homage.  But The Magic Circle isn't about the illusion of choice.  It's about making games fun, and the complex relationship between making games and playing them.  And it's not as pretentious as The Stanley Parable-- if anything, it pokes fun at that element of ""art games.""Is The Magic Circle a fun game?  I certainly enjoyed myself.  It's not particularly difficult, or long, but it backs up its sometimes-subtle, sometimes-blunt statements about what motivates players by living by them.  Exploration, choice, challenge, reward, cool powerups.  It's a nonlinear game about lateral thinking.  You're really free to solve most puzzles however you can get the mechanics handed to you to work.The game's aesthetic is beautiful, and keeps surprising you throughout.  James Urbaniak, Ashly Burke, Karen Dyer and Stephen Russell are obviously some incredible voice talent.I really enjoyed it, and highly recommend it.			"

												The Magic Circle is more of an exploration game than a puzzle game. You spend most of the game exploring the world of a game locked into development hell in order to collect powers, hidden lore, and audio files. The writing is quite witty and funny at times. I'm not sure whether or not it's worth the $20 price. Though it took me 8 hours to collect everything, you can beat the game in only a couple of hours. It could have used more puzzles and I feel the game could have utilized the main game mechanic more. Regardless, I really enjoyed the Magic Circle. I found it charming and funny.I loved the characters.In a marketplace full of games boasting ""non-combat exploration"" and witty satire, The Magic Circle is one game that does it right.			"

												Warning: Doesn't work with 3dVisionOtherwise, I would recommend this game, even with only .4 hours currently on record.  The humor has been fairly decent and it's rather beautiful in its use of mostly greys with splashes of color waiting to be found.  The only gameplay element I'd like to see changed is a 'run' button.  I've played too many games that make themselves longer, simply by forcing me to walk at a snail's pace.  I'll get to the places I want to sit and stare at; just don't expect me to be patient getting there. :P			"

												Let me say something to begin wih if your going to buy this game wait for a sale the game is not worth it's $20price tag for only about 3 hrs of game time.BUT! with that said this game is one of the most refreshing things I've played in awhile.It's mechanics are soild and interesting and the world aswell the story are breath taking.Story: The story is about a game that is a sequel to an old text based adventure game that has been in the development hell for the past ten years. You asume the role of a Beta tester who is contacted by the protagonist of the original version of the game. Whose goal is to ruin the game in any way possible. The story takes a few different twists and turn having you venture to E4 and into 8-bit sci-fi settings. Aswell you can discover other elements of the story scattered in glitchy objects and audio logs. Overall the story is phenomenal and I loved it. 9/10Visuals: They are amazing! Having all the textures be unfinished sketches but with colored versions appearing around you and your allies was a great Idea. 9/10Gameplay: It's good and interesting but slowly gets a boring after awhile with little to no chages to the formula. The way it works is you can take attributes form some enemies and stitch them onto other creatures to create new allies. However there is only so many time is it's fun to have a howler fly around and breath fire on a guy with 4 heads. The game also has great emphasis on exploration with stuff such as in game dev logs and Life upgrades. 8/10Final thoughts: The magic circle is great but is a little too short for the price paid and the gameplay can become a little stale. But I must stress this game is still wort you time and if you can find it on sale it is a game worth owning.8.5/10			"

												I went in expecting a ""Stanley Parable"" experience, but eventually it was just a linear puzzle game. For as far as I like it, it doesn't make me want to return and try and find the secrets or even complete one achievement. The characters are great, the story is fun and the mechanics have good ideas but most of the game is linear and when I could finally move around I discovered how badly needed a sprint button was. It looks nice but felt empty at times and while I tried breaking the simulation at first I quickly gave up, it's what the game wants but the design discourages it. As said, I expected a metagame with a fresh and new experience, and it tried, but eventually it's more like ""just a puzzle game"" that didn't exploit its theme in full.			"

												The Magic Circle is an experiment in control. It allows the player to control certain aspects of the game world that they find themselves in such as enemy capabilities. This is the extent of control that you get as a player but through this limited amount of control you can do almost anything you wish. It's this confinement that breeds creativity. While the writing early on can be a bit awkward the game's story really shines as you find audio logs that flesh out the characters and change logs that show the dynamic between gameplay and art. The only problem I ran into with the game itself was that it was too short, and this just stems from a desire to play more. Overall this game is an amazing look into game design and development hell that can be funny and sad at the same time.			"

												I think it's alright for me to say that I work in the video games industry, though only from the perspective of a QA tester, so I don't know everything about the processes of making a game. I work for a company, I won't say which, that is pretty big and has had a game in development for, while not 20 years, quite some time now.I can't personally relate to the joke The Magic Circle makes of games that have been locked in development hell for one reason or another (in TMC's case the creator's misguided search for perfection), since I've only been with this company for about half a year now, but I did get a pretty big kick out of it, looking sort of from the outside of things.The Magic Circle could be called a critique of the current state of the video games industry, at least the parts of it that delay games indefinitely only to release products that are obviously terrible, as well as making fun of internal developer politics and struggles. There were even a couple of QA jokes I got to enjoy (""Hell hath no fury like a tester scorned""). The game seems to take a crack at just about every video game trend in recent years, from episodic content to streaming let's players, overblown stories and undelivered promises.It's very funny, too, especially in how the game's mechanics of mixing and matching abilities comes to fruition. *HERE THERE BE SPOILERS* a portion of the game requires the manipulation of a live demo; the ""game"" is *supposed* to have the demo hero walk into a room containing a baby, but I was able to manipulate the baby's abilities so that it could fly and breath fire at the demo hero. I'm honestly still laughing about it right now as I type this.The game takes about 3-4 hours to complete, depending on how much time is spent in the end game, but the experience is well worth it.

												This has been an amazing experience. I know this will forever be one of my most favorite games. The story was interesting, the voice actors were satisfying, and what I loved most was that the game never saw you as just another character, but as the player. I also gotta admit that there were some goofy bits to the game as well, which added to the story itself. The only thing I was dissappointed by was the length of the game. I spent a good 4 hours on this game from the moment I finished downloading it and once I was done, I wished that the game had more content in it than it already does. I wished for more areas, creatures, programming bits, and more story. But hey, I shouldnt be wishing for more, I should be praising the game as it is. After all, I do believe its an indie game. Anyway, the game was a fantastic experience in my book and I suggest it to all who enjoy taking things apart and putting them back together in your own way.to summarize,PROS+Very open ended environments+Enticing story+Clever gameplay mechanics+you can make something your pet (Clyde <3)+You can make an animal legless. Genuinely legless+Doorbots are a thing+You can upgrade your pets+Alex Mercer's (Skyrim) voice actor is in the game+Challenging, but fun+Gorgeous OverworldCONS-Small-ish game length-one overworld-Exploring is a tad bit tedious-Only two glove optionsNEUTRAL~Trippy as ♥♥♥♥~semi-sad storyline~MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING HIVELINGS~dying is a game mechanicStill one of the greatest games I have ever played in awhile.

												just pick up the demo if you're unsure if you want to get this game. exploration and expermentation highly encouraged once you engage 'pro mode', which will happen shortly after you finish the joke without a punchline of the 'playtest'/intro section.also is very much a satire on those failed kickstarter and early access games. the enviroment is black and white save for a few choice things, you'll come across dev textures, and in order to obtain the means to command your small makeshift army you even have to do something that is an obvious jab at ubisoft.and that's just the tip of the iceberg...EDIT: once you figure out how to do some of the various puzzles, it begins to build up to the end. and what a gloriously well played end... head stumping, but figurable puzzles, a wide assortment of powers, and enough exploration to ensure you got something to find in the ol' wasteland of development hell.

												Fantastic, surprisingly deep in story and well made except for a couple points near the end which were easily surmounted by a minute's worth of trial and error. Lots to do, lots to explore, and all in a cute package that doesn't overstay its welcome. When the primary flaw of a game is ""I want more of it"", the quality of the basic systems is not an issue. The only regrettable part of the game is how compact it is that you never really get to test the full limits of the game world, but the story ties up in a wonderfully neat fashion. Overall, I'll rate this an 8/10 for a wonderful story, interesting game and fun interface. It's a little steep at $20, but more than worth it, in my opinion.			"

												Ok, so I have somewhat odd tastes when it comes to games.One thing that usually catches my eye (ear?) is good voicework.  I'm a sucker for good voicework that helps to pull me into the game (the Legacy of Kain series comes to mind), and I have to say that this game has some of the best voicework that I've heard in a long, long time.Another plus is the premise.  I was aware of Hack 'n Slash before this game, so I know the concept isn't totally original, but it's very well done and feels very much like being inside an incomplete game.  So far, I've just finished the trade show section and I was rolling in the floor by the end of it.Also, I have fire-breathing parasitic teleporter pads that follow me around and do my bidding.  So yeah, that makes me happy! "

												I'M NOT GOING TO MENTION THE STORY AS I WANT THE PLAYER TO EXPERIENCE IT BY HIMSELF EITHER UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS OR NOT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ANYTHING AT ALL.HAVE you ever come across an individual that's incredibly random, abstract, creative, witty, likes to think that ""rainbow dolphins"" exist and that life consists of twentyhundred elements as well as making unusual connections that somehow seem to make sense and no sense at the same time?!?!  Yep, If that person were a game, it would be this one.First off, why isn't The Magic Circle more popular? This game is (IF NOT) the most eccentric, (LET ME MENTION CREATIVE AGAIN),  fantastic, open-minded (way too open-minded till your brains fall out kinda' thing) humorous playthrough I have ever touched. The story is pretty frickin' compelling too. Note that I USUALLY get bored of games real quick, but this one just makes you wallow in yet more mindless emotionalism every step of the way, and it will make you question your existence.When you're tucked in bed at night and you're brainstorming endless scenarios, this game will leave a mark on you. Not an emotional mark, but an unusual mark that keeps you up at night asking yourself ""WHO THE HELL CAME UP WITH THIS?! AND WHY IS IT SO PERFECT?! AND WHY AM I THINKING ABOUT IT?!"".I can't recommend it enough, I mean EVEN THE PAUSE MENU IS FRICKIN' AWESOME.HOWEVER, I don't recommend this game for individuals who have no flexibility or capacity for imagination and tolerance of others with abstract views or perspectives or anything creative.11/10 for me.9/10 for individuals.WHAT?!?!/10 for individuals with no imagination.

												Modern art is eating itself alive. This is not necessarily a bad thing; this is a meta thing. Comic books are self-referential, and more characters than ever break the fourth wall. Anime about making anime is self-aware and self-consuming. We now have video games, like Undertale, that know they're a game. This is also one of that character.The Magic Circle contends with itself as a game in the making, displaying all the petty gluttony of a developing studio for the attention they want, the accolades they think they deserve, and all the bloody underthings of the human nature of creation. If you think that sounds pretentious, I apologize. The narrative exposes itself through the gameplay, which in turn exposes the gameplay narrative? What are all these words?The gameplay is a metapuzzle, solutions arising from the game framework itself.:( Just play it. I don't have enough words to describe this to you.			"

												Well... I guess, this game deserves a short review from me, something quite uncommon. It is hard to describe it without spoiling the fun of exploring it yourself, but I will try my best at doing the first without doing the latter.This game's focus is story first and foremost. Gameplay, while not being bad, is obviously a mere tool to the narrative. In that regard it is akin to the ""The Beginner's Guide"" or ""The Stanley Parable"", though gameplay is a little bit more complicated in this one. It is relatively unique, basically putting a limited developer editing tools at your disposal in order to ""bend"" the otherwise unwinnable game to your benefit. At the same time, the game itself is relatively short (as it is evident from my time played) and doesn't expand on the idea a whole lot. Aside from collectibles and some mutually exclusive achievements, there is little replayability of note in this case.My verdict is - buy it if you're interested in a short story-driven experience. I feel it does deserve the money. Do take into account the shortness and lack of proper replayability. Maybe you'll want to wait for the sale offer, as much as my heart bleeds saying that. I genuenly believe that developers do deserve the money for this one. I also believe, that the game could do with more content and some other changes.			"

All you need to do is search your hard drvie for a file called ""PROgress"" something or other, then go back a few folders until you can see that it came from a folder called ""Questions"".

It's got a great open world; which although small does have a respectable amount of content in the exploration and puzzle department. If you enjoy games such as Anti-Chamber or The Stanley Parable chances are you will enjoy what this game has to offer. I highly recommend it!			"

												I can say enough about this game but for now let's start here. This game is a masterpiece, it places you right in the middle of it's story which gets super meta and put alongside a soundtrack which captures the setting perfectly. So in conclusion The Magic circle is a little hidden gem with free-form puzzles and a great message. Therefore GET IT.			"

												I am of two minds on The Magic Circle because there are some things it does really well and some things it suffers tremendously on.On the good areas, the graphical design is quite impressive, the sound aesthetic is pleasing, and the overall presentation is phenomenal. Moreover, the story is excellently done. The characters are well developed, believable and thoroughly entertaining to listen to, with top-notch voice acting that makes the dialog thoroughly hilarious to listen to.Unfortunately, when it comes to the gameplay aspects, a dozen little annoyances come up and begin pestering you like dogs nipping at your heels. The biggest, in my opinion, being a lack of a decent way to organize your minions. By the time you reach the mid-game, you will have recruited a small army of mobs and only be able to scroll through them one at a time or by searching through whatever in your immediant field of view, which bogs the pacing down tremendously.The second being that in the in-game hacking minigame it can be difficult to tell whether the option you are hovering over is the one you are attempting to select or the one right below it, and can easily accidently select the wrong button and have to retry the entire section. An indicator to show whatever you are currently posed over would make a world of difference.Thirdly is that some of the puzzles can be quite unintuitive, especially if you are going for 100% completion and are attempting to micromanage an army at the same time, related to point 1, above.None of these points are dealbreakers, but they what could have been an amazing game merely good, and it also is worth bearing in mind that at 20$ for an experience that lasts four hours, fans who are hoping for a longer experience are going to likely wind up disappointed.One final note is that it takes a minimum of two full playthroughs to gain all the acheviements, which I feel is an unfortunate design choice for a humor-focused title such as this. The old adage about a joke never being as funny the second time you hear it rings true in this situation, especially since if someone has already found all of the hidden extras, they are unlikely to want to replay the story again just for completion sake.That being said, I did enjoy my time playing the magic circle, most especially due to the stellar voice acting the cast put on. The story is definitely the highlight here, and I would recommend it to those who enjoy meta-commentary based games such as The Stanley Parable.8/10. Overall postitive recommendation "

												I generally enjoyed it, but there are a couple of spots that are just a bit.... slow.   Like I wish you could sprint. This game rewards you for being clever.  In some ways, I suspect that's why it feels slow.  It kinda leads you by the nose for a bit, and then just places you on your own.  I don't feel like that's actually a fault of this game, I suspect it's more myself bringing in excpectations from other games that either lead you by the nose the whole way, or let you explore from the beginning. As you go through the game you start to find out more about the creators of the broken world your character is in, and I felt rewarded for exporing.If you couldn't guess by the vidoes and the demo (if you played it) this game is pretty meta.   I feel the end of the game where you get to ""do things right"" is pretty awesome and fits really nicley with how meta this game is.Overall I'd say this game is worth getting, though perhaps on sale.

												Genuinely funny in places, and profound in others, this belongs right up there with ""A Beginner's Guide"" when it comes to insights into the creative process, and what it's like to work on large projects, and how fan behaviour and ""love"" for a franchise can foul up such things. The ""game"" aspect of it won't last forever; it's more a taste, an idea for you to play around with, but it's a very good one: modifying the attributes and abilities of creatures is a lot of fun, while it lasts, and there are a few basic puzzles that can be solved in a variety of ways.Put simply, if you're into ""meta"" humour and storytelling, you'll like this. At one point, you get to actually design a level, and one of the characters does a real-time ""Let's Play"" stream of it, commenting on everything from music usage to health potion placement.Also impressive that, while the game is one big reference to its own industry and is full of visible influences from famous games, it doesn't resort to clumsy *direct* references.Just about the only criticism I can aim at TMC is the abrupt nature of its story - it could have leaned just a little more in the direction of Portal, with more actual puzzles and gameplay, and I would have loved to hear just a little more about the characters.

												The Magic Circle is an experiment in control. It allows the player to control certain aspects of the game world that they find themselves in such as enemy capabilities. This is the extent of control that you get as a player but through this limited amount of control you can do almost anything you wish. It's this confinement that breeds creativity. While the writing early on can be a bit awkward the game's story really shines as you find audio logs that flesh out the characters and change logs that show the dynamic between gameplay and art. The only problem I ran into with the game itself was that it was too short, and this just stems from a desire to play more. Overall this game is an amazing look into game design and development hell that can be funny and sad at the same time.			"

I really enjoyed not just what they were saying here but what they were *doing*, and I hope it continues in this vein. I purchased this title because I am so very sick of the undelivered promises, the missing cheek we're never given by the early access debacles. I've been in so many disappointing alphas and betas, and I saw so much familiarity here that made me simultaneously facepalm and laugh helplessly. How true. How terribly, beautifully true. How often we are caught between the rabid internet hate machine and the hype, and left with... well... this!At the point I beat it, I found it to be a charming, bitterly funny romp-- and it's not even complete. Funnier to me than to my less-beta-weary-wife, but still. Give it a shot if you like sendups of the oh so serious game process, or just like interesting puzzles with at least a few possible approaches.And for the Steam crowd:Met a dog.Stripped him for parts and messed with his mind.Added helicopter propellors and hellfire jets, and set him to control others nearby.Accidentally left myself listed as an enemy while tinkering, then set him loose.11/10 would karmic barbeque again.

												I'M NOT GOING TO MENTION THE STORY AS I WANT THE PLAYER TO EXPERIENCE IT BY HIMSELF EITHER UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS OR NOT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ANYTHING AT ALL.HAVE you ever come across an individual that's incredibly random, abstract, creative, witty, likes to think that ""rainbow dolphins"" exist and that life consists of twentyhundred elements as well as making unusual connections that somehow seem to make sense and no sense at the same time?!?!  Yep, If that person were a game, it would be this one.First off, why isn't The Magic Circle more popular? This game is (IF NOT) the most eccentric, (LET ME MENTION CREATIVE AGAIN),  fantastic, open-minded (way too open-minded till your brains fall out kinda' thing) humorous playthrough I have ever touched. The story is pretty frickin' compelling too. Note that I USUALLY get bored of games real quick, but this one just makes you wallow in yet more mindless emotionalism every step of the way, and it will make you question your existence.When you're tucked in bed at night and you're brainstorming endless scenarios, this game will leave a mark on you. Not an emotional mark, but an unusual mark that keeps you up at night asking yourself ""WHO THE HELL CAME UP WITH THIS?! AND WHY IS IT SO PERFECT?! AND WHY AM I THINKING ABOUT IT?!"".I can't recommend it enough, I mean EVEN THE PAUSE MENU IS FRICKIN' AWESOME.HOWEVER, I don't recommend this game for individuals who have no flexibility or capacity for imagination and tolerance of others with abstract views or perspectives or anything creative.11/10 for me.9/10 for individuals.WHAT?!?!/10 for individuals with no imagination.

												Short, but in the same vein as The Stanley Parable, with an active narrator. This game focuses on a game that's not yet finished. That probably will never be finished. Unless you can help. It's enjoyable, and it's short.			"

												This game is pretty short but also pretty freaking awesome. The concept is unique and interesting. The execution is fun and the story is amusing too. One cutscene near the end of the story got a bit long-winded but other than that it was great. The ability at the end to make a level for the AI character to play through and fake review was super cool and adds a lot to the replayability of this otherwise short game.			"

												The Magic Circle is a very unique game that requires some outside the box thinking. the story is very good as is the gameplay, if you can get into the story you will really love the game and could spend a while completing it and finding new ways to solve problems. If I had one negative thing to say about it, it would be that it was a rather short game though this did not detract from its overall feel.			"

												Ah The Magic Circle.  What can I say about this game.  First off is that it is boring, I mean I have about 5 hours put in this game and I was about to quit half way through.  It's a very weird game.  The best way to subscribe it would be that of an Adventure game with some pretty confusing puzzles.  Like I said before this game is boring, but ironically I am glad I stuck through with it because it gets good at the end.  The first part of the game is almost like a grind, but near the ending this is where it truly shines.  Oh and by the way this is a surreal game.  I mean you are literally playing a deleted character in a game called The Magic Circle. It sounds confusing but if you started playing it would make sense.  Although my dislike with the beginning of the game, the ending shines light on the gaming industry and how fame gets to peoples head.  But it also shines a light on how people think they know whats going on, but truly they have no idea.  Don't be diswayed by the beginning of this review, this is a game in which you have to play, you have to experience this game.  The best parts of the game was the old schoold character and the conference scene.  So yes I would definitely recommend this game even if you don't like adventure puzzle games, which I certainly don't like.  P.S. I know I only have about 5 hours, but that is basically the whole game. You can probably finish it alot faster, but again with those confusing puzzles.  Also, at the end you have to do some editing stuff which was really cool at first, but when it looked like it wanted me to continue I quit.  So basically the beginning sucks, the middle is really awesome, and by the ending you get bored again.  Also I wanted to say that I got this game in a Humble Monthly bundle.  "

												Frankly speaking I don't know what to say about this game as it really feels more like a narrative than a game.  I got this from a Humble Monthly and it kind of feels like a ""fodder"" game for the month. Premise is intriguing but in the execution it is somehow lacking. In the end,  I still got a somewhat enjoyable experience out of it.			"

												So far I have only played the first few moments, and I've enjoyed what I've seen and will do a more robust review once done. The main reason I'm giving a psitive review right now (beyond that I already love the concept), though, is due to how dedicated the Devs are to helping their customers. I had an issue that they personally responded to and provided extensive help within a couple hours of posting it.This is an examplary showcase of the passion and dedication of these Devs, which I am excited to see translated into their work!

												A very engaging and fun ""exploration/adventure"" game, with a slight lean towards programming, or game-glitch finding. If anything, a bit too short, and some weird ""what do I do here...oh nothing"" moments, which sets a story, but leaves you unfulfilled when it ends.Some brief achievements hunts are left around, but I was left wanting more. The mini-game at the end to try and make a 10/10 game is fun for a bit, but the ""pro"" guide is buggy enough for this game to be worth between £5-8, but not more due to lack of replayability and brevity.Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of fun to be had, but I wish it was longer.

												An amazing experience from start to finish! The Magic Circle is a stylistic adventure game / light puzzler, It's a game that combines good gameplay with amazing story telling for an overall fantastic package. The gameplay essentially revolves around breaking the game's inital ruleset through built in mechanics. That won't make much sense until you've played it, but if you ever got kicks out of using no-clip in a game and exploring all the places you weren't supposed to see then this is right up your alley.The plot exists on many levels, from a basic look a dev' team stuck in development hell, to an instrospective and existential view of all gamers and why we play the games we do. All this, complete with easily the best voice acting I've heard in a game of this size. I was able to beat the game with 95% of the collectibles in about 5 hours, which I think was the perfect length. It also means that people who don't enjoy the gameplay can still experience the story with relatively little effort.I highly reccomend this as a lesson to all people interested in game design or a perfect afternoon experience. Play if you've liked games such as 'The Stanley Parable'.			"

Early Access Review
								The Magic Circle is as much an allegory about the games industry as much as it is a game in and of itself. In the game you are a player character that is trapped inside a game that will never be finished. Your goal? Well that is not quite clear in the beginning. Exploration of the world, and who you are, are the main driving forces early on. As the story develops you begin to learn the fate of the people who were working on the game, and where everything went wrong. The game likes to play with your expectations and uses the fact that you are in a broken, unfinished game, to play with the idea of bugs and glitches. That is why when the game crashed on me one time, I thought it was part of the game.Overall I have enjoyed my time with The Magic Circle. With a unique mash-up of art styles, witty and funny characters, and a combat system more like Pokemon than a first person action game, The Magic Circle is a game that anyone can enjoy.Similar Titles:Portal 2The Stanley ParableThe Talos PrincipleIf you would like to see more of the game, check out my Indie Showcase of The Magic Circle

												Short version: The Magic Circle is an ambitious, original game with a great premise that it doesn't quite manage to fully deliver. Even so, I had a blast.Long version:So, the idea is that this is supposedly an eagerly anticipated sequel that's been in development hell for something like 20 years and is still a long way from finished. There's cut content that you can restore, mechanics that were planned but never implemented (or axed right in front of you), change logs scattered throughout, the developers drop in and have conversations with each other and with you (assuming you're a tester), etc. It's a great idea and unfortunately, The Magic Circle just doesn't quite manage to sell it. It's not large enough or layered enough with older versions (and logs, etc) to genuinely feel like a project that longrunning and embattled. It's more of a broad overview of what something like that might look like, on a macro scale. It's probably fine in the long run - this is an indie game made by a small team on a small budget, and it's not really fair to expect anything quite as elaborate as the premise suggests. But it does undercut the illusion a bit.Similarly, the writing definitely gives a broad, parodic sense of the sort of personalities and conflicts that might go into a debacle of that sort and the clashing priorities at work, but because they're so broad, they never quite feel like real people and the commentary on gaming culture and development is pretty surface level. But hey, it's funny and it works well enough in context, just don't expect deep insider insights.Those are really my main complaints, though. The game itself is brilliant, with a core mechanic in the main section that lends itself to a huge range of solutions to problems and a sort of anarchic tinkering with the game structure that is really enjoyable and beautifully realized, right down to visual representation on literally every editable object of all the different traits they can be assigned. And while the game isn't particularly large, that overworld has plenty of nooks and crannies to hide logs and other collectibles and special creatures and such. Heck, I'm still missing a couple and I could swear I've scoured everywhere. And while the scope undercuts the simulation a bit, there's some neat tricks with desktop simulation and such that help sell it. There are also a couple of later segments that are fun (if a little didactic) in other ways and while they're not as original or massively appealing as the core conceit, they're still well done with a bunch of scope for doing your own thing. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my time with TMC and definitely recommend it.			"

												I got this game through the humble bundle monthly and was not disappointed. I started playing it and found it hard to put down. It's not a game you will find yourself playing for months on end but the time you do spend is fun. You get to edit the game as you go along, break the rules and my favourite break the fourth wall. The voice acting is out of this world. I could listen to Ish, Maze and Coda read a dictionary. I had a little army of my own following me around who I could set upon my enemies with a single click. Love this game.Also, the devs are on top of things. I had an issue, posted about it in the tech support forums. There was an update to the game the next day that fixed the problem. Fan for life.			"

												An interesting game, with a unique mix of visual styles.  The gameplay mechanics seemed like they could have been flushed out more.  It was fun to play around with, but didn't go as deep as I was hoping it might.The transitions between the different at styles was fun, and didn't over stay it's welcome.  The storyline was... I don't know how to describe it other than preachy, or self aggrandizing.  Finished it in an afternoon, which was long enough in terms of the story line, but again some additional depth to the core gameplay gimmick would have benefited the game, I think.   I can see other games ripping the mechanic, and possibly doing just that.In the end, it was fun, and I recommend this game.			"

												I'd put this solidly somewhere from ""not bad"" to ""pretty good."" I can't say it resonated deeply with me, but I'm not a creator nor do I have an immense creative drive. Perhaps this game hits better with those who enjoy spending time making up worlds and desiging levels, or perhaps those more familiar with the fan-circle, forums, and other stereotypes.Part of me almost wished the sci-fi elements were a whole game because the music/art style was pretty spot on, but besides that.. I dunno. This is one of those games I can't go into a lot of detail about because, I think, a lot of it is more of how you see, interpret, and pursue things. But overall I'd say I enjoyed it reasonably, even if it didn't resonate to the depths of my soul.As much as I know everyone is still caught in the ""too-popular"" vs Hipster mode about it, it's not an Undertale experience. TMC takes the fourth wall down a lot sooner and faster, and in much more obvious ways, though it does toy a bit. At the end most of everything is neatly wrapped up and I don't find myself deeply emotionally moved nor attached - but that isn't necessarily bad, nor was it necessarily the designers' goal to do those things, but it's definitely different. I feel like it was maybe supposed to be a bit more ""Ah!"" for me, but again - I think this may just not be quite the game that really tickles the deeper fancies of someone who doesn't find the nuances of designing levels and such to be especially compelling, or perhaps someone who doesn't have direct experience with dealing with ""fans"" in a situation like that.I'm really not sure.. but ultimately, I can't say that I'd strongly recommend this to everyone and anyone, it definitely is more of a niche title, but that isn't a bad thing.

												A great combination of video game satire and clever puzzles that let you solve them how you want.The only real criticism I have is that the game is rather short and could do with more puzzles (and content in general), and the controls could use some work, especially when using an xbox controller (why does this game use right dpad for map view?). It's still miles better than the Stanley Parable (the game that it's easiest to compare this against) given that it actually has gameplay and the dialog is just as good.I'm hoping this game gets a proper sequel.

												This is one of the more unique games I've played and I was kind of down when it ended. I don't really like combat very much, and I like having little virtual friends, and I am big on customization, so this game was pretty ideal for me. It was also really beautiful in a different sort of way.			"

												I actually have no idea what happened in this game.  I think it was a pleasently enjoyable experience.  Anyone who is willing to try something interesting, has a couple hours to spend, and willing to shell a few bucks will probably enjoy this game,  Good  Funny and interesting - There is a lot of interesting mechanics as well as funny dialog  Unique - A one of a kind experience, I don't think I have ever played a game as meta as this game.  The artstyle was very creative, you play in a half finished game and the art style reflects thatBad  Nothing major.  Most of my gripes come form lack of direction, but the open-world part of it during the game portion. "

 I got this through Humble Monthly and I'm glad it did The game opens and if you've played Stanley Parable, this game will punch you right in the gut will all of its self-inflicted humor. I thought soon afterward ""I really hope this isn't all the game has. Its great but it'll get boring after three or four jokes about it.""No, it gets better and quickly. After going through a pretty nice tutorial, you're made aware of your goal and is thrown into the world.Right so the main gimmick: Editing those you meet.Yeah you find like, a dog thing. Trap it. Edit it. Take all of its behaviors and make it your pet.There you go you got a dog thing following you around.Copy paste. Behold puzzles.How do you complete it when you can't edit them due to 'groupthink' and these little bugs will kill you.Dog Thing. Give it melee and force it to fight the little bugs.How do you beat their queen? I have no idea. Figuring that out now.There is no wrong way to the beat the puzzles you find, only many ways to not do so.Its got a neat story and is overall pretty fun. I just wish we were allowed to color the landscape as we could in Epic Mickey.This game is eons better than epic mickey by the way.7/10.			"

												The Magic Circle is an underrated hell of a gem. The premise of the game revolves around exploring and 'editing' the game world while defying the developers. The world is small, but has an open world feeling of hidden zones for the player to find. The story itself goes beyond the sand-boxed world you explore and delves into many fourth wall references. This game also features a mini-game which allows you to build your own game for the AI to play.I cannot state enough the game's design being unique and novel that is, combining the fourth wall and game play creation. The voice acting was fantastic and really sold the characters.This game is definitely a 10/10.			"

												Have you seen the film ""Adaptation""? If not, watch it, if for no other reason than Nicholas Cage plays a pair of twin brothers. If you have seen it however, this is the video game equivolent in both story and creative quality. An indie masterpiece if there ever was one and by the looks of things, the single most underrated game on steam. Do not worry about the game length - I think you will find the price is fair Even if it is a 4 hour playthrogh kind of game. A game for the ""true"" games fan and for those who take an interest in how games are made. Just give these guys enough money to make another game! They are an asset to the world of gaming!			"

												How meta can you get? While Stanley Parable deconstructed the act of playing a game, The Magic Circle deconstructs the entire development process.You're basically playing as yourself, exploring and ""testing"" an unfinished 3D shooter from a once-legendary game director. The game has been stuck in development hell for a very, very long time, and you're tasked by the powers within to finally set things straight once and for all.This is mostly done by solving some environmental puzzles and tweaking the internal parameters of the game world objects (similar to Hack'n'Slash, if you've played that one). Reprogramming enemy behaviors makes all kinds of weird and messy solutions possible, and the game actively encourages you to use whatever means to get the job done.During all this, you're constantly finding commentary snippets, changelogs, deleted content and actually seeing the developer egos clashing about the state, mechanics and philosophy of the game. And after all that is said and done, it really gets crazy.Discussing about the last hour of the game would really be doing The Magic Circle a huge disservice. Let's just say that all the problems, considerations and points of view that go into making a big budget video game really do get thoroughly explored in a rather ingenious way.How much actual enjoyment one gets out of The Magic Circle depends. It's not a particularly fun game to play, and the graphics range from drab to gaudy with no real middle ground. The music is just, well, incomplete and bad. But that's how it's supposed to be, you know?Overall, I can't really recommend TMC as a game. I will recommend it as an experience, though. The ideas the game brings forth are quite valuable, but only in a cerebral, chin-stroking kind of way. It is an experiment that doesn't always work, but if you've ever cursed a developer for moving a release date of a hotly anticipated game, you might get something out of The Magic Circle.			"

												This has been an amazing experience. I know this will forever be one of my most favorite games. The story was interesting, the voice actors were satisfying, and what I loved most was that the game never saw you as just another character, but as the player. I also gotta admit that there were some goofy bits to the game as well, which added to the story itself. The only thing I was dissappointed by was the length of the game. I spent a good 4 hours on this game from the moment I finished downloading it and once I was done, I wished that the game had more content in it than it already does. I wished for more areas, creatures, programming bits, and more story. But hey, I shouldnt be wishing for more, I should be praising the game as it is. After all, I do believe its an indie game. Anyway, the game was a fantastic experience in my book and I suggest it to all who enjoy taking things apart and putting them back together in your own way.to summarize,PROS+Very open ended environments+Enticing story+Clever gameplay mechanics+you can make something your pet (Clyde <3)+You can make an animal legless. Genuinely legless+Doorbots are a thing+You can upgrade your pets+Alex Mercer's (Skyrim) voice actor is in the game+Challenging, but fun+Gorgeous OverworldCONS-Small-ish game length-one overworld-Exploring is a tad bit tedious-Only two glove optionsNEUTRAL~Trippy as ♥♥♥♥~semi-sad storyline~MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING HIVELINGS~dying is a game mechanicStill one of the greatest games I have ever played in awhile.

Despite how quickly I got to the end of itm I would happily replay this to find all the things I missed, and try some alternative solutions.If you like video games and are interested in how they're developed, and the idea of playing around with the development tools of a broken game, using them to solve puzzles, interests you at all, then The Magic Circle is for you.

It was fun to play around with, but didn't go as deep as I was hoping it might.The transitions between the different at styles was fun, and didn't over stay it's welcome.  The storyline was... I don't know how to describe it other than preachy, or self aggrandizing.  Finished it in an afternoon, which was long enough in terms of the story line, but again some additional depth to the core gameplay gimmick would have benefited the game, I think.   I can see other games ripping the mechanic, and possibly doing just that.In the end, it was fun, and I recommend this game.			"

												This is definitely a very unique game. The way I would describe it is a Metroidvania: You stumble upon unique abilities what will help you reach other places. These abilities however, are not for yourself; The game relies on ""reporgramming"" creatures to do what you want them to do and help you overcome obstacles on the way. A very unique and satisfying system!The story is quite unique as well. As advertised, the game is ""unfinished"", and the team is arguing about pretty much every aspect of the game (The voice acting for this is excellent). This is done in an enjoyable way, and I found them fun to listen to.The only downside is this game was a bit short for my taste. Not in a ""Not worth"" way, but that I was wanting more!			"

												An enjoyable game, if you can get past the overly preachy tone.  You're in the role of a playtester of a game that's been stuck in development hell for the past 20 years, and with the help of a mysterious ""Old Pro"" you gain the ability to glitch and alter the game from the inside.  The mix-and-match critters mechanic is great fun; the defining moment for me was hopping onto my pet rock to ride it into battle - my flying, laser-beam-shooting pet rock, that is.  You can bet that ""Ride of the Valkyries"" was running through my head at the time.  The flamethrower zombie I made earlier was rather funny, too, and then there's the baby...As others have said, the main game is fairly short, although searching for all the hidden logs can extend it a bit as well as help flesh out the main characters.  So don't go into this expecting some kind of Skyrim-like epic.  But if you manage to catch it on sale it's a fun way to spend an afternoon.			"

												The most sure-fire way of making an Oscar-bait movie is to make a film that has Hollywood and film-making at its core. I’m not sure that in the world of video games, the same principle applies when you make a game about game development, because otherwise, this game would’ve won.It’s a fun little romp through a satirized version of the turbulent development of a long-anticipated game and you are a beta-tester for this still fairly broken game. It makes fun of games stuck in development hell and constant course corrections over the years (Duke Nukem Forever comes to mind) as well as over-inflated game developer egos with hints towards Richard Garriott and Peter Molyneux and doesn’t stop before also making fun of fanboys and their perceived entitlement of an intellectual property based on their admiration for said intellectual property. To say more about the narrative of the game would spoil a lot of the surprises, but I found it highly entertaining. The dialogues are written with tons of levity and it’s clear that it isn’t meant as a scathing critique of any one thing, but more of a lighthearted satire at the expense of how seriously we sometimes take this medium. But what really brings the script together is the fantastic voice-acting from all the characters.Gameplaywise it continues the theme of game development, with you traversing an unfinished world filled with hostile creatures that you yourself can’t fight because the designer opted to remove the combat altogether right when you start playing. But you’re given the ability to manipulate the game world itself through a very simplistic form of changing the source code. You’re able to undelete things since garbage collection apparently hasn’t been implemented yet and you can retool properties and variables of objects and creatures, turning enemies into allies and giving them a variety of different abilities with tons of creative potential with all the available combinations. It’s not a very deep system and there isn’t a ton of finesse to it, but there are a few puzzles you need to solve with this mechanic. If there’s one thing that bothered me about the game it was the final stretch where you are tasked to create a “level” of this fictional game yourself. You don’t really need to put any thought into it, but it’s really the low-point of the game for me, since it takes just a little bit too long and the punchline to that particular part of the game isn’t the funniest. The game is also fairly short. You can beat it in as little as two hours if you don’t go out of your way of collecting the “developer” commentaries and notes which only serve to provide some additional humor and I’m not entirely convinced that it deserves the $20 price tag, but I still have to praise the game for being primarily focused on a narrative and theme while still managing to provide the player with interesting if not massively rewarding gameplay and not just a walking simulator, so I’d definitely recommend it at a discount.

												Played it and finished it in an hour half. I realized how short it was and got a little upset, but I went back to try getting all the achievements. So far I have all but one, which is ""Compelete everything"".After doing that, I'm really loving the extra detail that was put in behind the main objective as 'side information' or so. I wouldn't call it side-story, because there isn't much to go on, besides what is plainly put out in the beginning. I'm more trailing on now than anything, so!I like it. I like it a lot. Maybe it was a bit short, but I liked the idea that it makes fun of Early Access games and developers that don't keep their promises of finishing said games. I hope there's more content in the future, either as free attachments or rather cheap at least. For a twenty dollar game? Pretty meh about, if you have the money. Ten dollars? Definitely.Edit: I realized how short and detail lacking the review was, so I came back to write some more. Without spoiling anything, there's a lot of detail that is hidden away. There's an objective, and that's you, as the player, is tasked with breaking a game that was never finished, and finishing it yourself. Yet there's more, so much more. In the game, there is side information that's completely optional to find, and it tells the story of the 'developers', and I mean the ones in the game; Why did they make the game, why did they stop, what is going on in their life, and why are they okay with not finishing a product? Then there's more information, and more, and more. Then there's you, the player. What are 'you' going to do, in an unfinished game, that cannot be finished?What will you do?			"
