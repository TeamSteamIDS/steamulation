								At the moment this game is just a waste of time. Trust me. I didn't rely on the people in this review section, and here I am, tossing money out of the window at a mobile port that has no merit on PC whatsoever. I know you all don't have time to read text that I write, so I devide my review in Bulletpoints for easier confus- ehem, understanding.+ Pixels+ HD Mode+ All ""Elements"" unlocked from the start- Bad PC port that doesn't support wide screen (Ugly, nauseating borders)- Not even Sound Volume Sliders- Bad AI pathfinding- Nimble Editor, Mouse/Keyboard Pottential not used.- Grossly oversized UI (In my opinion, if you like buttons covering up 1/6 of your screen at any time...)- Look at the DLC box. The guys at Pixowl are already doing the TERRIBLE DLC thing.- ""Mana"" (In-game currency) not removed, Microtransactions beware.At the moment, this Early Access suffers from a bad case of Mobile Port Trauma. Plague Inc. Has shown us how to do a good PC port: You take the working iOS/Android Concept, rebuild the Game in a new, adaptable engine, Consistently add new features while listening to the community for support, feedback and translations.This Game is placed in one line with Tiny Troopers and the lot. No Merit to be on steam, Buyer's remorse galore.Now, If you excuse me, I have to eat chocolate. A lot of it.			"

Early Access Review
								This game looked so, soooooo good. But what I got was a waste of money that I could have used to buy Don't Starve, but instead I got:1. A game with a confusing tutorial (the developer has asked me to detail this, SPOILER ALERT: In one of the early tutorials in which I was tasked to mine out a mountain to get metal which i would use to fill a square. There was no mountain, just a square)2. Lacking graphics even for early access3. Bad sound design4. No way to quit out other than Xing out, and when you do it doesn't save your game. (fixed, may have been a bug)It has potential, but for now avoid it. I want a refund, because this game is a waste of time.EDIT: Shut up you guys, I know it's supposed to be 8-bit, it still looks like crap. Early Access is no excuse for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, there still has to be SOME level of quality.EDIT NUMBER 2: Ok, I'm sorry if my review sounded ragey but I was just seriously disappointed. For those of you who didn't guess, I rate Early Access games as if they are full games in order to help the devs make the game better in the full version. I get having a pixel art stylization but it still doesn't look good. Maybe bump it up to at least 16 bit, or be consistent and make them as detailed as the tutorial guy in the game.Furthermore, I'm tired of people yelling at me and me not being able to respond. If you're going to make a comment, have the comments open in your profile. Otherwise, if a comment frustrates me, I'm just going to delete it.ANOTHER EDIT: I have played the game for longer and found that it is actually pretty ok. The save glitch is fixed, it might have just been a bug that happened once. But the graphics seriously get in the way on the later campaigns in which you can't see what thing you're supposed to light/power/blow up/ etc. It's ok, but I'd still wait for it to be finished.

 To put it simply, it doesn't work. - When launching the game for the first time, it will ask you to enter your name. You can't click on anything, or it will crash the game.- In ""create"" mode, none of the tools work, except the eraser, and screenshot tool. Everything else crashes the game. (That's already 1/4 of the game that doesn't work)- In the mission mode, the tools still don't work. (Thats 3/4 of the game that doesn't work).- Finially, the gallery feature crashes when downloading/viewing other's creations. That's right.  The game does not work.  Conclusion: This game is simply a mediocre mobile game, ported over terribly (that's an understatement), to the point where the game does not even work, period. They didn't even put any effort into changing any of the features in-game to match the fact that it is not on a mobile device. Do not waste your time, nor money, on this scam. Here's some other gripes:- About 20 minutes of gameplay, until you get bored. - Deceptive trailers - Strange resolution errors- especially when starting up the game, and the menu.			"

								I have to admit, this is a fun little game. But it's not worth $10. Granted, it has a lot of interesting concepts at work, and maybe if it wasn't just a pixel based game it might be something, but as it stands, it's not. Also, all the images above to sell the game are downright lies. All those images are splash screens, and aren't of the actual game. Any ""people"" in the game are made of six pixels, and have only rudimentary A.I. at best; it's less like a god simulator in the same world as ""Black and White"" or ""Godus"" and more along the lines of a worse version of ""From Dust."" My suggestion is to avoid this game, unless ten dollars isn't a huge amount of money for you, but there are better games for this amount. Quite frankly, it doesn't meet the ""dollar per hour"" standard I use, even at $10.			"

								I have the mobile version, and even though the mobile one crashes from time to time it still runs much better than the pc one. This one lags horribly, especially when using such things as the earthquake. It makes static noises. And it just works like garbage in general. On top of that the screenshot that shows mobile size vs pc size is a load of bull. It's not landscape at all. In fact, there's a rock looking skin on either side of your screen and no option showing that you can change it to a larger size. Finally, the game is EXTREMELY behind in updates compared to the mobile device. I can honestly recommend this game for pc. And there's literally so many bugs that it SOMEHOW managed to show a quest that was further ahead on one and it wouldn't let me pass when I did the correct items. And it takes forever for the game to accept that you correctly completed something.			"

Early Access Review
								I decided to completely edit this review because of it's hostility, just so you know alot of the not helpfuls and the discussions are / is probably because I was a real cynical prick with my previous review.I have only played this game for a short time so I dont know if I just missed alot or just need more time to get used to it, but here you go (dont depend too much on this, take this more of as an ""addon"" for the other reviews)I firstly want to say that, the physics are pretty awesomely made, besides the thing that the water keeps having spasms on the top layer and cant be kept still without freezing it completely, which is really annoying when you want to make oceans or lakes or ponds just for the looks.Also, the graphics / the art are amazingly done, however there again, the resolution has not been edited in a single way so youre basically just gonna play a resized / larger pixel version of the Ipad game. What seriously disappointed me, were the humans. They basically either sit or move around slowly, without any walking animation which would be okay, if it wasnt for this really annoying and stupid max cap of 6 humans.Also, you dont directly get everything in the game.Alot of elements, and almost every tree and ai etc, has to be bought with ""mana"", which you only get from finishing quests, and from what i know this game doesnt feature a way to bypass those yet, so if you ONLY want a sandbox experience without having to do alot of quests, then this isnt your best choice either.The game actually has ALOT of potential to become better, however as of now, it simply isnt worth the 9,99 for early access. Theres alot of linear games that I personally find better than this, and for me non-linear is usually much better.Alot of the potential comes from the devs which seem to be pretty cool, and want to hear from bugs and cool things to do from / with this game all the time, they are really interactive with the community so I dont think this game is a ""Refund-now"" case.The music isnt the best, but it isnt bad either. So heres my summarized score:Gameplay: 2/10Graphics: 8/10 (9/10 if it wasnt for the mentioned scaling / no resolution situation)Music: 4/10Potential: 8/10Devs: 8/10Overall: 5/10 Also, these are some things the devs should fix to make this game be better and recieve a good score:First off, scratch the human maximal capacity. This is what mostly ruined the game for me. I can only spawn 6 humans, I mean theyre just like 6 pixels that stand around or randomly walk into two directions, I think we should be able to spawn as many as we want to.Second, add some better deaths. I throw lava on a human i expect to see him run around burning and turning into a charred corpse or atleast just run around and then fall down, but he just simply disappears. It made me think if that was intended or if it was just a glitch in the game.Also, you talk about a zombie survival mode. So when we shoot zombies will they also just simply disappear in a mere nano second? Third, give us an option to, for example have normal water that doesnt have spasms on the top layer, shooting blue pixels up the sky every second. Just some still water so I can create a lake or pond and have it be there instead of disappearing in mere minutes.Fourth, an option to unlock everything with just one click. This game is supposed to be a sandbox after all, so I would like to have more freedom of what I want to do, instead of being forced to do certain stuffs and quests so I can buy me a pine tree to grow.Fifth, More Modding Support, like creating custom creatures or elements.Sixth, more human varations. Right now theres only one man and one woman and the workers.Thats all I can think of. These are the truly gamebreaking things in this game for me.You fix / adress these issues and I'll probably give this a good review, considering the graphics and future updates stuff look / sound really good.

												I have no idea why so many people are upset with this game.Some say it doesn't work, some say it's laggy, some say it's just a port directly from mobile.Well sure if your computer can't handle NES graphics and its processor is a toaster then you probably can't play it, and yeah it's a port from mobile, except in create mode you get a lot more room, there's no buyable products (unlike mobile)you get everything for free once you buy the game.The Sandbox gives you everything you love about other sandbox games and smashes them all together, you are a god, literally.I suggest this game to my fellow Tomogachi users from way back when, because you can do the exact same thing in this game with humans, but on a much larger scale!Want to nuke it all start over? Why use the ""New"" button, just use a nuke!Want to simulate a meteor crashing into earth? Go for it, there's meteors.Do you like having control over everything single thing right down to the atom? Well of course you do, you're human.Get this game, JUST DO IT!			"

												Pros: - Just like on mobile phone!         - The performance is good. The other reviewers has probably a very bad computers.         - you get all the levels that are paid extra on mobile phones.Cons: - Just like on mobile phone! .. Seriously the resolution of this game makes my eyes hurt. The fullscreen on 27"" fullHD monitor is just bad. I played it for couple of minutes and my eyes still hurts from it. (there's actually the windowed mode if you press F1, still more eye friendly, not so pixelated font would be great)          - same small workspace. Wish I could have a bigger workspace on PC.I would like The Sandbox if there was some work visible in the porting this game to PC. Like some extra features that would not work for mobile phones but would be handy for PCs (bigger resolution and workspace) For someone the fact that it's exactly the same as on mobile phones can be a positive aspect. For me it's not and that's why I am not recommending this game.			"

Early Access Review
								I love this game, thats my opinion in short, its got a good campaign, and people can really challenge themselves to do things, my only criticisms are1. You can buy your way through the campaign, it costs 150 in game currency to pass any mission, most missions give you over 200 or even into the 1000s if completed, and for some reason when you skip the mission you still get the in game currency, so you can basicly buy your way through the campaign and still make a profit, you should either make the skipping more expensive, ie for a mission where you can win 1000, it should cost 1200, or when someone skips they should not get any form of bonus.2. I have a windows 8.1 computer and I experience a few crashes now and then, about every 20 mins my game crashes and I have to reload, its a bit more of an annoyance then an actual problem, but it may draw people away from the game.

												Neat pixel game - there are a huge amount of interacting systems. Chemistry, weather, temperature, electricity, and more flows through the pixel worlds you can make.It does have a few downsides though - the interface is a bad mobile port (for example, the zoom in screen tells me I can draw by touching with one or two hands... I'm using a mouse, I don't have a touchscreen), there are bugs and crashes (I've had at least 3 crashes in 8 hours of playing), and the character controls are simply terrible. Ultimately though, I just can't not love a game where I can evaporate pixelated water into a cloud system that then goes on to start a thunderstorm that powers some heaters under some rocks that then melts into magma that then causes some nearby oil to catch fire that then causes acid to be released onto metal generating electricity and powering a laser that is reflected by a series of mirrors that goes onto to do.... Anything really. All of that and more can be placed in the game via the placement of 8 bit pixels. It's magic.			"

Early Access Review
								Alright, now having sunk quite a bit more time into this game, I think its high  time i gave it a proper review.The Sandbox is literally just that, a sandbox. It hands you a bunch of elements (quite a few actually, with the ability to make more), gives you a blank canvas and says ""well, im going to go over here for a tic. Go have fun"". The elements it offers you are all scripted to interact differently with eachother, and will often transmute themselves to a different element (lava dropped in water becomes stone, wood burning produces ash). And once you get beyond the simple stuff, you can move onto the complexities of ""emitters"" and the wonderfully blank/sentient creatures that you can play with.With all these tools combined you are left with a game without a plot, and without any real set goals... and its Fantastic!  (note: there ARE a plethora of ""story mode"" levels, as well as a campaign mode that serves as a more in depth tutorial)So all in all, i think this is a delightful little time waster as long as you dont expect AAA blockbuster content from it. THis is not a CoD clone, this is not Half LIfe 3, this is just a cute little toy you can play with and kill some time...the price is a tad steep tho. So get it on saleTL:DR version3rd Person Omnicient pixel spawning game. Good for wasting time7/10			"

								Review: SandboxI Was SUPER hyped when this came to steamI Was a massive fan of the IOS Game, I loved the challednges and the thrill of collecting mana to complete the next stage and buying new elements.Why The f*** is there mana in this game? if f****** useless!When you buy the game you get 5000 ( Or Is IT 50000?) mana Which is completly useless seeing thse fact that all the elements are unlcked from the start.And Why Do we have to play the campaigns in order? i have to complete tonnes of other campaings before i get to play the zombie campaing! Screw You.Dont Get me wrong TONNES of potential But honestly it would be MUCH better if it was just ported to pc with pc configerd controls4/10 Base Drops   1       2       3        4DROP DA BASS : BAH WAH WHE WOH			"

								NOT READY.Not really sure if this is done enough, I mean it says early access and all, but it's definitely not as pretty as they present it to be in the photos, It looks pretty much like the phone version but blown up, Which wouldin't be bad but it's all pixely looking (more so then usual I mean, Up close) when they said 4x bigger worlds I assumed it would be alot more zoomed out...As for if I recommend? Well the IOS game was fun, especially with a braniac. And if they fix things ups like im thinking they will, Then yes I do...As for now? No. I really don't. Not yet.			"

								It's a nice concept and all, but, I am having this problem that I can't press any buttens. They don't seem to respond when I click on them. The first objective I get assinged when I enter, I can only press ESC instead of the regular buttens that are on the screen to start the given objective. When I have done that simple task, I get rewarded with 200 of that mana stuff. As soon as that menu appears, a butten on the screen, ""Next day"", that seems to be the butten to press to continue, and it doesn't work. ESC doens't work here. I opened taskmanager to close the game, and I thought restarting the game would fix, but no. I kind of assume it's because of resolution of computer that does this. But I have no way ingame to change that.			"

												Great game, buggy. I had a hard time getting it to work, but in my case the fix was simple - I just needed to launch the beta version of it.The game has a campaign; many, actually. I haven't beat even 1/5 of them..They're puzzle solving campaigns mainly, and they're pretty darn fun.My only complaint is that I have no option to choose non-HD mode or being able to set the bounds of the level when playing creative, but you can do a sort-of workaround for that by loading somebody elses regular map from the 'gallery' and clearing everything.Music frequently becomes glitched in a half-repeating loop, but usually that only happens when you've been playing the game for a while.Overall, if you need a relaxing but more casual ""minecraft"" experience with plenty of campaigns and room for you to be creative, this is your game. Many fun nuanced mechanics to learn.It's plenty of lazy entertainment. Fallen asleep to this game a few times.			"

								I have not played this game that much (I recently bought it) but it have already crashed TWO times!The first time was after I completed ""the first day"" and the second time were when I was about to fill up the whole screen with acid.The first time the game crashed, I just returned to desktop, but the second time I weren't able to get the Windows menu up, use F8 or ctrl+alt+delete. My Windows crashed.(I've played for 0.3 hours on laptop, and WAAYYY TOO LOOOOONG on my mobile phone)I love the idea of the game, and I loved the mobile version, but I must say that I haven't gotten a good new impression of the PC version.

												update 5 September: This http://i.imgur.com/6JSuL9y.png early access screenshot shows the devs stating that the final version pricing will be $15 deluxe version, $13 regular version, $4 humans DLC and that by buying in early access you will save money. This turned out not to be the case. The release price is $10 and humans dlc is still free.update 12 July: no further work was done on the game between them announcing they would have to take a break from working on the game (despite not having released an update for months) and them releasing it.Update 29 June 2015: With no further work done on the game and issues outstanding since it first hit steam I cannot recommend this game at all unless you buy it on deep discount and are aware it has problems such as: no windowed mode, references to tapping and drawing with fingers left over from mobile port, game doesn't exit when you ext it so you have to kill it with task manager, game creates massive number of ""ffdshow"" taskbar icons while running etc.Update 21 May 2015: Devs have issued statement that they won't be able to work on the pc version for a while due to ""circumstances"". Given the complete lack of progress for ages on the title anyway I would say the game is abandoned at this point. I am therefore changing my recommendation to thumbs down. For the record it was on 52/107 (49%) found helpful before I changed it.Update 27 Jan 2015: Although my review still stands, development on this title has been very, very slow. It's clear that it's not being worked on anything like full time. More like ""a couple of hours on a weekend once a month if you are lucky"". There are bugs which have been reported from when it first launched that are not being fixed. The dev adds more content but doesn't fix these issues: no ability to run windowed, creates lots of ffdshow icons isn systray, game doesn't exit when you exit so you have to kill it with task manager.It is fun now, but I wouldn't bank on it changing much or the bugs in it ever being fixed. For some people this means crashing or unable to actually run the thing.Original review follows:---------------------------------------------------------------If you have been around those areas of the web dedicated to free games you have probably seen a lot of what are termed ""Falling Sand"" games. Basically you have a blank screen and can ""draw"" pixels on it. For example you set your brush to 'sand' and hold the mouse button down: many pixels appear on the screen and fall down with gravity. Other elements behave differently and elements react with each other; you have things like fire, ice, water, TNT, acid, steam etc.The main difference between this and other falling sand games are the missions. It's like if you got a falling sand game and added stuff like from those incredible contraption machine games (or Bad Rats haha). There are quite a lot of missions in total, plus a user gallery which is already quite full since this has been released on iOS for a while.In this Falling Sand game you've got your familiar elements like fire, virus, sand, water etc., then you have some electronic/logic type stuff like power, metal, LEDs, detectors etc. for building minecraft like creations. You then have some more ""god game"" type ones (that do feature in some of the online falling sand games too) like clouds, plants that grow and people. You can turn the people into a variety of job-themed things like builder or miner that alters their behaviour so you get a kind of lemmings thing going on. Some of the elements don't do anything though, like purely decorative ones, basically like bitmap stamps.I have The Powder Toy which is free, for windows which is a better simulator with more elements and a higher resolution but I still bought this because there's something cute about the lower resolution, the fact it plays sounds when you add elements, and the interactive things like people.There's nothing else like it on Steam and I recommend it.

												As much as this game seems like its fun, it isnt,After reading some reviews, i thought they werent so bad, compaired to the handheld version.But this? Let me put it to you this way;1) Mana is useless2) Skipping a level is 10x less (you could skip an entire section)3) All elements unlock as you gain them4) Less elements then mobileIf you really want a game thats worth your time, buy the mobile version. You can get more at the steam set value price.Dont buy this, unless you want to waste money.			"

												(RE-REVIEW)It's fun as something to play when you're bored. Don't expect to get entirely addicted to it; it's not that big of a game like Garry's Mod would be, but it is fun to play when you're bored. If you like pixel sandbox games, this game isn't really much more than a graphics update on the old falling sand games, but, I liked those games. It also has cool stuff such as playable arcade game ""characters"" or a ninja. There are also people who you need to give jobs in order to help them survive, etc. But, don't expect TOO much from an Ipad app port, though. This wasn't made for super gaming computers.			"

								An astounding amount of fun with this unique sandbox game. Although to most people, it's only fun for the first hour or so. I was excited after burning the trees down, lighting volcanos, inventing heaters, and such. But finishing inventions that require metal boxes, electros, power sources, and bulbs are way too far. It's too complex for some people as they advance further into the game.4/10			"

								Pretty good, considering I traded a beta key for this game. 8/10. Its a good game, the pixels can remind you of an old Atari game. Its a fun little sandbox, with many elements to play with. The story teaches you how to play, letting you have fun while it does so. The only problems I found were that the Humans are too slow with no walking or climbing animation, as well as the problem of them never tweaking the things told to you. It tells you the controls based on the IOS Version, not the PC version. It never tells you what keys to use/mouse buttons, only to swipe or touch with your finger, which you cant do unless you have a touchscreen PC(Which I don't even know if that would work). Overall, its an OK port of the IOS Version, but I am sorry to say it may not be very popular on the PC. Oh, one thing I really liked, no more ingame purchases, you get a lot of Mana in the beginning and you can earn more. You never really spend much Mana either, as everything is pretty cheap. Like I said, pretty good game overall, but it may not become popular due to it not reaching todays standards. I'm sure some people would like a good ol' pixelated Sandbox Game though.			"

The Sandbox.I would buy this game, which I have.Sandbox is a game where you are god, and you create your own universe.It's fun, because you have MANY items to mess with.From:-Humans (A.I.)-Avatars (Player Controlled)-Minerals-Fun, create electrical LEDS and sensors-The Braniac. I vote hands down the braniac to be the brain of the game. Due to it controlling:-Planes-Tanks-Other moving thingsSo, I Recommend this game.Free DLC Too!Also, the braniac is only on iOS devices and from the mac store. I think.			"

								Just a waste of Money.... And yes.. it is Early Access.... But most Early Access games are far better for the same price....EDIT: For that one who wanted more details. So I try.It starts with ""The acclaimed world-building game"". I would Name it more a world-drawing game. You can put some pixels together, and they ""work"" in different Ways... but on a low Level... It doesnt look too good. But thats even ok, becuase it can be also a conscious design decision. But this makes a game also look simple and cheaper in production. And even with this few special Pixels. It is just Paint... Paint with Physics... Basic Physics.... If you want to teach somebody science, take another game... if you want to be god. Take another game. If you want Paint Plus, it is perfect.But even in Paint, you could make big and small pictures. In that game you can't make a big World. I hopped to be able to scroll to the left and right, but no... you really have just that small picture.Than the Humans... they are really stupid... (example) it is a  ""if wood, do cut"" human wo do his task until it doesnt work anymore.... And if there are more than 2/3 Humans... they sometimes doesnt even are able to pass there another by. They dont start working with each other. And oh, there is something that want to kill us. Lets just wait and stay... Maybe it doesnt see us.....The last thing is that this game just crashes a lot... and totaly random and unexpected. Ok.... Early Access... But what i think, is that most of the things above are a wanted design. Somebody said hey, that would make fun, i want that game (maybe for myself and then he sold it), lets look what happens. And this is absolutly ok! We dont need everywhere a AAA game. But what really *****, and so... I come back to my review... it would be ok for 2,99€... No Problem. Lets just have some fun with it. And some will play it never again, other had nice 20min. But not for 10€!!!! If you compare it to other games for that price, than sorry, but they are bigger, or you see that there ist an Idea that maybe someday it will become big, or just great. But this Game is already nearly finished... If not, maybe you should write down where you want to go, what you want to accomplish like the Spacebase DF-9 did.			"

												Honestly, the game is good but only if you like this kiknd of game. Me? I love these Physics/Chemistry/Whatever powder type games. I've played the free ones for hours. If you enjoy those kinds of games, then you'll like this one. If you don't you'll be quickly bored. There is not really an in between response to this game so if you aren't sure, I'd check out Powder Game or something similar. If you're intrigued then go for this one. If not, give it a pass.			"

								Neat puzzle solving game. Like eating peanuts for me.  Seems simple but can get quite complex. It is 2d and you can go creative and do pixel art, music art..or simply watch the theory of evolution take place.  You can assist the process or simply watch.  Make your humans little homes, then add zombies and watch all your humans become zombies.  Add aliens and watch your humans be zapped by lazers.  Build machines, wonders of the world.  The possibilities are virtually endless.			"

								I would give this game a 7/10. The reason is it is fun,BUT,later it gets a little bit,what is the word,well,boring. It does because you just do challenges and you can build in that mode to create what you want,It sort of gets a little boring. So,it just gets a little boring,I kind of recommend this and I kind of don't. But,you choose to play this or to NOT play it.			"

								I do like the game, though I hope there will be some more in future updates. The only thing I really don´t like is that there is no way to get this into window mode, I tried to force it in any ways there is, but no. On my large screen it is very hard for me to read the pixeled font and I´d really prefer window mode as all these things look nicer when small. I´m a little dissapointed that there are so few animals yet, and that most are just made of a single pixel, so that there is no way to recognize what it actually is. The elements that are available are fun to play with and I can´t tell that much about the campaigns ,since I´m yet just finished with the tutorial plus one campaign and tested free mode. Was a little sad dinosaurs are just decorationI have one very big issue with the game that I couldn´t fix yet; there is no sound at all. The last game I purchased via Steam does still have sound, everything is fine. I still checked all the sound options on my pc, as well as the game options. I really can´t find out where the problem lies and it is really frustrating , since this game really isn´t as great without any sound			"

												I tried it out, because it was a fun mobile game.  But when you have a resolution of 1920x1080 on your monitor, you don't want the pixels to be smudged against your face.  The least they could have done was increase the size of the borders and resolution.This game in my opinion is solely meant for a mobile game thus far.  Until they fix the major issues, I will not be recommending this for PC at all.			"

								I was really charmed with the idea... but the game do not deliver.I tried hard to find good point in all this.Pros:-Pixel art (but you have better pixel art using PAINT!)-The god complex-Ecosystem-Some kind of low AI and low game design tools ?Cons:-I don't fell great build an ""HD"" 120x80 screen in full screen. Seriously. Nothing could look good.I saw few people doing pixel art... you better use PAINT than that!-The same point... the whole world is 120x80! Nothing exist outsite that. In game like Terraria, Starbound or Minecraft, you have an big big world really bigger than 120x80. Those games are superior on every aspect.-Everything is so small (a human is 6 pixels, chicken 4 pixels, fish 1 pixel)-Humans are completely stupid and useless. Even low AI seem more advance than that. Example: One human is hungry, so you give him some foods. He do nothing with it... so you feel like that he didn't know which holes use for eating. This example show exactly the level of AI here. You bring lava, they didn't even run away... Wipe theirs existences, they don't care.-It's impossible to build something. So much easier to destroy everything.-Do whatsoever and hope something will happens. Nothing will happens if you don't do it.-The complexity serve nothing. Why build a complex electric system when it's for light a 2 pixels bulb at the end?-Ice never melt. Ice freezes all waters. Lava cancel a little bit the ice. Ice still wins and freezes everything. So you should just never use ice.-If you try things for around 30-40 minutes in one scene in sandbox mode, the game will crash. Did it's the name of the game ""sandbox""?. Happened twice in 1h. After that I just give up.This is my shared experience of this game. I hope this will help you.			"

								I was really charmed with the idea... but the game do not deliver.I tried hard to find good point in all this.Pros:-Pixel art (but you have better pixel art using PAINT!)-The god complex-Ecosystem-Some kind of low AI and low game design tools ?Cons:-I don't fell great build an ""HD"" 120x80 screen in full screen. Seriously. Nothing could look good.I saw few people doing pixel art... you better use PAINT than that!-The same point... the whole world is 120x80! Nothing exist outsite that. In game like Terraria, Starbound or Minecraft, you have an big big world really bigger than 120x80. Those games are superior on every aspect.-Everything is so small (a human is 6 pixels, chicken 4 pixels, fish 1 pixel)-Humans are completely stupid and useless. Even low AI seem more advance than that. Example: One human is hungry, so you give him some foods. He do nothing with it... so you feel like that he didn't know which holes use for eating. This example show exactly the level of AI here. You bring lava, they didn't even run away... Wipe theirs existences, they don't care.-It's impossible to build something. So much easier to destroy everything.-Do whatsoever and hope something will happens. Nothing will happens if you don't do it.-The complexity serve nothing. Why build a complex electric system when it's for light a 2 pixels bulb at the end?-Ice never melt. Ice freezes all waters. Lava cancel a little bit the ice. Ice still wins and freezes everything. So you should just never use ice.-If you try things for around 30-40 minutes in one scene in sandbox mode, the game will crash. Did it's the name of the game ""sandbox""?. Happened twice in 1h. After that I just give up.This is my shared experience of this game. I hope this will help you.			"

								8/10     I really love this game, PC or iOS. A lot of people complain about how the 10 bucks aren't worth it, when it actually is. On the iOS version, it may be free, but to get certain campaigns, you have to pay 1 dollar each, or all for 8 dollars. On PC, not only do you unlock all campaigns, but you also get all elements. I've been playing the iOS version most of the time, so I'm gonna wait for v1.996			"

												I wish I could recommend this version of the game. But the developers practically abandoned it. If you played the Mobile version stick to it. This version has nothnig new to offer and is about a year and a half behind at this point. Bugs are everywhere and the gameplay is all right. But with the lack of updates which is what makes the mobile version engaging this version is just a more boring version with a ten dollar price tag to have all elements that were available upon release of this version. Do not waste your money on it unless it's on a large sale and  you really want to get the older version.			"

												There isn't much to be said about this game that hasn't been said before. Yes, you can build with a lot of materials, yes, you can make civilizations with ""humans"", and yes, you can make minigames. However here's the reason that I recommend this. If you're on a phone, you get the ""standard definition"" mode, which means that you get a pretty tiny map to work with. On PC however, you get ""high definition"" mode, which gives you, I'd say about 4 times as much space to pack in blocks, water, and plants. Also, since there is no demo for this, I recommend you at least try it on Google Play or iTunes, whichever you have, and play it first there. If you like it, buy it here because you'll be paying $20 for the elements alone on the phone version and that's not even factoring in the mission packs... You get all of that for $5 on Steam. Buy it here...			"

												Great idea, terrible execution.It's hard to say whether the great things about this game outweigh the terrible problems it has.  It appears that this game was very quickly ported from some other platform.  It has bad stability problems.  For example, certain campaign levels reliably crash the game within 30 seconds (e.g. alien invasion campaign, level 9).  On the other hand the game is cool.   You can build whatever you want... Rube Goldberg machines, circuits, landscapes, pixel art.  The campaigns vary in quality, but it is impressive that the game engine lends itself to such a variety of campaigns.  Honestly, most of the campaign levels are kind of silly.			"

												Well meh, it have some potential but it is more like proof of concept than full fleshed out game.Controls are unprecise and clunky at places, this game is also available on mobile so this is why. Levels most of the times are very very short, some could take like under a minute to finish, under 30s even and not very satisfying, after some time it is just tedious to do another one. Visuals- well pixel "" art"" but it is hard to use word art here, pixel style is barely functional, not good looking at at by any standards. This is probably because of pixel dynamic/ simulation limitation and big size of pixel, but on the other hand smartphones could not handle much more pixels to compute so pc users also got this pixels big as your fist, you know when you don't play this game on 5' screen but 27-30 it can't look good and it doesn't. So in the end I can't recommend this game to anyone, simply not worth it.			"
