												Luna's Wandering Stars is a wonderful, wonderful puzzle game.The basic game play is easily explained: You control one or more moons with gravity and rockets, all the while trying to collect enough materials to finish the level. If you manage to collect the three gold clumps while you're already at it you'll get a 'perfect' on the level.The level design is really diverse and the challenges range from accidentally perfected on the first try to a dozen resets and still no luck. The only thing that never changes is the map border made up of text that you really shouldn't cross... I warned you!The graphics are first class and the controls fluid and intuitive. Well, as fluid as trying to steer a moon using rockets can be anyway.The written narration is quite witty and the comments when you crash may sometimes tickle a laugh out of you.Bascically this is a really fun game that I can recommend to pretty much anyone who likes to crash celestial bodies into one another.As my sound is busted I can currently not say anything about the music and sound effects.

												This game has something in it for everyone.I'm lucky to have been able to see this game at Colorado Comic Con 2014, then see the final product which has became so much more than a physics puzzle game; it has something for everyone when each planet introduces a new mechanic, then each level feels so well designed that the learning curve offers multiple ways of completion letting the player decide how they want to play, and the gold challenges push you to strategize or concentrate your twitch like reflexes to progress quicker. Even the little things from the conversational text barriers to the witty, hilarious, and sometimes insightful comments in the log drive you to want to play more without making you feel bad if you have to quit a play session since the game is very forgiving in terms of replayability. As a developer myself the main reason why I considered game development was because of how fun level editors were, so the included one is the icing on top of the cake. And at the end I learned a thing or two about physics. "

												First I must preface that I was a kickstarter backer, and I have just got the game for steam, so I haven't had a chance to play much.Luna's wandering stars is a game that essentially takes the idea our space craft use of slinging around gravity fields to better reach other areas, but instead of tiny metal objects, it uses celestial bodies, and instead of 20 pages of chaos and apocalyptic destruction, you gain points and complete the level goals. Also it lies to you about moons, frequently. The humor adds to the experience though, in a Glados mockery sort of way.Overall the game is simple to get the grasp of, hard to master, cleanly designed, and a lot of fun. Also it is a great value and developed by a great team. I highly recommend this game.			"

												A super fun and beautifully designed game. Definitely very addicting, and for completion-ists who need to get all the gold it has some pretty great challenges. Every planet has a unique power so there is lots of variety. I was never bored and never felt like I was solving the same puzzle twice. The snarky in-game comments are pretty great too. I found myself messing up on purpose towards the beginning just see what it would say. Hehe.Definitely canâ€™t wait for the level editor. With the variety of powers in this game, I can see so many possibilities for some really cool levels.			"

												LOVE this game. It's seemingly simple but becomes amazingly more complex as you play more. I play a ton of puzzle games and have never played one like this. There's a lot of innovative and fun game mechanics here that fit really well with the space theme. Some of the levels are really challenging and fun to try and beat. The music and art is also really beautiful and relaxing. Actually makes me feel like I'm in space lol.			"

												I rather like this game.The developers made a very clean game with lovely graphics and smooth gameplay.  I haven't quite finished Mercury yet, but I've enjoyed the challenges put forth in this game.  While not necessarily difficult, getting all three of the yellow asteroids/moons offers an extra bit of fun worth attempting.Furthermore, they seemed willing to work late on a Friday evening to help with a setup-related problem.  I find that quite commendable.			"

												I marginally recommend this game. But with the qualifier that the 'commentary' from our host or whoever that is supposed to be is really annoying and frankly cruel at times. It's mean spirited far more than funny and just makes me stop playing the game when I get frustrated. So whoever thought the comments insulting our failures was a good move has poor taste.I wish I could play many of these levels in slow(er) motion because I do not have time to figure out the right way to click the boosters because everything moves so fast. ""But that's the challenge!"" you might say. Well, the game is supposed to feature realistic physics and forces but if these heavenly bodies were moving at a 'realistic' speed it would take months or years to do a level. I like the early levels on Mercury because I had time to refine my technique. The planets I am on now do not challenge my brain as much as they wear out my mouse. And it's hard to appreciate the way a burst of thrust can affect a body in motion when you crash into a planet a hundred times in a row and have no sense of how to avoid that.			"

												In the rugged, frontier days days of the Internet 1.0 waaaaaay back in the late 90s, one game was widely recognized in middle school computer labs across the country: Space Pengine. It was a quaint, plucky game with the simple goal of launching a penguin via slingshot into a black hole, assisted by planetary gravity along the way.  My nostalgai had me thirst for a new Space Penguine for the modern age, and that's when I found Luna's Wandering Stars. While the first world, Mercury, gave me the Space Penguin slingshotting I missed, I then learned with Venus that LWS is actually 9 games in one. Each planet (Yes, including Pluto) brings a new mechanic that manipulates you (the moon) in different ways. From Saturn's power to shrik and grow your mass at will, or Mars letting you shoot at obsticles, players are bound to find a favorite section of the game that will win them over. Come for the inadvertant planetary descrution, stay for the addicting quest to collect all the golden asteroids.			"

												This is an excellent physics/puzzle game based on gravity. Each of the 9 planets (Pluto is included...) has a different gameplay so you can't get bored and timing is also essential in most levels. If you are looking for a good challenge, try to 100% the game !			"

												This game is a blast to play! I loved how real physics played into the mechanics. The levels could be difficult at times, but it only added to the rewarding feeling of completing it and advancing. From the first planet's simple momentum powers to shooting lasers and changing gravity itself, the game continues to surprise you at each new stage and teaches you some physics along the way. My little brother, who is 14, would love a game like this and I plan to get him a copy!			"

												This game is a great example of an ""easy to play, hard to master""-type of game.  The game is quite forgiving in some ways. Getting the blue comets is mostly easy, there's an instant restart button and a Speed Up button so that you can quickly pick up where you left off. Also, there's always two levels open, so if you get stuck on one level, you can just go to the other open level and continue.  But then there's the gold comets, which require both puzzle-solving and dexterity to get. If you get too many blue comets, you'll accidentally finish the level before picking up all the gold comets. The timer is also a factor. This is where the challenge and the difficult achievements are.Because of this, the nicely designed levels, and the good music, I would recommend this game to any player looking to find a great puzzle game.

												Great game with interesting teasing facts and varying gameplay.Gameplay is skill based, includes velocity and associated applied physics like mass influence. Depending on the planet you set a starting velocity, have a targetable speed boost, or shoot (further planets feature different skills still) each providing a very unique touch to gameplay in the same environment. You influence an asteroid to gain mass and dodge obstacles in space.Each level starts with a narrator/moderator text box with interesting facts or hints to the level.When playing we travel our solar system, visiting each planet with a unique ability and multiple (always 15?) levels. Progression is fair, you are unlikely getting stuck as next planets unlock after completing /some/ levels. Each level has 3 golden asteroids to pick up as an additional challenge.Note that the Store page promises a full editor and online level sharing, which is unlikely to happen at this point. Itâ€™s been over a hear, and forum does not get a response.Great game.			"

												It's a nice looking game, and interesting, but every puzzle basically just comes down to trial and error until it's right, rather than actually giving you something to work with to actually figure it out. Trial and Error is not interesting.Also, I know the messages at the end of each level are meant to be funny, but they fail. They don't hit the right snark notes, and just end up as mean/irritating.

												Luna's Wandering Stars offers an incredibly compelling gaming experience that delivers visceral satisfaction. Ostensibly a simple puzzler, the straightforward gameplay belies layers of nuance and subtlety. This is the kind of game that tempts you with the promise of a quick round, but ends up immersing you for hours on end as you discover more mechanics, novel challenges, and neverending innovation. The kaleidoscope of features never ends up overwhelming, however, as the game carries itself with natural elegance. Even more impressively, the already pleasurable experience is further enhanced with breathtaking graphics and a stunning soundtrack. The amount of care and attention that went into the game is evident at every turn, from the charmingly quirky dialogue to the deeply satisfying sound effects that chime just the right way.  LWS is a triumph of execution, bringing together all parts of the gaming experience into a holistically magnificent package.I cannot recommend this game enough, definitely give it a try. "

												The summarizing video for LWS really shows your expectations.As KSP player, I really enjoyed the game. Though I do play KSP, I beleive that this game would be fun and understandable to anyone (except people that won't, which is still highly unlikely). LWS has many different powers you use, and has just the right ratio of them too (15 per planet). With orbital mechanics, there is a totally new and fun gameplay. The levels are great, especially when you try to get all the gold. This makes the levels challenging but not tedious. Plus the commentary, while some people find it annoying, I find it crucial for the maximum experience. And even if you find it annoying, you can always just skip and not read it.But, the one thing I cannot insure you will be happy with is the price. I got this game from a Humble Bundle set, so when adding all the other games I got together, it was really cheap. So I simply cannot tell you if it is worth the money, only how good the game is.Maybe a 9/10 "
