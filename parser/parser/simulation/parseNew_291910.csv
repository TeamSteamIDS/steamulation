												As a Firefighter I have a tendency to nitpick at games like this. Yes it's firefighter simulator, and yes it's clearly german based, so some of my points of view may not apply since I know next to nothing about germans and firefighting outside of the fact Stuphen makes really nice apparatus and Draugr is kinda of a garbage SCBA compared Scott packs (my opinions)1. Firefighting. This game has some aspects of firefighting right, like water, water is important and keeping your equpiment in usable order is important. But it kinda tanked on everything else. I pulled 4 firefighting calls total on this, You can't crouch at all (Not sure whats with that) you are in turnout gear 24/7. Even when driving an ambulance. This game has no concept of actual fire scenes. It's essentially, you show up, pull out a section of hoseline and it is magically never ending and longer than than space and time itself. Then you just go rambo. No Incident Command, no assigned positions, nothing. Just Put water on Fire.2. Pre-Hospital Care. There is none. And what they tried to dress up and label as EMS in this game is a total joke. You literally drive the ambulance to the scene. Open your doors, pick up the patient (LITERALLY, NO BACKBOARD, NO C-COLLAR, YOU LITERALLY GRAB THEM WITH TWO HANDS AND CARRY THEM TO THE AMBULANCE....) and drive to the hospital. I even did this for a cyclist that got hit by a car...I mean come on..Thats EMS 101....3. AI. The NPCs that drive in the game are ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I got sideswipped, t-boned, pushed off the road....Even with sirens and lights running...I mean seriously. Do people try and hit ambulances and fire engines in germany? I just want a real simulator....Not some gussied up excuse for a game.			"

												Buggy and extremely unpolished-------------------------------------------This isn't intended to be a AAA title, I understand that. But I do expect a game where at least some measurable effort has been put into it. I expect a sim to actually simulate what it is said to be a sim of. I just didn't find that here, and instead, I found a seemingly incomplete, too early to be released attempt to be a firefighting sim. There are too many things wrong with the game that break the immersion of it feeling like a firefighting simulation.Had this been an early access game, I may have been able to see potential (and obviously, reviewed it differently). But because this is allegedly a complete game, it must be reviewed accordingly.=== THE GOOD ===The premise. To be honest, that's about all I could find good with the game. I do find the genre (rescue simulator) interesting and fun, but the premise only takes us so far...the mechanics, gameplay, ambiance, etc. all must come together to help immerse the player in the experience. The game just doesn't do that.=== THE BAD ===AMBIENT SOUND ISSUES--engine sound cuts on and off despite there being no running vehicles nearby--door sound opening/closing whenever a person is nearby in the station (despite no doors opening/closing nearby)--no sound distance; all same level despite distance (with a couple exceptions of cars I found while I was walking on road, but even then, they cut in and out instead of properly fading in and out)--repeat voice loops (constant ""good morning"" and ""Man, another shift that seems like it will never end."" On the way back from the event, he kept repeating ""I could really do with another hour of sleep.""  I didn't know firefighters complained so much about their job.--roaring fire sound same for all fires, even an extremely small 1 box fire. That is, it doesn't matter if a building is on fire or if it is a shoebox, it's a roaring fire with the same sound effect 100% of the timeGRAPHIC ISSUES--shading is bad on characters and other assets, more like smoke. It's difficult to describe, I've never seen a game do that before. I've changed the settings to see if it changes anything, it doesn't. I may post a screenshot to give an example.--reflections don't make sense. You can see reflections of things (like people for example) at angles, distances, and heights that are physically impossible (walking through the tutorial will give you an example of what I meant, but perhaps I should upload a screenshot to illustrate)--hose is non-existent once it is connected to water source. Nozzle appears in hand, but it is never connected to the hose. This is an immersion breaker.--reflections in vehicle rear view mirror are non-existent (except for sometimes, the top 1/4 of the rear view mirror displays the sky, nothing more)--100% of all civilian vehicles have darkest possible tint - can't see inside any vehicleBAD AI--walks randomly w/o meaning (back and forth down halls). They have no real tasks, they do nothing. They are just there to give the illusion that the facility is not empty, but it just doesn't work IMO.--will continue to walk into obstacles (like a desk). Eventually they seem to stop...but it takes a little while before they figure out they can't walk through the desk, it's weird.--colleagues do not actually do anything at all. They are there just for aesthetics (they do not put fires, they only appear to be doing so). The Steam home page advertises that your fellow firefighters do help you...but they don't. They don't do jack. The outcome of an event/emergency rests entirely with you...the other ""people"" there are just for show.=== THE UGLY ===GAMEPLAY--Tutorial only takes you through walkthrough of the department, it does not teach you the operations of the vehicles, nor does it tell you anything about any of the tools you use in putting out fires. There's a fair amount of different equipment, but absolutely no training on how to use them or what it connects to, etc. The tutorial does absolutely nothing more than what an in-game map could do. That is no exaggeration. There is no benefit that the tut gives other than showing you where rooms are and in some rooms, what can be found there (a couple items here, coffee maker here, etc.).--Mouse sensitivity - despite having it on its lowest settings, it's still extremely sensitive, I had to use my control panel to adjust settings since game's settings are insufficient. 1st time I've ever had to do that in a game.--Physics...high pressure hose does not affect any entity in game except fire. 100% of all entities are there for aesthetics only (gas cans, boxes, trash, etc.). There are no movable objects.--Water...once it leaves the hose, it magically appears, never to be seen again. There is no water on the ground, no soaking walls, nothing. It leaves the hose and disppears into thin air.--cars take ZERO damage when running into them. They stop (at least), but nothing else happens. Obviously this is not a demolition sim....but I expected at some some sign of damage or some penalty. There's not a scratch on any vehicle, not even the truck I'm driving.--100% clipping when walking into cars (or them driving into you). They are ""ghost cars"" apparently.=== CONCLUSION ===This is a game I'd expect to be in very early access. Currently, there are many early access games that are further along than this.   The idea behind the game (being a firefighter faced with different emergencies) is great, but the application fails miserably IMO.  Far too many bugs, immersion breaking issues, and lack of polish in just about every area imaginable.I had reasonable hopes for the game, but they were dashed by a poorly delivered product on almost every level possible.IMO, the game is worth around $5. I doubt that many players will get more than a few hours of game play from it as it is tedious, buggy, doesn't make sense at times, annoying (eg sounds), and has too many immersion breaking issues.

												The game can be better.  Much much better.  If your going to make a sim, then make it right.  Make it a simulator!  Amoung many issues and a lot have been covered by earlier posts,  It states explore the house and grounds.  Well i would if I COULD, BUT i SEAM TO BE THE ONLY ONE WORKING because after each run, I get another call out.  I was sent home twice due to over working.  Well i keep getting calls, so I roll.  Also I was able to hit my rack once, but it took me forever to find my rack.  So once I did, I got a call. I cant say I didnt enjoy it, but it could be a very fun game if improved upon.  Want to draw a larger croud, improve the game and give us a north american city, FDNY, Boston, Chicago or SFFD would rock.			"

												This game has a few bugs/glitches I really want for them to fix. Firstly mainly at car accidents, when they say oil has spilled sometimes there is no spilled oil which just makes me have to reset the whole game. It's really annoying. Secondly as there are fires such as when a car has caught on fire near and it's near rocks, garbage and benches, they are normally impossible to put out. I'm always dispointed as those type of operations sometime happen as my shift is nearly done and I'm happy and all that and then they are impossible, which you then have to reset or just ragequit.Thirdly as I am rushing to a scene the car is really easy to slip which can lead to a flip over which then ends the whole operation.Now the last one is that sometimes the lights and siren aren't always appearing and working as usual. And mainly alot of features and things are mainly like copied. Inside the trucks it is un-releastic. I know that all these excailbur publishing games use the same technique. And I know that these are games base in Germany.Please try to find a solution.On the other hand, the game is really enjoyable and good with all these different operations. I really enjoy the different types of vehicles you get to use at each operation depending on your rank/skill level. This is probaly the best firefighting game they have made yet.			"

												To be honesy about this game it really needs to be taken off steam and be redone completely and the right way. I played the game and i see why some people like it and some don't. This game is really buggy and really needs some work done to it.  Someone in another post had already posted all the problem so no need to post anything.  AI in the game is the really bad.AI people:What is up with this who walks thur cars and walk around when there is a fire. I mean come on when there a real fire people arent going to walk around next to a fire building they stay clear.AI vehicles :Are you kidden me The vehicle do pull over but don't stop. I was going to a fire had the siren and blue lights on and a car decided to pull right out in front of me.Callouts:I know this is a simulation game but come on. I get more callouts than the other NPC do and they only go out when there is something big that needs to be changed. Controler:Devleoper can add a controller support for this instead of the keyboard all the time.just to make this short this game needs alot more work done to it. "

												Reason for ""No""1.Game picture quality is so bad,although i changed every set to ""high""2.the BGM repeated the words from time to time like""Good morning Good morning"" it makes me feeling fidget3.“Game Loading”need long long long time,maybe more than 3-4 min4.BUG everywhere. sooner or later, this game will put in charity  packageHOPE： Game developers can continue to explore options to optimize this game。 After all，lot players dream about to be a great and sacred  firefighters---------------------消防員是一份神聖而偉大的職業，可遊戲裏根本感覺不出來..扯遠了說說這遊戲吧，我把所有設置調到了最高，可遊戲畫面還是像馬賽克般渣到爆,不停重複的語音讓人覺得好煩，loading大概需要3-4分鍾的等待時間，我以爲是我電腦問題 結果看了其他評測，大家都是這個問題，這遊戲優化太有問題，畫面也讓人眩暈，說真的 賣這個價格開放商也真的是勇氣可嘉，这游戏迟早进包~			"

												I'm an actual firefighter and i have fully determined this game is true crap. Game play and graphics aside, a bit of realism would have been wonderful. The fact that i had to stand in a very specific spot possibly the size of a thumb tack to put the first fire out was ridiculous! This is a truely♥♥♥♥♥♥poor game and I played the newest Duke Nukem.

												I'm deeply sorry I spent money on this game.  One of the most boring game I've played.  Ambiant sounds are bad and commentaries from your co-workers are so repetitve and meaningless.  At night, you just can't see a thing even with luminosity set to max.  You play the missions by yourself with no interaction with AI caracters.  Should be for ages 4 to 6...			"

												I have mixed feeling about this game. It is a great game with big pontential. but it is NOT worth 20 euros!+Great game to play if you are boredNice with some extra missions to get promoted- No time to fix your vehicle since you always get a call out.Many bugs that really needs to be fixed such as them listed below *You can not see oilspills if you have to low graphics* You can not end your shift even when you've passed 8 a.mMy main issue with this game is as a paramedic, you just pick up the patient and drive him/her to the hospital, i would love to see some work on that.

												It honestly isnt that bad of a game, being one of very few games out there like this that I kow of. It is a very basic firefighting simulator. I wish it went more in depth like for instance, having to triage a patient and treat them on scene before loading them ino the ambulance and actualy place them on a stretcher instead of literally picking up the patient and driving them to the hospital or the MVA's where you litterally go and cut the AB&C poston the drivers side, pick the patient up, take him/her to the paramedic, and take out the battery.That just seems really basic and takes away all the realism and it gets really boring after doing it two or three times. The timer is another issue for me that I dont quite undersand. I get having a timer getting to the scene, but having one while on scene is very inconvenient because I kow I like to take my time and come up with a strategy but when you dont beat the timer you have to start the entire shift over again. It would aso be nice to switch between a fog pattern and a straitstream when fighting fires as well as display the hose lines fully and more mission diversity. I got three oil spill missions back to back and one MVA one shift and it just got boring. If you are looking for something very basic and very repetitive, this is your game, but I defiantley would not recommend spending your money on this game even if it is just a few bucks.			"

												If you're looking for a nice firefighter simulator, move along!  The game has some qualities, but it was poorly made.  Fires don't always go out, and if you post on the forums, their idiotic moderator does a terrible job and blames your machie.  The developers for this game did what alldevs do anymore - ""finish"" a game, ship it, and move on.  There's been no updates, nothing.  In order to play free mode, you must complete the story, which is impossible when you encounter the fires not getting put out multiple times.			"

What are:The missions u cant complete (oil spill under car etc)The abundance of mission during the day (yep real fire fighter have call outs 24 hour of there♥♥♥♥♥♥... they're never at station waiting or doing other things....Never in a mission do u use a vehicle appropriate for the emergency at hand. (hey wait no call outs lets use the swap body vehicle for a car fire ....)In the description it says that your coworkers do something.... they do not in game there actions have nooooo helping factor ever....Inappropriate timing of mission (going to the city takes 2.5 hours in game time.... no uproar by the crowds????U almost can never clock at out time and get warning for that often .... because you have just finished a callout wthYou re co workers just randomly walk trough the halls of the station doing.... nothing.Wheter you arrive fast or slow at the scene it does not make any difference...Real firefighters are always in a rush to clean up an already pebbled pool of oil...So i kindly request that u refund me, and il hope as an game studio you can improve the game to some standards....With regards,yvo			"

												-UPDATED REVIEW- The game has been known to contain bugs, but most of them are down to the actual computer, not the game. I can run the game smoothly on Low, and I have a laptop with a 64MB graphics card! One thing to watch out for, is mission 18 in the campaign. If you cannot complete it, then you could try turning down the settings (e.g. Detail, Resolution, etc.) Overall, it is a good game, and completing the campaign is worth unlocking Free Play.			"

												I have finished this game, and done a few normal ""shifts"". I get the point that it's not meant to be perfect, but this is a terrible game. I'm no firefighter IRL, but at least I am human, which I can guarantee the dude you're running isn't. The terrible handling on the car (which of one of the cars doesn't have a working light), together with the terrible running the dude does just isn't good enough. When you play you're meant to be doing shifts, which includes exercising, drinking coffee and sleeping. The problem is that you keep getting calls, spend ages on driving there and it turns out to be a small fire it takes longer time to get the extinguisher out than actually putting out the fire. I like the idea of a firefighter sim, but this doens't cut it. The missions are way better than the shifts, but they're not really much special those eiher.Oh, btw, you can pick up an injured person (which SHRN says here you carry in your arms, while the person is like a plank), and then pull out your gas mask or fire hose and the person goes away (like in GTA when you pull out a gun and your other gun is magicly stored, you store the person somewhere).

Also note that you must play through the main game first before you can play in free play mode.Would i recommend this game?

												Honestly if this game isn't meant to be a simulator then why is it in simulator. At least make it so either the passenger shuts up or make it so the at least open the sides, and put mor time on for emergencies so you have more time to fight and get ready. AND the timing you return to the station and your on another call you have no time to refuel the truck, refill the tank or clean the truck.have at least 1 job per shift to respond with the whole station, not just for premotions.

This is the best firefighting game on the market and it is a great price! The only thing I don't enjoy are the Florian 5 missions (take to long) and the fact that it is a german fire station and the rigs aren't like American ones. Overall Great Game			"

												Though not completed in full, I do believe a lot of the critisism surrounding this game (mostly here on Steam) is somewhat out of proportion.The game itself is not bad, it's not great either, but lets get to the bad things first; Documentation and tutorials are scarce and it took me a good while to figure out just the basics (and every result Google gives when looking for (GAME) Firefighters 2014 not being related to the game in any way sure didn't help either). Missions begin to get repetetive real fast and you spend most time driving around the world or walking around the station. Add to that items that you occasionally cannot return to storage (which results in you being unable to pick up a different item), terrible civilian driver AI (worse than GTA 1...YES 1) and reflection not functioning properly (brightness of mirrors and such is way too high, game settings changes have no effect) makes this a frustration from time to time.But I can live with most of these problems, because the game looks really nice, even when everything is set to minimum levels. The introduction is one that makes you really feel like your a rookie firefighter just joining the force, and playing the tutorial first, you are shown around your workplace in a way that I can honestly say I haven't seen in any simulation game ever, and it was such that I'd imagine would go like in real life. The campaign basically is one big tutorial with a free mode unlocking afterwards (I'd imagine, not quite there yet), and things are simple but clearly explained as you need to perform certain actions. And last but not least, something that I really feel I need to mention here, is that the hoses do not actually roll out as you connect them to something and walk away; This is a good thing, because a lot of these simulators have tried to implement that and utterly failed seriously bugging the game. I'd rather lose that little optical detail and have a smooth game than fighting the hose during an emergency situation, and you are responding to emergencies (in most cases) after all...I can honestly say that, despite most comments I've read online I can actually recommend this game, but with a fair warning;It is a Firefighter simulator. It is at minimum levels running on a game engine that could have been written a decade ago. It is not a racing game, if you feel the vehicle slide away underneath you, release the gas pedal. Different countries put different priorities in the balance between speed (responsiveness) and utility (weight and ability) of the vehicles, so if you have played a similar game set in America for instance, don't expect the vehicles to handle the same, this is Germany (or virtually interpretation thereof), in case you're wondering.A word for the developers:In a future version, don't focus so much on visual quality, you clearly have that covered more than enough, and in my opinion, it is not nearly as important as the actual simulation elements, AI, physics, etc. I did not really get that team-spirit feeling when at a car crash with 5 firefighters around me and just me and 1 other guy actually doing something and the rest just standing around. You could, for instance, improve on the civilian traffic AI and give the traffic cones an actual function... Just some thoughts...			"

												Would be great fun if it wasn't broken. Keeps sending me on a fire while in the chiefs car (with only an extinguisher) that wont go out. Might go out with a handline from one of the LF trucks but no way to find out. There's also no way to replace the extinguisher on scene so once you use it all up, that's it. Realistic, yes, but not when you dump the entire can on a ""broken"" fire.I love this for what it's done correctly, but I can't in good conscience recommend it. If it were 10 bucks I'd say yes and/or if the day comes where they fix it I may say yes.			"

												This game was fun at the start, the missions were quiet enjoyable despite the poor driving system that is in the game. Things started to get frustrating when I had a mission where I was suppsoted to put out a fire off two cars and then take the oil leak out, the problem was, there was no oil leak, or atleast none that I could see. The textures in the game tend to dissapear or glitch alot and it makes it impossible to finish the missions sometimes. The point where I got really angry tho was when I got a mission when a flat was on fire, I had to take the ladder, put out the fire and rescue the people. I did all that, but the mission didnt end. There was no more fire and no more people in the flat but for some reason the game didnt tell me to do anything else altho, I am not certain if I was doing everything right, wich is then next thing I wanted to talk about. The games tutorial dosent really teach you much, it tells you where certain things are on your station and what some of them  do but it dosent cover anything regarding the missions or usages of vehicles or items. You get to know what certain items do only  when you take them the first time and if you accidntaly skip the text then there is no way to check again. To sum it up, this game could be fun, but there is way too many glithches and game design flaus that the game gets very frustrating.			"

												What a Complete Rip off not cool at all. The More you play and get into the game the more challenging it can be. Who ever heard of a Fire truck having to fight car fires, etc with a Fire Extinglisher with No hose pack or water supply.. I remember playing one episode or level that everytime you free the person out of the car their was no ambulance or rescue personel they show up then disapear. This game has major bugs. I have personally contacted STEAM and the developer and no response to anyone.. Seems like no one cares about the bug and fixes.			"

												I would like to start off and say that I love this game. Basically, you start off as a Probie (or cadet, for you non-fire people) and work your way up the ladder to Chief. If you are looking for something different to play, I would definately reccomend this game. A message to developers: PLEASE MAKE AN AMERICAN VERSION! I would love to see how this would work. Also, add a bit more to do in the Ambulance. If you want to make a good ""simulator"" then let us work on the patient, like take vitals or put them on a strecher, and also chest compressions.			"

												This game can be annoying and for me it didn't become fun until I could drive Florian 7 (Turntable Ladder). Its cool to put on an airpak and climb the ladder into an apartment that is on fire. The AI though are idiots and don't help you at all.			"

												I recommend this game, but one small issue. I just bought this game today and I am playing on Mission 1 The Dumpster Fire and everything else will go out, but the dumpster. I have tried everything: Restarting the game, Restarting the Mission, and Deleting the save, Making a new game.			"
