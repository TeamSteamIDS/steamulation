												UPDATE 6: the new released version from august 2015 is different than the first. still very short (less than 10 minutes) and 50% of it are only dante´s monologues (unskipable!). yes, there is a bit of interactivity included now, but the whole garden level is gone, or i wasn´t able to get there. i might make my own review now, since the game changed a lot (still NOT recommended). it´s still the same :slugpoo: they offered as the alpha 2015 afaik. screenshots of the hands and all have been in the store forever. what´s also very bad, is the fact that there is a overlay with bloodsplatters and dirt over the whole screen... STAY AWAY FROM ALL THAT INCLUDES ""NarrowMonolith"". they are scammer, nothing else.UPDATE 5: YOU HAVE TO BE FU.CKING KIDDING... SERIOUSLY? NOW ON KICKSTARTER TO GET THE GAME IN EARLY ACCESS ON STEAM? SCREW YOU DANTE!!UPDATE 4: since they try to lure us in again with an update... watch this before:

 DON´T TRUST DANTE ONE WORD!UPDATE 3: ANOTHER SCAM OF NW IN THE SHOP? SRSLY? please stop this developer from scamming even more and more... guess why there are no negative comments in the forum? they get deleted and the poster banned. UPDATE 2: the next scam from NM is on sale now... STEAM SUCKSUPDATE: all games of NarrowMonolith have been deleted from greenlight, thanks to valve/steam (GOOD JOB!). they looked into this, after i reported this scamming behaviour. hopefully ""the tower"" can´t be bought anymore soon. too bad that i can´t write in the forum of this comedy of a game...DON`T SUPPORT SCAMMERS - NarroMonolith needs to be stopped! all they do is starting a game, taking money, starting a remake, then another game...nothing gets finished by them.""Ambush. Hunt. Survive. Extinguish torches and create diversions to overwhelm guards and create shadows"" - are you kidding me? at this sequenze it means standing at one point and extinguishing one torch. then you listen to what happens in the fight and press two keys. that´s it! you can´t move or use stealth to get past the guards. damn, you don´t even see anything, that is described from the fight. you see the torch, a table and a bit of a tunnel. that´s it.have fun http://steamcommunity.com/app/310870#scrollTop=0btw...horror is only the game itself, not mobs or gore or else...

												This is the worst steam game I have bought to date.It starts out and looks so fun, so good, almost reminding me of a Grimrock art style.But then it happens, you walk into the pitch black corridor and you think to yourself ""This is awesome"" and then it hits you... Wait a second, I can't get anywhere but via a guess. So you might say ""That's what this game is, you have to listen via the sounds""That's the main problem, For a game pretty much 90% dependent on sound, the sound isn't that good. I think of games like Thief: Deadly Shadows and know what surround sound should be like and how good it can be. This game utterly fails with sound, even though good headphones (I'm not talking Beats headphones, I said good headphones.)At one point you get a flashback to your farm... My God... The farm...  the amount of invisible barriers in this well lit, non threatening area is ludicrous. At one point I had to get a watering can from the shed, a shed with no door just begging to be entered. No can do, no way in heck you're getting in. Better idea go outside the shed, on the side of the shed where you see a watering can, get close to the wall and left click, left click like you never have before. Boom, I got it, now repeat with a shovel, an axe, and a hoe. And I can even describe the rage inducing harvest gathering, click on the poorly animated wheat until you get it. This game should be called ""Rage Quit: Tales of the Anger Managment class.""At one point I see a enemy... If I had to sneak past or fight, I didn't care, I was just hoping for something fun. Instead you blow out a candle and a quick time event happens, which you don't get to see by the way. I have never seen a more lazy game then this.On the short side of pros these are these:Pros: Voice acting is greatOriginal idea for a gameThe graphics in some areas look pretty good...In short, this is a game both so full of promise, and yet so full of teribad... Yes I said it, teribad, no go out and buy a game that's fun and awesome and is actually worth cash. "

												I gave up on playing this game after it glitched out & refused to let me enter a building I'd previously been in & out of at least 5 times.I have high hopes for this game, it seems interesting.  The version I played wasn't the final release, so hopefully the bugs will be ironed out in the final version.The following are issues I had with it:* Movement can be stitled, especially in the flashback scene* The gardening scene in the flashback is ridiculously buggy, you have to wave your cursor up & down the rows of plants for ages until the interact hand pops up* You're not told about quick time events until you're in the quick time event* I couldn't find an 'exit game' menu, and had to exit the game through the task menu*  The commentary track doesn't acknowledge when it's already playing, and will play two at once if you click on multiple items that trigger commentary tracks* Invisible walls that don't make sense			"

Early Access Review
								Can't recommend at the moment, given the pre-alpha nature. That aside, here's my general run down on the playable pre-""field from hell"" part of the game.-The voice acting is interesting. Well done!-Most of the current content is non-interactive (most scenes are set in darkness, with an audio recording of you doing things. Occasionally letters pop up on screen to press, moving to the next recording)-The ""field"" is a nightmare of invisible walls and broken interface. Before this I was intrigued if a bit bored. As far as I can tell, only 10 minutes of the game are playable.Overall, interesting premise, marred at the moment by horrendous pre-alpha gameplay.			"

												I really hate to do this, but I'm writing a review despite not finishing it. It's not something I usually do, and I always say that a game should be finished before a review is written, but here I am. However, there is a good reason to why I did not finish this which I'll share with you guys.So before getting into why I didn't finish it, I would like to talk about the actual game and what I've seen. The intro was good. It had good graphics, and had atmosphere building up. But that's it. It's too dark to see anything, heck I had to turn my brightness to maximum at times. The voice acting was really hard to understand, and there are no subtitles.After that, I got up to the first soldier, and died. This is when I had to quit. The load option did not work, and when I tried to quit the game it gave me a bluescreen. I tried to fix the issues for atleast 10 minutes and then finally noticed to reboot my computer. The menu system is so buggy, you can not turn of fullscreen either.Sorry for the short review. I really hate to do this, but I just cannot recommend it. I'm getting a refund.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS!!!I bought this after it ""was released"". It is nowhere near finished. This is a short (15min) alpha-quality demo level, which is terribly painful to ""play"" (its not play, this is the worst ""gameplay"" Ive ever seen). Basically the description of the game is a giant pack of lies. I wont dig into the details (Im sure others have), but suffice to say its false advertising at the very least.Valve - you should give refunds for this, and delist this piece of sh*t.			"

												Quite disappointing. Annoying unskippable intro, the voice acting is good but overwritten, and I fell through the world when I got to a flashback.

												The game sets out to do… something, we suppose. You play the part of some bloke stuck in abunch of caves, trying to escape, by committing graphic murders (or at least, we think so. Itwas a quick time event with a black background. Because reasons), stealthing, and findingrest zones all over the bloody place.

												This is very unfinished software, this SHOULD NOT be sold as a product because it is NOT USABLE. There are too many bugs. It is NOT WORKING. It takes time to realize that it is not you who is not working properly, but the ""game"". I was unhappy but tolerant until I got stuck outside the map and I even could not quit the game. I had to restart whole computer to regain control of my computer. And I found there was no save in the game so I should start from start - NO, I will not do that again! I was robbed by this and I want my money back! I am very angry as I found out I cannot return it as even Steam does not ""support"" returning not-working products! That's a theft!

												Ok, so it's an Alpha... don't worry about the bugs.  I am sure they will be ironned out eventually. ButThis isn't really a game.  It's more like a book.  You don't have any control of anything you do.  The biggest challenge is walking through dark tunnels.  So dark that you could be staring at the ceiling and wouldn't even know.  There is no game here, and by looks of the direction the Alpha is going, I don't think this will ever be a game.  Seems more like a really long cinematic where everyone once in awhile you press a button to continue, blow a torch to continue, light a torch to continue.But I purchased it like a dummy... I was tricked into buying a game that you walk around and do nothing.  I will be trying it out  time to time to see what else may unfold.			"

												Ooookay...I have no idea what ""stage"" this game is supposed to be in.  There's was a post way back in JULY about a soon-to-be-released ""2015 edition"", but here we are in the New Year and this doesn't yet resemble a ""finished"" game in my humble opinion.  Was this the ""2015 edition"" I just attempted, or are there improvements to come?  No mention whatsoever on the Store page of it still being an Early Access title, so...anyway, let's attempt to review what I've played so far...    The Tower, from what I have thus far experienced/endured, is an awfully good premise which has been executed...well, I'm obviously tempted to say ""rather awfully"", but it's not ALL bad.  The idea of having to find one's way through some tunnels with MINIMAL lighting, and mostly sound to guide oneself by, is undeniably genius.  The problem here is...there's nothing ""minimal"" about it.  Much of the time, we're just talking a black screen with a tiny white cursor dot in the middle of it.  So in other words, unless you're Mr Precision himself with the mouse, you honestly don't even know if you're staring straight at the ceiling or the floor half the time.  And the sounds are...well, I'm not sure they helped ME that much, but I am admittedly the kind of person who needs his ears syringed of wax every so many years, so maybe I just need to visit a doctor sometime.  Or maybe...just maybe...the devs thought of a brilliant way to create a sellable ""product"" with very little need for, y'know...those things that they call ""graphics"" (which aren't particularly awesome when you DO seem some daylight, I might add).      So does this mean that this is yet another ""walking simulator""?  Oooooh, GOD no.  We have COMBAT, believe it or not...in the form of pressing ""quick-time"" keys in aforementioned total blackness and hearing the guard we are allegedly attacking say things like: ""Oy, would somebody 'elp me?  Somebody's ATTACKIN' me 'ere...oy, 'e's just punched me in the FACE, so 'e as...is anyone goin' to 'elp me?  Cor blimey!"" or words to roughly that effect.  Fortunately the voice acting is fairly reasonable, so one must be grateful for small blessings, and yet...    Honestly, it's hard to even review what it is we have here.  Even if this qualifies as a ""game"" per se - and not a ""con"", as some other reviewers on the Store page have posited -  it certainly doesn't appear to be a completed one, or even a semi-polished one.  It's more like a demo with (questionable) promise.  Henceforth I cannot, in all good conscience, give this anything resembling a recommendation, but who knows?  Perhaps one day this game will be: a. complete, and b. rather good.  Even on sale it's a pretty dubious proposition at this point in time... Verdict: 4/10 (for now, at least).			"

												So I found this game when it was on desura is an alpha state (it was also in steam greenlight at that time). I thought it looked really cool so I picked it up for three dollars. At that point, it looked like NM was actually putting out content for this game, and were looking at feedback found on the forum (which was minimal). They put out one major update and added a little chapter, know by many as the laggy garden chapter. That was Aug 21 2012. Then a few months after that I got a messages from Dante asking me if would beta test Polarium, a new game they were working on. I thought it was odd they were not going to work on The Tower, but as I found out Polarium was going to be on Xbox live Arcade. I know that sometimes you have to take funding where you can get it. So I thought maybe after they finish Polarium and get more money they would finish The Tower. Well after testing and sending my feedback on Polarium, everything went quite for a while. Then out of the blue I saw Dante has posted that there was a Kickstarter (or indigogo, I don't remember) for The Tower. Again I thought this was odd because I thought they would have more funding. I backed this though because I really like this project (granted this was a mistake on my end, not learning from the past). I was following the steam discussions on the game and NM was giving out keys for people to play test it. I said I would love to help (again me being a moron). They sent me a key... and it did not work. So I posted that my key did not work. I didn't hear anything back and didn't see anything more posted from NM. It seemed the game was dead again. With this whole Tower issue out of my mind, and me counting the game as a loss (which was a disappointment to me, and still is because the IDEA is great) I saw this private eye game on steam called Sam Glyph: Private Eye! (I'm a sucker for a detective Noir theme). At first Glance it looked interesting, so I scrolled down the page... then I saw it's developer was NM. I took a pass because from what I knew of them, and the posts in the comments it sounded like another unfinished game. I did happened to buy it when it was on sale for a dollar so later. I played it, and again, the idea is interesting, but I was correct, it is just another unfinished game. Again I pushed NM out of my mind, and tried to forget them. Then one day I noticed that Dante had posted another crowdfunding project for The Tower (again I can't remember which one). I laughed and told myself I wanted to back this and help the project, but they lost my trust long ago, and it seemed like they were nowhere near reaching their goal. So I brushed this off and went on with my life. Then today I just happen to notice that The Tower was fully released on steam and I had it in my library. I played it, and it was different than the old game. New engine and voice acting and story. The idea seemed to be the game (which I still think is a good idea). The game looks ok and runs better than in the past. Though the game right now, just seems to be walk ten steps and have a dialog part where you do not feel engaged and feel bored about. Sadly as Tryyton says in this review of the game, it seems NM is just trying to scam our money and I have been a sucker more times than I should have. Don't buy this game, don't buy any of NM games, they are just unfinished. Also there is this... http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1094973/Musician-barred-selling-soul-eBay.html(Also sharing this link in no way condones my support of the DailyMail)			"

			The Tower is a scary scary game on steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/310870/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your thing: https://twitter.com/TheSocioPsycho...		

The Tower is an adventure action-horror game.  This is a low-budget indie game that despite being funded on Kickstarter, and was on EarlyAccess, is selling on Steam with the addendum that any further production has been halted due to lack of funding.  They state that they will only add more to the game if they have enough sales.  What?!The game runs poorly, and the sound is reminiscent of an early 2000 game.  The ambient sound overpowers the character narration and plotdetails.  Bugs proliferate throughout, and the plot wanders in pointless directions.  The horror aspect of the game is simply inbeing unable to complete the tasks that you are asked to do.  It wastes your time, and lies to you.  I would rather hug a porcupine than recommend this game to anyone.For more details, see the linked video review, as this is a basic summary of what I cover in my video.
