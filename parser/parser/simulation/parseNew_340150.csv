Early Access Review
It's time to break a little bad.Basement is a drug empire strategy game which is currently available through Steam Early Access. In Basement your aim is to create a successful drug empire by building facilities to produce drugs and taking over drug selling business to sell your product. But tread lightly, the larger your business grows the more attention you will attract from the police who will attempt to raid your facilities unless you 'persuade' them otherwise.I'm not in the meth business. I'm in the empire business.A word of warning, Basement, in its current stage, is more of a proof of concept than a game as most of the planned features are not present in the game yet. Despite the lack of content I, as a huge fan of Breaking Bad, enjoyed my time playing the game and look forward to seeing it develop. My review will be updated as and when this game is updated.+Awesome pixel-art style+Simple building mechanics, similar to XCOM or Smooth Operators+Four different types of drugs which can be produced using science, b**ch!+You can order your employees to attack the other businesses in the area and take control of them, you are the one who knocks+Your products are automatically collected from your base of operations to be delivered to your distributors+Taking over other facilities gets gradually more difficult as you get further away from your base of operations+The devs have set up a trello board so you can track their progress and they seem to be pretty active on the Steam forums, they're also very friendly+Good AI+Character descriptions are rather amusing+Nice soundtrack+Randomly generated cities-As mentioned there's not much to it, I won't mention everything and most of it can be discounted since it's Early Access but the main things are there's no tutorial so you have to learn for yourself and there's no objective other than make money -No way of speeding up timeVerdict:8An interesting strategy game with an awesome art style, simple mechanics and a good variety of products that is somewhat let down by its lack of content. If you're a fan of Breaking Bad this is not one to miss out on.***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***El K.			"

								Ah! Nothing like waking up to the aroma of meth cooking in the morning!The Good Fun. Hiding from cops while cooking up all sorts of nefarious product in underground labs is delightfully entertaining Straightforward UI. There's no tutorial (or at least not one that I found), but its pretty easy to just sit down and GO. Graphics / Artwork. It feels a bit dodgy and run down, almost like graffiti art people, which is appropriate considering the subject matter. The minion AI isn't stupid. For the most part, it does precisely what it should be doing at a particular moment. Creepy music that I think works for a game like thisThe Bad No save-game? Seriously? I realize that they're probably trying to prevent players from saving before raids and then loading if they fail, but what if I have conquered the sandbox and want to play again, but don't want to throw away my awesome conquest? Super easy. I was able to beat it pretty-much the first time I picked it up. The strategy is very straightforward. If you don't have a line of junkies spilling out onto the street, and nobody dies, the police don't show up. Its all about managing that flow. Once its managed, the game becomes simple, and you can start training your conquest armies in peace. Overflowing money. Towards the endgame, you have too much money and nothing to buy. Part of this is because the money-stashes only hold $1000. When I beat the sandbox, there were whole houses that were nothing but money stashes because the game nags at you irritatingly every time you get money but have nowhere to put it. I am playing this during early access, so take these with a grain of salt, but there are some bugs. The delivery trucks didn't work for me. They would get to a place and stop and then never move again. The controls are also a bit finnicky when it comes to assigning workers to rooms.Suggestions Guns would be good. Considering the subject matter, I don't think devs need to worry about violence influencing children Competing drug labs would also be good. It might be fun to try and get the cops to go after them, as well as bust up their operations yourself There's no real difference in the drugs aside from market value. I would have liked some kind of tangential side effect, like Acid-takers tripping out and becoming erratic, pot smokers becoming mellow, speed users getting into more fights (etc) I think it would also be more fun if there were a bonus to providing a selection of substances, rather than really just wanting to provide the most expensive one.ConclusionGood game already. I have high hopes for the final product being even better!  :) "

								Hey love the game. Only a couple of things to change atm but I know there are more.1. Mouse wheel should make the screen slide left or right.2. Bribe and fight only! Add in something like ""dump stock"". Cops leave you alone but you lose all the drugs in that house the police search.3. There needs to be upgrades: A. upgrade the cars that deliver the stock.B. Upgrade the storage shelves.C. Buy weapons and items for your goons.D. One on one fights between police and goons/ cooks need to change so that your goons/ cooks can gang bash the cops vice versa.That’s it for now but there is more to come, let me play a bit more. good luckI think the drug theme is funny "

								Basement, so far, has a very strong proof of concept. I can see the hard work the developers have put into it so far, so I have no trouble recommending it for people who are fine with bare bones gameplay that will be improved over time. The game satisfies an itch for me that I've had since watching breaking bad, a drug dealer simulation game. Right now, there isn't much to the game. You hire some drug makers(sorry, not sure what the proper term is), some bodyguards to protect your product from police, and you force dealers to deal out the type of drugs you're making. Thats pretty much it at the moment, you can build different types of drug labs, for Weed, Acid, dope, ect. You have to find dealers for each different type though, you can't just have one dealer that does everything. You also don't really have much control over the dealers(yet anyway).I won't go into too much detail, just that with the base game being what it is, I have enough confidence to recommend as I'm sure this game will be finished. It has enough to it to warrant the purchase now, and I'm sure there will be plenty of content updates to come. Wait For Full Release  "

								I'm not going to do a typical review, because other people have already discussed the pros and cons of the game's intent, design, and execution.What I would like to review is the community's quickness to disparage indie developers and jump on the abandonware paranoia bandwagon. Games take a long time to develop. Especially with an independent studio that is oft times relying on money coming in to pay the few employees, or purchase assets.Decide for yourselves if a game is something you're interested in, and would be willing to support...but please don't shoot us all in the foot by writing a hundred reviews where you cavalierly play the role of Chicken Little and kill a game's chances before it has even had time to develop.This game went a few months without an update.And...people lost their minds.Have any of you played The Long Dark? It has been in EA since before dirt was invented. They may go months without updates. But when they do update, it is significant. It improves the game. It makes it more playable. I have gotten more value out of playing TLD, and replaying after each update than any major-studio release in my library. It is one of my most cost-effective purchases, ever, in the realm of entertainment.With EA, you toss your money in the hat and enjoy a sneak peak at potential greatness in a genre or niche that you find interesting. You check on it when it updates, and take the journey along with the rest of the community that supports it. Please understand, though, that if you jump the gun and shoot down a game you briefly believed in, because your paranoia made you think it was abandoneware - you're potentially screwing all of us out of a completed game. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy.I understand that some EA games do fizzle out. Some developers do take the money and run. It happens. But if you believe in a game, give the developer the benefit of the doubt. If you aren't willing to do that, then don't take a gamble on Early Access in the first place.TL;DR: This game's review score was tanked by irresponsible Chicken Little spazzes who wrote tons of reviews calling the game dead, after a few months without an update. Then, the developer comes out with their huge level editor tool, and progress update - but they've already lost months' worth of potential capital that could've helped further refine the game, because $9 is worth wetting yourself over, apparently. Most of said spazzes still have not revised their reviews, and so continue to incorrectly slander a developer that has absolutely proved them wrong.			"

								Start the GameBegin a Custom Match/SkirmishChoose Adam Stand as the starter lab and any and all future labsTurn Off In-Game MusicPlay one of the many songs from Breaking Bad soundtrack, I recommend Crystal Blue Persuasion.Begin your empire, watch your money grow, improve your product, bribe the cops, become the one who knocks.(The game is good for what it is, a nice time waster, and in the future I am certain it will be much more than that. For what it is, it is incredibly addicting, the only thing I dislike is how small the map is, mind you that it does take a very long time to take over every building, but once you do there isn't much else to do other than start over.) Nine things I would want to see in an update:      1. Larger buildings with a greater zone to dig under, as only being able to dig down by three is somewhat low.      2. Vaults to store larger amounts of money.      3. Different gangs which compete with you and each other.      4. Bribeable gangs/Hireable Gangs (Pay off a gang or hire a gang to attack a building for you, and by chance they will         leave it be (As in they attack the building, clear it out, then leave.), take it over for themselves, or fail at the attack     5. Hireable hitman (Instantly clear out an entire building for a large cost)     6. More variation when it comes to NPC's and hireable ""staff""     7. Melee Weapons and Ranged Weapons/Guns     8. Larger amount of upgrades     9. Larger Maps			"

								I really enjoy this game. And I think by the time it is finished, I'll be able to give it a nice big thumbs up. But for now let's look at the pros and consPros:-Unique backdrop and idea-Simple game play, half management, half idle game-Random events, getting raided or attacked (could use even more random events)Cons:-Lacking AI-Tutorial isn't up to par-No zoom function. You have to reset your screen resolution to set the zoom level, ridiculous. -Price point. 8 Bucks? At the game's current stage, $2.99 is really where you should set your sights. There is a big lack of depth, which is fine for an alpha. But it's simply not worth the price point at it's current stage. With some added features, or lower price, I could change my opinion here. It's near the line for me, but not yet over it.			"

								So, I backed this game on Kickstarter last year, I think, because I saw a lot of potential (and, let's face it, because of Breaking Bad - who didn't want a taste of the drug-dealing business after watching that show?), but didn't expect it would see the light of day (albeit in alpha) so soon (what with all my disappointments with KS games). Well, thank god it did.After logging an hour and some minutes on it, I can definitely say the potential is still there. And even more so than I had imagined. The thing is, it's still pretty much ""barebones"", as others have pointed out. So, for now, buy it at your own risk (as you should do with all Early Access games), but I'll bet that a year from now, this will be one hell of a game.			"

								I've had a lot of fun with this game over the last two days, probably because it reminds me of work that I've done for major corporations in the retail and fast food industries - the only difference being that this game doesn't leave me feeling all guilty and dirty afterwards :PIn all seriousness though, this game is worth buying if you like tycoon style games and you're not offended by the theme (it is just a game after all). The game has a nice art style and atmosphere, and the mechanics work pretty well for something that is still very early access. It already has that tycoon game satisfaction of starting with a small basement with limited facilities and gradually working your way up until you have basically taken over the whole town with enough money and hired muscle to be an unstopable force.You can get through a single game fairly quickly, but it's still fun to replay the sandbox level as it is slightly different every time you play it with some procedural generation of the map.It is early access and that means the game still lacks content. Nothing jumps out as being missing but there also isn't that much there. It's already fun though and it can only get better as the game continues to develop.			"

THAT'S RIGHT! A ♥♥♥♥ING WORKSHOP SUPPORT. instead of do what they promise in early-access description. they do a ♥♥♥♥ing system anyones couldn't care less until after the game is done. i think the developer just lost their motivation on this game and too lazy to create anything now. so in the few months they will fix some game-breaking bugs. make in-game editor so people who cares about this game can create the game themselves. and then they gone and make some more new games!for 8 bucks i lost this is basically robbery. they have more than enough resource to make this game to finish and create some more profit. but oh no let's create in-game editor and let's make new game i want to do! i'm dissappointment in halfbus right now. i hope they will finally realize noones cares about workshop and start refine the game to the point they want to see. make actual progress not more bug fixes. i hope to see this in the light 1 day...

After 30 minutes you pretty much have seen what there is to see in the current version of the game. The game however has loads of potential, and if they keep the updates coming with new rooms, more interaction with the world etc. i can see this becoming an amazing game. But for now i would hold off on spending money on it. Unless you really feel you need to be a part of the development input/process.I am giving this a thumbs up, simply because what is there now already is solid. And it's still in early access so no point in being negative about the lacking features as they are hard at work making new ones.			"

								Basement in a way reminds me about the old Sim Tower where you have to build a ""vertical empire"". But with drugs. I had fun with Basement but unfortunately it suffers from the Early Access syndrome, there's not enough content to keep you busy more than one or two hours. Hopefully that will change after it gets out of EA.Your objective is simple, grow your drug business fighting the law and at the end attack the competition HQ. It took me about 45min the first time and 30min the second time. The game is not hard at all and easy to learn. I recommend it ONLY to people that are fully aware this EA is to support the developers rather than buying a complete game.If you wish to see it in action you're more than welcome to check this video, it's a First Look into the game:

However, the missions are painfully easy because as you can see i only have 1.6 hours at the time of writing this review and there is also the sandbox mode which I always take over the whole map simply because of how easy i find it to take buildings, I only hired 3 people, a producer, researcher and a seller. With those 3 people, i was able to take control of the entire city with like 2 uses of the infirmary. When the is fully released i may change this review, I still have a lot of hope in this game. I really hope the devs don't mess this up.			"

								There are several good things about this game and several bad things. The good things are that the game offers a simple design of game-play, it doesn't take much skill to understand.  However, it also requires that you be attentive because it's also mundane and tenacious.  Being a drug-lord in this game you have to ensure that you have the proper amount of resources to assist your employees in thier daily tasks of creating and selling, and even defending/attacking.  However, there is also some bad things such as the rollover(s) may not always reflect accuracy in the game.  This could cause frustration and negative gameplay experience as ""mistakes"" due to design impacts user experience(s).  Also, the ""citizens"" do not respawn after they're all killed, this lead to the downfall of my business within the game -- not just the citizens; thugs and policemen alike did not respawn whatsoever, therefore I was left with nothing else.  I haven't even taken 1/2 the buildings in the stage that was randomily spawned for me.Overall, the game is cool.  Great for casual play in its current stage.  Not so great for a daily game.			"

								I really like the premise of the game, and am looking forward to future updates for it. --Pros--Relaxed play enviromentGood musicBuild your own drug empire and kill crooked cops and rival gangsSandbox mode--Cons--Still a bit short on content, though the game is still in development and plans to add moreUnit management can be a bit tough, especially with multiple people standing in the same roomRanged weapons seem a bit ineffective. They do much less damage than someone just using a tazer or baseball batWould like to be able to rename my goons so that I can easily find the specific one I wantOverall a nice game to play to kill some time with, but again, is still a little light on content at this time.

								Basement is a fun little indie game that rose to the top of my most favorite games right below saints row IV which mean it is my second favorite game. The gameplay is solid and mechaics work cannot wait for what is in store later down the road of devolpment.1 major flaw is that you can only fight and bribe the police please add another option becuase later down the road you can get a little dependent on the bribes.2. UDGRADES: Mainly for the machiences and the cars and maybe you can change the price of the drug via supply and demand (EX:you have a big supply of a certian drug the demand might eithier 1.lower the price or 2.make the demand more needed) "

I like this game because I like the management and growing your buissness also I like this game because its a close to a resemblance as the award winning show ""breaking bad"" and I love that show. So if I were you I would definitely buy this game but there is many features that need to be added. and as it says this game is early access.			"

Sometimes patience is the key ingrediant.EDIT: The game as of (21/09/2016) has quite a bit more content, with challenges/levels and AI to play against as-well as a research tree to produce more potent variations of your drugs.

								An interesting take on business simulators; This is a local drug ring simulator where you start off with a small shop, growing weed and selling it to junkies and whatnot.From your income you can upgrade your rooms, build new ones, start digging underground for a larger basement (which means more room for rooms), hire people to grow or mix your drugs, sell or transport said drugs, or keep your people safe from angry addicts and police raids. Or you could send them out to other buildings and expand your business through some...aggressive negotiations...The game looks really nice and I think the choice for low resolution graphics has payed off in this case. There isn't much in terms of guiding new players into the game, and it feels more like a sandbox, but there is a sound foundation for what can become a great game, regardless of what anybody may think about drugs.I actually feel inclined to writing a beginners guide, but the game IS actually really easy to pick up, as long as you don't fear losing the first few games figuring it out.Definately has potential.

								Been waiting ages for this game to get released. And even though, i do recommend this game, it is lacking in features. Once you know what your doing, it is extremely easy to go on and complete the whole level your faced with.Once they have added more content, i can see this being an epic game.I did play the game the put on Playdot (is it that site?), and it plays differently. For example, you send your products to dealers to sell. Not people come to your door. I would like some variation on that, to mix it up.So far, the game is good, but needs more. Which i feel will be added soon.			"

								Game has changed so much from when I first purchased it way back, but not for the good.They over complicated things that were fine to begin with, but left many of the underwhelming aspects of this title, untouched.Even made little to no effort on adding player/fan suggested ideas to the game.Yeah, devs' don't have to do that. But hey, could it hurt bussiness by taking criticism from potential buyers, and existing buyers. Hell with it, why try, amirigtht?I miss sandbox mode. Even though it wasn't sandbox mode, it was just the basic EA version of the game when it released.I miss unupgradeable rooms, because the ones that exist in the game now are poorly thought up and cheap to look at.Did I get my money's worth? Sure, I played for 66.0 hours. Cost me 8$Will I play this when it comes out of EA? Nope.I could very well just be jaded by the direction they took, because it's pretty bad.			"

								Disappointment.I have seen this game many months back. And now I was thinking that it's about a time it will be pretty good even when it's in early acess. I don't mind the lack of the content but more or less the awefull controls. There are so many things which should have been already there.For example:- When you select a room you should CLEARLY see who is assignet to it.- When you select a person you should CLEARLY see where is this person assignet.- The free (non-assigned) person should be clearly visible. - The free (non-assignet) rooms should be distinguished.- When you select a person and send it to a room, it should override the person who is already in it.- When you select a person you should be able to move him to another building just by left clicking (the person would automaticaly get into a car and drive there)- You should see ppl weapons from the ppl overview - Some other improvements.I was playing this game for a couple of hours, finished all the mission and was playing few sandbox games. When you have bigger base and about 15 ppl it's just a mess there is no way to keep track of them, I was so annoyed by the controlls that I am not going to play this game again.Also I don't mind the graphic style ( like prison architect, rimworld etc) but here we could see some improvements.

								A fun little game in which you run an organised drug ring. If it was fully released and/or abandoned then I would leave a negative review because of the $9 price tag, but seeing as the developers are frequently updating and expanding the game, and because I'm a fan of these types of games, I'll recommend it.I've seen negative reviews on the bugs and issues this game has, but in my time playing it I have not experienced any serious bugs asides from the tiny shelf missing it's description.Graphics: 8/10 Basement has a pleasing (well done) pixel art design which fits with the sound and gameplay very well. It is very satisfying seeing your cash vault pile up with money.Sound: 8/10 A very fitting theme plays in the background which compliments the art style perfectly, with 8bit styled sound effects which make the game feel more alive.Gameplay: 7/10 The gameplay flows well and operates how you would expect it to. The game can be completely mouse driven, but the keyboard can be used also. It is a casual game keep in mind so the gameplay is pretty simple, but it provides enough depth for a few hours of play, not to mention it does have quit some replayability and different ways you can play. It is a bit rough in patches, mainly with selecting a room to build/upgrade, but this can be fixed by moving the camera. "

								A Fun and Addicting game about managing a Drug EmpireThis game is cheap for the sheer amount of addicting fun this game has. While currently a little light of content, I feel this game has almost perfected its mechanics especially for the fun of sandbox mode. I would recomend that you buy this game for a good 6-infinite hours of managing drug production and sales on the black market. This game is easy to learn and simple, but somehow manages to grasp you. When I first played this game I stayed up all night beating every level and dominating sandbox mode. I would like to thank the developers for making such a fun and addicting game that will only get fun with more levels and content. Easily the funnest game I have played in a long time.			"

								Drug Dealing SimulatorI played the Ludum Dare version of the game and really enjoyed it. Also following their Kickstarter and reading the ideas they have for this game, I think It can be an awesome game. The Early Access of the game has a lot more features and can be played and enjoyed for at least a few hours, but also lacks a lot of basic things you expect from a finished game; like a tutorial.Soooo do I recommend buying it? Yes and no. I really enjoyed playing it and I think a lot of people will, but it's still an unfinished game. So if you cannot look past the rough edges of an unfinished product, I would recommend to add it to your wishlist and come back when it's finished.I'm only getting it a thumbs up as an ""Early Access"" game and will update this review when it's released.

								Update from 08.09.2016: Since 02.05.2016 no major update.I bought the game a year ago because it looked interesting. I didn't look how far it is into development. It wasn't far. Of course you are able to play, but just remember how few things you needed to play as you were a children.If you try hard enough you can spend hours into the hundreds on every task and call it 'fun'.Once again I fooled myself with the Early Access - tag. ""How long can it take to develop this simple 2D game?"" - I said to myself July 2015. Now 2016. Some things have changed, how shall I deny that? Do I have the feeling that they worked a reasoned amount of time on it? No. For me, it is another StarForge.If you've read till this point, you'd kinda expect that I leave some sentences on the gameplay. It's kind of you get what you see. You build rooms for certain tasks. Workers are needed in some of those. If you are behind in production, a junkie will attack you which usually results that the police will check on you. More space is aquiered via attacking buildings, which revolves around sending workers and watch them punch other guys.Once again, you can spend on everything time. But I honestly never got the feeling, that i've experienced anything new nor had I a need to change something after building my first base. Everytime it was the same.			"

Basically hire drug dealers to sell drugs and take over other territories in the neighborhood. So you can have a neighborhood of drugatics.It would also be cool to see this game add a multiplayer battles, take over other territories till your opponent has no territories left.Sandbox mode can improve by actually making it unlimited everything.Maybe even add some missions and a storyline.It would be a lot better if they added different games and give the gangs names.Easy 4.3 stars for this game at the moment.

---OLD REVIEWIt has a lot of potential, but I'm afraid I can't recommend it at the moment.  It's extremely bare bones, what with no menu, no tutorial, no tool tips, no save function, and no direction as to what it is you're actually supposed to do (you're creating and selling drugs, I think).  I figured some of it out eventually and actually like some of what it does...the whole base-building underground reminds me of XCOM a bit, albeit a simplified version.  If you're fine with a game that's missing a lot of core features and want to support the devs, then fine...though I personally recommend waiting for more content to see if the $9 is justified.  I'll revisit my recommendation later down the line as development continues.

								Early Access Review.Basement as it stands is the very bare bones of a game, but it does say that when you buy it. So for from what i am able to play I have enjoyed the game. And if the game lives up to the word of the devs and the expectations of the community i believe it is worth the investment. a solid 6/10 so far so give it a try. Bellow is my reason for the score.Although the game in in early development the foundations of what the game will be about are already there. You can tell it will be a fun game to try and over come the challenges of your neighborhood and create a nice drug empire. It has the elements you would expect at this stage including rooms to build people to recruit and police to fight.The future of this game could be a great one as long as the devs don't neglect or give up on it and complete the game to a good standard.  Things that i would hope to be implemented in this game would be stating the obvious to people. But they include more enemy types, more rooms and vehicles. On top of this i would like to see skills for my employees and a larger leveling system. may increase 3 to 5 or 10 and level the gains per level but end on a high total. I have high hopes for this game and i have enjoyed the quick run play i gave it. I will be adding a few more hours in the next few weeks and look forward to at least monthly updates.			"

Early Access Review
								1.7 ReviewBasement NEEDED this update, and it is great! Random spawning cities, a title screen, A SAVE FEATURE!!!, and new trucks.Some problems with 1.7 is the glitches. Some notable glitches:-The bus only shows 2 drugs when it should show 10 (But it does carry 10 still)-Sometimes any worker will keep resting even when they're fully healed and full productivity-The playtime still falls a bit short in my opinion, around an hour I think-No tutorial, although you can experiment rather easilyThis update greatly helps to show us the game's core features and much more. One thing I want to see is different characters' appearances. For example, the cover of Basement shows a hazmat worker with a gas mask, PLEASE add this to some workers!Also, I would like to see if an achievement and trading card system is implemented, please work on it :)Other than that, keep developing Basement, and I look forward to upcoming updates!VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVFirst release reviewVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVEarly Access Basement...I've been waiting for this game to come out for multiple months, and I was patient.To my dismay, Basement doesn't have too much features and lacks game features- as noted when the game is stared. Quick list:Good--------AWESOME soundtrack!-Great visuals with pixels-Great core gameplay/storyline-It fits a great Strategy/Simulation-First ever I know of ""Drug Dealing Sim""Bad--------NO SAVE FEATURE! I played for a half hour to lose all my progress when I quit the game...-NO TUTORIAL! Luckily I watched a video on youtube of some gameplay so I know what to do...-Low content, short lived (You'll beat it in an hour or so, then you HAVE to restart)-No trading cards nor achievementsAll in all, I think Basement has great potential to being a great game. Unfortunately, the small Halfbus team of I think 3 people can't make the game too quick. I recommend buying the game if you want to support Halfbus and get a general idea of what this game will become. If you're impatient, I don't recommend buying this game as it's not complete and lacks major features. Good luck to you Halfbus, please make updates ASAP! I'll be waiting ;)			"

								Rather fun in a micro-managing sort of style but the game is currently very much a WIP. Not a bad thing, mind you, just not completed yet and it shows. The game has a gulf in replayability after the first few wins. Wait a while and pick the game up when a few more updates come forth.			"

Early Access Review
								Time to cook.If you ever wondered what it's like to play a drug lord simulator, this is it. The game plays like a strategy game, therefore demands critical thinking and micromanagement. If you aren't any good at strategy games, I would still recommend you give it a shot. This is coming from a player who doesn't play any strategy games.The game is still in development and has yet to reach it's full potential. At the moment I don't think there is enough replay capability to justify spending the 8 or 9 dollars.If you do decide to pick this up now, my advice is to jump right into it. Trial by fire. Your first several attempts are going to be, more often than not, colossal failures. The game currently has no tips or suggestions for noobs. It actually reminded me of my first time playing Minecraft in that there were no clear instructions. But with a little perserverance, you will understand the innerworkings of the game. Final thoughts: Put this game on your wishlist and keep an eye on it. I believe once this game rolls out more content and adresses its lack of replayability, it will find a nice place in both your heart and library.And remember, don't do drugs kids.			"

								This game is the start of something amazing. Though I must emphisise the START of something. This game is like no other and I can see as time continues and the devs add more and more it can easily become a masterpiece. I can see the game taking many twists and turns such as adding a possible villian, or quests/story lines, maybe even a co-op multiplayer; the possibilities are almost endless. Though again like I say in the begining it's only the start, easily noticed as in the first 20 minutes I took over every house/store/prison/other stuff like that and had 10's of thousands of dollars.In all keep an eye out on this game for future updates and if it goes on sale definitely get it.Edit: Oh and I can't forget about the very cool pixel art graphics :)			"

								This game has a lot of potential, it is really fun so far. It is missing a lot of features, but shows promise.I play it as if I am a mob boss, setting up an underground business. Fortunately, there are no rival gangs to pose a threat, just the police. You create and sell various narcotics and fend of the police to do so as you try and capture new ground.That is all, for now. But it's still pretty awesome.			"

								To start off, I found this game and it looked cool. I bought it shortly after and I played it for a little while. Then I started going through some of the game's quirks. Personally, it's not for me. There aren't enough story levels and they're too short as well. Pros:ManagementBase-buildingSpecific goals with a tutorial and goalsDrugsSandbox mode, with unlimited possibilites and infinte replayabilityCons:Clunky ControlsMinimal base-buildingNo sense of accomplishmentNo on-going games, just short and sweet levelsSo, in conclusion, Basement is not for me. I would prefer an on-going, story-driven, and a bit more detailed game similar to this.			"

Early Access Review
								After having played a couple of hours i have managed to pretty much complete and do everything there is to be done at the moment in the game, but that doesn't stop me from wanting to jump back into the game and start again, making a better organised drug basement.The game puts you as a sort've head of a drug cartel, and you must hire different staff to make the drugs and to protect your facilities from the police that come inspecting every once in a while. You have to build up your main facility to export different types of drugs to different stores that you take over by attacking them when you have enough men. It is still a game very early in its developement, I myself have not come across any bugs so it seems to be a stble game to play and wont cause many problams. At the moment you are very limited with what you can interact with, build and do. You won't be able to play this more then a few hours at this stage but as the updates come out, this game will show more and more promise and I have no doubt it will become a game that you wont be able to put down after hours and hours. Until then you could see this version of the game as a short taste of what its like. "

The developers have been more than gracious in being up front with the current stage of developement and expressing that this is still early alpha. That being said; this is a great game.  It's fun, its gritty, and has a good ebb and flow of gameplay.  If you enjoy quirky, innovative indie games pick this one up.			"

WHY?????- List of workers keep flipping its order back and forth everytime I open the listing- Glitch where angry junkie would run back and forth outside of the building, not doing any damage or fighting anyoneThat being said, I'm pretty in love with this game.

								So, I think the game is well-made, but the only problem is it is not finished. (That´s why it is an alpha :D).The game is easy, you have like a drug factory and you need to produce and sell it so you can get money, with more money you can get more rooms, different drugs labor and yeah you can buy new workers. (You have two type of workers that you can buy, the drug producer and the ""fighters""). The fighters take care of the police and they have more life and strength than the drug producers.Yeah, so the things I think need to be made are:- that you can develop the transporters, so you can transport more drugs- that you can construct in any house/garage any room and that you can dig in any house/garage so you can build a room- that you can have partners, so like you have your region and you can work together with other regions/drug dealers- training room for the ""fighters"" and drug section training for the drug producers- police office and different types of police officers- that you just not can have partners but opponents too that want to get your region tooand yeah, I think this would be what I would like to have in this game but even if it isn´t done, it makes even now really fun and yeah I hope that this project starts to develop to not just a good but an excellent game !

This game could - and SHOULD be so much more. Sadly, the devs have decided to abandon it. I hope they enjoy all their money from Early Access, but it seems they have abandoned this project - the last update was 4 months ago and the last update on their site was 8 months ago. At the current status it is not worth the money. If they actually developed a game around it it would be worth so much more. What a shame.			"

Suffice to say, I'm no fan of this game.I get early access can sometimes be buggy, but this feels pre-alpha. The interface is reminiscent of a badly written dos game from the 90s. There's always an element of doubt that you're going to achieve your intended goal whenever you click on anything.  The graphics are atrocious, but I've got no complaint about that. Graphics do not equal gameplay and gameplay is where this title is let down and solely what I'm basing my review on. The $8.99 pricetag suggests that a massive amount of extra content will be added, so the developers are going to be pushing it if they're going to stick to their stated development timeframe. If that happens, I might change my opinion. I won't be holding my breath.Sometimes it's better to keep your masterpiece hidden from view until it is ready to reveal to the world. It is my opinion that the developers of this game would have been wise to follow that advice.			"

								You can't do manual saves. The game only saves when you exit the game.Uber lame. Sure, some people like games like that. I don't. We should at least have an option to choose. This game does not give you that option. Mount and Blade lets you choose what game save mode you want when you start a new game. Basement should do the same thing. Until that feature is implemented, I cannot recommend this game.			"

								Not even 2hrs into the game and iv got so much money i dont know what to do with it...police bribes are far 2 low, more skills and rooms requiredneeds rival gangs trying to take locations either forcing you to defend or reclaim them, also fluctuating supply and demand for individual areas so to make shipping certain types of drugs around far more lucrative, aswel as drug quality which should effect the price and demand of the product.I also noticed in the pictures that preview the game contain images that have rooms that seem to be conjoined? as to make them more productive..? also a district map? none of which content is available in this game wtf...

								Played all the tutorials. They are fun, but with limits. It's a selected taste. It is too confusing to hire and assign,honestly. I'm pending a refund and pray for it to go through. The old versions (I saw on youtube) seems simpler to hire because then you could hire through rooms not a seperate room. Also, now there is one catagory of people that have strength, production, and etc. stats instead of seperate gurards, cooks, and sellers. I personally didn't like it, but it's maybe worth a try.			"

								I bought this game today as I saw it while I was browsing YouTube. I decided from the video that this game look pretty good and because I am a fan of Strategy games, It instantly clicked with me. I haven't played very much of it already but from what I have experienced it seems like a brilliant game with great potential. Now i'm not saying that It is completely perfect and It does have quite a way to go before it becomes a really great game, but considering it is in early access, it is amazing.8/10 - Would recommend to fans of the Strategy genre and those who like supporting up-and-coming games.

It would also be nice to expand more buildings for shelf space etc. Might not be a bad idea to give the riot police more health, and maybe have upgrades for the basement security. All in all, great game with tons of potential.			"

								NEW REVIEW- The levels are great and allow a new player to experience the game slowly, but for people that played since Early Release they may be too easy.- The sandbox version is great, it allows you to make a Drug Kingdom in a matter of 15 minutes, only problem I have is that it seems to become boring fast.-more updates on review to comeOld REVIEWDefinetely improved than when I played it a few months ago. It now has awesome challenges, as well as a better overall game experience. I love being able to upgrade your rooms now. It was a big problem before because one room couldn't sell things quickly enough. I also think that the main map is very cool for being able to see different missions. VERY OLD REVIEW(Early Release in May 2015) Really fun game I can see this being a entertaining game for hours on end. The only issue I have is that there should be a way to increase selling speed. Its almost impossible to gain any money past day 150 since you are being raided 24/7. This forces you to buy guards. The labor costs and hiring fee then become so expensive that its almost impossible to get out of the hole. Other than that its a fun game, you have to create a drug empire from your basement. THE TIP IS WAY OUT OF DATE (Early Release in May 2015)A tip that might help you finnish the game like I did is to start bribing the cops once you have reached a steady income of money. Its almost always going to be worth more later to pay up then having to wait and buy new guards. The only time you should use guards is to attack new buildings. When attacking always make sure you have 1 or 2 extra guards to make sure they can get the job done. If you want to see a nice layout of your first base that can really help you later check my profile. It's in my opinion the most efficient layout that you can have. Always remember to start of with pot first don't jump to crack until you have tons of money to support the attack and support the bribes needed to keep the building. If you need anymore tips message me and I would be glad to help. :D			"

								Picked the game up after watching a youtuber I like play it. The games really amusing but I do wish you could upgrade your product/henchmen.There have been a few things here and there like an unhappy sign stuck above a door or a customer thats unhappy stuck inside when there is product to be sold.Biggest downfall so far is when you take over a decent amount of the map yet there is nobody to sell to. Im just loosing money because there is to much product and no customers.All in all I cant wait for future updates. Ill probably reset this one and see if I can make some more money by advancing slower this time.			"

								[Note: This is one of those times when a 'maybe' button would be useful - see explanation at the bottom in regards to the negative review.]Basement is, in a nutshell, a reversed Sim Tower meets Breaking Bad. As of the current release, you play an unnamed scientist with the aim of bringing the entire city/urban area/whatever it is under your control. The game is bare bones right now, and goes something like this:- Build new drug labs/security checkpoints.- Hire new chemists/henchmen.- Send henchmen to neighboring buildings to take them over: be prepared to send two or three truckloads, as they tend to die in rather short order.- Send henchmen back to previously conquered locations to fight off police raids (or bribe them if you're making money hand over fist)- Take over every building on the map; you win!The game is lacking in content at the moment - my playtime represents a single game start to finish, with the only replay value being in the randomly generated maps. You have a very small selection of room choices and no upgrades or real variety for your chemists and henchmen (beyond very small stat changes that are tied in to the hiring cost/upkeep of them). On the plus side, the developers seem on the ball with patches and rolling out content, so this should be remedied sooner rather than later.However, I can't recommend it at this time - I think more than a few people would be disappointed by the lack of content for the price. If you want to support the developers, buy it, play it for a bit, and shelve it until you start seeing updates. If you're on the fence, or just know that you'd rather purchase it in a more complete state - just put it on your wishlist and come back in three months.			"

WorldMeth ProductionsSecret, Inc.Company Leaderboards: Companys from the best to the suckiest.1-10 or 1-50 it should rank you up for your money, or how good your meth/drugs are (Note BY THAT i mean they should add a review system if they dont want you to rank up with your money)Afterall, I rate the game:89%/100%If they add the updates:94%/100% "

								This game is fun. It was very easy and I almost beat it in 2 hours but that is to be expected with a game this early in development. I found that i explained things badly at times and I found a few ai problems with the buyers, The cops were easy and the trucks were aggravating but it is a solid preview of the game. I would recommend it, but It could use a difficulty boost, more content, and tutorial. Personal experiences.It was very hard for me to get buyers into my new places, and these new places once you got into them tended to have small amounts of space to work with. So if you want a couple of groweries, or an atom lab good luck finding enough space for them. There are some later game buildings that are bigger but once you get to them you can just delete your security stations and get more space because you don't need guards anymore.I still think this is a good buy though despite its flaws because of the concept, fun( if somewhat tedious but never boring) gameplay, and with some updates this could be refined into something great			"

								This game is still in it's development stage, therefore there are things missing. The game can be 'beaten' in 3 hours but hopefully when it releases there are going to be more areas and the sandbox mode will be larger.. If you want a great game about creating a drug empire, you should buy this. I'm sure this game will meet my hopes when it releases! :D			"

								This game is fun. It was very easy and I almost beat it in 2 hours but that is to be expected with a game this early in development. I found that i explained things badly at times and I found a few ai problems with the buyers, The cops were easy and the trucks were aggravating but it is a solid preview of the game. I would recommend it, but It could use a difficulty boost, more content, and tutorial. Personal experiences.It was very hard for me to get buyers into my new places, and these new places once you got into them tended to have small amounts of space to work with. So if you want a couple of groweries, or an atom lab good luck finding enough space for them. There are some later game buildings that are bigger but once you get to them you can just delete your security stations and get more space because you don't need guards anymore.I still think this is a good buy though despite its flaws because of the concept, fun( if somewhat tedious but never boring) gameplay, and with some updates this could be refined into something great			"

								Althought I like the general idea this game is far from being completed and even though it doesnt cost big bucks I do not recommend until some major patch being implemented. I finished it in about 1h30min and have to say it is way too easy and it misses some management issues and customization. For example you have a district with some people where you can sell but you cant build a dealer place because it wont let you. The garage offers you multiple vehicles to buy but you honestly only need the scooter. All in all I expected a management kind of challenge but the game let me down in this matter. I will play it once again just to see if I only got lucky but so far I give this game 4/10 and would suggest to wait for it being completed.			"

								I have to say, I was dissapointed. I had seen this game in steam greenlight a long time ago and thought it would be cool when it got released, and I just found it, released! I bought it immediately. I would regret it if it wasn't early access. The reason it wasn't good was because once you got to a certain level, you were basically done. You are done 30 minutes into the game, because by then you can have the best room in the game. There needs to be more rooms, types of buildings, men, etc. There needs to be more challenges. I had 10 very good security guards built up, and I am starting to swipe through the district. I just attacked the hardest building with no problem. Unless something happens when I completey finish the district i will be even more dissapointed. BUT this game has AMAZING potential, so I will reccomend it when it reaches that.			"

Early Access Review
								So far, this game seems...Alright.Very little content so far but that's to be expected. I hope the developer adds more rooms, more things to sell, and makes the products more unique. The game seems to lack ""end game"" content, i.e., what is there left to do when you take control and can successfully defend from cops? There should be some high end facilities you can get.Two things I would suggest:There should be bonuses for good room placement. What I mean by that is, say, if you have two storage rooms next to each other, they should connect and be able to hold slightly more. If you have two grow boxes next to each other, maybe they could connect and make a hydroponics lab, which means the production rate gets +.2 or something like that. I think this would make designing your buildings much more interesting. Maybe larger rooms could require a little more power to balance it out?And a more major thing: The game needs to be more forgiving in the beginning. For example, I spent 15 minutes sloooowly expanding so I didn't draw the immediate attention of cops, and then my dealer had to take a break. He came back and got murdered by an angry customer. There was literally nothing I could do about this, because my dealer spawned with low health.Anyway, the game is playable, but not quite enjoyable yet. I'll come look again in a couple months perhaps.p.s. This game is a little more suggestion centered than review centered, but A. this is in early access and the dev needs feedback and B. theres so little content that you've played the entire game if you've watched the trailer.

								My Expectations Were  Pretty Normal As For What I Expect From A Game As Instead Of Buying A Game Just Becuase It Looks Good, I Actually Revise About The Game Before I Buy It So I Know what To Expect And With This Game Being An Early Access I am Going To Go Fairly Easy And Give You My View On The Game So Far How To Make The Game Better For The Player So Lets Get Started.Positives About Basement1. The Game Is Amazing In a Way That The Graphics Should Be Left The Way They Are As That Is What It Will be Known For Like Minecraft, Escapist And Prison Architect As They Are Known For A Description About The Game Which Will Make It Easy for People To Remember And Imagine In Their Head As Someone Explains It To Someone And They Will Be Well Known For How Unique The Graphics For Basement Is As It Brings Back The Original Side-Winder Two Dimensional 64 Bit Games That Everybody Loved Especially In The 21st Century And It Is Now A Pleasure to Play A Game That Makes Me Feel Like I am Going Back In time To The Golden Age Of Gaming When The 1st Revoloution Of Gaming Started Which Went Viral And Makes Me Feel Honored To Have Invested My Money Torwards A Game That Is So Full Of Potential.2. The Theme Of The Game is One Of A Kind And is Out Of The Normal Which Nobody Thinks Of Now. Today All people Are Thinking of is Sequels to Squeeze More Money Out Of Their Buyers Or The Games That Have been Thought Of Before Thinking That it is new Unlike This Which Is Completely Out Of The Blue And Is Very Strategic, Mind testing And Full Of Suprises Which Is What A Modern Game Should Be And Another Miracle of This Game is That They Made So Much Goodness and packed It Into a Two Dimensional Engine Which Is nearly Impossible To give It Long Lasting fun But This Miracle Of A Game From Some Skilled Angel Makers of this Game Have Pulled It Off And It Is Under $10. This Game Will Spark Another revoloution Of Gaming taking It Back In time to The Golden Age.The Down SidesThere Are Only Few Minor Glitches But Other Than That All That Needs To Be Added Is The Old Van Route System Aswell, Easier To Get Vans, More Vehicles With Different Positives And Negatives Like A Sports car That Holds Less but faster Back And Forth And Away From the Police(Old City Route System),  A Few More Buldings To Attack And most Of all Please Add A Save Game ButtonThankyou For Reading And If I Have inspired You To Buy Or Look More Torwards Investing Into The Game, Every Dollar Or Pound Is Worth it.

								Do not buy this game it gets boring after a few hours, STAY AWAY. Spend your money elsewhere, if you havent played Skyrim or Bioshock Infinite or Metro go buy those GOOD games. I strongly discourage anyone from purchasing this game.  It is somewhat entertening at best for about 20 miniutes and then you realize it is actually terrible and try to drown yourself.			"

								This game has lots of deads ends like when your trying to expand dealing you cant because even if you have stock your reputation at a new locations is 0 so, no one comes in therefore resaulting in a waste of trying to get a dealing place set up there. There is also a bunch of smaller bugs and this game is NOT worth it for the price.			"

								Basement is a testament to the current issues with early access. The game is so far from completed that chargeing even a dollar for it is too much. The game currently lacks anyform of play outside of a (very limited) sandbox mode, with no tutorial or story mode to introduce concepts and gameplay. It is a shame that a developer thinks this model of aselling to players a game in it's uncompleted, and frankly unplayable state, is not only allowed, but widely supported.			"

								Review for v0.41 (2/24/2016)This game is still much too early to recommend. Major game elements are missing that would make it actually fun for me to play, time controls are missing, there are typos and poor grammar everywhere. Maybe this will turn out to be fun, but for a simulator wonk like me there wasn't much here.			"

			Basement is a strategy game, where you play as a desperate scientist who chose the wrong path in his life. That path seemed easy, but turned into a deadly one.

								Review targeted for v0.3.0 - RecommendedPositives and negetives+ level system+ buildings+ animation- 1 game experience ruining glitch- RepetitiveThe level system in the game has improved the game and made it a great experience for the player insted of repetitive gameplay as it was before. since i last played the security rooms were a room and are no longer, i think this is a great evolution towards the game and now a training room that levels up your characters health and strengh (attack damage).The lockers and upgrades are a great experience to the game to increase the difficulty and make it easier in simple ways. Simple animations in Basement that give the game a more realistic feel, such as the customers becoming un patient and sometimes ending up dead with an interesting animation that makes the customers have a seizure then dying insted of a sudden death.There will always be bugs in every beta / alpha but one stood out and made my experience repetitive. when my dealers automatically sit down and rest they sometimes dont register as working in that zone and people are coming into the shop getting angry and beating up all my workers when they are working in the designated zone.Overall this game was a great enjoyment and will go far in the gaming industry. 7/10I will continue to review this game after every 0.1.0 updates.

								I was so hyped for this game, however it's not like the game I had expected. I'm sorry, I don't feel like getting into details. Just wanted to get it out.UPDATEok since i wrote this in the comments, just copy-pasting it on here.This game is probably the game that I was most hyped for ever since it's day 1 on greenlight. One of the most turn-offs for me was it was a horizantal scroll game. And I always expected the gameplay to be tycoon-like. I expected to manage my operations like if I was managing a company. And I thought I would be able to buy weapons, fight other druglords, upgrade and research drugs, enlarge rooms, create branches in different cities, find ways to smuggle drugs to other places, buy items like untracable phones or planes. More in-depth. The visual art outside the game is awesome,but the ingame 2d graphics could have looked cooler. I truly don't know how to describe what I had expected, but there is so much potential for the genre that it makes me want to develop my own game..			"

								It was fun for a bit, but i pretty much experienced it all within the first 30 minutes of gameplay. You pretty much put a person in a room to make the drugs, and you put a person in a another room to sell drugs. You can even go out and take over other buildings to get more space to put people in rooms. Long story short, it feels like an overpriced app i could get on my phone, not a $9 steam game. "

								What am I missing? This game is utter crap. You cannot complete the Bank Heist level and can't progress. I can't even figure out how top download the latest version. You would be a fool to buy this game.			"

								Fatigues the system comparing its graphics. ''A real early access''.  It seems like the developers haven't made anything beneficial to improve it since April 2015.There must be some reclamation, like adjusting the system usage,  before you developers demand couple of feedbacks from the new customers.Surely refunded.

Hire a♥♥♥♥♥ton of guards to go everywhere. 4. get bored and make breaking bad refrences until you can't do anymore and fun is impossible. ----------------I will change my ""no"" into a ""yes"" if more content is added and it doesn't get so stale so fast.

								Im going to start off with the fact that I Really like this game. I have no problem spending money on indie games and infact I prefer it over buying AAA titles. I also Realize this is still a super early version of the game. But my honest opinion is that in the games current state it is not worth the money. There is less than a hour of content. No Replayablity. Until the game gets a substantial update keep it on your wish list. At the time of the review I have 79 Minutes played, and the game crashed once and i had to restart. From then on I fumbled though trying to figure out what to do because there is no tutorial, no instructions, nothing. After all that I Still beat it first try no problem. Luckily there is an easy fix, Don't force the game to end after you beat it. I took over the last outpost and was looking forward to just selling drugs and preventing future raids but your only option is to just restart and do the exact same thing you did.I really enjoy the game but there is not enough content at this time.

								I bought this game hoping for updates, but haven't seen any in a while. Save your money.Just editing my review:This game's got people who apparently take other people not liking it to an extreme. The guy who bragged about 623 games and ""realistic expectations"" is clearly someone who is getting paid to try to boost this game's score. This game has not only not been updated, but it is boring. Very paper-rock-scissors gameplay with a wanna-be Breaking Bad decor. This game was about ten bucks, and there's plenty of other, better and fully developed games out there. Basement is fun for fifteen minutes, and the developer does not have the time to make it fun. Don't be fooled by the good reviews, its fun is limited and its concept tired. Try something else.			"

I would have liked to see that in the description before I wasted my money. The tutorial isn't even a tutorial. I lost interest trying to figure out the mechanics of the game.Also, the devs need to choose a different font in-game. It's hard enough figuring out what to do, but reading what little ""helpful"" font there is, is frustrating.			"

Its slow.The previous version had less to choose from, but they had: quick setup, quick objective finishing and overall very quick and unique gameplay, and the version 0.3.1 is slow.I hope devs wont slow the game to a speed of a snail, just because its very easy.

								Basement is an Early Access game where you take on the role as a drug tycoon. You can make your current base of operations underground or expand your drug empire by sending some muscle to the neighbors. Because of it's current stage of development, my review may change.Overall, I give Basement a 7/10 for now.			"

Early Access Review
								First off, I really thought that this game is a great time consumer and is really fun to play. It's fairly easy to navigate the controls and general ideas of this game, with some expense to the bugs that I asume will be rolled out in the alpha version. I like the idea, seeing that I am a sucker for the games with a darker atmosphere, and is really a unique. Definately get this game if you like like the dark stuff, or just want to try somthing completely new.Suggestions: I would like the idea of having the dealers choose which storage they choose to pick their drugs from. All too often I find all the good drugs stored away in my lower storages, untouched, because the dealers refuse to take from a farther away storage. As well, I would like to be able to see how much energy I have, and how much I have used so that I know when I need to get anotherr generator. Thirdly, I find that when I want to buy a room, occasionaly I will have to go to the main menue, and back to my game because it will not let me click ""buy."" Again, those kind of bugs will probably be fixed once the alpha version is released, but just somthing to think about. Also, I was very dissapointed when they took out the designated ""thugs,"" because all too often I find myself trying to figure out whom I trained to be better at fighting, and I liked the look of them too. Lastly, it would make this game much more enjoyable if there waas different enemies than just the cops. People like rival drug lords, or squads of junkies that you could attack, or be attacked by. Again, these are all just ideas for the makers of the game, an i would love it some of my ideas came into focus.			"

								This game is as addicting as the drugs that make up the content of it. Extremely fun and simple, and easy to pick up. You can use strategy without putting too much thought into it like many other strategy games.The only problem is the bugs. One bug in specific makes it so the buses/vans/scooters don't work properly, and many times don't recognize districts as pick up or drop locations. Other than that, I didn't see any real problems.Considering that this is only a pre-alpha build, this game has so much potential. 10/10			"

								Pretty good for a Breaking Bad simulator!All joking aside, it's a shockingly fun little strategy game for what they have so far. You play as a fledgling drug cartel building his empire in a randomly generated district, and are tasked with juggling your funds as you hire cooks, bodyguards, and deal with the police through either fighting or bribing, both of which become harder as your empire becomes bigger. You also have to manage the comfort and health of your employees, because if they get too tired, their productivity/fighting skill goes down, which hurts you in the wallet. It's surprisingly polished for being in the early stages, which is more than can be said for other games that have been released in early access. Ironically it reminds me of those edutainment games I used to play in middle school like Lemonade Stand, as it is at its core a business simulator. My hopes for future updates are more/different drug choices, better ways to manage your employees, and more fighting/building options (and being able to build things in empty cells would be nice hint hint). I also heard Quests were coming soon, so that's worth looking forward to.Definitely worth the 8 bucks imo, now that the latest update added saving.			"

								I backed this game on Kickstarter based on what seemed like a quirky and fun idea and I have played all of the different builds that HalfBus have put out so far ... and I can definitely say that their game is starting to take shape ...

YouTube™ Video: Basement - Early Access Full Playthrough 0.1.2 - Part 1/3 - A New World! 

			Views: 17,122		

			Basement - Early Access Full Playthrough 0.1.2 - Part 1/3 - in which we check back in to the Basement after a long absence ... and the world looks completely different in the current version!		

I didn't enjoy the previous build as much as this one ... the way the game worked didn't seem to be as much fun ... but this one has so much promise ...The game can get quite frantic as you try and work your way across the map while keeping control of the dealers behind you ... and you are constantly thinking ... do I save money and fight or do I pay the bribe and keep all of my guards alive this time ... do I lose some in order to afford the next type of 'cook' ... I really enjoyed playing the game all the way through to victory ... which took around about 50 minutes ... I am really looking forward to more features and just to see where this game goes ...Oh by the way ... the music in this is perfect ... it swells dramatically at points adding to the feeling of impending failure ...

								This is a great fun and hugely additive game which I cant stop playing. There are some things that concern me and i would like to see different in my point of view and oppinion. Firstly the police raids are far to frequent i feel i dont have enough time to move the guards around and buy more. Secondly i would love to see more unlockables more places to go to more houses and sellers and also more vehicles. Also of course im sure it will happen but be able to upgrade everything where things can be upgraded to be faster and produce more. But apart from that this game being early access is a great game and a great way to kill time and relax. I wil continue to play more of this game cause its fun to play.			"

								It certainly seems very promising, and from what I read and saw on the Kickstarter site, they have lots of features planned. I can safely say I am very interested in how the game develops, and I can't wait what it will look like in a few months. That said, the current version is truly only the core play, and doesn't include any replay value. That's why it is important for people to understand that by buying this rough gem they are giving it the necessary nourishment to continue and evolve, and one of the nourishment is patience :)But otherwise I think we can expect a pretty good game once everything is all nice and polished.

								I really, REALLY like this game already. The pixel art is polished and well themed, and the gameplay is interesting and satisfying. My only suggestions are these:- More help. I got to level 3 and I'm lost as how to gain customers. I'm sure I will figure it out and that's satisfying in itself, there's nothing wrong with a game teaching you how to play by actually playing the game. I don't need someone to hold my hand, I think I just need a few extra clues. - Grammar. I know it's early access and some things are probably put in there quickly or as placeholders. It just needs a tidy-up and it will be great. I am so excited to see this game finished. With what you have and what you plan to do it could be an extremely well made game with lots of replayability and challenging aspects.			"

								I've had immense fun with this game! There are some notable issues, although they do not distract from the core element of gameplay. Extremely addictive and a genuinely enjoyable user experience. It takes a short while to start off, but once you get into the swing of things, you'll have speed coming out of your eyeballs.I strongly recommend to anyone interested in tycoons, strategies or anything of the sort!

								Edited review.Basement is a fun management game that puts you in the shoes of a drug dealer attempting to expand his empire in an urban setting.Although still in Early Access, it is fairly playable in its current state, with each subsequent update seemingly focused on extending the game's already considerable playability further.The game requires you to acquire buildings to setup your operations and hire staff to manufacture and distribute your product (as well as hiring muscle to protect it). In addition, you must keep up with the demand of junkies, while diversifying in what drugs you make/sell. This increases your revenue, enabling you to acquire new buildings and expand your empire further, but also makes your business more prone to police raids.Buying transport to transport goods between premises is an option provided you have a garage, providing further depth to your manufacturing and distribution network, and forcing you to think about designating premises to perform particular functions: manufacture, distribution, storage etc.Each character in the game has a set of stats which indicates things attributes such as: health, damage, ability to sell drugs, ability to manufacture etc. which level up over time as the attribute is used. This enables you to specialise your employees in order to maximise their effectiveness at their given tasks.Aesthetically the game's pixel graphics are well-done and quite charming in their presentation. The minimal soundtrack compliments the atmosphere and immersion the chosen pixel art style affords, and I look forward to future updates that expand out the content even further.At the moment the game is currently only a sandbox mode, but the developer has mentioned future updates will also include other traditional game modes.Should you buy the game now in its current state, you will get something that is currently playable, but will also be contributing to its further enhancement which is en exciting prospect given how fun it already is.Lets just hope the updates keep coming :)			"

Also when ever i make the truck stop delivery then it moonwalks in place, like its wheels are going but it not moving. Finally, make the truck deliver to anywhere that you have unlocked, you probbly have but for some reason when i want the truck to do something it doesn't want to do it, like i have storages in one place but it won't pop up on the pickup/drop location. thx and i really love this game			"

It sells itself as a Breaking Bad video game when it is really is a drug empire game that I have personally wanted for a long time.Seeing sa the game is in its pre alpha infancy it is pretty basic and lacks any technical aspects that while throw you. That been said I urge you to buy this game.This game will become something awesome as the updates pour in, and it is something that you can help move more quickly buy buying the game, playing the game, and giving feedback to the creators so that we can all tell them what the game needs to meet its full potential.For fans of: - Lemonade Tycoon- Game Dev Tycoon- Management games			"

								It's really fun, but at the moment it's only a couple hours of fun, not very challenging at all, and I have no reason to play it again after finishing it after an hour or two. Seeing as how it's early access I will give it a positive review because it is a very fun concept with plenty of room for future playability after updates. Definitely one to keep an eye on.Suggestions for the devs.Multiplayer support: Maybe a gaming mode to compete against or attack someone elses drug empire. Spy support would be interesting to infiltrate other players bases as buyers and sabotage them. It would also be neat to have team-based game mode where each player is assigned a role (Spy, Dealer, Bodyguard, Grower/Chemist) and they work as a team to grow an empire and/or beat the other team.Scenarios: Quick objective based scenario's to sell a certain drug at a certain rate in a certain amount of time or survive multiple quick raids.More customization.

								= Pre Alpha Release ==This is what is present right now=This is a great game so far.The potential in this game is ridiculously high.Now the fun part in reviews:Pros:+ Ever expanding drug empire.+ Drug trafficking adds extra managment.+ Customer patience gradually lowers and causes fights. (Funner than fighting police but bad at the same time)+ Great art.+ Cop raids.Cons:- Limited playing field.- Cops can camp at the door of a cop-owned building and kill your henchmen who walk in.- Sometimes workers get confused and don't know how to add the drugs to the storage rooms.- No tooltips.- No upgrading system.This game is amazing so far but these are just some things I'm pointing out. (Sorry if I seem too harsh considering it's a early access game)I think that there are a couple of features that would make this game better:+ Some kind of advertising method (Fliers, Whispers, Websites ect.)+ An arming system where enemies and henchmen can be equipped with weapons and whatnot.+ Rival druglords.+ Obviously a tutorial.+ And obviously upgrades.+ Every house/building isn't the same. (each are unique or have a set kind of style.)+ And lastly cops can't just raid you for no reason. In order to get raided people need to report you or there has to be some evidence towards the drug tycoon.Thank you for reading this.Final (currently)= 8/10 =PLEASE DEVS DONT BAIL THIS PROJECT!			"

Early Access Review
								This game is beautifully done and I've throughly enjoyed it through the past day of playtime. I would absolutely recommend getting this game because I believe that it has a lot of potential to be a blockbuster game that will be on the top of the Steam charts. However, there are some quirks in the game that I'm going to point out here. (I am aware that this game is in alpha right now, but leaving honest opinions helps the creator)Sometimes when the drug is being created, the cook will freeze and the progress bar won't go up any higher. To fix this issue, just click on the cook and click on a nearby couch to send them away to rest. This fixes the issue for the time being.Another thing that's pretty annoying (no fix) is that there are random frowny faces hiding behind the buildings that never seem to disappear. I'm not sure if anyone else is getting this issue or if it's just me. Finally, I'd like to see a larger map that lasts longer than just 120 minutes of playtime. (That's what I'm at right now) I'm sure the creator will add more content to the game as time goes on, so I'm excited to see what's next for this amazing 8-bit game.  Something that would make this larger map more interesting is more frequent police raids when you have more power & more types of drug manufacturing. My honest opinion is that this is a must-have game. Whether you're a hardcore gamer or a casual gamer, you'll have amazing experiences with this game! :)			"

								The game is only in early access and is very promising. I usually don't play early access games because of the way starbound was. The game has a good concept. It's very entertaining. One idea for the full version would be a campaign mode. Where you can choose from three different guys or a few different guys. And instead of one city, have maybe 5. So your drug company has to take over all the cities. Also adding in storyline in that mode would make it awesome. Even though the game's only in early access it is very fun, I would recommend this game. The things that are promised to be in later sound great. I will edit this review after more updates. Keep up the good work.			"

								Great game in development! Obviously not finished, although replayable. Even with the late start, Basement shows promise and the devs don't slack like many early access devs. WHEN, not if, the game is finished, I think it'll exceed our expectations			"

								------ 21st June Build------This game has the power to totally enthrall you, regardless if you'll say ""Just 5 minutes and that's it"", you just won't close the game!I just managed to conquer all the buildings, and it was fun trying to understand which one to attack first in order to maintain the economy balance. Sure there's still a lot to add, the devs know it and are working on great game content for the future . If this quality will be kept for the incoming builds, Basement is going to be a pretty good drug dealing management game! :) Keep up the good work!			"

								A neat little game of the new indie genre that has appeared. It sells itself as a Breaking Bad video game when it is really is a drug empire game that I have personally wanted for a long time.Seeing sa the game is in its pre alpha infancy it is pretty basic and lacks any technical aspects that while throw you. That been said I urge you to buy this game.This game will become something awesome as the updates pour in, and it is something that you can help move more quickly buy buying the game, playing the game, and giving feedback to the creators so that we can all tell them what the game needs to meet its full potential.For fans of: - Lemonade Tycoon- Game Dev Tycoon- Management games			"

								Basement is a must buy indie game where the goal is to create a drug dealing empire! This game was greated in 2-3 days, in a game jam competition, which is mindblowing when you see the quality of the game. At first it can be tough to figure things out, so you may have to restart a few times before you get the ball rolling. This is early acess so they are planning to add much more to the game, I am definatly excited for the future of Basement.			"

								Although this game is still in early alpha, there's still enough content to get the core concepts of the game down. However, it does take a few tries to get the hang of your drug empire because there is some what of steep learning curve. This game doesn't hold your hand through the first couple minutes.  If you're too agressive and too expansive in the early game, the short pixelly arms of the law will come crashing down on your gasmask.I'm interested to see if this game gets the love and the attention from both gamers and the developers because its almost as addicting as the products your selling! There's a lot of upside to this game and I cannot wait to have more tools to fashion my empire with!			"

								Basement is a fun game. the game is great but the only complaint i have are the gangs. The gangs are too OP and i think there should be a way to switch them off or they shold be nerfed. the gangs over time will eventually take over the WHOLE town and they already have a base settup that is extremely OP and too hard. The egangs should at least be limited to attacking specific buildings. And your basement shouldnt have to suffer from gang attacks. your basement should at least be the only building that gangs cant attack. but something seriously has to be done about the gangs becuase they are OP and too hard to beat.

								A great game and all around fun. If you like doing what i do over my weekend or just making drugs, it's a great game. the only lacking thing is the amount of druggs you can make. and the lack of options to do somthing for exsample. you could do an import option to get timmy to steal his mom's ""stash"" or maybe the option to befriend other gangs and have them beat the skull's into your ""un-friendly human beings"". But, it is an early access game that is GREAT and worth the money, just need's improvment and with your money, they will! So why not get the ""My Weekend In a Nutshell Simulator"". P.S. I don't have a meth lab in my basment, i know one of you is going to get all mad but, to inform thy, I DO NOT MAKE DRUGS IN MY BASMENT.

								What can I say? This game is amazing. It isn't perfect, but most games aren't. This game is for you if you love tycoon games and selling drugs to random homeless men and women, which actually kind of makes the game sound boring, but believe me it isn't. I give this game an 8/10 and here is why:Pros:-The game simply has an amazing concept which I enjoy and find sometimes comedic which is to sell drugs. Simple, but I love that about it. It isn't complicated and takes almost no time to get a hang of, but I love it.-Good looking game. It has good graphics and I do understand it is a pixel game but it just looks nice. It is appealing to the eye which makes it easier to binge on for a few hours.-Still being updated. They update the game and I only got the game today but to my understanding they update it either often or in big updates at a time, since the game is rather new and has still changed a lot since it came out. I finished the game and I cant wait to play it again when they add new exciting things to do.-Casual. It isn't a very difficult game to play and is kind of relaxing when you get into it... Well as relaxing as a drug cooking and dealing game can be...-Replayability. It is decently replayable. I am not going to replay the game 50 more times and waste 100 hours of my life on it (at least not until they update it again) but still decently replayable.Cons-Repetative. Even though it is replayable, after a few run throughs, I'd imagine that it would become very repetative, which is why I hope they continue to update the game.-Short. It does not take very long to beat the game especially if you tried. I kind of messed around a bit and still beat the game in less then 2 hours. If I really tried I could do it in less then 1.5 hours.-Easy. Yes I did say it was casual but I really hope they add maybe a difficulty option or some way to make it more of a challenge after beating the game the first time. I beat it once and now I want to beat it again, but I want it to be harder then the first time and give me a good run for my money.-No content. It is in early access which is why there is less content then a full fledged game would and should have but it is also most likely cheaper then the game will be in the future and is almost an investment in a game in hopes it will become even better.Overall, great game. It needs some work but it is early access so don't get it and immediatelly refund it because wait a week or two and they will already have some new stuff to try out. I actually found out about this game from a youtube video by Sips and I decided to get the game. If you are uncomfortable getting an early access game then don't. If you are unsure remember that you will be getting an unfinished game but you will also be supporting the developers and speeding up progress at the same time. I hope everyone who gets the game enjoys it like I did and it now eagerly waiting for the next update.			"

								It's a game where you make a drug dealing based criminal empire as tension mounts with police raid after police raid; in the current build your empire is divided into districts (dealers, garages, construction sites etc) you use your main district to build downwards xcom style, hiring chemists to make your product, and thugs to protect and take back your districts from police. There are multiple room types and a good supply chain, and your ""employees"" (both chemists and thugs) require to rest or they won't work as effective. Combat is a simple dungeon keeper style of throw the most/toughest of your dudes at their dudes and they automatically fight until the other side falls over, your units can level up too (one of my original chemists could take down a riot officer). To be clear this is a skeleton but a damn fine skeleton, I beat it in 90 minutes and am waiting eagerly for future updates. Highly recommended but is by no means a complete game.			"

								this game has potential, however it gets to the point where when the police raid its cheaper to bribe than to lose 3 or more guards (guards costing 400 each and the most a bribe costs late game is 1200). also it only took 60 minutes to complete and is pretty much just a flash game at this point, and once complete it has pretty much no replay value as all you can do is play the game from the start again, you cant even keep playing with the setup you just made. guards should have more variety when you hire them e.g. higher level guards cost more but lower level guards can be leveled up and cost less. i also think you should be able to upgrade the vans to carry more product or maybe even be able to buy more vans, you could apply this to the dealers as well so you can either upgrade them to sell more or buy more dealers to sell for you. overall though this is a cool game and i look forward to the future updates.

								Fun little game...but for the price I wanted more out of it.Will play again once it's out of BetaAt the moment it's a little too simpleYou can only fight or bribe the police for an example and the game gives you time to prepare while the cops are coming over...I'd like to see something like hide drugs...dump drugs into toilet and so forth as well once I build more facilities in the basement...hide in the stove, garage that sort of thingBut like I said, fun little game, a bit expensive for what you get right now			"

								The game is okay I guess, I mean it has a few game breaking flaws like not being able to select the truck's their stock/destination it prioritizes weed over the more expensive drugs like acid and brown which completely makes no sense, the bodyguards are probably what annoys me most as you can't select their targets and most of ur body guards will just iddle away walking into other rooms while the ones fighting keep fighting till their dead. Thus making it unnecisarily hard level up your bodyguards. Personally I would have implemented these features from the start before it even got green lit cuz they are pretty critical for gameplay. Anyways, I've played this a few times over a short time span and its fun to play a bit easy difficulty wise even with the critical bugs and short but hey. All is forgiven since its early access.			"

								The problems I find with it is a lack of tutorial. I felt great figuring it out, but electric usage, profit dropping, managing units, over a expedited 24 hours, and being raided while learning controls might not work for everyone. But its fun when you figure it out. I noticed everything listed from the previous update except ""New trucks."" I thought it meant new as in additional. The ice cream truck is still funny. The biggest issue I had is a glitch. After taking half the map by capturing a large chemical district I realized I had almost no money. I had three trucks in possession but none of them were moving, leaving me with barely full storage rooms. My chemists looked like they were working, using their energy, but weren't producing anything. Like the update says, I had a dealer and producer in the same district, so this could be a similar problem. Great game so far with interesting mechanics. Looking forward to the final version.			"

								This is a great fun and hugely additive game which I cant stop playing. There are some things that concern me and i would like to see different in my point of view and oppinion. Firstly the police raids are far to frequent i feel i dont have enough time to move the guards around and buy more. Secondly i would love to see more unlockables more places to go to more houses and sellers and also more vehicles. Also of course im sure it will happen but be able to upgrade everything where things can be upgraded to be faster and produce more. But apart from that this game being early access is a great game and a great way to kill time and relax. I wil continue to play more of this game cause its fun to play.			"

								Excellent game overall. Very fun to play, definitely worth $9.99 even though it is still in Pre-Alpha. This game will be a hit when it is released in six to eight months. Great gameplay for the Pre-Alpha version, however I hope that they will soon add the ability to move your employees to different districts and most importantly, to have the option to save. This is the only downside of buying the game at its current state, although it is still worth it. Great job, Halfbus, continue the good work.			"

								This game is awesome for everything it is, and especially early access. The only couple problems I see right now is that instead of distributing guards all over the map, I end up moving them all at once because I can replace the empty cells with a generator, and a resting room (which is what you need). I beat the game in about a hour too, so I think something needs to be added to lengthen gameplay.			"

								It's a game where you make a drug dealing based criminal empire as tension mounts with police raid after police raid; in the current build your empire is divided into districts (dealers, garages, construction sites etc) you use your main district to build downwards xcom style, hiring chemists to make your product, and thugs to protect and take back your districts from police. There are multiple room types and a good supply chain, and your ""employees"" (both chemists and thugs) require to rest or they won't work as effective. Combat is a simple dungeon keeper style of throw the most/toughest of your dudes at their dudes and they automatically fight until the other side falls over, your units can level up too (one of my original chemists could take down a riot officer). To be clear this is a skeleton but a damn fine skeleton, I beat it in 90 minutes and am waiting eagerly for future updates. Highly recommended but is by no means a complete game.			"

								this game has potential, however it gets to the point where when the police raid its cheaper to bribe than to lose 3 or more guards (guards costing 400 each and the most a bribe costs late game is 1200). also it only took 60 minutes to complete and is pretty much just a flash game at this point, and once complete it has pretty much no replay value as all you can do is play the game from the start again, you cant even keep playing with the setup you just made. guards should have more variety when you hire them e.g. higher level guards cost more but lower level guards can be leveled up and cost less. i also think you should be able to upgrade the vans to carry more product or maybe even be able to buy more vans, you could apply this to the dealers as well so you can either upgrade them to sell more or buy more dealers to sell for you. overall though this is a cool game and i look forward to the future updates.

Early Access Review
 I GOT THIS GAME IN EARLY ACCESS! PERFORMANCE AND / OR CONTENT MAY BE DIFFERENT! It all starts out basic like it should, you begin with a Growbox for gowing weed.you have a seller, a guard and a cooker.Let's explain what each class does.The seller sells the drugs that your cooker has made and has stored in the tiny storage that the cooker puts them in, the weed comes at a price of 150$ the acid at 170$ the mushrooms at 180 - 200$ and the cocain at ­∼ 200 The guard guards you (obviulsy) and you can use them to take over other buildings (I'll get into that later don't worry)And the cooker the most important guy you'll ever have, he cooks..... and that's it there's nothing else to him.Let's get into the police part.There are in every building in the game exept in the basement that you start in.and they guard that specific house for the rest of the game unless you raid them and take the house over.you can do that by clicking on the fist button (no dirty pun intended)and if your guards and other guys that you send there win, then you get the building and you can then put stuff like generators in there and acid stalls and etc.there's not much else to it right now when it's in this state but, I'm certain there will be more in the future.I hope there will be a tutorial and cutscenes and some story and I would LOVE to see some more drug stands for this game! Anyways, I'm impressed how much there is to do in this game at this state!If you have good waiting skills and a clever mind you can beat this game! I give this game my rating ooooff... 8.5/10 It naturally has some bugs as every game has, but that doesn't stop it from being a good game!get it if you have the money.			"

								Really good strategy game about expanding your ""Business"" and ""Capital"" across 15 (Currently) buildings on the map which is basically the current end game. The cool thing is the 15 abandoned buildings are randomly generated each play through and choosing the right approach to conquer those points of ""Interest"" is really what the game is all about. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a new twist on the strategy realm... 10/10 ""My Brown stuff caused 7 people to OD and had the cops raiding me, but luckly i could bribe them away.""			"

								This game is amazing. I love the different things to do and the rooms to conquer. It has a great style and feel and the animation is of a unique standard. I can not wait for what the full game and even the true alpha have to offer when there is such a high standard and level in the current games developement. Please keep up the great work and create many many more fantastic games like this one. "

Early Access Review
								First off, I really thought that this game is a great time consumer and is really fun to play. It's fairly easy to navigate the controls and general ideas of this game, with some expense to the bugs that I asume will be rolled out in the alpha version. I like the idea, seeing that I am a sucker for the games with a darker atmosphere, and is really a unique. Definately get this game if you like like the dark stuff, or just want to try somthing completely new.Suggestions: I would like the idea of having the dealers choose which storage they choose to pick their drugs from. All too often I find all the good drugs stored away in my lower storages, untouched, because the dealers refuse to take from a farther away storage. As well, I would like to be able to see how much energy I have, and how much I have used so that I know when I need to get anotherr generator. Thirdly, I find that when I want to buy a room, occasionaly I will have to go to the main menue, and back to my game because it will not let me click ""buy."" Again, those kind of bugs will probably be fixed once the alpha version is released, but just somthing to think about. Also, I was very dissapointed when they took out the designated ""thugs,"" because all too often I find myself trying to figure out whom I trained to be better at fighting, and I liked the look of them too. Lastly, it would make this game much more enjoyable if there waas different enemies than just the cops. People like rival drug lords, or squads of junkies that you could attack, or be attacked by. Again, these are all just ideas for the makers of the game, an i would love it some of my ideas came into focus.			"

								This game is awesome for everything it is, and especially early access. The only couple problems I see right now is that instead of distributing guards all over the map, I end up moving them all at once because I can replace the empty cells with a generator, and a resting room (which is what you need). I beat the game in about a hour too, so I think something needs to be added to lengthen gameplay.			"

								This is a great fun and hugely additive game which I cant stop playing. There are some things that concern me and i would like to see different in my point of view and oppinion. Firstly the police raids are far to frequent i feel i dont have enough time to move the guards around and buy more. Secondly i would love to see more unlockables more places to go to more houses and sellers and also more vehicles. Also of course im sure it will happen but be able to upgrade everything where things can be upgraded to be faster and produce more. But apart from that this game being early access is a great game and a great way to kill time and relax. I wil continue to play more of this game cause its fun to play.			"

								Excellent game overall. Very fun to play, definitely worth $9.99 even though it is still in Pre-Alpha. This game will be a hit when it is released in six to eight months. Great gameplay for the Pre-Alpha version, however I hope that they will soon add the ability to move your employees to different districts and most importantly, to have the option to save. This is the only downside of buying the game at its current state, although it is still worth it. Great job, Halfbus, continue the good work.			"

								Edited review.Basement is a fun management game that puts you in the shoes of a drug dealer attempting to expand his empire in an urban setting.Although still in Early Access, it is fairly playable in its current state, with each subsequent update seemingly focused on extending the game's already considerable playability further.The game requires you to acquire buildings to setup your operations and hire staff to manufacture and distribute your product (as well as hiring muscle to protect it). In addition, you must keep up with the demand of junkies, while diversifying in what drugs you make/sell. This increases your revenue, enabling you to acquire new buildings and expand your empire further, but also makes your business more prone to police raids.Buying transport to transport goods between premises is an option provided you have a garage, providing further depth to your manufacturing and distribution network, and forcing you to think about designating premises to perform particular functions: manufacture, distribution, storage etc.Each character in the game has a set of stats which indicates things attributes such as: health, damage, ability to sell drugs, ability to manufacture etc. which level up over time as the attribute is used. This enables you to specialise your employees in order to maximise their effectiveness at their given tasks.Aesthetically the game's pixel graphics are well-done and quite charming in their presentation. The minimal soundtrack compliments the atmosphere and immersion the chosen pixel art style affords, and I look forward to future updates that expand out the content even further.At the moment the game is currently only a sandbox mode, but the developer has mentioned future updates will also include other traditional game modes.Should you buy the game now in its current state, you will get something that is currently playable, but will also be contributing to its further enhancement which is en exciting prospect given how fun it already is.Lets just hope the updates keep coming :)			"

								What can I say? This game is amazing. It isn't perfect, but most games aren't. This game is for you if you love tycoon games and selling drugs to random homeless men and women, which actually kind of makes the game sound boring, but believe me it isn't. I give this game an 8/10 and here is why:Pros:-The game simply has an amazing concept which I enjoy and find sometimes comedic which is to sell drugs. Simple, but I love that about it. It isn't complicated and takes almost no time to get a hang of, but I love it.-Good looking game. It has good graphics and I do understand it is a pixel game but it just looks nice. It is appealing to the eye which makes it easier to binge on for a few hours.-Still being updated. They update the game and I only got the game today but to my understanding they update it either often or in big updates at a time, since the game is rather new and has still changed a lot since it came out. I finished the game and I cant wait to play it again when they add new exciting things to do.-Casual. It isn't a very difficult game to play and is kind of relaxing when you get into it... Well as relaxing as a drug cooking and dealing game can be...-Replayability. It is decently replayable. I am not going to replay the game 50 more times and waste 100 hours of my life on it (at least not until they update it again) but still decently replayable.Cons-Repetative. Even though it is replayable, after a few run throughs, I'd imagine that it would become very repetative, which is why I hope they continue to update the game.-Short. It does not take very long to beat the game especially if you tried. I kind of messed around a bit and still beat the game in less then 2 hours. If I really tried I could do it in less then 1.5 hours.-Easy. Yes I did say it was casual but I really hope they add maybe a difficulty option or some way to make it more of a challenge after beating the game the first time. I beat it once and now I want to beat it again, but I want it to be harder then the first time and give me a good run for my money.-No content. It is in early access which is why there is less content then a full fledged game would and should have but it is also most likely cheaper then the game will be in the future and is almost an investment in a game in hopes it will become even better.Overall, great game. It needs some work but it is early access so don't get it and immediatelly refund it because wait a week or two and they will already have some new stuff to try out. I actually found out about this game from a youtube video by Sips and I decided to get the game. If you are uncomfortable getting an early access game then don't. If you are unsure remember that you will be getting an unfinished game but you will also be supporting the developers and speeding up progress at the same time. I hope everyone who gets the game enjoys it like I did and it now eagerly waiting for the next update.			"

								10x better than drug wars and all it's clones. so far it looks like it will be a great game. it's very much pick up and play you might need to do some expermenting with the game to figre out some of the stratagy. overall the main goal is to take over all the districts on the map.			"

								I will recommend this game to just about anyone and everyone, great game. Just no story line and it's a really fast game. Played for about an hour (maybe less) and beat it. Could be alittle longer and have a few more upgrades.. It felt too short but it's still a great strategy game.			"

								Even in pre-alpha this game is a lot of fun. Certainly lacking in content and features, but fair warning is given even before you buy the game. The basic foundations are there for a really great game, and if the developers continue to enhance it and add more content, it'll be just that.			"

								Outstanding game, this game has gone a long way from since when i first bought it when it was only sandbox with no enemy gangs except the cops. Honestly i love this game so much and the developers are always working hard on advancing the game. I would recommend this game to anybody. I think the best part is how the game is only $8.99 when most developers would make a game like this cost at least $15			"

								Basement is a fun game. the game is great but the only complaint i have are the gangs. The gangs are too OP and i think there should be a way to switch them off or they shold be nerfed. the gangs over time will eventually take over the WHOLE town and they already have a base settup that is extremely OP and too hard. The egangs should at least be limited to attacking specific buildings. And your basement shouldnt have to suffer from gang attacks. your basement should at least be the only building that gangs cant attack. but something seriously has to be done about the gangs becuase they are OP and too hard to beat.

								I  bought this game because I was obsessed with Breaking Bad and wanted to know what it was like to run a meth lab. The weird brooding electronic music and 8 bit graphics hooked me even more. It's harder than it looks and and it's incomplete as of yet but I recommend it as good, clean, fun. Like Sim Tower but everyone is addicted and the towers are pretty short.			"

								Very good game, even in early stage of development.  Good mix of challenging play and fun replayability.  HIghly recommended for anyone who wants to go Breaking Bad, Walter White style!Recomendations for later versions:- Fix bug when hiring new employees from multiple sites during game pause- Rebalance starting strength/money when confronted with gangs- Allow for multiple/better upgrades for locker/generator to further reduce footprint while building- Be able to upgrade storage spaces/vaults for greater storage capability- Allow purchase of weapons (even melee) for increased damage capability- Randomize first hitter instead of always defender-fights-first- Ability to rename characters/buildings- Place upgrade button below demolish button on research bench tile to be consistent with other upgradeable structures- Should be a greater gap between drug prices (before beginning research)- A money laundering feature to prevent cops/gangs from seizing vault funds- More floors to build on or larger buildings- Customizable starting conditions, building sizes, etc.			"

								Basement .... what to say well when i first got it i was not expecting much but was i suprised it is a great game well worth getting.. I have not played much of it but what i have seen is great. Really fun, a must get in my book. Yes it is early access so there are places to be improved on. There is a small part in the game that does happen to get to me a little. When you go into sadbox mode there is no end result as you expect as it is sandbox. so there is no way of getting back to your map. You have to start over again (unless i am totaly missing a way of returning to your map.) Other then this small thing i have fallen inlove with this game. So far so good.			"

								Oh gods.This was such an impulse buy after watching Breaking Bad ...But it was suprisingly fun to order my own hoodlums to town.Good amount of content for buck, some cool easter eggs and the occasional violent junkie.What more can you need ?Dev still lovingly takes care of his/her game.So show some love !Njoy folks.P.S.: If you just watched Breaking Bad and are totally in that illegal zone, get it.For you, it will be a guaranteed hit.

								Well, what to say:I do really like this game due to the low difficulty. You can play without thinking, for quite some time. Its not that much managing that a hardcore gamer would be pleased, but its quite fair.			"

								it is kind of, unfinished. The game from what i can see, is dead. No updates for 3 month.Pros: 1. Fun for a while2. Good idea.Cons:1. Abandon by devs (no more content from what i can see)2. Buggy and hard to learn.3. you can get through everything in 90-120 minutes4. No Completly sandbox modeI would not buy this game, updates have been slowing down and as seemed to stop. Don't buy the game until new content comes or price is down to about, 2-3$ that is what i would buy it at.If the Devs are reading this, make this into a gem, and not into mighty number 9.			"

								For the price this game it is a steal, if you are a fan of building and management with a criminal undertone this is the game for you. Although it is only in alpha it is still a ton of fun to play, I see a huge amount of potential and its already good. I very much enjoy the sim tower feel to is, the different rooms and different drugs are fun to manufacture.			"

								My thoughts on this game are mixed. I would recommend it, but I would wait for it to go on sale before you buy it. Eight dollars is not much and when it goes on sale you can get it for a pretty low price. The game is a lot of fun, but is somewhat low on content. There is a ""campaign mode"" that is six missions long, but there is no overarching story to them, and they are more like a series of scenarios that you can play. They ramp up in difficulty as they go on. There is also an endless mode. The gameplay is a lot of fun, and kept me engaged throughout the whole game. Each of the scenarios are fun and provide an interesting new thing to do in the game. For example one scenario has you in a prison where you can't hire people. Instead you get new workers by taking over cell blocks. I enjoy the graphics of the game. Also the game had no problems running on my computer which is now especially getting quite out of date. I never had any problems with long loading times, or lag. The interface in the game is very intuitive, and is easy to use. The game is also easy to learn, and can be simple, but also has some features that provide some more complexity, so the game is great if you want to play it casually or more seriously. So far everything that I have said has been pretty positive, but there are some negative aspects to this game. First off the game has a lack of content, only six missions and an endless mode won't take you long to beat. I have beaten the game twice and have about 7 hours of playtime, as of writing this review. There has been a while since an update to the game, and it seems that the devs are not putting a lot of time into developing the game further. This is why I can't recommend the game at the full eight dollars especially if you have a tight game budget. The other negative thing that I have to say about the game is that there are some unfair game mechanics. One feature of the game is that the police will come and raid you occasionally. When they arrive they will give you an option, you can fight them or can bribe them to go away without a fight. I think there has been a total of one or two times where I have been able to pay off the bribe. Even when I have a lot of money I can't pay it off and that can be a bit frustrating because the police can kill a lot of your workers or even fully take over your main base. You can avoid this risk by having a person that has very good fighting stats in your base. However it was still frustrating when it happened. Other than this most of the gameplay features are balanced. The gangs in the final mission can sometimes kill you very early in the game before you have a real time to set up which was again frustrating. However even considering this bit of frustration that I had the gameplay of Basement was very fun and I found myself wanting to try the mission again, or immediately planning how I can take back my base from the police or bring it back to its former glory. PROS-Good Graphical Style -Fun Gameplay-Good Strategy-Mostly Bug Free (I haven't encountered any, but I don't want to say it is completely bug free)-Will run on pretty much any computerCONS-Lack of Content-Some Unfair Gameplay-Devs may have abandoned the gameOverall I would recommend the game. It is a ton of fun to play, but it has a lack of content. If you buy it buy it when it is on sale. Considering the amount of content that is in it right now it not worth the eight dollar price tag. Hopefully the devs will continue developing the game, and it does not get stuck in early access hell.  "
