												I remember at first picking this up on a whim, doing a couple guns, then putting it down for a long while and not really seeing the point. A few months later I decided to pick it up again and put some actual effort into bringing down my times and working on expanding my view of the map, and that was when I got hooked. The first time I managed to take first place on the daily leaderboards was a great feeling, and soon I started to get a feel for the general patterns of the mechanisms, like how similar the CZ-75 and Jericho pistols were internally, which helped decrease my times on both guns as I learned them. I learned that the Colt Walker is easy to take apart quickly, and whoever made the MG 34 can go to hell. Each gun had their own similarities and differences that were fun to figure out and optimize for the best times. Eventually I completed the whole map that could be done without paying (and I even got a couple of the premium guns from credits earned being the champion on different guns).Anyway, now that I've rambled for a bit, the point I'm making is that this is a fairly satisfying F2P experience. You don't really need to put in any money to enjoy yourself, and frankly the real money options seem to not have the greatest value. Just expect to log in once every hour or so and learn every gun on the map so you can do the quizzes. You should be able to manage at least 3,000 experience every time once you learn them, and depending on how actively you want to log in and do the quizzes, can rack up enough virtual currency to unlock a gun or two every day. It'll probably take you a month or two to unlock everything, and keep in mind you can buy things that are locked behind premium guns through the catalog at an increased price. If you're good enough to earn credits to buy some of those guns, strategically pick the SVD first to maximize the amount of stuff hidden being uncovered if you want to lower the cost.In summary, for the price of free this game is worth your attention if you like challenging the leaderboards and don't mind investing some time in the quiz system to get the currency to buy guns. It probably helps if you like guns too.Update:I feel it's worth noting that virtually every single gun added to the game since I originally wrote this review has required premium currency to purchase. Whereas before you could own nearly every single gun in the game without paying a cent, and good play could earn you a couple more of the paid guns for free, now such a large portion of the guns require premium currency that it's forced me to revise my assessment somewhat.There's still a hundred or so free guns that I expect will remain free, but once you've burned through those, don't expect to be able to continue to enjoy the game as a free player. Of course, you can always go back to guns you do own to refine your times, but there will eventually come a point at which you've done about as much repetition on the same guns as you care to. My suggestion would be to play through as much as you can as a free player (which is still a fair amount of content), then decide if you want to put money into the game. If you do, wait for the lifetime access DLC to go on sale. It'll be more economical in the long run than trying to buy each gun as they come out. You could spend $10 to get the 100 credit pack and not be able to buy all the premium guns available now. So if you can find the lifetime access on sale for 50% off or more (currently retails for $50), that's probably a good deal if you intend to put serious time into the game.			"

												Ok , as  an  armorer  and having  dealt with firearms since childhood , this game  is good  and it's a nice way to see  cutaways of  guns in function without spending a boatload of money  !, bit that's just it  the keyword of that is  ""game""This is not at all a bad thing , but  know  that  in disassembly it can  be picky  about order of parts disassembled/ reassembled and will have you  taking apart pieces of firearms which   are NOT considered ""user servicable""  Since when  does the armory strip of an M1911A1 require me to  remove the safety detent plunger assembly and tube?! a gunsmith only removes those if they  can not be salvaged /need replacement..it takes a  punch hamer and file!  , and  why  the hell is  it asking me to remove the bullet  guide/ramp AND the barrel from an  AK-47?!.. YOU  NEED A HAMMER AND A  10 TON PRESS BARE MINIMUM FOR THAT JOB! they are NOT even  considered  general purpouse armorer removable parts... gunsmith/OEM  factory instalation job, ONLY !And it can be  ""picky"" about what it considers to be  ""unitized parts"" ...OOHHH so the  trigger , trigger spring and trigger linkage bar of a IWI MK VII .44 Magnum Desert Eagle is  a  unitized part which needs no disassembly, even though  it  was sold under 3 seperate SKU numbers   while   the safety assembly  of a  ( MISMARKED AS A CENTURION, MIND YOU!) Beretta 92FS  must be COMPLETELY  disassembled even though  it is only sold under ONE count em ONE SKU# and comes in  2 parts  when you recieve it from Beretta.. lovely...There are my only real complaints, the graphics used to represent each  gun are good though not great ( remember this was originally a touchscrren  mobile app!) but  get the job  done well enough to familliarize anyone with the overall function of all the parts of the models featured and how they interact with each other.The Lifetime membership may or may not seem  ""steep"" ( this depends on your wallet and if they are hosting a sale) but  it speeds you up allowing you to  focus on the guns you want first as opposed to  playing this only as a  mechanical ""puzzle game"".Do I recommend this  game ..well if you  have ANY interest in firearms cross sections and how each individual part of the whole works the answer would be a resounding YES!BUT if you  have experience and want to  use this as a tool to familiarize yourself with the proper technique of stripping a firearm down I say  HOLD UP!, this is good , but  video tutorials  are better...Learning from an armorer or gunsmith is the best option but  it will take the most time and money  of all the options.still pick this up but know that  the practical  real life solutions are NOT always what this  virtual model kit / game  will have you  belive!It is no source of misinformation ,  but it's no sage  wisened 'smith  teaching you  the tricks of the trade!

												Before I found World of Guns: Gun Disassembly, family and friends would laugh at my ambitions of single handedly taking down corrupt world governments and large terrorist organisations. To an extent, they were correct.Thanks to World of Guns: Gun Disassembly, I have since single handedly taken down 4 governmenets, 16 terrorist groups, 2 supervillain super teams and and alien race threatening to enslave humanity. Non of this would have been possible if it wasn't for Wold of Guns: Gun Disassembly teaching me how to disassemble and reassemble any gun within 2.6 seconds.It also gives you the vital information to disassemble and reassemble a Deloreon of the film Back to the Future, enabling me access to time travel in my journy to save the earth from the evils that threaten it. This clearly shows that World of Guns: Gun Disassembly went beyond just giving me the firepower for my new career choice, but also a time traveling super car.The only down side to the game is that it is free to play, thus allowing many of my enemies to also learn skills that only we of the free world should have access to. Whilst they could also disassemble and reassemble guns and/or a Deloeon, I feel I got greater high scores and was able to best my foes, proven by the fact that you are sat here now reading this review rather than enslaved on a forign alien planet mining precious gems and ores for the formidible Gorlakians that no longer pose a threat. All this is thanks to the skills that I learnt from the game nominated for 486 game of the year awards and an emmy, World of Guns: Gun Disassembly.Thank you World of Guns: Gun Disassembly. I would not have been able to keep this planet safe without you.10/10Would reassemble again.			"

												The first half hour is definitely time well spent. Even if you never plan on owning a gun, the mechanisms involved are kinda fascinating. Your milage may vary based on your enthusiasm after the first gun and a half, but it's free. An engaging and informative half hour is probably more than you get out of most games you pay money for.

												This is the story on how this game saved me over $2,100 in repairs IRL. I’ve been a firearm owner ever since I was a kid. My father bought me my first .22 rifle when I was twelve. After I became an adult and joined the US ARMY (11B) I got more serious about my collection. It was not until I started my own company and could start buying seriously expensive firearms that I really took off. I ran into a dilemma a few months back. I had my Fully Automatic Browning M2 .50 and I could not get the charging handle to move all the way to the rear. I tried my best to ask around but nothing worked. I was about to throw in the towel and take it to my local gun smith when I remembered that World of guns existed. After going through the in-game play, I found out that it was a simple two-inch piece of metal that I had not put back in the proper place. After talking to the local gun smith. He told me that the repairs would have cost me almost $2,100 because of how much time it would have taken him along with the peace being ordered. World of Guns is so detailed and in-depth. The developers really went to full lengths to make it as realistic as possible. They must have the actual firearms in the studio to get the attention to detail that they have. I salute the developers for going the extra mile and giving us firearms fans something to be really excited about. "

												Its a Facebook game thats somehow ended up on Steam. Because of its origin, and the fact that its free, unlocking stuff involves lot of grinding for experience points, which means assembling and disassembling same weapons over and over again. To unlock guns you only need XP, but for shooting range you need XP and you also got to send friend invites! Alternatively you can skip these requirements with credits, which can be earned with most difficult achievements, but even that can be skipped with, you guessed it, microtransactions! Buy credits or unlock stuff with real money.But the question is, is it worth playing? The idea is really cool and if guns are your thing then yeah, go for it. The detail is excellent and it should satisfy the curiosity for those who want to know more on how guns work. However, lot of people will probably get turned off by the excessive amount of grinding and pay-2-unlock mechanics before they get to the guns they might actually be interested in. The game goes really anti-grind already after you've unlocked MP5, as the required experience to unlock the next guns keeps increasing and you earn less the amount of XP when you repeat old one's. I'd love to fool around with something like that Gatling Gun seen in the pictures, but I probably don't have time or patience to tear down the same bloody AK again, again and again, especially when I have better games to play which are actual full experiences.

												Don't get me wrong, the idea is great. A neat way to learn about guns and gun saftey and all that.But what ruins it for me is that you basically need to invite your friends to play otherwise you can't unlock the cool stuff.Of course you don't NEED to harrass your friends.... you can also buy credits and unlock things that way.Great concept, poor execution.

												This game has much potential, but the loads of DLC's and the strict way the guns must be disassembled (Completly different from the real world- Why do I have to remove the handguards on the M16 to remove the upper assembly from the lower?) make this game much less fun than it could be.  I've spent enough time in this game to learn one thing:  The creators of this game never even handled a firearm, let alone disassembled one.   Also some of the guns, like the AMT backup, are glitched.			"

												World of Guns Gun Disassembly is not a game in its actual meaning. It’s more like an ABC of guns that everyone would like to have at home. Sure, it would be more interesting to have all those guns at home stored in a special place but if you have a very special need to take a closer look at the weapons of all kinds but at the same time want to be safe or simply can’t afford the arsenal – World of Guns Gun Disassembly is your savior.World of Guns Gun Disassembly is a decent and more than successful attempt to create affordable and deep encyclopedia of guns. But not just a virtual book with boring descriptions and history. Well, not that we do not like history, but all that information is available on the web already. We also have tons of videos and tutorials on how to use guns, assemble and dissemble them and how to fire the proper way. But, have you ever seen an application that would allow you to get inside the gun, see how it actually works and assemble or dissemble the favorite rifle with your own hands?To your surprise – World of Guns Gun Disassembly is exactly this kind of software.Once you got your gun chosen, start playing with it. At first it looks like a simple 3D room where you can take a look at the gun from all sides. However, in just a few seconds it turns into something unpredictably catchy.Everything you do is accompanied with simple but nice animation. In World of Guns Gun Disassembly your task is to dissemble or assembly a gun in a certain order. Don’t be afraid – it follows the rules of logic, so even if you have no idea what to do next – start dealing with the most complicated part of the mechanism. In the end you will either appear with lots of gun elements floating in the air or a fully loaded pistol/rifle/shotgun after making it one solid construction from all that stuff.It’s a great thing that you can train your memory by completing challenges both ways. Not only it gives you a better understand of guns but also allows to be more aware of all the small things. I would say it’s a perfect virtual helper for young soldiers and those who want to improve their knowledge in guns.Despite incredible attention to the details, World of Guns Gun Disassembly also has an X-ray mode where you can see what’s inside the gun and how the mechanisms work without tearing it apart.On the top of all the greatness, you can also equip your guns with various accessories and see how they work.  Flashlight, optics and lasers – they all are here and look different on every gun.World of Guns Gun Disassembly includes all the possible weapons starting from ages ago and going up to the modern and popular models. World of Guns is a wonderful experience.			"

												This game has a lot going for it, but also a lot of major issues.Pros: Very detailed and accurate gun models. Gameplay is surprisingly engaging. I found myself trying to optimize ways to strip and reassemble the guns to get the fastest time. It's pretty cool they managed to make gun maintenance fun in a video game.Cons: A few...1. Poor performance. Even on a 4670k and R9 295x2 the game will still occasionally crawl to a halt and stutter. This is probably the fault of the Unity engine.2. Ridiculously long tutorial that still somehow manages to not explain things very well.3. Incosistent on what parts are grouped into assemblies and which are counted individually. Sometimes you have to remove individual pins/screws, other times you don't.Now the big problems:4. Free2Play mechanics. The game is set up so that completing every game mode and getting most/all of the achievements for a gun will give you just barely enough XP to unlock the next gun. You essentially have to grind each gun until you can do it fast enough to get enough XP to progress. They then offer expensive ""boosters"" and DLC to help you progress faster. No thanks.5. (Final straw) The shooting range mode is apparently totally broken. I unlocked the 1911 shooting range and after a couple tries managed to complete all of the challenges. However the game did not recognize this at all, and when I returned to the map my >4000 XP had disappeared and I was at 0 XP. This is a ridiculous game-breaking bug and is unacceptable in a final release.This game is good in concept, but terrible in execution.			"

This is an excellent program for learning the basic operation of various weapons, how they work, and how to disassemble and reassemble them.  The program is very interactive and allows you to work and learn at your own pace.  It is NOT a competitive game, it is a program for learning about weapons and doing it in a safe way.  I have been hunting since I was 8 years old(I am 59 now) and have always been interested in various weapons, but would never be able to afford them or get access to them.  This is the next best thing.  I highly recommend this program. "

												Pros:- You can disassemble guns and reassemble them, which lets you learn about all the guns you use on your bloody shooters!- You can paint gunsCons:- DLCs, DLCs, DLCS!!!!! You need to buy this DLC to get guns, You need to buy this DLC to actually use the gun in a shooting range, You need to buy this DLC to disassemble cars and skeletons, You need to buy that DLC to have more paintjob options. FFS.- Oh, hey, The next gun you can disassemble is your favorite one, but you need to unlock it by getting XP, which is earnt by disassembling the same guns you already did in many hard modes, and in some of them, if you make a mistake, you start again from the beggining! Get ready for hours of disassembling a gun over and over and over and over and over again just to disassemble the next gun.- Lack of options in the Gun Customization (Paintjob) ModeRating: 3.5/10DLC and Rage Simulator 2015			"

												What they show you: Completely detailed diagrams of gun disassembly and operation. Great fun and very informative.What they don't show you: You unlock more guns through ""experience"", which you earn painfully slow by doing all the strip and bad operational challenges for every gun before it. The only way to unlock these guns without hours of crap is by buying ""experience"" points in absurd bundles. There are also vehicle disassembly portions which I couldn't review because they're their own seperate DLC. If you want everything this game has to offer, you're probably spending somewhere around $50-$60.I'd much rather pay $15-$20 outright for this than weave around their sneaky DLC scheme. Don't support this publisher until they change their tactics.			"

												Even though I have approximately zero interest in firearms, taking things apart has to be one of the most satisfying and addictive activities our little lizard brains can partake in. Granted, now I know more about the inner workings of an AK-47 than those of my own kettle. Educational - check. Entertaining - check. Strangely meditative and therepeutic despite the fact that you are putting together intricate (and sometimes not so intricate) instruments of death - check, check, check.对枪支真的是一点兴趣也没有，但拆东西拆起来真的是无比之爽，看着一地的细碎零件再把它咔嚓咔嚓的拼装起来是多么快乐的一件事啊! 反正是免费的，强推强推			"

												World of Guns is a game about disassembling guns, as simple as that. Practically, this product has one of the clearest headers in the whole market.Basically, there are many (priced) products theming disassembling things. Most famous on Steam are the Surgeon Simulator 2013 and the Car Mechanic Simulator 2014/15. Both of those hardly giving you any real knowledge, just some queery ""fun moments"" mostly.World of Guns is very different. Generally, it's not much of a game. It's not about fun. Of course, if only you're not the one seeing fun when you don't lose any screws while disassembling something. Most likely, it feels as a big manual on ""how to operate with guns"". And that is a good thing. You can find many books, pictures, videos on ""how to keep the gun"", but you don't get it unless you'll try it by yourself, even if in 3d model (yeah, like those in ikea shops).It has its flaws, sure. If you want a manual to specific weapon from list, you have to pay for it - or to get it by achieving ""points"". You can collect those points for practicing with already unlocked stuff and answering some quiz to unlock next weapon closer to one you want... Over and over, until you'll get them all. And yeah, if it sounds grindy to you, that's because it is.Also, while you not only be playing with screws there - there will be some ranges to shoot, some paints to make your dream gun if you like them coloured... that's not all you can hope for from a weapons ""Hustler"" game. For example, if you were wandering not only how those irons disassemble and blazing, but how to oil them... alas, there are no such useful info.So! People doesn't like to see a price in F2P game for quick access to something that could be opened later for free. People don't like ""grinding"". And even if they are alright with F2P gaming basics, the game itself is not like a wet dream for a gun ate-ups, as there are not so much content, as one can imagine... and new additions comes not so fast.Still, it is quite a good project. Even if it's just 3d models and not real iron, it's much, Much better than nothing. I can only hope it could be improved to become something greater. Like the ""Jane's"" magazines in the XX century.There will be no usual mark 'cause it's not a game you'll play to enjoy. It's education... of some kind.			"

												World of Guns: Gun Disassembly is a good game in my book.But first of all: What is World of Guns: Gun Disassembly?World of Guns is a simulation. Not the ""Surgeon Simulator"" kind of simulation but a rather realistic one. The developers of the game took their time to good use finding information and blueprints on different weapons. They then created and animated the parts. What you do in the game is disassemble and then reassemble them in varying detail. You start of with two weapons after the tutorial. The AK-47 and the Colt M1911. You can partially assemble them (Field Strip), fully disassemble them, assemble them, watch them shoot in great detail (X-ray Cam, Cutout, Slow Motion) and finally ""Play"" with them. There are 2 game modes. The simple one, where you disassemble and reassemble the gun as fast as you can, which can be done competetively against others via leaderboards and the ""advanced"" game mode where you do the same only that when you try to assemble/disassemble parts that can not logically be moved it restarts completely, forcing you to remember how to correctly assemble each of the guns. It should be noted that you only click on parts to interact with them. You will not use any tools or choose where to put the parts yourself, that is something that the game does for you.The game features an unlock System. You can unlock new weapons with XP. XP are gained by earning achievements for each weapon (Finishing each game mode / disassemble and reassemble in a certain time etc.) or simply by ""playing."" It is not all that easy to unlock all achievements and it will make you grind to unlock most weapons, which is totally reasonable since that is what the game is there for. It teaches you realistically to actually disassemble and reassemble those guns. Learning their parts and the process of assembling them by heart.This naturally should tell you that this isn't a game for anyone but gun enthusiasts. If you have no interest in guns or disassembling them, not once but over and over again repeatedly then this is not a game for you.Now that you know what the game is about, is it any good?It's a good game in my book. As a long time german shooting club member (implying I already did disassemble some of the handguns also in the game) I can, at least for some of those guns, tell you that they are very detailed and correctly represented.My only concern is that the developers seemingly weren't all that consistent when creating some of the guns. Sometimes removing a single bolt is an action you have to perform and sometimes the bolts and the part that they hold in place are handled in the same action.Lastly, the game is free to play. You are free to try it and if you actually do get sick of unlocking you can also buy the guns.So, if you think that you are within the target audience of this game, feel free to try it. I enjoy it a lot.			"

												Putting this up as a ""Free To Play"" game is an outright lie. Unless you're playing it incredibly hardcore and dropping huge amounts of hours into it, you'll get stuck behind paywalls after 3 guns. The game is NOT that interesting to spend that much time on it, and it's clearly not worth the 49.99 ""Guns Full Access"" price which doesn't even get you all that much if you read the fine print (there are 12 other DLCs for this other than that).Don't waste your time/money on this piece of garbage.

												Most new weapons now cost Credits. Credits are currency which can be obtained through speedrunning and placing in the top 3 dissasembly times for that day OR are bought with money. I reinstalled the game recently to spend my 108K Experience gained through buying the free weapons and completing the challenges, only to find that none of that experience could be used to unlock any weapon available, all costing from 1 credit to a rather large 20 credits. This game was and in some ways still is a very unique puzzle and memory game, having to remember order of dissasembly and reassembly as well as the individual screws and panels that need to be taken off. The fact that such a large percentage of the game is locked behind a paywall removes my incentive to keep playing. The fact I've stopped playing doesn't even matter to them, if we aren't spending money then we are of no value to them as a community. They've introduced a voting system from what I've seen, to vote for the next weapon model they introduce; this does not reflect the wants and needs of the community, more like the developer's, as they KNOW people will pay for that weapon.I've achieved the top three in my time and gotten credits before, enough to unlock one of the cars, a Flak Cannon and many other assault weapons, but some people might not be able to achieve something like that, therefore their time on this game will be short.Overall, whilst the game is free, you won't get much enjoyment out of it unless you actually grind or pay up.

												This game has a great concept but its game play is bad. Learning about how guns work is interesting and taking apart and reassembling the guns is fun but the way the game makes you go about it is infuriating. I really enjoy seeing how each gun comes apart and how they go back together. Its great seeing how each part in the weapon works together to fire the bullet and chamber the next round. The x ray and slow motion options are great for capturing exactly how it all interacts. This game does present this all in a very nice way. I feel like i have learned alot about the weapons that i have unlocked however, some of those weapons are of no real interest to me.You must unlock each weapon with experiance you earn from playing the game but you dont earn enough to ensure you will unlock the next weapon from hitting the most common achiements. This mean you need to repeat each test several times and combine with the frustrating mechanics you'll end up hating the game quickly. Additional the weapons are only unlocked following a tree that might see weapons you want to learn about hidden behind dozens of guns you are not interested in. The experiance needed to advance is earned from getting achievments such as finishing under a set time or not clicking the wrong part. This method would be fine except that you have to wait out each animation before you can start the next part and by default the camera swings around wildly when each part is moved. This all makes it almost impossible to reach the better times needed to get some of the achievements. Additionally, clicking on a part before the animation has finished will count as clicking the wrong part and shut you out of another achievement further adding to the frustration. Finally, several achievements are require you to have a faster time then other people in the last 24 hours. These seem almost impossible to achieve as there are people who have unreasonably fast times blocking everyone from getting these achievements.Many of these problems would be resolved by buying the game but I feel it is simply not worth the money for a collection of interactive user manuals.

												It's a neat concept, and a potential great learning tool (If some of the inconsistencies were polished out) for what it does... That said I find it hard to reccommend due to a few issues, most glaring of which being the total loss of all my EXP, unlocks and achivments as of this morning.That aside, it does have a lot of neat guns that most of us will never be able to touch, let alone take apart.  But I would have liked to have seen even more of the oddities.  Like the Liberator 3D printed handgun; designed in 2013.  Or the Nock gun; an obscure 7-barreled flintlock designed in 1779.  It just needs more.  Especially for the $50 unlock-everything-forever cost, and the fact that you can, apperently, lose everything at a moments notice... For no apperent reason.For now, I simply can't reccomend it.  Losing my stuff was a game breaker.			"

Product received for free
This Game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sham and Here's Why:There are 2 sides to the game:Side 1) A fun gun disassembly game that helps you learn the various parts, function, and care of dozens of firearms. This is what the game appears to be at first glance, and for the first hour or two of play].Side 2) A ludicrously difficult game that demands you to take apart entire 100+ piece guns in a certain order without a single error in under minutes if you want to disassemble anything other than the same 6 guns over and over.If you don't take side 2 and either a) become the quickest virtual gun disassembler in the world (you literally must in order to unlock all the guns, or b)spend $$$ to unlock new models. If you don't do one of these YOU ARE D-E-A-D ♥♥♥♥ED (see ""stuck with the same 6 guns forever"" above). It's all a tease and a cash grab...sadly. This game had huge potential. "

												Every lover of the 2nd Amendment Beware! This game will absorb all of your freetime!Just kidding! Don't worry guys, although I'm on here nearly everyday, it not too addictive. It is however a very fun and educational program about firearms, and its FREE! However, I will admit, for extreme gun gurus, this game may be dissapointing for its somewhat watered down approach to firearms dissassembly. When I got this, I was thinking ""AWESOME"", finally a game that will help me figure out how to dissassemble my AR without getting shot in face the with the Action Spring! However, it turns out there is no in-depth explaination of the dissassembly process for any weapon. Actually, the game is more about raw step-by-step memorization than anything . . . . Although you will be able to see every single firearms 100% dissassembled, and learn whice pieces need to be screwed/unscrewed first, there is no explaination about the methods of dissassembly, or the purpose of each individual part, or even groups.In other words, the game runs as simply as this. In all of the game modes (except operation and shooting range), you have a 3D model of a weapon, you wait for the computer to 'clear' the weapon by racking the action and expelling all ammunition, and then it is your job to click the pieces that are to be dissassembeled 1st, 2nd 3rd, as the computer automatically dissassembles the parts/groups, and all the way until you have a complete 3D exploded view of the weapon, and then click the pieces in backwards order. Although there does seem to be some inconsitencies with the ordered parts in this game (on the AK-47, you must click the 'butt screws' before dismantling the wooden stock, however on the MP-5, the lower receiver just falls off magically?), this goes does serve as a great INTRODUCTION to each weapon. The operation mode allows player to watch the weapon fire with X-Ray vision, to watch the parts interact, however, there is no further explanation.Another word. The game is FREE, therefore there are a couple draw backs. You do not have access to all the weapons at the start of the game! You have one starter gun, the AK-47, then you must master the dissassembly of this weapon to get 'XP"" before unlocking more weapons! And oh, there is no list of weapons to choose from. Although weapon progressoin is not linear (there are often a couple branches to choose from), you will have to slog through some boring weapons before getting to your all-time-favorites. I will however REDEEM the developers by saying, this does force a player to actually master a weapon, and often times GO BACK to a previous weapon to re-learn and hopefully get more XP, but it can be really tedious . . . . OR you can purchase the game for $40 and have every weapon unlocked!However, start with the free version to make sure you can handle it ;)░░░░░▄▄▄░░▄██▄░░░░░░░░▐▀█▀▌░░░░▀█▄░░░░░░░░▐█▄█▌░░░░░░▀█▄░░░░░░░░▀▄▀░░░▄▄▄▄▄▀▀░░░░░░▄▄▄██▀▀▀▀░░░░░░░░░░█▀▄▄▄█░▀▀░░░░░▌░▄▄▄▐▌▀▀▀░░ THIS IS BOB▄░▐░░░▄▄░█░▀▀ ░░▀█▌░░░▄░▀█▀░▀ ░░ COPY AND PASTE HIM,░░░░░░░▄▄▐▌▄▄░░░ SO, HE CAN TAKE░░░░░░░▀███▀█░▄░░ OVER STEAM!░░░░░░▐▌▀▄▀▄▀▐▄░░ ░░░░░░▐▀░░░░░░▐▌░░ ░░░░░░█░░░░░░░░█░░░░░░░░▐▌░░░░░░░░░█░░░			"

How much you enjoy this game is completely dependant on how much of a gun enthusiast you are.Beyond that, I noticed I was getting disconnected from the server a lot, which forces you to quit the game. Also, in order to unlock firing range modes, you need to have friends that also play this game. How very facebook of you, World of Guns.I wish I didn't have to give a yes or no recommendation.

												I bought the starter pack (3.99 sale) within the first hour of playing this game.  After several more hours of tinkering, I decided that I'm sure I will invest more money in this game.  Based on the fact it's been out 2 years successfully, has tons of iconic guns I love and some I have, and many more interesting guns in development, I belive this is pretty real.   It's alot like an interactive version of the 'Forgotten Weapons' YouTube channel.   At this point (10 hrs), I've not used Exp. to unlock any new weapons.  I've got 31,000 Exp. points to show for my time so far, which can only buy a few guns or one of the expensive ones.  I haven't minded a moment of the ""grind"" so far, it's kind of like a really fun version of going to school.  I am, however, probably going to buy the $50 lifetime guns access in the near future. As with the few great F2P games I've played, I've determined that it's more effecient use of my time to earn real money than to spend the enormous amount of time it takes to unlock all the content for free.  It's not a cheap game in that respect, but doing the math shows it's a no-brainer with a game with such a high entertainment value.For some perspective on my opinion, I am:-A proessional high-level auto mechanic-I've spent about $150 on War Thunder-I'm a lawful gun owner-I've done some amatuer gunsmithing that has proven to be safe and reliable			"

												World of Guns is an interesting game in which you get to disassemble, and reassemble guns. At first, I looked at it and thought ""There is no way I'll like this."", but then I started playing it. I thought, 'Why would I want to do that?' almost every step of the way, after all, it's just taking bits out of a model and then putting it back together. Well, it turns out that if you have a few minutes to spare while a friend is off doing something, or half an hour before going to work with only boredom to keep you company, the prospect of a gun model to pull apart and put back together is pretty pleasing.Most things appear at first to be accessible with no payment needed, and a few that you can get by being the daily top score on a gun. It's free, so that's great value already, and you get hourly quizzes for bonus exp(Used to unlock more guns). So then, how does it play?You can field strip a gun, taking apart only bits of it, and then putting it back togetherYou can disassemble and reassemble a gun, which is doing the obviousThere is a simulation of how the guns work, with slow down, x-ray vision, and multiple magazines and assesories you can useAfter you completed those, you will unlock the 'game', 'supergame', and 'hardore game' modes.Game is a time attack, you have to disassemble and then reassemble your model as fast as possible, with bonusses for not clicking too fast and not clicking any part that you aren't going to activate. (Hint: Spacebar activates whatever you have selected, this will help your time a lot. You can also turn off the auto-zoom to selected parts in the options)Supergame is also a timed mode, but now you get to time your activation a second time on some parts. If on time, the part moves out faster. If not on time, it's slower. You get a bonus for not clicking too much.Hardcore game automatically activates any part you click on, and you can activate multiple at once. This is where things get fast, with large amounts of bits, pins, screws, and all sorts of springs flying all over, you'll get a bonus if you don't click anything you can't activateAnd in all this, you will become very familiar with what I have called the ""Ikea effect"". Namely, there will be one or two little screws or pins somewhere that you can't find, possibly having vanished into the ether when you weren't looking. Luckily it isn't modeled on reassembly, so you won't have to worry about a spring rolling under somewhere and disappearing into an alternate plane of existenceGun enthusiasts, you probably already have this. But if not, I recommend it to you. Others, if you enjoy score-based or slightly competitive - With the whole playerbase or just between you and friends, this may be a good choiceBut aside from that, if you just want to grab something simple to spend some time on between things you're doing, this is a great choice. The small size means its a fast download and the short gamemodes means you can spend as long as you want on this. But I'll warn you, perfection on a model may take a lot of time(I would also recommend a youtube search for LethalFeline, he has videos up of him playing if you still aren't sure)			"

												World of Guns: Gun Disassembly. A simulation based around the assembly, disassembly, maintenance and operation of various types of firearms which allows the user to better understand the mechanics of firearms and teaches the user the proper method of stripping, disassembling and reassembling their firearm, as well as giving history and insight into the design and use of the gun. As a concept, it is a fantastic idea as it allows the casual gun interest to better understand, and therefor respect, the tool that they admire as well as allow the seasoned gun enthusiast or collector a means of virtually disassembling a firearm without risking damaging its real-life counterpart.As a gun enthusiast and owner myself, I saw World of Guns: Gun Disassembly as the latter, a helpful tool. However, the sheer tedium of grinding one gun constantly to get to the next, only to grind that gun again, coupled with both the steep learning curve and steep price tag ($49.99 for ""Lifetime Access"", which grants access to all guns, structures, vehicles and skeletons) has put me off of this notion. While the potental for greatness is there, the severely misguided execution of World of Guns has left it floundering with the rest in a sea of shovelware and lost ideas.Sadly, I must leave this simulation with a negative vote. I hope that, in the future, the developers of World of Guns will try to salvage this concept, as I firmly believe that it could be both a valuable tool for teaching the history of the gun as well as an invaluable tool in the workshop. But, until that day comes, this gets my thumbs down.3/10. It could be something wonderful, but as of now it is simply shovelware			"

												Really cool concept, but in order to play with more guns, you need to spend days reassembling the same gun, or throw away some money.On top of that, the ordering of the assembly/disassembly is wonky. For example, you need to take the stock off the gun before you can take the d-ring for the sling off the stock. Those, in real life, could be done in any order.My current speculation is that the bulk of the positive reviews come from people that either a) are frivolous with their money or b) take pleasure in marathon-length grinds.

												So, most negative reviews comes from the pay2win feature.Sure it is, but you can't have such a deatailed gun disassembly game anywhere else.(at least I don't know)And if you've got a specific gun that you want to know how it works, the P2Y won't bother you.(All you'll need is 1~2 weeks of constant log in)It's just great because we've got so many games that have guns in it, yet many people haven't touched a real gun.(except in the US)When we want to know how it works, we just don't have a clue.Yes, we've got youtube and many other sites, but none of them are interactive.When you want to know that specific part where they don't explain to you, you've got no idea.So there is this game.For people who want to know how guns work, but don't want (or just can't) buy a gun, you can learn in this game.There's disassembly, motion check, X-ray mode, anything you'll need to learn how it works.More than that, there's not only modern guns, but also historical ones.It's free to start, so give it a try!

												I like this one. Many people say this game requires actual money to progress, but I disagree. I've unlocked 37 guns, I didn't pay nothing and I can (and will) unlock and study  about ~40 more quite easily. If you log on into game EVERY day you can have 18600 points per week (100-500-1000-2000-3000-5000-7000, or something), and even this will be enough to open many interesting guns. Then you'll get more points from disassembling/assembling new guns  (~4k per each). And then you can invite 5 friends (and why not - it's good and free) - аnd you'll get 20 credits from that (now you can unlock some GOOD guns). Interestingly, it's much easier to get some achievements  (best of the day, top 3) on guns you have to ""purchase"" for credits, because there's significantly less people there: less competition. Note, that ""best of the day"" achievement will give you not just points, but also credits! ) This sim allows you to study: you can compare engineering decisions of different constructors/manufacturers agains each other. Or you can use this app as a simple puzzle you have to solve in specified order - it's all up to you.			"

												The basic idea of the game is that you disassemble the guns and assemble them step by step. When you have enough XP, you can unlock the next gun. PROS:-Very skill based. You need to memorise what parts to move. -Leaderboards. Very competitive. You will think that you have the best times. Although some people clearly cheat, Noble Empire, get your ♥♥♥♥ together.-Very engaging mechanics. It's very satisfying to see all those animations.-Really easy to understand how to play. -If you are the plenty of time kinda player AND a gun enthusiast, this is the game for you.-As you get better at the game, you unlock achievements faster and faster, thus getting more XP and more guns.CONS:-Slow start in terms of XP. The game requires you to be good quite early.-Poor variety of music.-Inconsistent order of disassembly/assembly. You would think you can take that part out. Unfortunately, the game requires you to follow a specific order.-Inconsistent duration of the animations. Ruined many ""speedruns"".-Very small parts are hard to spot or don't come with the bigger parts.-Hidden guns are much more expensive unless they show up in the unlock tree.-Not recommended for casual players who just want to play and relax and not have to bother with the XP. But that's the life of free to play.When I started playing this game, I only had one weapon available which is the AK-47. Honestly I think they should introduce simpler weapons first, and maybe sort the weapons by type: handgun, assault rifle, smg... Oh well. I was immediately compelled by the mechanics of the game, the animations, the sounds, and the neat organisation of the parts in the 3D environment. I wanted to play more, I wanted to get better at the game. It's very easy to learn how to play.Then it told me that it has some modes of playing, Field Strip, Disassembling, Operation Assembling, Game, Super Game and Hardcore. Each mode is more difficult than the previous except for paint and operation. The hardcore mode requires you to know exactly what to do.Operation mode is quite fun. You can attach different stuff like suppressors, laser sight, bayonettas, etc. You can slow down the time and see how the weapon works when fired. It doesn't require you to disassemble the gun or anything.After I got good at the gun, I got enough XP points and unlocked my second gun. The pacing of the game in terms of unlocking is really well done, because you can get a weapon, and you can complete a lot of achievements for each weapon. I still haven't finished some weapons and I already have 2 guns in reserve to play. You could get a lot of XP really quickly if you dedicate your time to it. If you don't well, well then I don't recommend the game for people like you. You can also login to the game daily and amass more XP. I actually managed to get the complete set for 2 weapons. Very satisfying, would do it again.Yes, you can't choose any weapon you want to disassemble, without paying time or money. Yes, if the gun isn't showing up in the main screen, it's a lot more expensive on the store. But, all in all, still would recommend the game. Just because it's free to play.			"

 Phenomenal Game/Program, Not Free to Play For one, it's just great in terms of gun assembly/disassembly. You can take apart a weapon to the very core, every little spring, pin, and bolt can be removed and replaced. You can also simulate operations, i.e., firing, reloading, unloading, etc. Moreover, you can do it in slow-motion, or simply pause and scroll through the footage and frames manually to get an in-depth view. There's also different view types such as X-RAY, which shows the weapon's insides while assembled, and there's plastic mode, which shows the weapon in a sort of toy-like fashion using color coding, making it easier to distinguish major parts. You can also toggle having part names displayed.The texture quality is more than decent; it's not like a realism mod, but you can see every little groove and angle that would be present in the real weapon very clearly. For example, I know nothing about guns, just like them in general, got this, then figured out thoroughly, simply through slow-motion footage, exactly how an AK-47 fires with every little detail.Beyond having various vehicles to assemble and disassemble on top of guns, you can take apart and reassemble skeletons of various animals, obviously including humans. Whether you prefer biology or engineering, this is a game/program for all academic enthusiasts and hobbyist's alike. About Being Free to Play The   game  is not free to play. The  demo  is. You don't get even a tenth of the full game content without puchasing at least an $8 pack. However, considering you can still take apart a few weapons and run operation demos for free, it's definitely worth the download for anyone who likes taking things apart. It's especially worth the download if you want to educate yourself on guns and their anatomy and functions. I'm already much more fluent in the nature of firearms from the small time I've played. However, you can buy new guns using experience points you earn through various activities in the game, but they often cost  a lot of experience points which aren't easy to earn through actual gameplay; but, what you can do is simply log in to the game on a daily basis, and by doing so the game rewards you experience points. Each day you get more EXP, and on the 7th consecutive log-in, you receive 7,000 EXP (whereas earning EXP from gun activities only ever yields a couple hundred). A nice gun, e.g., the M14, costs about 30,000 EXP, so it is quite possible to get new guns frequently enough to keep you interested in the game.I'm waiting a while to see if any packs will be on sale, like the 4 cars pack is as I'm typing this, and if I can't find anything soon I'll probably purchase the lifetime access. It's overpriced, but not by much, and I'm willing to spend a bit extra for this kind of content.			"

												This game, while having a cool concept and lots of content, is designed as micro transaction paradise. While every gun model can be unlocked via in game experiance the amount of grinding necessary is immense. While learning how to dissassemble and reassemble guns that most people will never get their hands on is neat the constant microtransactions needed make this game a pass in my opinion. If you have a favortie gun design you can probably find it here, just be prepared to spend some real world cash on it.			"

												Used to play the game a lot, and loved it.  Took a break from the game for a few months, when I came back I found out that all my progress was lost.  Every gun I unlocked, all my exp, gone, forcing me t have to start from scratch.  Later found out that the game deletes any inactive accounts unless you pay for it, a MAJOR turn off for me.  Also, some of the guns require ""credits"" to unlock, and to get credits, you need to pay for them.  Now, if you have lots of time and a little money you can spare, then you may enjoy this game more than me.			"

												If not for world of guns, Gun Dissasembly, my evil next door neibour would still be cursing my life. but fortunatly after i bought a rifle, and was completely oblivious to its dissassembly and re-assembly, i found this game, oh how i would be stranded without it, and prssumably a crying mess of human tears and maniacle fesces. fortunatly, i found World Of Guns! Gun Dissasembly!due to the option of dismantling a skeleton aswell ""a bonus feature i had no expectation of"" i was able to dissasemble my neibour and place them into neat little holes in many diffrent graveyards. allowing for no one to ever find enough of it to figure out its origin. i also then used the car options to reassemble my damaged motor and escape the scene of the crime. i am now in mexico and would like to thank World of Guns: Gun Disassembly. THANK YOU! YOU ARE TRULY THE GREATEST FREE GAME EVER! 10/10 would commit again.			"

												This game is actually a gun disassembly simulator, and a living encyclopedia, that is ongoing patched and expanded, and allows you to look into the inner details of a wide variety of firearms. For every model there are different game modes, including field strip, disassembly and reassembly, as well as some challenges and rankings. For everyone who is just a bit more interested in firearms than playing shooters, this game is extremely fun and highly educational.Even though it's free-to-play, the payment model is quite fair, so I really don't get why so many of the bad reviews claim that the game is only playable by paying. Nothing you can buy gives you any advantage over non-paying players. There's no gun model that cannot be unlocked by playing and only a few and very advanced models (a complete tank, a complete airplane), where playing good enough to unlock them might be hard.			"

												Nice game, you can learn how to dissassemble / reassemble a lot of guns. However the guns are a real pain to unlock. In order to get enough experience to buy them you have to finish a bunch of challenges for previously unlocked guns, some of them are very hard, requiring you to dissasemble and reassemble a gun within a very small timeframe or without making a single mistake. Some guns require ""credits"" to buy which you get by completing insane challenges like getting the daily top score for fastest gun dissassembly + reassembly. Or you could get the DLC for 50$ to have all guns unlocked or buy EXP / Credits. For a F2P game its really cool but can get very boring and frustrating since the guns can be complex and a single mistake will make you restart from the beginning.			"

Make the Ravioli dough.- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest - Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!

 About World of Guns: Gun DisassemblyThe game allows you to do almost everything the leftists in your country won't (in my country PT - Partido dos Trabalhadores/Worker's Party). As a gun enthusiast I can say it's the best simulator in the genre that I've seen, it's an almost real experience. If you're looking for a random FPS don't download it, probably you'll find it boring, but if you wanna learn the mechanics or practise the disassembly of some of the most known and reliable weapons it's a must in your library. It has a greater educational value than entertainment value, however I do find pleasure on this kind of knowledge. The GameplayModes are: field strip, disassembly, assembly, operation, game, super game and hardcore game, each has a description at the beginning. There are also achievements for each mode and world leaderboards for all 3 game modes. If you liked in the first 10 minutes, chances are you'll play for 10 hours in the first day, so I don't have to say it's replayable and addictive. You use the mouse to interact with parts and control the camera, you can also use keyboard for some actions but I don't recommend. Sometimes a different part is selected in game mode and in some modes the camera moves against your will. In most modes you have to wait for the end of the animation to perform an action, that's annoying in timed modes. RMB is a good and quick way to zoom a specific part. Controls could be more precise. The Graphics Models are very precise and some even include a bit of visual external wear (mechanic wear would make a nice DLC), however they only look like plastic. Options are very limited, but they're not very relevant on this game, you can identify any part at all times, and if you don't, there's a caption in the lower centre of the screen for each part selected. There's native AA support and fixed frame rate at 60fps. The game is windowed by default. In general the models look like any good directx 9 game, I believe it's playable even with integrated video cards. Menus could look better. The game hasn't crashed yet. The Content	There are several models of handguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, SMG's, etc. You start with an AK-47 and afterwards a Colt 1911, the other guns you will have to buy, but you can unlock many more with your exp. points. You get exp. completing achievements and logging in everyday. As if it wasn't good enough, you can also disassemble skeletons (got the highest score of the day :D) and vehicles, which I find amusing. In addition there are shooting ranges, quiz and information about the weapons. Models are downloaded the first time they're used.All in All World of Guns: Gun Disassembly	 is a very good Simulation Game!9/10 From MeSweep "

												Overall it is a good game, I do recommend it to people who have interest in how guns work, there really isn't a better way to know those things than this game that I know of. But once the number of guns you have interest in begins to deteriorate, it gets really annoying when the guns you have interest in are Freemium content. As well as every update bringing new weapons from here on out is 100% Freemium. Not expecting any changes to the formula, but saying that would be welcome would be an understatement. Cannot begin to understand people who intend to make their daily bread with Free To Play apps, but that's a personal issue.Good game falling unfortunately short in keeping the players visiting regularly (besides the time attack junkies).

												It let me make sweet, virtual love to my raifu as soon as I downloaded it. 10/10 game.Speaking seriously though, this is a pretty fun game if you're a big gun nut and like admiring all the effort that goes into firearms design. With a bit of tweaking and effort, I could see it working as a wonderful educational tool. The game has some issues with it's localization, those can be fixed with time. But it's still embarrassing to see these guys misspell 'Skull' as 'Scull' and what not.World of Guns sits behing the grindfest/paywall model that other free to play games feature. Whether or not that bothers you is a matter of opinion. I would rather have had it as a mildy-priced retail product, personally.Really, pick this thing up at least once and give it a go, even if you don't like guns it may even pique your interest in them.

												DLCsDLCsDLCsDLCsDLCs everything is a DLCWhen I bought this game, I thought it was going to be a free game, where you could assemble the guns whenever you want and every gun has a shooting range. I wanted to just look at the guns and shoot them.But NOOOOOOOOOOOOIt's an actual GAME game. You have to get XP if you want to get to the next gun, and not every gun like the trailer seemed to promise. It litteraly said ""SHOOTING RANGES!"". There's a ratio of, like, 5 to 1 in guns and shooting ranges.I just wanted to shoot the guns, maybe look at X-rays, not have to stress out about how to unlock the new gun, without spending hundreds of dollars from my poor wallet to unlock them.Also, the Super Game and Hardcore game, whatever it's called, is pretty much impossible unless you play for 100 hours or whatever. And if you play this game for 100 hours, I'm afraid your life shriveled up and died a long time ago.In those two game modes, if you make one mistake, ONE mistake, ou have to completely restart.WHO IS GOING TO TRY AND MEMORIZE 50 STEPS OR WHATEVER, JUST TO GET AN ACHIEVEMENT AND SOME XP.Well, people with no life, so definitely not me.I don't want to have to memorize that. It takes a step from being easy, and normally assembling and disassembling guns, to being complete bullcrap, and having to memorize every single move in order.Speaking of moves in order, it makes no sense for the most part. Why should I have to take the cartridge out before I can do absoltely anything at all?The absolute worst part of this game is that it deleted all my progress. I was playing one day, and then I lost all my guns, lost all my xp, i lost everything.00000000000000000000000000/10 It completely sucks			"

												It's hard to be a fan of firearms and stuff in a country where ownership of firearms is illegal, so at first I was glad to have a game like this. Learning stuff about weapons, their assembly/disassembly procedures, operation modes and other was a lot of fun, indeed.I'm not very much into XP grinding for hours for a tiny gain. Also I prefer to pick a weapon by interest. So I even purchased unlock-all-guns-forever pack 'cause Support the developers, they said, it will be fun they said. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, it is. This game is the source of frustration of many kinds.I have this game for more than a year now and here's what I got:- Most of this time this game could not even run: crashes and/or freezes since the very start of the game. They debug it like ♥♥♥♥ on major platforms like Windows and much much more ♥♥♥♥♥ier on others, like SteamOS. They don't seem to debug it at all on other platforms like generic Linux. I have Debian btw which is very close to Ubuntu and SteamOS. C'mon guys, crossplatform era (even in gaming) started years ago, not yesterday. Instead of delivering quality product devs concentrate too much on foisting new content and boosters.Sometimes, some versions of the game could start so I faced the rest:- Not being able to connect to servers, losing progress and ♥♥♥♥.- Getting messages from the game like ""We think you're a cheater, we don't trust your result, we won't accept it. If you disagree please contact support team."" Should I say it was not even day high score?- Acquiring and loosing batches of achievements instantly. For absolutely no reason from my side, of course.- Cheaters. Cheaters everywhere. Some random guy appears and instantly gets weapon alltime highscore with time less than all disassembly/assembly animation takes being run super optimally. And yeah, he will appear tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. And the day after that day. Finally, if you're lucky, you will have a small window to compete with dozens of guys as desperate as you are.As I stated before, my progress is not bound to weapon achievements, so I only got part of the frustration you guys get if you don't buy DLCs. Still too much though. For the guys whining about pay2win: oh yeah, it's here, but implemented like crap, so doesn't work for everyone, haha.Despite all of the above I got about 1% of normal gameplay I counted on, which is nice.Not recommended even if you have some mainstream platform, most issues are not related to it.

												This is an excellent niche game that targets people who enjoy building things, taking them apart, learning about their functionality, and guns.You will not enjoy this game if you do not have a mechanical mind that takes large amounts of enjoyment from deep exploration of different devices. You must be the type of person that enjoys ripping things apart, and putting them back together repeatedly until you can probably do it in your sleep. Even if you enjoy guns themselves, it may not be enough - you have to actually enjoy the mechanical side of the weapons you love so dearly.That being said, if you DO fall into that camp, this game will blow you away. It's hyper-realistic, and nails every little detail with extraordinary accuracy. It is easy to use, and names every single part. If you're like me, you can definitely Google search everything you find in this game, and with a bit of invested time you could become quite knowledgeable about guns in general, and a lot of specific weapons.A lot of people are claiming it is 'Pay To Play', but it really is not. The people calling this out are not what I described above, and are operating under the assumption that you can do a few runs with the gun you're currently working, and you should be able to buy another right away. This is not the case. Remember how I said you have to actually LIKE taking apart the same thing over and over again? That's because you may have to take apart the same guns dozens of times, doing it different ways each time to get achievements and high scores (or even the exact same way, in some cases, as practice for the challenges), before you can afford to buy another weapon. Ideally, you would work the same weapon continually until you have all the achieves (which is like saying 'I know every piece of this weapon by heart') before moving forward.The purpose of this game, I feel, is to actually teach a bit about the weapons you work with. The only way you can learn something is through repetition. There's no shame in getting some compensation out of this, anyways.I personally have bought two new guns (beyond the two starters you begin with) at the time of this writing: the Beretta 92 and HKMP5. That's with about 3 hours of play. Pretty decent, especially if you consider I was taking my time to enjoy the mechanics of the game, and I had to take frequent breaks to pay attention to my 2 year old daughter.So while I don't believe it is 'Pay To Play / Pay To Win', you will have to put a little work into the game to get through more than a couple guns. I hope you can enjoy this game like myself!			"

												One of the rarest F2P games that you don't need to spend a single penny to obtain most of the content. At the beginning it may seem a bit grindy, but when you master already unlocked weapons (get all the achievments) you get more than enough points to unlock more.Yes, timed puzzles and getting top scores are hard, but only if you are not into guns. Once you know how gun works in general and can distinguish what certain parts do and where they go this game becomes much easier than it looks (except for the russian tank, this thing is undoable).PS. About the reviews saying that this game will help you surviving zombie apocalypse / war,Spoiler:  it won't It skips the things like maintaining the gun, and even when you know how to disassemble certain weapon, without some knowledge you still won't know which part is broken and need a replacement.

												World of Guns: Gun Disassembly is a really in depth firearm simulator. Mostly in the way you pull apart the guns piece by piece but there is a firing range and operation mode where you can fire the gun of your choice with different attachments such as silencers, scopes, different magazine sizes and just learn how every single component works with each other. The satisfaction you get when you pull apart and put back together a sophisticated gun with more than 60 parts without choosing the wrong components is probably more rewarding than shooting the gun itself. The only downside to this game is that it's a bit grindey, but I guess that adds to the charm of getting to know each and every part of the weapon you are disassembling, but it's not too much of a problem for me as I don't really mind a bit of a grind sesh once in a while. Plus I get time to learn every weapon that is in the game instead of just blazing past every single gun and missing out on how they all work.In conclusion, it's MUCH better than the Google Play and Apple store versions just because of the fact you have full control over the camera. Plus it's a stupidly fun and rewarding game if you're into pulling things apart then putting them back together just to see how they work and operate.			"

World of Guns: Gun Disassembly not only taught me to dis-& reassemble an AK47 assault rifle in under 4 minutes with no faulty steps on the first day (on my PC, i dont have an AK47 assault rifle for real!) - but also, how the AK´s, probably unique, safety/fire selector works :O			"

You can also show you friends how to fully dismantle and put back together a 1911 in 3 1/2 min. Even without actually buying it. Which you still should tough because it's still the most glorious handgun around.P.S: AR-15 > AK47 just sayin.			"

												First things first, I wasn't a gun person at all before I started playing this game. And I got pulled into this game because the technique behind guns is amazing. And the help you get to disasseble and assemble a gun is GREAT and easy to notice. Even car enthousiasts can bring their hearts up a little, it is a DLC(sadly) but it is worth the while and the money.9/10, Why?Great game in generalMy pc is from 2004(yes 2004!) and it still runs on 35 fps, so it isn't that heavySkeletons, Cars, Tanks, LOADS AND LOADS of guns. Cons: Takes a while to gain EXP and credits to unlock a new gun and some achievements are based on world wide scores, so most are quite tough(yet impossible) to get.Note for the publisher: Please make more cars/ vehicles for this game, or make a seperate game for that. Because that is really something I miss in the gaming world. I understand it'll turn out to be something you'll have to pay for because of its complexity, but it'll be worth your efford. ;)			"

												World of Guns: Gun Disassembly is by far the savior of my life. I once was a very troubled boy, and very uncontent about my career path. After World of Guns: Gun Disassembly, I was placed on several FBI watchlists and pursued my new founded dream as a terrorist. Since then, i have been on the run and taken down several SWAT teams who have raided my home. I am currently resideing in Iraq sharing the knowlage i have learned from World of Guns: Gun Disassembly with my muslim peers. Being able to assemble and dissassemble an ak47 in under 2.48 seconds comes in handy in a firefight. Thank you World of Guns: Gun Disassembly, for changing my life.10/10			"

												When I saw the trailer to this game, I was pretty excited. I don't consider myself to be a firearm enthusiast, but I do enjoy going to the range every so often, and thought this would be a great way for me to learn how a firearm works. And it does.However the whole ""Freemium"" Free-To-Play model REALLY turns me off. Sure you can gain experience slower, and poke friends to play to unlock stuff - but I'm not interested in these things; I don't play Facebook ""Farmville"" like games.I'd rather pay $15 (MAYBE $20) for a FULL game where I don't have to pester for friend invites.$50 though? That's asking way too much for what this game is.Also the ""need to be online"" is another turnoff - this game could be fully playable offline.Great concept, enjoyed the actual game, but crap execution.Would rather pay $15-$20 for an actual retail game.The Free-To-Play model here really kills what could be a potentially good & enjoyable game.

												I find this game very addicting for some reason. It's a great way to educate and guide you on how guns operate and what to expect if you want to repair one of your pieces IRL. You start out with only an AK to toy around with and get 2 more for a while with little choices to getting other guns for free. I got 20,000 points out of nowhere though, which helped me get at least a half-dozen more guns to play with. Suggestions: Beef up the credits you get for IRL $. Maybe $10 for 60,000 or so? so $1 = 6,000? Maybe $1 for 10k. Some of the dlc is a tad bit overpriced and I'm used to steam sales anyways you know.More ways of earning Credits like some more game modes if you can think something up. Text is instant as in no scrolling till it loads completely. Idk if it's an option already but it'd be a great feature.In the end this is an excellent game to pick up; it's free, addicting and has a lot of content to discover.			"

												General - 9,0The game allows you to do almost everything the leftists in your country won't (in my country PT - Partido dos Trabalhadores/Worker's Party). As a gun enthusiast I can say it's the best simulator in the genre that I've seen, it's an almost real experience. If you're looking for a random FPS don't download it, probably you'll find it boring, but if you wanna learn the mechanics or practise the disassembly of some of the most known and reliable weapons it's a must in your library. It has a greater educational value than entertainment value, however I do find pleasure on this kind of knowledge.Content - 9,5There are several models of handguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, SMG's, etc. You start with an AK-47 and afterwards a Colt 1911, the other guns you will have to buy, but you can unlock many more with your exp. points. You get exp. completing achievements and logging in everyday. As if it wasn't good enough, you can also disassemble skeletons (got the highest score of the day :D) and vehicles, which I find amusing. In addition there are shooting ranges, quiz and information about the weapons. Models are downloaded the first time they're used.Gameplay - 7.5Modes are: field strip, disassembly, assembly, operation, game, super game and hardcore game, each has a description at the beginning. There are also achievements for each mode and world leaderboards for all 3 game modes. If you liked in the first 10 minutes, chances are you'll play for 10 hours in the first day, so I don't have to say it's replayable and addictive. You use the mouse to interact with parts and control the camera, you can also use keyboard for some actions but I don't recommend. Sometimes a different part is selected in game mode and in some modes the camera moves against your will. In most modes you have to wait for the end of the animation to perform an action, that's annoying in timed modes. RMB is a good and quick way to zoom a specific part. Controls could be more precise.Graphics - 7.5Models are very precise and some even include a bit of visual external wear (mechanic wear would make a nice DLC), however they only look like plastic. Options are very limited, but they're not very relevant on this game, you can identify any part at all times, and if you don't, there's a caption in the lower centre of the screen for each part selected. There's native AA support and fixed frame rate at 60fps. The game is windowed by default. In general the models look like any good directx 9 game, I believe it's playable even with integrated video cards. Menus could look better. The game hasn't crashed yet.Overall - 8.4Current specsIntel Core I7-4770K at 4.2ghzNvidia PNY GTX 770 2gb at 1201mhzKingston HyperX DDR3 8gb at 1600mhz (x2)HP 1TB SATA III 7200rpmWindows 7 Premium SP1Sony Bravia KDL-42W655A at 1080p			"

												Being a firearm enthusiast I was hoping to enjoy this but there are several things that I can not tolerate...Lacking of options; fullscreen set it on my left monitor instead of my primary monitor. The only way around it is to use windowed mode and thirdparty program to make it windowed-borderless ( haven't tested functionality ).Instead of being able to choose the weapon, ie I have an HK G36 and would like to see how accurate it is to provide feedback to the developers, you're stuck with the AK47 which you have to complete everything with before you have access to the menu then you're forced to unlock the Colt 1911 and complete that before you have the xp/points back to get something else, but the G36 is tens of thousands of points to unlock meaning you either have to purchase an XP booster pack to gain more xp ( $3 for 60 minutes for 2x xp ) to gain xp quicker in order to get up to the level to provide feedback, or you purchase credits or points to unlock or spend ~$23 to $50, depending where you get it, to unlock all of the weapons instantly...I can't spend the time necessary on it because of an automobile accident in 2011 which left me with a terribly messed up neck and back which causes a lot of other issues with sitting, laying, walking, etc... It is also the reason I haven't been able to go shooting since and was hoping to check out the game to see if it had the SL8 trigger system ( some of the springs are annoying to assemble so I removed the ""lighter"" trigger from mine but was thinking of re-adding it ) as an option, or not and if not then provide photos or feedback so it can be added.I can't spend the money on it because the job offers have vanished since the accident, all 6 figures minimum otherwise I'd gladly support the developer.The camera system is terrible; you double-click on something to perform an action but instead of it happening the camera flings you around and you have to spend more time repositioning the mouse for each step then repositioning the camera back to a decent location, etc....The audio is loud and nausea inducing with no way to adjust it without muting it in Windows because you have no access to the menu prior to completing the AK47..The Escape key doesn't work, it doesn't open an options dialog to exit, etc.. to exit the game you have to close the task manually...Incorrect options for weapons ( The AK47 is ""SAFE""/""AUTO"", or ""SAFE""/""FIRE[single]"" depending on the variant; this WOG had 3 options which I haven't encountered yet but if it is a possibility then great... But the issue is with the weapon manipulation. I had to find the incredibly tiny button at the bottom left to complete the AK47 Assembly, Field-Strip, Disassembly and Operation modes... my advice: Remove them and click / drag the actual weapon... ), and instead of manipulating the gun as you see fit ( ie racking by clicking and dragging the mouse which would be more intuitive that double-clicking or clicking )			"

												This game is amazing for both entertainment and educational purposes. It's perfect in every way, save for a few flaws. The only issue, is that the flaws are extraordinary in comparison to the pro's. Not only is it basically a grindathon if you rather not put money into microtransactions, but you must have a certain number of friends (which number increases the more you unlock.) in order to play the shooting range courses.. The most entertaining PART of the game, may I add. (No pun intended.) I'd rather have paid at least 10 US Dollars for this game and have the whole thing to myself, rather than have it contain microtransactions and friend-poking. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I hope they make it a retail game soon, as that might remove the microtransaction and friend-needing element. The experience system is neat, as to challenge yourself to beat new difficulties in order to progress, but grinding does not equal challenge. It equals impatience and disinterest. And if you even try to repeat beaten game modes (Disassemble/Reassemble/Operate/Field Strip, etc.) the experience count you get for completion is laughable at best.For operate, (COLT 1911.) I got 200 experience, repeated, it gives me a whopping 5. With the wallet-tease ""IF YOU HAD A BOOSTER, YOU'D GET A WHOLE 12.5 EXTRA EXPERIENCE POINTS!!!!!111!!1oneoneoneeleveneleventy! JUST PAY US!"" If you wont take my review seriously due to the time I've invested in the game already, it's because the curve the game grants you from ""Hey! Welcome to Facebook, Guns edition!"" to ""PAY US PLZ!"" is a mere half an-hour if you really are into it. Two guns, out of the hundreds available, are unlocked for me right now. With the MP5 within 300 experience points away. The only options I have to get these points are to spend money, or beat a ""Super-Game"" (Disassemble/Reassemble perfectly with no double-clicks or flaws while timed.)At the moment, and I hate to say this, because Firearms are an extreme hobby of mine, is I do not reccommend this game at this current state, floppy connections, friend-bugging neccessities, and pay-to-win ruined it for that giant elated smile I had on my face when I hit ""Play"".On another plus side, I got to dis/reassemble a human skeleton. Which was cool. Sadly I have to pay credits to play the Car assembly, Motorcycle assembly, and the rest of the Skeletal assembly games. I guess I'm alright with the AK-47 and the COLT 1911. for now. I will change my review as this game has hefty updates. Thank you.			"

												It's pretty damn good for what it is, and what it really is, is a Facebook-like game. Your first gun is an AK-47, and the game lets you field strip, dissasemble, assemble, operate and then do a little mode called ""game"" where you must dissasemble and assemble the gun without any hints in one sitting.The best way to describe it is to say ""A puzzle game with guns"", click on the correct part and that part is no more, click on the wrong part and, unless you're in Super Game, you'll get nothing.There's lots of guns, with Wild West guns such as a Colt Single Action Army, with World War 1 or 2 guns like the MP40, to modern-day rifles like the H&K G36E. The tree that you can unlock these guns with is huge, but is covered with a sort of fog that reveals the guns the closer you get to them. You will need XP to purchase the guns, and you get XP by playing around with your current guns.I'd say give it a bash, it's not that bad and can be pretty fun. Oh yeah and there's shooting ranges but they are kind of dull as only specific guns (I think only 14 guns has ranges) has ranges and they are mostly ""Shoot targets 5 times"" or ""Hit all these targets within time"" and whatnot.If you are lucky, you might be able to stop terrorists by dissasembling their guns right infront of their face. But you need to be skilled, fast, and have the Sniper achievement for every gun in order to do this.			"

												A game where you dismantle real-life guns by each and every single pieces, all the little springs and screws being ripped off, and then you have to rebuild it back from the mess you've made.I'm far from being a gun enthousiast, but this game is still pretty interesting gameplay wise, there's a neat puzzle aspect to dismantling and reassembling, analyzing how the guns are build.  While it's totally fine taking you time with it, the in-game challenges has the more adept players try to make the highest score, taking a lot of precautions to not try to remove/assemble a piece too soon, and as fast as possible; a lot of it is about memorization, but it's still good fun, it ""wakes up my brain"", which is enough to keep me happy.It also serves as a very complete educationnal tool.  I've said I wasn't much into guns, but it was still interesting seeing how all this stuff works.There are a few annoyances though, as sometimes I would click twice on a piece to remove it, but the game counts it as me being hasty and losing points, and sometimes trying to click on the smaller pieces makes the game think you've been clicking on the side.  It's pretty obnoxious as you try for a better score, and the game fails to load quite a few times in each sessions, but it didn't tarnished the whole experience for me, at least.There are also Shooting Ranges, where you actively use a weapon, which is more of a neat little distraction for me.Since it's Free to Play, the way it's build has you either retrying the same guns or wait for daily rewards, to obtain Experience Points, which you have to use to unlock new guns.  You could always buy for Gun Packs DLC to not have to use these Exp Points.  There are also exclusive models that may require Credits, which also cost money, unless you miraculously manage to get all challenges on a model, in which case you only get 1 Credit for each 100% guns.  Not the best business model, but eh... could be much worse, I guess.It's worth a peek at least.			"

												This game is awesome! Personally I am really addicted to this game at the moment. Ok first of all it is no real game... It is more a educational software for gunenthusiasts or a training module for your local shootingclub to further your knowledge about the internal parts of a gun and how a gun excactly works. But the game modes wich you will play a lot if you want to unlock more guns are fun (too a degree). I mean it is really not for everyone disassembling and assembling the same gun over and over again (to unlock new guns), but as this is more a tool to get knowledge about guns and how their internals work and the dependancies between those parts, I call that an excellent approach to bring that knowledge to guninterested people and I think it is really the easiest and fun way to learn about these things. As I have read some reviews about this game myself, I read a lot about grinding in this game. For a game that is really Free to Play I think that isn't fair to say, cause even if it is a bit of grinding, you get full access to each and every gun through playing. If you are really bad at assembling and disassembling, just do it over and over again... you will get the hang to it and score your needed points.*Every 2 hours you can do a quiz where you just have to relate a black and white silhouette to a gunname, if you know gun's this is a fairly easy method for acquiring a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of points in just 30 sec. (every 2 hours without a hassle).* Update NOW every 1 hour * Kudos to the developers :)Get that game and try to beat my highscores, it is free to play afterall!!!			"

												Now granted, this is the first day I gave this game a try, but I got 6 hours clocked already. Unlocked several firearms, and getting to know their inner workings is a blast! I'll try to keep this spoiler free if you're looking forward to finding out all the different firearms you can get, like I am. It's A LOT of fun, and is THE game to get for gun owners who find legitimate enjoyment in disassembling/cleaning their firearms. Truth be told, I've managed to completely disassemble/reassemble my Springfield Armoury M1911A1 Mil Spec while blindfolded without using tools within 30 minutes flat. The only things I didn't muck with is the sights, the barrel link, and the... tail thing on the hammer. That's right, I even took out the mag release spring and screw, without the use of my eyes lol Anyways, back to the game... if you always wanted to learn how firearms function, how their individual pieces come together to form one cohesive tool, this is the perfect game for you. I've never played anything like it, but I've wanted a game like this for years, possibly a decade. The closest thing I remember is a flash game on Newgrounds that allows you to eject the mag, replace the mag, rack the slide, and fire. Not at anything in particular, just to operate the firearm. Of course this has that, and LOADS more. I'm only 6 hours in, I've unlocked a fair number of firearms, and the ones that I'm seeing that are possible to unlock I'm very much looking forward to! Here's where some of the *SPOILERS* start to come in, but they're mild, I won't mention any other firearms yet, I'll give a warning before I have a nerdgasm on that. There's a leaderboard for disassembly/reassembly time, and there's also some shooting ranges. The firearms will behave quite realistically with mag+1, select fire, and all that good stuff. The only way I could see it being better is if you could adjust the sights, if the controls to reload were more like Receiver, and if you used individual mags instead of the typicall 'ammo pool' that you'll find on CoD and Battlefield. Alright, now to talk about firearms next, so if you want that to remain a surprise, divert your eyes now lolYou start out with the AK47, how appropriate is that? Known for being simple, it's still got some complexity when it comes down to knowing which parts to remove first. Still, VERY enjoyable learning about every last individual part and how they all interact. Next was the M1911A1 (Called Colt 1911 unfortunately. I mean it's a Colt, but it's an M1911A1, not a 1911), and other than the barrel link not dropping before coming out of the slide, as well as the way the hammer assembly needs to be strictly removed AFTER the leaf spring (which is simply nonsense), it's 100% accurate to real life. After that you get the option to unlock the MP5 or Tech-9 if memory serves correctly, and branching off those are the Beretta 92 and CZ75 respectively. The Tech-9 is surprisingly simple, while the MP5 is DEFINITELY more complex. Now both the M92 and CZ75B are complex in their own right, but I found the Beretta to be particularly unforgiving with its hoard of tiny spring/plugs/pins. Then again, I also had to replace the trigger return spring on my 1982 CZ75 Pre-B so that kind of gave me a hand in figuring it out, came pretty naturally. There are also some historic gems, I can see the sillouette of the PPSH-41, M1928 Thompson, P08 Luger, and the ancestor that lead to the P08 which I can't remember the name. Borsharte? Something like that. There's more to unlock after finding those out, and they apparently release another firearm at least once a month! All in a free-to-play game!!! You need to unlock experience however in order to unlock said firearms, and that takes quite a lot of disassembly/reassembly as well as time at the shooting range. Both I find quite enjoyable :P Ah, there's also a firearm quiz that you can take once every 2 hours. It lasts 30 seconds, and you have to name all the firearms you can, at 300 Exp. per model. If you get one wrong, you don't get any experience whatsoever, so be careful with your choices. Last time I played it I got 8, which is 2400 Exp. That's almost half way to unlocking another firearm for me, however they seem to be getting more and more expensive. Performing feats of speed/precision with the shooting and disassembly/reassembly, are the only other ways to get experience at a convenient rate. Though doing the disassembly/reassembly over and over doesn't give you experience very quickly, neither is doing the shooting ranges over and over. The first time you make the time limit/hit number, you get a good amount, but every time after that is only a morsel of your first reward, so unless you want to spend money buying Exp. or credits, you're going to be doing a lot of quizes/shooting/disassembly/reassembly to unlock those juicy firearm models you're dying to get your hands on. Not that that's unenjoyable, but it does distinctly feel like grinding. Eventually doing it more for the Experience than the enjoyment. So basically what I'm saying is unless you're willing to pay, you'll need patience. I have loads of it, so I look forward to making this my go-to game for the foreseeable future :)Anyways I think that concludes what I know so far. If you're into the mechanical workings of firearms, then get this free-to-play game right now. No hesitation. If you just like playing shoot-em-ups without really caring how firearms come apart or work, well, you'll have to earn the shooting ranges you unlock in the game. Takes Experience for those too, you see. So far I only have two unlocked, and the next will cost me 8000 Experience if I recall correctly, which is a couple hours worth of grinding/quizzing. Still really fun though, with lots of modes to choose from, and I'm hoping to get some adjustable sights/bullet drop with the longer range firearms :) Happy shooting, and remember, check to make sure your firearm is clear before beginning your field strip or disassemble ;) Safety first!

												★★★★★☆☆☆☆☆That's something really interesting, indeed. However the game is quite demanding. It expects you to deep dive into the guns, it's mechanics and constructions. I'd love to find some kind of chillout mode, for players who want to simply learn how to use and clean some various guns. For now, it starts with forcing you to disassemble and assemble about 100 elements of AK-47 - and you should do this really fast to go further for next guns and tasks. This makes the most of extremely valuable content unavailable for most of casual players.			"

												When I was first introduced to the game I was sceptical at first, thinking that it was just another one of those boring games. But when I started playing all my scepticism towards the game suddenly vanished. The graphics are good/great, multiple gun models for you to choose from if you have the experience, and overall a good game for memory and concentration for those challengers out there. Can't wait for new models to come out for this game, to add to the multitude of guns that it already has!.			"

												This is a great educational tool for those interested in firearms.It doesn't teach you exactly how to take each part out, but it gives you a pretty good idea.The fact that it names each part is also pretty useful if you own a firearm and need to look up something online about a certain part.All the negative reviews are coming from people who complain that it's too hard to unlock anything. I've played for 36 hours and unlocked 17 guns, and I could unlock  more if I started it up to do the quiz every half hour and earn an average of 1000 points each time. "

												This game is very fun, especially if you have an inner engineer, wanting to tinker with stuff, see how they work, and eventually knowing them. I've always wanted to be a gunsmith, this game is kind of my ""gunsmith-in-training"" game, and sometimes realizing how many parts are in a single weapon, take the AK for example. I never thought it had 96 parts, considering it's easy field strip. Although there are a couple guns where I would think ""OK, I don't want to ever mess with this, too many little tiny parts (SG 552, I'm talking about you)"".Although I've only unlocked like 5 guns, there are ones I can't wait to unlock and tinker with. There are quite a few historical guns that really tickle the WWII history buff in me. Thompsons, 1911's, guns that everyone will recognize, and a few that I haven't heard of, but eventually knowing how to completely disassemble, reassemble, and field strip like the back of my hand.The game modes give a good challenge, like SuperGame. One wrong part click, gotta start all over. The community and developers are great, new guns regularly, game is alive with content.The only thing I didn't like about WoG is it's long tutorial. When I first started the game up, it automatically put me into a field strip mode, went through that, had to disassemble and reassemble, then had to know about every button there was in the game. 9/10 great game for 2nd Amendment supporters and people wanting to get into the 2nd Amendment profession.

												1000% GoodYou like (or love) Gun or mechanic? World of Gun is made for you.Works made on this game is incredible great! I was not even dreaming of such a game... In fact, it is more than a game, it is a tool to learn, to understand, and to explain people that gun can be consider as car, as watch and other mechanicals stuff that people collect because of their mechanical engineering, not only as a tool that kill people (which manage to make this without firearms very well by the way!)Until know, i have play all actuall models, including bonus section.You can play it as a casual, or as a ""full time"" game without any kind of problem...after 325 hours of playing i still turn on my computer in the only goal to launch the game everyday.The team of the game is incredible reactive, and careful to players observations. New model are made very often.It is really worth the money you will put in it....it is a mechanical database without equivalence, above all considering the price!Long live to World of Gun! Long live to Noble Empire!			"

												It is a simple yet engaging game. As a gun enthusiast in a country where the fire arms and ammuniotion laws are very strict, this is a nice way to see closely my favorite weapons.The graphics are pretty decent, and could do with an upgrade, but the detail provided is good.Yes, the bad part is that you have to grind for XP to unlock new weapons and the weapon tree is not fully visible, unless you pay. But guess what? This is a free game and you can play free for as long as you want. Most of the guns are availabe without having to pay. I don't mind the XP grind since I haven't paid a cent yet, nor did I feel the need to do so. The people who made the game, have to get paid somehow, so I don't mind the microtransactions.			"

												Anyone with a passing interest in engineering should install this and check it out.I'm not a firearms enthusiast, but if the full game was on sale for $10 or so I would consider buying it just because it really is impressive to see everything that goes on inside these machines. Unfortunately the developers went the (greedy) F2P route and charge $50 (as of this writing) to get all of the content, or who knows how much more if you're a sucker and pay for boosts, credits, etc.The thumbs up is for the truly FREE AK-47 content, and I imagine the full game's content is equally high quality and probably worth $50 to gun enthusiasts.That being said, as other reviews note, trying to grind your way to all the content is absolutely out of the question. It just takes an unreasonable amount of time to accrue more XP. So install it, but think of it as a demo. If you like it enough to finish the AK in Super Game mode, then ask yourself if you want to see another 100+ guns at the same level of detail. If you do, then spend the $50 and get the DLC that unlocks all content. Otherwise move along.			"

												Very interesting sim for gun enthusiests.If you ever wanted to know how that AK-47 featured in so many games and movies works from inside and out, this is for you. In fact the AK-47 is the very first gun available.You can basically field strip, disassemble, reassemble and operate a large variety of guns. If you think you are good enough, you can unlock the timed competative modes and test your skills against people around the world.For certain models of guns, there are also unlockable shooting ranges to try for some high scores in target practice.The shooting range experience won't make you feel like you're playing a AAA FPS, but at least you can test the guns in action.As of this writing, there are also other things that can be disassembled, such as skeletons, cars ( Including a Delorean ), a motorcycle, and even a tank!On top of all that, the game is free to play. You unlock guns by earning points ( or credits, explained later ). You earn points by assembling/disassembling, using, or winning timed modes with the guns you already have. You can also earn points with a daily quiz and a referral system. To unlock credits however, you either need to make top place in the best times (daily times fortunately), get the referreal bonus, or pay money.If you want access to ALL guns at once, or boosters, that's where the money comes in.I was kind of sad that some of the guns and most of the bonus content (cars, skeletons, etc) required credits to unlock, but I can understand the decision, as the level of detail was no doubt extremely time intensive to reproduce.You don't have to buy it, but you should definitely try it!

One of the only downsides is you find yourself disassembling and reassembling the same weapons over and over to get the experience you need, although they have acheivements that give you experience which makes this less tedious and makes the game more challenging.

												World of Guns: Gun Disassembly. A very simple game for those who love firearms or want to know more about firearms.This is not really a game where you have fun compared to shooters or simulators or simulators that are made for the lolz.This game is educational or an easy 3D source material for those who make replicas, fix guns etc.The game starts well. It tells you how the game works and what you can do in a very straightforward manner.The rules are simple. You unlock a model, play the game modes, unlock achievements and receive xp to unlock the next model.The game modes are: field strip, disassembly, assembly, operation, game, supergame and hardcore mode.Field strip- you field strip the weaponDisassembly- you take the weapon completely apartAssembly- you put the firearm back togetherOperation- you fire the weapon, reload it and customize itGame- you disassemble the weapon and assemble the weapon as fast as you can (there are 3 achievements. Timed I is easy, Timed II is medium and Timed III is hard)Super game- Like game mode but harder. If you click on the wrong part you lose and you have to restart from scratch.Hardcore mode- you can make more moves. Example: when playing HC mode with an AK47 you can take the magazine, cleaning rod, top cover, pistol and the cleaning kit apart (located in the stock) in a few seconds. To unlock the hardcore achievement you must take your gun apart and assemble it flawlessly. You can not take things apart instantly. For example if you remove the magazine on some guns you can not remove another part while the magazine is being taken out. You have to wait for the animation to end in order to take another part apart or when putting parts back together.There are also shooting ranges where you shoot weapons and gain xp but you need xp to unlock them.In shooting ranges you are given a task to shoot X targets X ammount of times with X ammount of rounds.The reloading animations look robotic in my opinion but they are better than tacky animations.Its another game mode but if you want to unlock all of the guns then you might think about avoiding them but unlocking shooting ranges is also good because you can gain xp from them and possibly get credits from them on the first try (if your final score is good enough you might be the top scoring player of the day and receive 1 credit).And then there is Quiz. When playing Quiz you are given an image of a firearm and you have to pick the right answer.Sounds easy but if you are not familiar with alot of firearms you are gonna have a hard time because if you pick the wrong answer the quiz is over, you get 0xp and you have to wait 1 hour in order to take the quiz again.So the best way to play this is to memorize the models or print an image list. If you dont know the answer then the best option is to do nothing because something is better then nothing.There is also bonus content where you can take cars, motorcycles and skeletons apart. The human skeleton is free but the rest is not. Which brings me to xp and credits.The more guns you unlock the more xp you need to unlock the next model. Now you get a decent ammount of xp for playing the game modes but after unlocking the achievements you get less but depending on the model and the ammount of xp it requires you get more xp (a 16000xp model will give you more xp compared to a 10000xp model). Credits can be earned if you unlock the champion achievement (you can unlock it by topping the scorebored in the Day section. There is also Week and All time. Theres also highscores for each game mode. And if you lack the ability to think the Day section will show you the top scoring players of the day and yes the scoreboard resets). You also get free xp for playing the game the day after so the game is not that cruel. But if you lack patients you can buy a booster pack which doubles your xp or you can buy credits or xp with your money. 1.99 € for 5000 xp. You can also buy DLC to unlock everything but I have not looked that up very well so yeah you can simply buy all of the models for 50€.While that kinda sounds like a P2E (pay to enjoy) you can get all the models for free if you play casually.Casually playing is mini grinding and playing Quiz. When you have enough xp you unlock the model you want to unlock, have fun with it and start mini grinding and playing Quiz until you get the next one.Graphics- since my settings are set to low to get a lot of fps. I am not going to judge but it looks fine. Not super realistic but good for an educational game.Music and backround art- the music is fine but the backrounds are not. In my opinion the default backround is the best for me cus the space backrounds look cheesy. If you like the space backrounds go ahead and use em. What ever floats your boat keep it floating.Pros: educational, no major glitches, fun animations when taking the weapons apart, free and alot of models to check out.Cons: due to the ammount of xp you need you will grind at one point or another and it does take a while to unlock a new model.Tips: when taking firearms apart while trying to get the best time disable auto focus in the settings. Leave it on in disassembly and assembly mode for ease of learning.Overall the game is fine. Its not a mega fun blast. Its educational. 7.5/10			"

												I would have to first start off by saying, this is not really a game or atleast in my opinion.Its more like a learning tool to understand how guns work, how to take them apart and rebuild them. The level of detail is pretty nice, and while its not a 100% perfect guide to learning about guns. Its pretty close to me.It show's pretty much every part of a gun, and even lets you see how they work and whats going on as they fire so you can get a better idea of whats parts do what in a gun. "

												A fantastic Free 2 Play title that helps to gain insight in guns.The GUI is minimal, the models are really accurate and the textures are well made (except for some matte-black internal part).You can also operate the guns to see what happens when you pull the trigger (and whan you flip the selector/safety, when you remove the magazine and so on), thanks to the X-Ray view and to the cutoff view. You can also slow down the simulation up to 50 times.Disassembling and reassembling procedures are ""simple"" and clean thanks to the assonometric exploded view of the disassembled parts. ""Simple"" is between commas because you still have to learn and remember the disassembling order.There are hints (in case of you really can't see that tiny pivot holding up the entire safety lever), but don't rely on it too much if you want to achieve a good score.By completing tasks related to a model, you earn XP that you can spend to unlock further models. There's also a Quiz feature, where you get to recognize the gun by its silhouette.You can also try out some gun in shooting ranges, but I think they don't worth the cost.You can buy the sport cars pack or even the skeleton model pack. You can also buy the whole pack of models (98 models!!) for 36€, but hey, where's the challenge if you already unlock everyting by the start?If you know guns you'll like this game, and if you like this game you'll start to learn something about how a gun works.(Fun fact: I own a deactivated Desert Eagle .50AE, so I already knew how to disassemble it. Guess what, I got the best daily score with that gun. I already knew what to do, and the big work was only about clicking faster and faster.)			"

												My only problem with the game, is the fact that all the new models they are adding require credits to unlock. If they added more guns that could be unlocked with just the XP then all would be right with the world. But overall the game is great if your a gunholic like myself.

												""World of Guns: Gun Disassembly"" is a pretty interesting game: you can disassemble and assemble many weapons in the bonus section you can (currently) disassemble and assemble 6 skeletons 4 cars 1 bike, 1 jeep and 1 tank you can learn how every gun (or vehicle) works (x-ray and slow-motion) and learn about functions and components/upgrades you can play on time and skill to compare your stats world-wide this game is (nearly) ""Free To Play"" (you won't be able to unlock all achievements without buying the car and/or skeleton bonus pack and maybe one credit-boost for the tank and/or the jeep)Some maps, models and functions still need some improvement, but I'd say that's okay for a free-to-play game.

												While it does have a rather disgusting business model in place, the game itself is pretty good.I love guns and learning useless stuff, so this game hits the spot. It's very educational.I bought the full pack almost as soon as I started running out of xp so I don't know about the grinding aspect, but it was starting to look really scary.Now that I don't have to worry about running out of xp and whatnot, the game is very entertaining.I've learned quite a bit of firearm mechanics thanks to this. Me, I've always wanted to know how some of the weirder looking guns function, and now I do.Taking guns down is easy, and putting them back is equally easy, but doing so flawlessly and fast takes certain skill.With closer to a hundred firearms, there's plenty of guns to learn the inside out.Sure, the graphics could be better, but I see this more as a tool than a game so it's not as important.If you like guns and useless information, this is your jazz. Buying the lifetime access makes you breathe easy and the entertainment factor skyrockets from the free version.The game is good, business model is bad			"

												This is quite a good exposition of how various firearms work (110 working models!). The attention to detail and the various options given seem to to be quite well thought out. I like the approach to making a game of the various disassemblies and assemblies which stops the memorisation process from being such a drill and more of a competition with various achievement levels.Seriously considering Lifetime purchase (which includes shooting ranges!) but would like to see option to maintain the game aspect of earning weapons (but without the payment which the lifetime nulls).Also great to see that they've approached cars and anatomical structures too!

												This game. Oh, boy. Let's get started, shall we?PROS:-Gun disassembly is very accurate-Firing and executions are correct-Leaderboards to race against players-A true ""story"" experience (as long as you don't go along and use your mommy's credit card)-Large selection of weapons-Included disections such as a human skeleton, cars, etc.CONS:-Part(s) of the game require a substantial basis of money (which I'm not willing to pay)-Achievements of the guns give somewhat little EXP for their difficulties (I'm looking at you, Timed achievements. 400 EXP for my ""perfection"" of disassembling and assembling a Tec-9 in 1:37?)-Random selection of when to unlock guns in the game (the catalogue will allow you to get something at any time, with a little bit of extra pricing I believe). What I'm saying is, I would've started with pistols and you would've kept expanding into higher tiers of weapons: e.g. pistols, sub-machine guns, assault rifles, light-machine guns, sniper rifles, artillery.PERSONAL COMMENTS:-I know a very good general understanding of most weapons, and I love expanding my knowledge to more guns and learning how to fully disarm weapons.-I love field stripping weapons in real life, so this game really speaks to me.-I like looking inside the mechanics and seeing how a weapon works to a full extent.Hope any of my review helps your choice on downloading this or not, and if you're still not sure, it's a very quick DL and you can try it out for yourself.

This game does exactly what the title suggest: you have to disassemble and assemble various kinds of guns, both historical and modern.The process of disassembling a gun works like a puzzle, or a memory game: you have to remember the exact sequence and not try to move a piece that is locked by another piece.Every time you complete correctly a challenge you receive some points with which you can unlock other guns. You can also spend real money and buy various kind of update, or unlock the guns right away.The fully 3d models are very nicely done, and the mechanism is fully operable and so you can see with x-ray how any single gun mechanism operate.

												I would recommend this game only to those interested in a game exactly like this, the controls in the game moving perspective aren't the greatest and are a hindrance to competition, however this is in no way like a real gun dis-re assembly competition that would be most likely a friendly challenge. I can't call it pay to win, because winning is simply based off of memory and mouse speed, however grinding is a pain when you already have done the same two guns over and over, unless you want to be a terrorist. Grinding wise, I would simply do each gun once a day so as to not drive yourself crazy over them(and become a terrorist.) Overall, for what this particulary is, 7/10.			"

Without me, my rifle is useless. Without my rifle, I am useless. I must fire my rifle true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy, who is trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will. Before God I swear this creed: my rifle and myself are defenders of my country, we are the masters of our enemy, we are the saviors of my life. So be it, until there is no enemy, but peace. Amen.			"

												Very addictive game if you gun person. This game does exactly what the title suggest: you have to disassemble and assemble various kinds of guns, both historical and modern.The process of disassembling a gun works like a puzzle, or a memory game: you have to remember the exact sequence and not try to move a piece that is locked by another piece.Every time you complete correctly a challenge you receive some points with which you can unlock other guns. You can also spend real money and buy various kind of update, or unlock the guns right away.The fully 3d models are very nicely done, and the mechanism is fully operable and so you can see with x-ray how any single gun mechanism operate.

												Great game for any gun fanatic , I personally had fun and i learned alot about guns  but poor buisness  and gameplay decisions ruin  the game . Pros 1. Game accuratley simulates gun parts and how guns work. With very high detailed models  2. Guns recoil and animations are  realistic.3. Extremly educational for people who are new to using or learning about guns.Cons1.Game is basically ''Pay to win'' or in this case ''pay to unlock more guns'' is obvious that the Devs buy guns license for the content .This perspective is ok but no one wants to pay for content that is supposed to a core part of a game .2.To progress in the game you need to dismantle every gun part and resemble it . Later on the difficulty increases such as taking it dismantling the gun with out doing a mistake if you do you restart the process . This overtime becomes extremely repetitive and boring.3. Gun sound effects are quite poor Verdict- Game is great , but dont expect much unless youre willing to pay .   7/10			"

												This is a very awesome and accurate 3d representation of guns and how they break down piece for piece. There are several modes of play from a basic field strip to a full on disassembly of the gun right down to the last screw and spring. There is a reassmebly mode and then there are 3 different game modes that require you to do a full disassemble and reassemble while being timed with bonuses for not clicking any of the wrong pieces among others. This game has a large and beautiful catalog of guns to choose from. Everything from Mauser to Glock as well as Beretta, Colt, AK variants, Heckler and Koch, Fabrique Nationale, Walther and many others.This is a fantastic game for any gun enthusiast. It will make you a lot more knowledgeable about the guns and how they break down. You can also see an x-ray view of how the gun works in real time or slow motion while it is in operation. If that isn't enough you can also fire guns off at firing ranges as you unlock them. (You must unlock guns as well as ranges) One downfall to this is that it doesn't let you choose which gun to use at the range. The ranges have 4 games which are preset to certain guns.In the end I don't think there is much to complain about. The game is free, and it has tons of guns. You can compete for high scores with other players and friends. You can learn about all of the parts of the guns, and you can even select an option that allows you to see the names of each and every part.If you love guns, get this game. You won't regret it. I own a beretta 92FS and I will say the break down of the gun in the game is 100% accurate to the real thing. Every spring, every pin, every screw. Perfect to a fault. Rating: 10/10			"

												I used to play this game back on Kongregate.  As such, I was super happy to see that there is a version available here on Steam.  If you're a gun enthusiast, such as myself, you will find hours of informational enjoyment with this game.Pros : - Awesomely detailed and animated models.- Various levels of x-ray viewing.  ( especially useful during the animations )- Various levels of slow-motion available for said animations.- Large selection of firearms.- The shooting range challenges are a nice added bonus.Cons :- Sometimes it takes a while to unlock the next weapon if you dont play every day for the login streak XP bonus.  ( Slightly offset by the quiz you can try hourly for which you are rewarded XP for how many weapon IDs you can make. )Overall :STRONGLY RECOMMEND			"

												Gun Disassembly is basically an interactive encyclopedia about weapons, and not a bad one. There are a lot of weapons to read about, look at and disassemble to the smallest part, but not all of them are easily accessible. For instance, there are some guns, that cost a lot of xp points (36,000 for a simple pistol) and some require credits, which you can only get with real money. What saves this game from being a total grinder is weapons quiz. You have 30 seconds to recognise as many weapons as possible, and for 1 correct answer each, you get 300 xp points, which is a reasonable amount. There are some shooting areas, but I found those to be the weakest part of the game, boring and sluggish. If you are a Gun Nut, who's mostly interested in how weapons work, then I would strongly recommend this game, if not,  then you won't find much enjoyment here.			"

												This is a fantastic game! The gameplay is very nice, and is a new idea. However, it is not yet flawless. The MP5 rifle has a glitch in the operation, and the firing ranges are extremely difficult, to the point that it takes a painful amount of time and luck to pass them. I'd still reccomend this game due to the stunning realism and detail put into the (dis)-assembly of the weapons, and the bonus vehicles and skeletons. It is a very addictive game that manages to make the best of not being a fast pased action game like we mostly see today. The education demonstrated here clearly made the best of it's time.			"

Played for an hour, now I am become death.11/10Really more like a 7/10. It's a fun little toy for gun enthusiasts and hobbyists. So far, there seems to be a variety in the available guns, the accuracy of the firearms seems to be of top-notch quality, and the assembly and disassembly can be addicting. If you're looking for traditional fun, you will probably not find it as what you get in the game is what it advertises. You mostly assemble, disassemble, and learn about various firearms. If that doesn't interest, go elsewhere. There are two other gripes I have with the game. Firstly, if you lose connection to the servers, you're gonna have a bad time. It's not uncommon for me to lose connection which results in me having to restart the game. This is a nuisance and can become frustrating. The second major problem is the Facebook game-esque nature. You unlock things by grinding (assembling, disassembling, and playing games repeatedly) and inviting friends to play. You can also get things like XP boosts to unlock more guns and bonuses quicker. If you're not into having your fun held hostage until you get x amount of friends playing this, then go elsewhere.Personally, I love it so far.brb, assembling Kalashnikov			"

TL;DRHave you ever wondered how firearms work? If so, this is a perfect opportunity to familiarise yourself with gun mechanics... for free!+ LOADS of firearms, including rifles, pistols, machine guns, grenade launchers, and even artillery+ Attention to detail+ X-ray, slow-motion, and other features help you see better how a gun works+ Quiz+ Low system requirements+ Suited both for short (although it may be hard to stop playing) and long sessions- Steals time like nobody's business- Inconsistent- Frustrating and unforgiving at times- GrindyREVIEWWorld of Guns: Gun Disassembly is a free gun puzzle game. It lets you disassemble and assemble firearms. Moreover, you can also see how a gun works and, albeit in a few cases only, visit a shooting range and put your aiming skills to test.The gameplay is centred around, you guessed it, assembling and disassembling weaponry. It relies mostly on memorising which parts to move and when to do that. You can move single parts and the whole assemblies. The downside associated with it is that the moveable parts vary from weapon to weapon and it is very easy to make mistakes when disassembling/assembling. Who said that gun assembly was easy?Apart from the clue of the game, you can also examine how a firearm works. There are some features which come in handy, including x-ray vision and slow-motion. During the ""Operation"", you perform many actions with the gun, such as fire, reload, attaching accessories (flashlights, scopes, etc.), changing the fire mode, and so on.The weaponry ranges from historical (Winchester 1887) to modern-day rifles (TAR-21) and everything in-between. There are well-over 100 guns, including pistols, machine guns, and even artillery. To access them, however, you have to earn it the hard way. You start with the AK-47 and unlock other weapons by spending either experience points or credits. The former are earned by completing the weapon tasks (field strip, disassembly, assembly, operation, normal game, super game, and hardcore game) and completing quizzes (one quiz per hour). The latter are either bought or earned by topping the scoreboard in normal, super, or hardcore games (one credit per weapon). Getting all the guns requires a lot of grinding, but that is to be expected from a free game.To sum up, I recommend this game not only to firearm fans but also to people playing casually. Despite being an unforgiving and sometimes frustrating game, it is still tons of fun to play and discover. Furthermore, it can be ran on pretty much any PC. Beware though: a wise man once said that this game should not be played at an airport. Mark his words, for you might miss your flight!P.S.

												Selling this as a ""free to play"" game is such a god damn lie its almost funny. This game is basically a demo of what could have been a great gunsmithing and learning game, but was plauged by those stupid, inevitable microtransactions. The saddest part is that its actually a really cool game if you are into guns and its an even better experience if you own a few yourself. That being the best part, i dont reccommend it unless you like to spend all of your money on microtransactions or if you have a good 10+ hours time to waste just to unlock ONE of the next guns (thats not an exxageration). The only thing that will not offer you a microtransaction is the uninstall button, which is really sad considering this game is such a good idea, just it was brought down by the developers greed. With the money spent earning every single gun, car, artillery cannon, in this game (there is a lot), you could go get yourself a good small caliber rifle to start learning off of in REAL LIFE. They really had a good idea to start off with and could have made this the best gunsmithing game to date, but they got money hungry and ruined such a nice game in the process. ""Free to play"" nowadays means ""pay to win"", its really sad. This game is a perfect example of that.			"

												Less a game, and more a simulation for people who want to dismantle and resemble firearms. Unlocking new firearms require a large number of points, meaning a user will be spending either a lot of time grinding activities repeatedly, or money on buying credits to unlock more weapons.While the simulation aspects might be accurate, ultimately, it's closer to image training program for anybody who really wants to disassemble firearms, than an actual game of any sort. In this sense, it belongs more in the software category than the game category.3/10			"

												I would love it, I wish I could love this game, but I'm not here to grind, and the devs/pubs aren't here to not be money grubbing savages since this appears to be their only game on Steam. The level of savagery here is off the charts--foam at the mouth deception, painting the game as free to play, turning around and giving you all the traits of a pure pay to win game.>Ridiculous grind.>Microtransactions.>Free to play surface with DLC packages that *KILL* the point of the game.>Charging outragious prices and disregarding the point of the game.>You're either a degenerate with no life who uses unfunny public shooting incident memes living in their great grandparents' home, or you're a spoiled baby being schooled by this forty year old army veteran who doesn't know about these mouth-foaming, money devouring, soul-sucking fiends in the gaming market.Okay, sorry for that. Is this worth the value the developers/publishers are releasing it at? No. Period.What could they do to make this game actually worth it?-Less grind. *Much* less.-Remove most of the DLC packs, including the unlock-all one(NO EXCEPTIONS).-More subtle emphasis on competition(personal thing, competition's a bit intimidating, and not every gun nut is here to put together a gun the fastest in a ♥♥♥♥ measuring contest).-Of course, remove the microtransactions.-Work on VGUI(in general, pretty sure other people would want something better than this).What good is there besides these fiends trying to snatch up your wallet by the belly?+Pretty steep into details.+Not too hard, but there are challenges for you, and engaging events.+A leveling system so that you can't just go from putting a rock onto a stick all the way to performing surgery on a Centurion tank on the fly as a newbie--allthoughthegrindis♥♥♥♥ingawful.+Indepth analysis of model workings with simple, not too distracting x-ray effects, but slow-mo effects aren't quite on par, let alone the sounds in general.+Decent learning experience for a not so new gun nut who's already pretty into guns, but needs the extra kick.There's not much else to go about for me, and while the visuals aren't on par either, they don't really need to be. You're just being baby-stepped through the technical wonders of weaponry, not much is really needed visually, as this is a game for those interested, not more than the target audience.The major problem still cannot be avoided, you will probably have to pay real money if you sped through your first very few models already, and you may pay dearly.

												For everybody that has played a shooter game at some point in his life and was interested in stripping and piecing together the guns he used. Or somebody that has a general interest in weapons and looks for a game to play when he has a little spare time. To all of you but to those I mentioned in particular I recommend this game very highly. It brings a new feeling of tech to every shooter game because you feel like ""Yea I know that gun and I know how to strip it and build it back together.""THUMPS UP TO THE MAX			"

												So let me break it down. World of guns: Gun Disassembly is a unique 'game' if I've ever seen one.You start off with a classic Kalashnikova and work your way up to a colt, not much of a spoiler there. but yeah.The game is all about unlocking things; Field strip your gun to unlock dissasembly, dissasembly your gun to unlock reassembly... Assemble to operation, operation to game, game to super game and super game to hardcore game. You can geuss what the first three are; Operation is using the various features on a gun, changing handgrips, firing it, attaching a silencer or even folding a stock. The games however are a test to see your memory of how to put a gun together, you get bonus points and kudos if you manage to do it without touching the wrong part or taking a hint. On super game and up its instant failure to touch the wrong part and there is no hints.You might be thinking ""okay thats easy"" well... I've spent a bit of time getting raged at a gun for getting one peice wrong or forgetting what came first. A few times the game screws you over by saying ""YOU NEED TO DO THIS FIRST"" even though there are other points where you do the same thing and the game lets you.Example: You need to attach two rods to a plate and put the springs back on. One gun lets you put a rod and then the string on before having to deal with the second rod. But this particular gun needs both to be on.Its a bit annoying when some guns let you do it and doing it for real lets you do it.On the graphics end of it. The outside of the gun, looks awesome. 10/10 texturing. On the inside though... many parts have 'brush' texturing. This means that they are all are very basic tons of grey and black. Honestly they're just shaped blocks at that point, a mere representative. No complaint unless your obbscessed with HD textures.On the of the guns themselfves. TONS of variety. I find quite a few guns I like in their collection, however... I need to sift through alot of guns I don't cary about at all just to get to them. Sure you can buy the starter pack or the full unlock... but whats the fun of that? Well, i'll tell you: total access. Unless you got alot of time and patience, you won't get through this game without paying. Because the awarded points for working with a single gun almost never total enough to unlock a new one. Sure the points increase as you move on up... but the points needed per gun almost quadruple. So it makes playing fairly hard to do. Also you cannot earn any points through the ranges, I do not suggest unlocking them unless you really like the guns your using alot. Plus its just challenges and not free shooting; you also cannot repeat the challenges once you finish. The graphics for the range also take a plunk, going to CS 1.6 esque graphics. AKA Crappy world textures and okay gun textures.There is also another few ways to unlock points (two of them broken for me, reinstalling to see if it fixes it for me).First is coming back every day. Don't laugh you get a points bonus for coming back so many days in a row; even if you only pop in the grab that bonus. But make sure you come back every day or it'll reset.Next method is by joining the group and inviting freinds. I managed to join the group... but now it won't let me invite freinds because the button for it does not function. I have even used the other method in game and it still doesn't work. but this gives you some credits and a ton of XP to use on unlocking guns. But, I can't use it because it's broken.Last method is the quiz (which has a high failure rate for me... figures)Quizes test your ability to recognize the gun models, the more you get right is the more XP you get to walk away with. Get one wrong though and you lose your shot and get locked out for 2 hours.The funniest thing about the quiz not working for me is that it will go through just fine, but it will basically not give me the button to collect my points. It will however (even though I got all the questions right) lock me out for 2 hours. Its interesting to note that is registers me as unable to take another quiz... but yet I get none of my earned points. It only occasionally gives me my points for the quiz, if not... it basically locks the game up because it doesn't give me the button. CRAZIEST THING IS... If I fail the quiz, it doesn't crash at all. I feel like they're trying to keep me from getting points... Cheeki ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.Anyways I'm reinstalling, still voting positive for this game. Even though its got a bunch of Cheeki Breeki coders.			"

												Interesting and possibly fun if you are curious or enthusiastic about the mechanics of real firearms. The XP grind is tolerable for those who want to perfect their knowledge. You'll get enough XP for the next firearm by the time you've mastered the current one. However if you just want to explore the weapons at leisure then you'll find the XP earnt to be drastically insufficient. Of course this is no problem if you're willing to throw money at the game.

												This game is essentially a facebook game, and it will probably only appeal to a select few. It's like a memory game with guns, with some sexy firing animations to break up the monotony. There is a lot of grinding, but most of it can be avoided by simply mastering the hourly quizes which will net roughly 1/3rd of the experience required for the best gun each time you take one. The best thing this game has going for it is the developers, who are probably some of the most active I've seen for any game. Just look at the Steam community forums, they respond to pretty much everything.I would love to see camera hotkeys similar to Starcraft where you set hotkeys to a predetermined camera state and more historical guns (let's face it most of the polymer pistols feel the same).

												This is one of the most dangerous time sinks I have run into since Minecraft. I managed to unlock the Colt 1911, the MP5 and the Intratec Tec-9.  After a few hours turning them around seeing how everything works I went for the DLC with the unlimited guns. The M-16 A1 model brought back not-so-fond memories of skinning my knuckles trying to pull out the handguards. I also noticed that the o-rings in the bolt are stacked exactly like in real life, it's obvious that these models went through an insane amount of scrutiny. What's good:1. You get to see how most of everything inside works.2. You get to fire the weapons.What's not so good:1. The full weapons unlock should allow hiding all new guns and click to show/hide guns as needed so it is not so damn hard to navigate. It is overwhelming when you see all of the guns up to date displayed in one shot.2. I wish I could use my controller in the shooting games.3. The game doesn't explain things, it just walks you through. And sometimes the safeties can't be engaged by clicking on the weapon, you have to click a menu button.4. Sometimes the fire selectors don't allow all positions, so you are also stuck using a menu button to select fire modes.5. The only adjustable sight post that moves at all so far is the AK-47. The M16-A1s front post doesn't turn, unless I am doing something wrong. 6. Some weapons should allow movement of the hammer but the model only allows to pull back the slide. Wish list for the developers:1. Allow show/hide of items already purchased/unlocked/etc. 2. Allow a visualization of the return mechanism, for example the M16-A1 should show me the gas blow back, etc.3. Allow sights to move if/when the originals do. 4. Explain a little bit more of what's going on. 5. All safeties, fire selectors, de-cocking levers, etc. should be movable from the model, not from menu buttons. BTW, hats off to the parties responsible for the game mode achievement for doing things in the right order. It's frustrating as hell, but these being dangerous machines it makes sense to force people to learn an assembly sequence. I have been busting my ♥♥♥ for two long miserable days trying to do the Colt 1911 in order and I keep screwing up because I pick the main spring out of sequence or I click the recoil spring plug when I wanted to click on the recoil spring, that kind of thing. Overall:A complete absolute win for anyone that is curious about how machines work. The first time you dig into that AK-47 and you figure out on your own why the auto mode works, you'll feel like a rocket scientist.			"

												Woo yeah making guns and stuff.American Simulator 2014 is an excellent game in which you get to play with guns, but not like usual, instead of firing them (although it is an option in the game), you actually learn to field and full strip and assemble all kinds of fun things. its very straightforward and to the point, kinda pushes for an ingame purchase but is mostly fun, especially when you live in a police state country like australia.my only complaint is that some of the guns seem to have a diferent scale of texture detail to others, which bothers my OCD.

												An in depth game showing how to disassemble, assemble, and operate many guns. There are fun options such as the x-ray view on a gun that allows you to see in depth (sort of) how the inside mechanics of a gun works. For free, if you play for a couple hours, you get full access to the ak-47, and a few pistols. However, this game will most likely feel incomplete if you don't pay real $ to unlock several of the expensive guns. Purchasing at least the $10 gun pack, which is what I did, gives you close to a complete experience of the game, so there's no need to buy the $50-60 ""full game"" option, unless you really, really like this game.

												A common complaint about videogame with firearms in them is the they aren't realistic enough.   This game changes that.  This is less of a video game and more of a gunsmith training aid.  Every firearm contained is a real life weapon.  The mechanics of how they work and how they come apart and go back together is accurate.  Ever wanted to see exactly how your favorite weapon in your favorite FPS actually works?  This ""game"" is your answer.  That being said, the GUI is a little clunky at times, and outside of getting achievements the first person aspects are not great.  None of this really really detracts from this little gem of a game.			"

On super game and up its instant failure to touch the wrong part and there is no hints.You might be thinking ""okay thats easy"" well... I've spent a bit of time getting raged at a gun for getting one peice wrong or forgetting what came first. A few times the game screws you over by saying ""YOU NEED TO DO THIS FIRST"" even though there are other points where you do the same thing and the game lets you.Example: You need to attach two rods to a plate and put the springs back on. One gun lets you put a rod and then the string on before having to deal with the second rod. But this particular gun needs both to be on.Its a bit annoying when some guns let you do it and doing it for real lets you do it.On the graphics end of it. The outside of the gun, looks awesome. 10/10 texturing. On the inside though... many parts have 'brush' texturing. This means that they are all are very basic tons of grey and black. Honestly they're just shaped blocks at that point, a mere representative. No complaint unless your obbscessed with HD textures.On the of the guns themselfves. TONS of variety. I find quite a few guns I like in their collection, however... I need to sift through alot of guns I don't cary about at all just to get to them. Sure you can buy the starter pack or the full unlock... but whats the fun of that? Well, i'll tell you: total access. Unless you got alot of time and patience, you won't get through this game without paying. Because the awarded points for working with a single gun almost never total enough to unlock a new one. Sure the points increase as you move on up... but the points needed per gun almost quadruple. So it makes playing fairly hard to do. Also you cannot earn any points through the ranges, I do not suggest unlocking them unless you really like the guns your using alot. Plus its just challenges and not free shooting; you also cannot repeat the challenges once you finish. The graphics for the range also take a plunk, going to CS 1.6 esque graphics. AKA Crappy world textures and okay gun textures.There is also another few ways to unlock points (two of them broken for me, reinstalling to see if it fixes it for me).First is coming back every day. Don't laugh you get a points bonus for coming back so many days in a row; even if you only pop in the grab that bonus. But make sure you come back every day or it'll reset.Next method is by joining the group and inviting freinds. I managed to join the group... but now it won't let me invite freinds because the button for it does not function. I have even used the other method in game and it still doesn't work. but this gives you some credits and a ton of XP to use on unlocking guns. But, I can't use it because it's broken.Last method is the quiz (which has a high failure rate for me... figures)Quizes test your ability to recognize the gun models, the more you get right is the more XP you get to walk away with. Get one wrong though and you lose your shot and get locked out for 2 hours.The funniest thing about the quiz not working for me is that it will go through just fine, but it will basically not give me the button to collect my points. It will however (even though I got all the questions right) lock me out for 2 hours. Its interesting to note that is registers me as unable to take another quiz... but yet I get none of my earned points. It only occasionally gives me my points for the quiz, if not... it basically locks the game up because it doesn't give me the button. CRAZIEST THING IS... If I fail the quiz, it doesn't crash at all. I feel like they're trying to keep me from getting points... Cheeki ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.Anyways I'm reinstalling, still voting positive for this game. Even though its got a bunch of Cheeki Breeki coders.			"

												This is the perfect tool for anyone who is obsessed with weaponry. Firearms of all shapes and sizes are field stripped or fully stripped to your heart's content. The ability to cut away part of the weapon as you observe the firing mechanism and various attachments available for each individual weapon, with the option of multiple slow motion speeds and x-ray images, each highlighting different working parts, is mind blowing. You strip every last bolt and it is invaluable in teaching you how to safely strip and reassemble a wide variety of weapons and other objects, such as the Delorean, for a price. With the option to compete against other players around the world to see who can strip and reassemble the weapon in the fastest time, this game is awesome in every way. Specs and pics for each individual weapon is available, with links to websites for further information. I deem this game Worthy.			"

												World of Guns: Gun Disassembly is a very good game for killing time, and learning about the guns and other things (Such as Skeletons and other goodies) that the game has to offer. While people complain about grinding, you can test your gun knowledge with a Quiz, that shows you images of guns by their silhouettes and asks you to identify the model. At a decent rate of 300 XP per correct answer, it's a good way to get experience.There are undoubtedly microtransactions in the game, though they're really quite unobtrusive. Credits, Experience, and other little packs can be bought to help the developers and get yourself a few new things as well. People in their reviews are complaining about the need to reassemble and disassemble the same gun to progress, however at this point in time I've not had to do that. The game itself offers login bonuses, in addition to the hourly test, that helps progression.Overall, it's an interesting little program that lets you assemble, disassemble, and operate weapons as slow or fast as you want to, with new weapon models being added every couple months. For a free game, it's really quite a bargain, as there's a way to get mostly everything without needing to buy so-and-so microtrasnaction. I enjoy it, and would recommend it to anyone who has a passion for guns.			"

												I would like to make clear that I only got the free version of this game so my experience related within this review can only be based upon the free version and none of the paid versions of the game.Four words desricbe this game...""Gun tummy bannana rub"" (I could do it in less words, but not here) 3.5 stars for the free version, the need to be super awesome or pay money to get more weps to strip is why I rate it down a bit ... Other than that I enjoyed my gun tummy bannana rub. Mainly because I have stripped and re-assembled various models of the AK-47 and M1911 and put them back together lots as a child. MODELS! not real ones!The ingenuity of the mechanisms in guns has always astonished me. This game shows all that engineering genius in the simplicity of the working parts in reasonably good detail, static and functioning. There is also a shooting range that is unlockable through experience earned or bought.One gripe from me, is that some pieces would not let me dissasemble them before I took apart another unrelated piece.There was no logical reason why I could not remove that part. This has happened in both the first two weapons and makes playing the super game mode more a ""Learn what order your taught to do it"" rather than "" I got a screwdriver and there is a screw, I should be able to take it out now"" You are then left with the looming fact that unless you learn those first 3 guns inside out and the correct order to do EVERYTHING you are going to have to pay money to get more guns.Oh, there is a ""Bonus"" part where you can dissasemble a human skeleton......... in a gun game ? What? ... well,  I done it anyway and put it back together again hoping to get enough experience to unlock something .. but no, it was not to be. 300XP didn't put a dent the 5000XP I needed for the next gun. There are other Skeletons...There are cars.As that last bit was totally confusing, we are just going to move on with the gun stuff.The question is , how much do you like guns? the first is an AK-47 and then a M1911. These weapons are a pleasure to strip and put back together (for me anyways) I do have a personal favourite that I am tempted to get,,, it looks like it will cost me a fiver though :( For me, I personally would really only get enjoyment out of weapons I am familair with.Last words are this,Try it, its actually educational and seeing the brutal simplicity of a death dealing tool in action is quite something.

												This is a great game (even the comments are fun to read, especially Linkno1's). Personally, and this is probably just me... I think everyone should learn about guns, that way they wouldn't be such p*ssies when it came to owning and handling one. This game is a great first step in LEARNING about guns. Practice, of coarse, is a whole different story. My Wife and I both enjoy this game, because it's like a puzzle game combined with the game of Memory, combined with things that can kill and maim. What's not to like? And, for the record, my Wife didn't want guns in the house until I took her to the shooting range. Now she thinks she's Rambo. It's quite sexy (now, if I can just get her to wear a bikini when we go...). The only down-side is that when we argue, she swears she's gonna go ""Tarantino on my ♥♥♥"". I usually have to remind her that he often uses Mexican stand-off's in his films, which means that she wouldn't make it out alive either. Her response is ""I don't care! I didn't bring you in this world... but I will take you out!"" She's so cute.Anyway, If you want a chance at survival in dangerous situations this game is a good starting point in LEARNING about the tools you'll need (minus the tanks and rocket launchers... unless that's your thing... I'm not one to judge). If you want to be a scared victim, learn how to use the phone to call the cops, and die waiting for them. Although, I don't think there's a game for that... mainly because GUNS ARE COOL AND EVERYONE LOVES SHOOTING THINGS AND BLOWING THINGS UP! But I digress... if there is a game like that, it's probably British.AUTHOR'S NOTE: Before anyone gets upset at me for my last comment I just want to point out that shooting a home-invader in the face with a gun is a whole lot quicker than beating him/her about the head and shoulders with a cricket bat (although ""ye ole willow wood"" has less moving parts). Also, keep in mind that criminals don't care about gun laws. Come to think of it, they may not care about cricket rules either... I don't know... maybe try this game bundled with Don Bradman Cricket 14, or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive bundled with Cricket Revolution. Regardless, I recommend this game.			"

												Not quite my definition of a ""Game"". More an educational simulator. It is a ""Free-to-play"" game in the sense that it comes with the nowadays standard (as much as it makes me want to stab someone with a rusty butterknife realising that) psychological warfare that is ""microtransactions"". For advance unlocks, ""Credits"", ""Experience Boosters"", etc.And the game is not without its problems:Some components you have to arbitrarily disassemble yourself, even when others do so automatically, which is an ""inconsistency of the rules"" I consider a crime.Additionally, some components that you'd assume could be removed or (dis)assembled without interference from other components (example, taking off a muzzle/compensator/suppressor thinking the front sight won't be a holdup), THINK AGAIN, you're doing it their way or not at all! Which is a rather irksome issue. Common sense says that such steps should be performable interchangeably. This is plainly evident with the AK-47's accessory case in the stock, were that step a requirement to proceed, I might think differently, but you can dissassemble everything BUT the stock without any restriction, not only implying that you already have tools on hand, but that the restriction has ZERO reason to be there! And that's from the *first* gun you work on.Each gun comes with its own array of ""Achievements"" you unlock towards a massive XP (which is used to unlock more guns) stipend at the end. However there are no less than two such achievements that rely on leaderboard placement. Which is equal parts skill, luck, and psychosis. (Guys, AXE THOSE ACHIEVEMENTS!)This issue is exasperated by the fact that some components take half-an-iceage to extricate or disassemble themselves.And lastly there is a small ""quiz"" minigame you can take every hour that tests your ability to identify certain firearms. Problems being that you only get the thumbnail from the gun ""map"" to go off of, so similar looking models are easily mistaken for eachother (I'm looking at YOU, Walther PP and Makarov PM!). And on top of that, when you get ONE wrong answer, all the experience you've built up (and it builds up quickly, which is nice, and sort of alleviates some of the aforementioned psych-warfare) is GONE. And the only way to get a question wrong and make off with the points is to let the 30 second timer run down.When you make a wrong answer, it tells you what the right answer was (after a short delay, which may confuse some), but when the timer runs out (whether by choice or simple lack of time), you leave with all accumulated points. Which may be interpreted as a tradeoff, you make a wrong response, you lose all points, but are told what the correct answer was, you let the timer run down, you keep all your points, but you are left in the dark on the last model. Which is especially frustrating when it (again) looks extremely similar to one or two other models. So, in short, make a judgement call: are you willing to lose all those points you've earned on a guess, or did you just start and have (almost) none to lose?Overall, I think this game can do a whole lot more in terms of educating (Example: What the hell is a sear? I've never heard of one until now!), it is nothing short of fascinating to see the internal workings of quality, classic, and iconic firearms. If you like guns, learning about them [not only do you get to (dis)assemble them, but each one has a comprehensive encyclopedia interface, complete with wiki links!], or are just curious about the internal workings of said guns, I give this game a (tentative) recommendation.

												You can hardly call World of Guns: Gun Disassembly a game but it's something that every person who has some interest in guns, should have at home. I do not understand all the hate coming from people who do not understand the concept of the project. It's a perfect way to learn about guns, how they work and how to assemble/disassemble them. Probably, that is why they offer people a free demo to see how it works. If you do not understand something, it does not mean it's bad.			"

												If you like guns, or just like mechanical master-pieces, then this is the game for you. This game will teach you a indepth demonstration of: How to disassemble guns, how to reassemble guns, what all the gun part's names are and how the internals operate and function. There is a firing range for some of the firearms, and also a leaderboard system for if you have a competitive side or possibly just want to see what others have gotten for time wise. There is also a different section of other things such as: Bones, cars and AFVs. When I first tried this game I thought that since its free, it would be sh*t, but after only a few minutes of playing I found that it actualy is a very good simulator/teaching tool. This game has been very beneficial to me, in helping me understand everything about guns and all kinds of different guns, for when I fully enter my career and now have a huge leg-up. I also have now started designing and thinking about making proto-types of firearms of my own design. Overall I would strongly recommend this game, and will actively play this game for a long time to come.			"

												It was good timing I downloaded this just before Independence Day! I am sure I will never pay anything for packs and stuff, I am not a big gun fan, but it is real fun to dissemble and assemble guns. BUT now that all US guns are free I feel the problem with this game.1. It is too slow. I played with the minigun and it is very boring to dissemble it.2. The music is looping. All the time. It is a good music, but it gets old fast.3. It is not for me at all. I have fun with it from time to time but if not for the ""all american guns"" are free I am sure I would never unlock most of the content.4. smaller components have really ♥♥♥♥ graphics. Most of the guns look realistic enough from the outside but lot of small components doesn't even have texture and that is a shame.So this was really a good timing for me, this way I can play around with lot of guns then forget the whole stuff. I would be angry if I payed anything for this, but this way it is a fun game with lot of content, it is just not for me.For real gun fans this could be a very good game though.			"

												Very interesting game!It's free, so there's absolutely no reason for anybody to not try it - obviously, yeah, you can buy things in-game with real money, but it's not necessary unless you want to unlock more things/get more EXP faster (which, again - without paying a dime, you get a ton of content, so it's not necessary).If you're interested in guns at all, even just a little bit, then this game is for you.  The graphics, while not necessarily impressive, are nice, and the ""Operation"" mode is just outstanding.  Every working part of the gun is shown to you - be it in varying levels of X-ray mode, and/or in slow motion, you can see how a gun operates from the inside out.  This isn't just limited to one weapon, either - every gun you unlock, you can watch how all of the parts interact to fire a bullet.As well, the disassembly/assembly modes are pretty cool, and the ""game"" and ""super game"", and ""hardcore game"" modes are really fun.  You're not just racing the clock or grinding for EXP, you're learning how a gun is constructed at the same time.  I've field stripped a Colt 1911 in real life before, and this game has it down to a T.  I haven't fully disassembled one before, but I'm assuming they got that right, as well.All in all, really fun, sort of niche game that you should definitely go for.  It takes about 10 minutes to install, and is literally an educational time waster (for free!).			"

The best way to understand something is to take it apart and put it back together! The only way I see people not likeing this is if they loth grinding experience, which isn't so hard to get, or if they don't like point/click mechanic in the game. It's neat though, and a great way to educate yourself about guns. (They add more every so often too.) Free game, awesome game.			"

												This game is essentially a facebook game, and it will probably only appeal to a select few. It's like a memory game with guns, with some sexy firing animations to break up the monotony. There is a lot of grinding, but most of it can be avoided by simply mastering the hourly quizes which will net roughly 1/3rd of the experience required for the best gun each time you take one. The best thing this game has going for it is the developers, who are probably some of the most active I've seen for any game. Just look at the Steam community forums, they respond to pretty much everything.I would love to see camera hotkeys similar to Starcraft where you set hotkeys to a predetermined camera state and more historical guns (let's face it most of the polymer pistols feel the same).

												This is one of the most dangerous time sinks I have run into since Minecraft. I managed to unlock the Colt 1911, the MP5 and the Intratec Tec-9.  After a few hours turning them around seeing how everything works I went for the DLC with the unlimited guns. The M-16 A1 model brought back not-so-fond memories of skinning my knuckles trying to pull out the handguards. I also noticed that the o-rings in the bolt are stacked exactly like in real life, it's obvious that these models went through an insane amount of scrutiny. What's good:1. You get to see how most of everything inside works.2. You get to fire the weapons.What's not so good:1. The full weapons unlock should allow hiding all new guns and click to show/hide guns as needed so it is not so damn hard to navigate. It is overwhelming when you see all of the guns up to date displayed in one shot.2. I wish I could use my controller in the shooting games.3. The game doesn't explain things, it just walks you through. And sometimes the safeties can't be engaged by clicking on the weapon, you have to click a menu button.4. Sometimes the fire selectors don't allow all positions, so you are also stuck using a menu button to select fire modes.5. The only adjustable sight post that moves at all so far is the AK-47. The M16-A1s front post doesn't turn, unless I am doing something wrong. 6. Some weapons should allow movement of the hammer but the model only allows to pull back the slide. Wish list for the developers:1. Allow show/hide of items already purchased/unlocked/etc. 2. Allow a visualization of the return mechanism, for example the M16-A1 should show me the gas blow back, etc.3. Allow sights to move if/when the originals do. 4. Explain a little bit more of what's going on. 5. All safeties, fire selectors, de-cocking levers, etc. should be movable from the model, not from menu buttons. BTW, hats off to the parties responsible for the game mode achievement for doing things in the right order. It's frustrating as hell, but these being dangerous machines it makes sense to force people to learn an assembly sequence. I have been busting my ♥♥♥ for two long miserable days trying to do the Colt 1911 in order and I keep screwing up because I pick the main spring out of sequence or I click the recoil spring plug when I wanted to click on the recoil spring, that kind of thing. Overall:A complete absolute win for anyone that is curious about how machines work. The first time you dig into that AK-47 and you figure out on your own why the auto mode works, you'll feel like a rocket scientist.			"

												This is a great game (even the comments are fun to read, especially Linkno1's). Personally, and this is probably just me... I think everyone should learn about guns, that way they wouldn't be such p*ssies when it came to owning and handling one. This game is a great first step in LEARNING about guns. Practice, of coarse, is a whole different story. My Wife and I both enjoy this game, because it's like a puzzle game combined with the game of Memory, combined with things that can kill and maim. What's not to like? And, for the record, my Wife didn't want guns in the house until I took her to the shooting range. Now she thinks she's Rambo. It's quite sexy (now, if I can just get her to wear a bikini when we go...). The only down-side is that when we argue, she swears she's gonna go ""Tarantino on my ♥♥♥"". I usually have to remind her that he often uses Mexican stand-off's in his films, which means that she wouldn't make it out alive either. Her response is ""I don't care! I didn't bring you in this world... but I will take you out!"" She's so cute.Anyway, If you want a chance at survival in dangerous situations this game is a good starting point in LEARNING about the tools you'll need (minus the tanks and rocket launchers... unless that's your thing... I'm not one to judge). If you want to be a scared victim, learn how to use the phone to call the cops, and die waiting for them. Although, I don't think there's a game for that... mainly because GUNS ARE COOL AND EVERYONE LOVES SHOOTING THINGS AND BLOWING THINGS UP! But I digress... if there is a game like that, it's probably British.AUTHOR'S NOTE: Before anyone gets upset at me for my last comment I just want to point out that shooting a home-invader in the face with a gun is a whole lot quicker than beating him/her about the head and shoulders with a cricket bat (although ""ye ole willow wood"" has less moving parts). Also, keep in mind that criminals don't care about gun laws. Come to think of it, they may not care about cricket rules either... I don't know... maybe try this game bundled with Don Bradman Cricket 14, or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive bundled with Cricket Revolution. Regardless, I recommend this game.			"

												The game ""World of Guns: Gun Disassembly"" is exactly as it sounds. The whole game revolves around guns, but not only disassembling them, but also re-assembling them, checking and firing them, seeing how they work, shooting them on ranges, and you can also play 3 different types of assembly games. The first is basically to see how fast you can disassemble, then reassemble the gun. The second is the same, but there are no hints to whether or not the piece you select is one that can be removed at that moment, and if it turns out to be an immovable (unactivatable) piece (this is found out by clicking it twice, once to highlight, and twice to ""activate"" it, which is basically removing or re-adding it), you lose and you have to start ALL over again. The final one is like the first except you can move multiple pieces at once so you time can be even faster. The game can be pretty intruiging and educational about guns, but it's pretty repetative. By completeing achievements and games, you gain experience points which can be used to unlock ranges or new guns, and as you progress, the experience needed increases by the thousands meaning you have to repetatively disassemble and re-assemble guns, or play the games. Still, it's free to play, so I'd download it for the amusement factor. It's actually kinda educational.			"

												An in depth game showing how to disassemble, assemble, and operate many guns. There are fun options such as the x-ray view on a gun that allows you to see in depth (sort of) how the inside mechanics of a gun works. For free, if you play for a couple hours, you get full access to the ak-47, and a few pistols. However, this game will most likely feel incomplete if you don't pay real $ to unlock several of the expensive guns. Purchasing at least the $10 gun pack, which is what I did, gives you close to a complete experience of the game, so there's no need to buy the $50-60 ""full game"" option, unless you really, really like this game.

												So let me break it down. World of guns: Gun Disassembly is a unique 'game' if I've ever seen one.You start off with a classic Kalashnikova and work your way up to a colt, not much of a spoiler there. but yeah.The game is all about unlocking things; Field strip your gun to unlock dissasembly, dissasembly your gun to unlock reassembly... Assemble to operation, operation to game, game to super game and super game to hardcore game. You can geuss what the first three are; Operation is using the various features on a gun, changing handgrips, firing it, attaching a silencer or even folding a stock. The games however are a test to see your memory of how to put a gun together, you get bonus points and kudos if you manage to do it without touching the wrong part or taking a hint. On super game and up its instant failure to touch the wrong part and there is no hints.You might be thinking ""okay thats easy"" well... I've spent a bit of time getting raged at a gun for getting one peice wrong or forgetting what came first. A few times the game screws you over by saying ""YOU NEED TO DO THIS FIRST"" even though there are other points where you do the same thing and the game lets you.Example: You need to attach two rods to a plate and put the springs back on. One gun lets you put a rod and then the string on before having to deal with the second rod. But this particular gun needs both to be on.Its a bit annoying when some guns let you do it and doing it for real lets you do it.On the graphics end of it. The outside of the gun, looks awesome. 10/10 texturing. On the inside though... many parts have 'brush' texturing. This means that they are all are very basic tons of grey and black. Honestly they're just shaped blocks at that point, a mere representative. No complaint unless your obbscessed with HD textures.On the of the guns themselfves. TONS of variety. I find quite a few guns I like in their collection, however... I need to sift through alot of guns I don't cary about at all just to get to them. Sure you can buy the starter pack or the full unlock... but whats the fun of that? Well, i'll tell you: total access. Unless you got alot of time and patience, you won't get through this game without paying. Because the awarded points for working with a single gun almost never total enough to unlock a new one. Sure the points increase as you move on up... but the points needed per gun almost quadruple. So it makes playing fairly hard to do. Also you cannot earn any points through the ranges, I do not suggest unlocking them unless you really like the guns your using alot. Plus its just challenges and not free shooting; you also cannot repeat the challenges once you finish. The graphics for the range also take a plunk, going to CS 1.6 esque graphics. AKA Crappy world textures and okay gun textures.There is also another few ways to unlock points (two of them broken for me, reinstalling to see if it fixes it for me).First is coming back every day. Don't laugh you get a points bonus for coming back so many days in a row; even if you only pop in the grab that bonus. But make sure you come back every day or it'll reset.Next method is by joining the group and inviting freinds. I managed to join the group... but now it won't let me invite freinds because the button for it does not function. I have even used the other method in game and it still doesn't work. but this gives you some credits and a ton of XP to use on unlocking guns. But, I can't use it because it's broken.Last method is the quiz (which has a high failure rate for me... figures)Quizes test your ability to recognize the gun models, the more you get right is the more XP you get to walk away with. Get one wrong though and you lose your shot and get locked out for 2 hours.The funniest thing about the quiz not working for me is that it will go through just fine, but it will basically not give me the button to collect my points. It will however (even though I got all the questions right) lock me out for 2 hours. Its interesting to note that is registers me as unable to take another quiz... but yet I get none of my earned points. It only occasionally gives me my points for the quiz, if not... it basically locks the game up because it doesn't give me the button. CRAZIEST THING IS... If I fail the quiz, it doesn't crash at all.

												Enjoyable game if you're either a gun enthusaist or a puzzle fan. It's fun and quite educational, and this concept of virtually disassembling and assembling something again is great for learning the parts of anything basically. (There are also quite cheap DLCs for other things, like cars and skeleteons.)One of my favourite parts is the x-ray and slow-mo, because it really does help in further understanding the mechanics of the guns. For people that are not that interested in guns and only like the puzzle aspect can test their memory in various game modes. There's even an actual shooting range! It could be improved, but it's still pretty cool.For someone who's into guns because of video games like me, this game has helped me learn a lot about my favourite guns. There's a section for every gun where the game explains it's origin and history and everything. Overall, great game. They're always adding new guns, and I really do hope this game expands to other things.			"

												This is the perfect tool for anyone who is obsessed with weaponry. Firearms of all shapes and sizes are field stripped or fully stripped to your heart's content. The ability to cut away part of the weapon as you observe the firing mechanism and various attachments available for each individual weapon, with the option of multiple slow motion speeds and x-ray images, each highlighting different working parts, is mind blowing. You strip every last bolt and it is invaluable in teaching you how to safely strip and reassemble a wide variety of weapons and other objects, such as the Delorean, for a price. With the option to compete against other players around the world to see who can strip and reassemble the weapon in the fastest time, this game is awesome in every way. Specs and pics for each individual weapon is available, with links to websites for further information. I deem this game Worthy.			"

												World of Guns: Gun Disassembly is a very good game for killing time, and learning about the guns and other things (Such as Skeletons and other goodies) that the game has to offer. While people complain about grinding, you can test your gun knowledge with a Quiz, that shows you images of guns by their silhouettes and asks you to identify the model. At a decent rate of 300 XP per correct answer, it's a good way to get experience.There are undoubtedly microtransactions in the game, though they're really quite unobtrusive. Credits, Experience, and other little packs can be bought to help the developers and get yourself a few new things as well. People in their reviews are complaining about the need to reassemble and disassemble the same gun to progress, however at this point in time I've not had to do that. The game itself offers login bonuses, in addition to the hourly test, that helps progression.Overall, it's an interesting little program that lets you assemble, disassemble, and operate weapons as slow or fast as you want to, with new weapon models being added every couple months. For a free game, it's really quite a bargain, as there's a way to get mostly everything without needing to buy so-and-so microtrasnaction. I enjoy it, and would recommend it to anyone who has a passion for guns.			"

												It's an interesting game and it can teach you a lot about the architexture of guns, but for those who are interested in it more for being a 3D Dictionary of Guns and Gun parts, this is a Moneygrab and too big a time-waster. Pros: Unlockable, very detailed assortment of Guns for your viewing pleasure and curiousity, has features of a game.Cons: The list of guns isn't all that big.It takes too much time to unlock all guns/models if you just want to look at a specific gun.Game offers expensive moneygrab DLC, which doesn't unlock certain features/models.Game doesn't let you play offline.Conclusion: Too cumbersome to be of immediate use for the itch of Gun curiousity.It's more for mobile twits despite being on the PC platform.

												A great game to those who like guns and want to learn more about how they work. Good graphics, good gameplay, with lots of detail, different modes, tasks, objectives to make you train like a maniac to get the best times and to find increasingly efficient ways to take apart and reassemble a gun. Also provides you with historical information about the guns and specifications, complete with a photo collection.Good community, with devs that interact closely with the players to get feedback and to keep adding new content and making the existing one stay stable through bug correction.Overall, if you like guns you should try this game, if you just want to learn more about guns, fill your free time for fun, or if you want to try and beat the times of players all over the world, or maybe all of these, this is a game that's not going to let you down!

												If you like guns this game is fun, addictive, and educational (and if you aren't trying to play for score, throw some music on, it's pretty relaxing). It's really interesting to see the differences and similarities between various designs from different ages and cultures--I have a newfound respect for Russian guns and a newfound hatred for German guns (why use two parts to do a job when you can use eighteen parts to do the same thing instead!), being able to trace design elements on the Desert Eagle back to the Jericho and then the CZ-75, how Ruger's copy of the Colt SAA is in many ways more complicated, etc. All of this is pretty interesting to me.But then again I'm a nerd about these things. I like the ""operation"" mode too, where you can see how the gun functions using varying levels of transparency and slow motion. It's all fantastically polished, especially being free to play.Not perfect though. As another reviewer mentioned, while the game requires you to remove and install parts in the proper order and shows animations of the various screws and pins, it leaves something to be desired as far as the actual method goes-- there's a difference between clicking on a 1911's recoil spring vs. slipping and sending the spring and plug across the room when you turn the barrel bushing, for example. So in its current form the educational aspects are limited, but I see a lot of potential there.All in all, though, it's a heck of a lotta fun.			"

												World of Guns is a free to play simulation that will appeal to two groups of people; those who already have knowledge of firearms and those who want to learn more about firearms. The game succeeds in making even something as dry as field stripping a firearm into a puzzle/memory game. The guns are finely detailed right down to individual screws that hold these mechanical marvels together. You start by field stripping a gun into its major components. As you progress you unlock further modes such as disassembly and assembly. Disassembly tasks you with taking down a given firearm into each of its individual parts. Assembly of course is putting it all back together. This then unlocks operation mode where you can then cycle between various levels of x-ray and cutaway views to see the gun in action. Its really quite something to see the internal mechanisms work. Finally there are game and super game modes. In game you simply try to disassemble and reassemble the firearm as fast as possible. In super game (hardcore) mode you have to meticulously disassemble and reassemble the firearm in the proper order otherwise you face failure and have to repeat it all over from the beginning. Of course this is repetitive but it is the kind of repetition that builds familiarity with that firearm. Its this cycle of repetition and learning that ultimately proves to be rewarding. However it can be frustrating in that you can fail in this mode for doing something in what the game perceives to be the wrong order yet would be still just fine if you were doing the same task in reality with the actual firearm.As you complete these game modes and various achievements you earn experience that can be used to unlock the next firearm. When the game first launched the prices were over priced. But looking through the shop now I think they have dropped prices on content considerably. This game has great potential to build upon with a new model promised every month. The game also allows you to disassemble and reassemble skeletons as well as vehicles.If you have a passion for firearms or want to learn more about how guns operate and how they have evolved; this game is certainly worth a look.

												When I first started playing this game, which I found by accident, I thought it was a bit too annoying for my taste, but once you start remembering all the parts for individual weapons, you feel some sort of accomplishment when you correctly complete a gun with 70+ parts without mistakes within a certain time.If you get this game, (It's free so why wouldn't you?), you will need to take into account that you cannot expect to complete this overnight (unless you pay £30 for the full unlocks). You could complete 3 or 4 weapons within the first day, but after that the exp costs of weapons starts to rise, and as repeating games nets you only 10% of the exp, you will have to count on gaining most exp through quiz's (every two hours) and daily rewards.Some bad things about this game would be you require 10 friends who play to unlock shooting ranges, invite 5 friends who don't play and get them to play the game for an achievement and exp. And that's really it.			"

Quite well made, though with a few spelling errors that show whoever wrote the tutorials surely didn't have English as their first language.... But then, neither do I, so I'll let it slide. Now, onto the actual review!As mentioned before, the ""game"" is for gun enthusiasts. There's no plot. There's no story. There are no characters. You disassemble, study, and assemble a gun. I have no expertise in the area, but I would say the guns are extremely realistic and spot on. There's really nothing more to say about it.I recommend it solely on the basis it does what it sets out to do, and doesn't promise more than it does.			"

												If you like guns this game is fun, addictive, and educational (and if you aren't trying to play for score, throw some music on, it's pretty relaxing). It's really interesting to see the differences and similarities between various designs from different ages and cultures--I have a newfound respect for Russian guns and a newfound hatred for German guns (why use two parts to do a job when you can use eighteen parts to do the same thing instead!), being able to trace design elements on the Desert Eagle back to the Jericho and then the CZ-75, how Ruger's copy of the Colt SAA is in many ways more complicated, etc. All of this is pretty interesting to me.But then again I'm a nerd about these things. I like the ""operation"" mode too, where you can see how the gun functions using varying levels of transparency and slow motion. It's all fantastically polished, especially being free to play.Not perfect though. As another reviewer mentioned, while the game requires you to remove and install parts in the proper order and shows animations of the various screws and pins, it leaves something to be desired as far as the actual method goes-- there's a difference between clicking on a 1911's recoil spring vs. slipping and sending the spring and plug across the room when you turn the barrel bushing, for example. So in its current form the educational aspects are limited, but I see a lot of potential there.All in all, though, it's a heck of a lotta fun.			"

												Do you like CS:GO? Do you like guns? Would you like to get up close and personal with all your favourites like the Desert Eagle, AK-47, M4-A4, Tec-9 and so much more? Then this is well and truly the game for you! With so many great weapons and other models to assemble, disassemble and see in action this game is both educational and a much better way to learn and experience guns and other models than in other games. Another amazing feature of this game is that it will actually show you how the parts work together to fire the gun so that you learn how they are opperated! Not sold yet? The game promises to add a new model every month! Puzzle education has never been so fun!			"

About The Game:Gun Disassembly isn't really a game, it's more of an interactive tool in which someone who is a ""Firearms Enthusiast"" (such as myself) or perhaps just has an interest in firearms can learn about different types of firearms, learn how they work, learn the ins and outs of each firearm, how to take them apart for maintenance etc. This tool is also avalible on mobile devices but it is certainly nice to have it avalible on the PC to enjoy in very high definition and also on a large screen.What's it About?:Well it's what it says on the Store Page it's all about Firearms if you're interested in learning how they work, what parts are inside the firearm or learn how to take apart and put them back together (perhaps for work, perhaps for cleaning or perhaps just because you're interested in learning about them.) then this is the tool for you!It allows you to learn all about firearms in a intereactive and very detailed game which allows you to take apart a firearm of your choice.The Verdict:Unlike any of my normal reviews there's not a great deal i can say about this as it's really not a game, there's no scores i can give for ""graphics"" or for ""level design"" etc this is just as it is a tool which allows the user to take apart firearms and learn how they work.If you're like me and are enthusiastic about Firearms and want to learn about how they work & operate then this is for you there's nothing more i can say, it's free and has a very large selection of firearms to choose from and learn with.Do i Recommend This?:Yes i do and i have no reason not to as it's free, if you're like me and love Firearms then this is something you should add to your Steam library.

												This game is surprisingly well thought out.   The operations mode needs to demonstrate the collider relationships on the safety mechanisms that prevent firing, but otherwise it's incredibly good.I like the integration with the other games by the company, but they need to use each game's specific achievement names.  (This is probably going to be added in later versions, as it looks like something they just haven't gotten around to yet.)There is also currently a lack of certain setting features, such as keybindings, camera axis control reversals and resolution control.  However, this is a minor detraction, and likely will be in future versions.			"

												A great simulator due to the users control over the disassembly, although it does feel very ""p(l)ay-to-win"".  As the game title says, the disassembly of the guns themselves is damn near perfect for a computer simulation, only missing small things, like the pressure to apply on certain pins, for example.  The quantity of props is also astonishing, even if it mostly includes military guns and vehicles (apart from some other extra props, like the skeletons).  Still with all of this, the game could benefit with removing some interesting and fun leveling up moments, while making every model available from the start, since people might want to use this as a tool to help them with cleaning or troubleshooting their firearms.  All and all, highly recomend!  It's free, easy to use, and truly fun and addicting at times.			"

												Many gamers are running around and shooting with all kind of weapons. World of Guns: Gun Disassembly is all about real world weapons. It is not a violent game. Main part of the game is about disassembling and assembling your gun. There are a lot of different weapons, some with few and some with many parts, and about each month there is released a new one. You can play this free game the way you like. When you are only interested in how to dismantle your weapon, go ahead. Want to know how it works? Use slow motion and cutaway views. But you can also play on time and try to beat the daily number 1 or try to get a place in the top 100. It's all up the you. Disassembling and assembling and operating your weapon is giving you experience points, with which you can unlock new guns. When preferred you can buy the game (not a cheap game, but this week 50% off!), which unlocks all weapons at once. Or you can buy parts of the game like e.g. WW2 weapons. The free game takes longer to collect the needed points for unlocking a new weapon but there are no other restrictions. So why not give it a try! As for me, it's a fun game to play and I can really recommend it. For a free game I give it a 9 out of 10.			"

Try your luck at taking apart famous guns as fast as you can and without making mistakes for more experience points so you can get more guns and test them out. The interface is simple and easy to use, and the level of detail is mind blowing. The only downside is you might have to grind for more experience points because after getting it the first time you get only 10% of them for the next time after. But hey, practice makes perfect.

												World of Guns reminds me a lot of World of Tanks in its ''ranking system''. And when I say that it reminds me of World of Tanks, I mean that I don't like it one bit.In this game you start off with the original ''bad guy gun'', also known as the Avtomat Kalashnikov 47 (AK-47). You have to learn step-by-step how to assemble and disassemble the gun very carefully and as fast as possible to unlock achievements and score the highest scores. However, to unlock a new weapon, you need to earn a lot of experience. For example, unlocking the gun after the AK-47, the Colt M1911, is a piece of cake because it only asks for 2000 experience points that you can easily unlock right after completing most of the challenges on the Kalashnikov, however, after the Colt, the experience cost dramatically rises to 5000 and then keeps getting higher and higher.With this massive experience cost, the game's grind rises dramatically which turns most of the players away from the game, seeking an easier alternative. The easiest alternative in the game, however, is to open your wallet and pay up. Yes, that's right, to unlock all of the guns, you can simply pay for DLCs. Pay-to-win, anyone?If you seek an enjoyable game in which you want to access all the sweet, juicy firearms and assemble/disassemble them all, test them and stuff, then this is not the game for you. Please wait for a better alternative.			"

												This a free to play puzzle / memory / edutainment game involving dissassembly and assembly of guns and shooting those guns.  You start with the AK-47 rifle, then you unlock Colt 1911 pistol quickly,  with 3,000 xp you can unlock HK MP5, might be a few more you can do for free.  The store sells DLC packs with a lot more guns, cars, motorcycles, skeletons, and xp buffs so it is Pay to Progress.  If you get five friends on Steam to play game, you can earn 20,000 xp and 20 credits.  There is shooting ranges you can unlock for firing those guns, i guess there is games and achievements you can do at each shooting range.  There is a leaderboard for your times and scores versus other players.  There is games involving dissassembly and assembly of guns.  You can operate those guns while using modes: x-ray, cutaway, slow motion, rotating. Has Steam achievements, few which are easy to obtain, many requiring paying real money.The camera movement is clunky and can get in the way on timed dissassembly and assembly of guns.Try it, you might learn something. Great for those gun toting NRA members.for more info:

												World of Guns: Disassembly is a game where you have to basically dissect a weapon. As doing so, you can learn a lot about guns in the process. You can take guns apart, label the names to show what the part does, then re-assembly the weapon. I hardly know anything about guns. In the near future, I may learn a lot more about how a gun works. Strong recommendation.Super fast download!			"

												World of Guns is a great game if you just want to kill a couple of minutes at a time, but it can still hold up extended sessions too. It's very interesting to see the workings of all the models without having to own them and get a reputation as a murderous lunatic. That, and actually since you can hide parts and slow down time while watching the weapons operate, it gives some insights into the gun that most people wouldn't be able to uncover with equipment they have at home even if they owned it.The biggest problem for me is that the game is ever so slightly skittish on the virtual currency and clearly tries to goad the player into forking out some cash. This would be no problem otherwise, but I don't want to buy the exp straight out as it's the pacing that keeps the game interesting, nor do I want to unlock weapons directly, for the same reason. The boosters are cheaply done; they only last an hour and are much too expensive. The only real incentive to spend money I see here is stickers and other cosmetics for the guns, which I'm not all that interested in. In fact I find the ability to customize the guns with bright colors, animal prints and stick-on pictures a bit tacky.Something I could see myself pay for would be a premium version where I can take apart all the weapon accessories I normally only get to see attached in operation mode. The differences between skeleton, wooden and synthetic stocks could be interesting, for example. Or maybe being able to operate weapons with parts taken off (and getting to see malfunctions, dry fire, etc). For the right price I could pay for these features even gun by gun.			"

												Interesting ""game"" if you are into guns or curious about how they work.   However you kind of hit a wall if you don't have friends.    This game feels very much like it should be on facebook.   You are limited to only a few guns untill you get enough EXP to unlock more.   This means replaying the same 3 guns over and over untill you have enough EXP, or you purchase unlocks or EXP with Cash. "

												Cons:Firing any weapon requires a facebook friend-unlock system (# of friends owning the game. They only need to download it).The challenges and EXP all bottom out by the time you reach the Sten or the Jericho; you're forced to pay or grind afterwards.Although a rare occurence, there are a few assemblies that are arbitrarily ordered and confusing.Pros:Gun porn and the ability to tinker with guns that you don't have (yet).Overall:Play until you reach the Sig 550 or Jericho; this is the absolute limit where the EXP system bottoms out. Any further, and the game requires money or several wasted hours of your time on the other assembly series. Besides that, it is definitely an enjoyable puzzle/educational game.			"

												The amount of grinding this game requires is unsurpassed by any other. Yes the game is pretty awesome and educational, but consider the ""free to play"" version as a demo and use it as a reference as to whether or not to buy it. I have 2.1 hours on this game as a write this and I've just only unlocked the third weapon. That says a lot considering it only takes 5 minutes to disassemble and reassemble a gun. You also don't get to choose (ok maybe you do but between 2?) which gun to disassemble next. It would be much more entertaining if I could freely play around with the weapons and vehicles in the game without having to spend an hour disassembling and reassembling a gun literally 50 times but hey, I guess that's how they make money.

												This game's hard to recommend to everyone, so I won't. I'll recommend it to people who have weird compulsive disorders and like meticulously taking things apart piece by piece, and seeing how it works, because that's all you do in this game. And it's awesome. And it's /free/.What's not awesome is that you have to invite friends to the game to unlock certain features, and the game really stunts your ability to progress like any other social/casual/f2p game. It's fine, because they have to make money somehow.On the other hand, if you're willing to take apart the same weapons a few times and wait a day inbetween binging sessions, you can easily get enough points to progress without spending a cent! Can't beat that deal.It's great fun if you're super weird and like taking stuff apart; that's pretty much it. Just try it. It's 90 MBs and free. If you don't like it, you can try it and be done in like 15 minutes.			"

												Now everyone can be smartass weapons expert with this new educational tool. with the help of this ""game"" you can learn everything you need to know about guns you'll never even get to fire.  Before playing this game it was hard for me to become a weapons expert by just shooting guns in computer game's like ARMA (ARMA essentially trained me to become a soldier despite never leaving my house). after paying $50 for the ultimate pack i can now learn ever more about Theas gun in stunning iphone quality graphics, some might call paying more that $50 for a worthless iphone game a rip off but can you put a price tag on knowledge?  Now i can name every gun i see in movies and T.V shows AND list all its stats despite never even holding the gun.  For instance, Did you know that the IMI Tavor TAR 21 is more powerful than the FN SCAR despite using the same 5.56×45mm NATO round and is lighter.       "

												This is a great game if you are interested in guns.But if you want to get guns you have to buy them with points and the only way to get are to buy them do the quiz that only happens every hour or wait a day and the points progress from 100,200,500,1000,1500,2000,3000 and that is the easiest way to get points.So if you like guns and wanna see how they work try this game out...all i can say is i hope this game SHOOTS for the stars hahahe...that was bad.

												I always had complains. ""You don't understand me"", ""Its all about shooting your load isn't it?"", ""Always making me so wet and leaving me alone"". Then on our days out we always had stalls and irritating fits that further increased the tension on our troubled relashionship. This has been bothering me for a long time and despite asking for proffessional advice i was never able to bridge our differences. Well not anymore. After buying this game my Moistened Nugget has never been happier.Our quality time together has increased. I now know how to take it apart, lube it properly and reasemble it. And the shooting range days have never been better. I thank the developers of this game as they have made me and my rifle happy once again.Overall /k/ out of 10.			"

												World of Guns is an amazing game, that is the ultimate customizer and the ultimate learner that should almost be a requirement, howver the music almost makes you feel a little like a really cazy person. However this you can overcome by making a gun based off of youre contry of origin on the gun.The graphics should be updated to be more realistic, and thats all exept the experience system whick is almost stupid, to unlock all of the guns, but still THIS GAME SHOULD BE PLAYED!!!!!!!!

Unlocked the higher tier guns can get a bit tedious, but the free xp from just booting up the game once per day ensures you can unlock a bunch of them pretty quickly.

												A fun game to play if you´re interested in how guns work. I do recommend this game to gun fanatics and people that are interested in guns but the cons to this game is that you have to unlock guns with exp that you earn everytime you operate a gun. In the beginning it seems real easy to earn that exp but later on it really takes a lot of time to unlock the next gun. If you're are not willing to pay real money then this game needs a lot of dedication to move on otherwise this game is not for you.			"

												Quick Evaluation===========================The Game itself has many pro's and few con's, yet the con's make it obnoxious at times.Pro's-+MANY Weapons to model and even re-texture yourself+Support for other languages, this is actually often forgotten+Supports direct workshop addition, as well as Modded weapon models+Accurate models *to my knowledge*+Customizable backgrounds and mute option for music to add [s]dank meme songs[/s] good music while working.Con's--TOO MANY MICROTRANSACTION SECTIONS-Micro-Transactions lock out certain features that would have been nice to do, as well as easier to buy models etc.-Confusing Menu screens-Misleading titles on certain things=================================""In-Depth"" Review-This game first sparked my interest after seeing the youtuber WarOwl play it, and at that moment, with my fascination of weapons, went and downloaded it, it being free is the coolest non-game-feature. The install itself takes less than 5 minutes, even on wifi from a far away connection zone (tested this for a friend). The game immediately starts up and changing the [s]ridiculous[/s] music to mute was a great feature, as well as changing the background for the screen when dissassembling weapons and such. The tutorial wasn't as great as I'd hoped it would be, but it definitely sufficed enough to let me learn on my own, at my own pace, and even gave me a ""free"" model as part of showing me how to buy them. After the initial tutorial though, there isn't much help finding out how to do in-depth things such as duplicating stickers on your guns, or other things that without needing to do it, seems pointless to even make a help document or tutorial for, so I get it. The overall quality of the game surprised me, and the x-ray feature allows you to see the insides of mechanics that when firing normally aren't visible, and the accuracy of the models are as accurate as any I've seen or field stripped myself at gun shops, etc. Overall this game is a fun time consumer, that can teach you more about guns, or even designing, if you want to texture guns for CS:GO etc. I really do reccomend this since its free, so what's the harm, and its fun to mess around in!

												When I first purchased this game, I was thinking this was going to be some kind ofmemory game... And well, it is... but it's so much more...First off, this is a memory game, but not just any memory game. It's a game about disassembling, reassembling, and even remembering how each gun is taken apart and put back together with & without using the guides. This game is really about remembering the order in which you have to assemble the parts. There's also a shooting range for each gun so you get an idea on how to use the gun as well as teaches you how to spare your ammo for each target and on how you can learn to use each gun on aiming, handle and even practice on moving targets.One thing to note about this game is that, although it is called ""World Of Guns"", it's not just about guns. There's also sections of the game that lets you disassemble and reassemble skeletons, army vehicles (Tank & humvee), sports cars, and even a harley.During the course of playing the game, you also get some really neat info about each weapon, vehicle, and skeleton. Details about the make, model, history, concept, and what went into making each weapon.What I like most about this game is how well detailed the designer put into making each part of every weapon. Someone did some serious homework on this game based on how many parts each gun has. I found this game not only fun, but also informative, and even help me to learn to respect weapons. Learning how the mechanics and insides work was the best part about his game.I have read some other reviews and they seem to claim that some parts of the game were too hard. Although I can somewhat understand, this is more of a memory game as each gun, vehicle, skeleton as an order in which it's assembled, so you have to remember the order of the parts in order to get a good score. This is a memory game, not so much a shooter game. Some guns have as much as 100+ parts to remember, while a few guns only have say 20-30 parts. Every part has it's place, every part must also be done in a certain order, so you got to use your head more than use your speed. Once you know how the parts go, speed will follow. This is is a trial and error game as well as memory game. If you like memory games, this is a good game to get.WARNING = Although this game is free, you can purchase download content which opens up ALL the areas of the game or you can purchase experience points as well as credits to open up only a few select areas. You only start out with 1 gun at the beginning and must earn experience and credits to open up other areas of the game. you earn experience and credits when you complete tasks on each gun.			"

Its impossible to unlock more than 4-5 weapons . I tell you, with all grinding and timetrial crap its im po ssi bleD. It hasnt got any game. Its an encyclopedia, not game.

												Isn't World of Guns: Gun Disassembly suppose to be Free to Play? How come when they add new content it costs money to unlock them? When I downloaded this game, the first gun they give you is the AK47, and you unlock the Colt M1911A1, it takes several hours of disassembling the two same guns over and over again to unlock more guns, you do the quiz every hour to get bonus points to unlock more guns, or you invite 5 friends to play this dumb game to get 20000 experiance and 20 credits. 20 credits can unlock 4 guns that have 5 or less credits.Not all guns are free, you see guns that have experiance and credits, at first I thought ""Okay its 12000 experiance or 5 credits to unlock the SVD"" when in fact its 12000 experiance AND 5 credits. This means the game is not free to play on full aspect, all the new guns they have been adding require credits, these guns include: Browning M250, Fn 57, TMP 9, and probably more guns in the future. If you are looking to play this game for free, you can unlock 80% (ish) of the map, and only get a few acheivements.If you are looking to Pay for this game to unlock everything on the map, you are looking at around $60 or more, you might as well buy something new that came out for Xbox, Playstation, or a different game on PC.

												Pros: Extremely detailed. Very relaxing. The actual process is exhaustively accurate (or at least aspires to be - I don't own a gun myself that I can cross-check their work with.) If a given part could not be removed in reality without removing another part, the game makes you do it in the correct order. It also forces you to deal with parts so small that they don't initially seem to be there even on a close examination. ""Plastic"" mode colors all the parts differently in bright neon colors to make them stand out more, useful in these cases. A competitive element that you can engage or ignore freely - each gun has leaderboards you can compare yourself against. There's also cars and skeletons to disassemble, although only a handful of each, and a motorcycle and two military vehicles. The game includes shooting ranges and challenges to allow you to play with the guns as well as just examine them, but it appears that not all guns have corresponding ranges. Out of the five I've unlocked, only two have such levels.Cons: You start with only three models - AK-47. 1911, and a human skeleton (under bonus models.) To unlock more guns, you have to either save up experience points or spend real-world money. If you're willing to spend money, you unlock guns quite quickly. To do it through XP, you have to grind. That's slow - I'm seven hours in, and have unlocked just three additional guns. (Keep in mind that each gun I have encountered so far takes no more than ten minutes to completely disassemble and re-assemble - and that's the first time attacking a relatively complex gun like the AK. The TEC-9, clocking in at less than forty parts, took just five minutes total, and judging by the leaderboards, I'm slow.) What's more, guns unlock in a specific order along a tree like a Civ V tech tree, except that it goes in multiple directions. You have to unlock eight guns to get to the Garand, for instance, and those eight guns take you in the opposite direction from the Desert Eagle, for another example. You cannot actually see the whole tree to begin with, either. You see the next guns available to unlock, and you can see vague outlines of the ones after that with no names or detail. After that, nothing. You have to consult charts made by other players to plan your unlocks more than two steps ahead. There's also a handful of guns that can be unlocked only with purchased credits. There are often  guns beyond these that can only be accessed by getting through that one gun - so while they're ""free,"" you can't get at them without having paid. Virtually all of the respectable handful of non-gun models are paid-credits only, as well.Conclusion: It's good for killing a few hours here or there, but completionists should be aware that it is impossible to 100 percent this title without paying, and everyone should be aware that what progress you can make is made only at a comparative crawl.

												This game is good...if you dont mind paying 50 dollars to unlock all of its content witch I chose not to and if you like me and you chose not to you rely on the gun quiz...wich is horrible. it shows you weapons you havent even unlocked yet and no matter how many you get right if you get one gun name wrong you lose everything. This was so frusstrating for me i literally went out and beat a filing cabnet with a shovel. What would make this game a lot better is if it had 10 guns unlocked at the beginning so you can get a hang of the game and something that would remove a ton of frustration from the gun quiz would be giving you at least 1 chance before you lose everything. Overall this is another Free to Pay game that were all forced to give our money to if we want to progress through the game.			"

												I always had complains. ""You don't understand me"", ""Its all about shooting your load isn't it?"", ""Always making me so wet and leaving me alone"". Then on our days out we always had stalls and irritating fits that further increased the tension on our troubled relashionship. This has been bothering me for a long time and despite asking for proffessional advice i was never able to bridge our differences. Well not anymore. After buying this game my Moistened Nugget has never been happier.Our quality time together has increased. I now know how to take it apart, lube it properly and reasemble it. And the shooting range days have never been better. I thank the developers of this game as they have made me and my rifle happy once again.Overall /k/ out of 10.			"

												A cool little game that will show you the inner workings of a great many firearms.  How they work, how to disassemble/reassemble them, and all the names of the individual parts.There's even two little other things for animal skeletons, motorcycles, and cars.  The only real downside to this game is that the only way to get more guns to play with is to grind, or pay money.  It's okay, though, because the base game is FREE.  I only wish there were a way to just unlock guns you wanted to use, not all of them all at once for $50.			"

												If I could rate t neutral believe me I would. I like it because it is a great time killer but this game should just be free. No dlcs. No unlockables. Just free to play. I say this because it is just a game of disassembling and reassembling various guns with an optional challenge mode. The dlc matter is tricky because I can get over 100 guns and counting but the problem is that the season pass dlc is the same price as a newly released AAA title game which honestly is pretty damn outrageous even though I might purchase it. The point system is dull and take forever. Taking apart and rebuilding a gun totals to sixty points which is way too low and gets boring easily considering most guns are 15,000 points. It's like a digital arcade center: you play games and earn tokens, tickets but after a couple hours you still don't have enough for the cool lava lamp or in this case a pistol. All in All it's good but needs to be 100% free.			"

												One of the best Free-to-play games on Steam! Very entertaining, yet very competitive if the player wants some challenges. Not quite a full arsenal of both historical and modern weapons, but there are many platforms, and the field strip/disassemble/reassemble processes are accurate. Also, there is an ""Operation Mode"" where the player can find out how a specific weapon work, and there are informations about the weapons gathered from Wikipedia and other sources for reference. In general, this game will keep the player busy for some time. Definitely recommended.			"

												If you love puzzles, this is the game for you.If you just love shooting things, this is probably not the game for you.The basic premise of this game is simple... dissassemble and reassemble every kind of gun imaginable. From notable historic models, to modern military pieces, even a few vehicles, and some skeletons, this game has a lot to offer anyone who loves fiddling with intricate models, and looking at how things work.It's got a few negative quirks, though. As others have noted, the game is very unforgiving to those who don't want to pay for microtransactions. If you're just a casual player wanting to look at all the different models, expect to pay a lot.Even if you're really into the puzzle aspects, expect to throw down a few dollars on occasion for that really nice model you want to try out.Another negative is the inconsistency between models. Some models will require you to pull apart every single little screw, bolt, flange, and spring. Others will do most of the detail work for you, dissassembling large amounts of items with one click. It can be especially frustrating when trying to get the higher difficulty achievements, to figure out just how much attention to detail a specific model wants you to have. Planning and memorization are key.If you like puzzles, though, and aren't afraid to shell out a few dollars now and then, pick this up. You'll be engrossed pretty quickly, I guarantee.			"

												I've only done the assembly and dissassemly of the AK-47 but I'm impressed with the graphics and animations it makes a very nice educational tool to learn how these guns work.  It's also surprisingly detailed it just needs links to gun suppliers to show where you can get your spare parts from. I'm unsure of it being a game concept. But any one interested in engineering or wannabe terrorists wanting a bit of a heads up before they join their Al Qaeda terrorists camps should check this out. Its definately worth a look. Some of the more non-weapon based DLCs should be encouraged.			"

												I Kinda like this game, hate the fact that i have to invite friends to play, but otherwise its good i guess. The core concept is amasing, but it feels way too restricted, lemme have more models without having to either invite 5 friends or do the super game for everything 3 times over (you have to do every part in exact order to win, ♥♥♥♥ up once you start over). What i ended up doing for the M1911 was writing down everysingle part in the order of assembly and dissasembly so now i know every solitary part, so in a way the game does its job well, it teaches you the inner working of many firearms.As of now this game has my 6/10, a good game, if they got rid of the friend thing AND made it less restrictive around getting new models, id give it a 7.5/10.... for educational game standerds			"

Boy, was I wrong, it's basically a Puzzle, Memory type of game where you learn how to take apart and reassemble real weaponery. Once I found out what the game had to offer I was hooked. I find it quite good and a little addicting. It's very casual too, hop in for 5 minutes or 1 hour. It's not like most games out there that really impose on your time to get something done.The game is free, you only start with one gun but it's easy to get points to unlock other guns. So it's NO WHERE near a pay2play. I have around 11 guns now and enough points to probably buy two more guns depending on what I want. I actually feel quite guilty because I have not yet paid for on of the packs the game does offer which are around $10. I mean it's so cool of a game that I'd like to support the Development team.I don't know if this review will help much but if you get anything from it, learn from my mistake. I thought the game was stupid looking and almost passed it by but once I tried it I found out how great it is. Don't make my mistake.At the very least yoou can learn how to take apart and then put back together an AK47 Assault Rifle or Colt 45 Handgun :)			"

												It's not really a game.It's a 3D program for learning anatomy of guns for whatever reason you may need it. Here you can find more than 100 different gun models even some cars and skeletons models.This is an educational program on steam, but it's about guns so i give it thumbs up.It's a free ""game"" but unlocking gun you like probably will take forever, so you might just go and buy dlc when it's on sale - even for full price i think it's worth it.

												This is not to be taken as a ""game"", or you will be disappointed.This is to be taken as an educative program, i find it interesting to know how the weapons are built and how many parts they have, and that's the purpose of this ""program"".

												For a free-to-play title this is surprisingly fun. Disassemble and reassemble up to 96 weapons! This also includes cars and apparently creatures (have yet to explore those options)Essentially this is a simulator but acts easily as a puzzle game. For anyone who is into shooters, war history or simply weaponry this is highly informative and detailed. Use Experience gained from successful completion of tasks to unlock more weapons, vehicles, shooting ranges and more! Definitely recommended and going to sink hours into it!			"

												I Kinda like this game, hate the fact that i have to invite friends to play, but otherwise its good i guess. The core concept is amasing, but it feels way too restricted, lemme have more models without having to either invite 5 friends or do the super game for everything 3 times over (you have to do every part in exact order to win, ♥♥♥♥ up once you start over). What i ended up doing for the M1911 was writing down everysingle part in the order of assembly and dissasembly so now i know every solitary part, so in a way the game does its job well, it teaches you the inner working of many firearms.As of now this game has my 6/10, a good game, if they got rid of the friend thing AND made it less restrictive around getting new models, id give it a 7.5/10.... for educational game standerds			"

												Very fun and truly educational game. when it says full disassembly it really means it. it  does have a field strip as well, but  on top of that it has a full factory service type of disassembly/reassembly wherer you have to get every single little  pin/spring out.its a tough game, and  as a  person who has  owned and repaired several of the firearms in this game, i can say that it is a very accurate and educational tool. this would   be SO helpful for a gun owner doing repairs, whos  having a  hard time seeing how a certain assembly goes.  its not with out its problems, there are some order of operation- type issues that dont  always make sense, sometimes it requiers that one gun part comes off before the  other, when in real life that is not  really  how it would be. but im sure theyre probably following like the service manual order when it comes to those things, so its no real  error i suppose.great game, get it, i HIGHLY reccomend the  Starter pack DLC< NOT the FULL lifetime DLC.  its on sale right now for 5 bucks, it gives  you 15 guns  that are all unlocked and ready for dis/assembly challenges etc. the full mode unlocks everything, and thats  not as fun, if you are goal oriented gamer, it will pretty much Finish the game for you.

												Picked this up on a whim and thought it would be a gimmick or uninteresting, especially being free.  I was wrong.The developers put a lot of work into this game.  The models in-game are based on real world models.  Every part is labeled with it's correct name, down to the smallest pins, rollers and springs.  If you are detail oriented, mechanically-minded, or simply curious, this will be up your alley!Whether you are a firearm enthusiast or simply wondered how firearms function, check this ""game"" out.  I don't even consider this to be a game, but more of a fun educational tool with games on the side.  There are ""pay"" aspects, but only if you want to progress faster or move onto a subject other than guns, such as military vehicles, race cars, even skeletons, etc.  As for progression within the ""gun"" world, it's free.The game consists of assembly, dis assembly, function, games (including a firing range) and even painting the firearms.  You can try to disassemble then reassemble as fast as you can, without ""hasty"" clicks, and without errors for extra points.  It's very challenging (and I'm adept at this using actual firearms).  The X-ray feature allows the player to see inside a firearm, even while firing, reloading, safety on-off, etc.  This is what I liked the most about it.In the real world, one can take apart an actual gun, learn the names of the parts, and understand the basic functions; but to see the pieces in action (while inside the gun) gives us a better understanding of how all the parts work together.The models are pretty good looking too.  They aren't super high res, but they aren't low-res either.My only two complaints with this game:- The way one moves around the gun/parts to get a different angle is awkward, sometimes frustrating, but it's not game-breaking bad...not by any means; just an annoyance at times.- Some areas of the breakdown and assembly are draconian when it shouldn't be.  For example:  the AK-47, one does not have to remove the accessories pouch from the rifle-butt BEFORE removing the rifle-butt (in real life).  The game penalizes the player if the pouch isn't removed first though.  This problem is more of a developer's attitude of ""You have to follow MY procedure, even if it's not necessary in the real world"".  This is not game-breaking either, but VERY frustrating when trying to go from start to finish with zero errors.Overall, I would recommend this game, 100%.9/10			"

												One of the best Free-to-play games on Steam! Very entertaining, yet very competitive if the player wants some challenges. Not quite a full arsenal of both historical and modern weapons, but there are many platforms, and the field strip/disassemble/reassemble processes are accurate. Also, there is an ""Operation Mode"" where the player can find out how a specific weapon work, and there are informations about the weapons gathered from Wikipedia and other sources for reference. In general, this game will keep the player busy for some time. Definitely recommended.			"

												My experience so far:Oh sweet I got a new gun, let's play and see if I can beat everyones score. I'm going to click on this piece... and sniper is gone wtf. Repeat x10, restarting each time to get it right. I will verifty I have the right piece, but lolno sniper disappears half the time. The other half you can single click on the right piece and there goes your other achievement (I forgot the name because at this point I'm too ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off to care).Do this again for other competitions.Finally a new gun maybe this is better... no it's the same as before.Repeat x10With the bugs, clicks and order of operations that makes no sense - and is forced - I'm convinced at this point that this game was made by people who read the factory manual and never actually have been near these weapons. Ever. Either that or it was made to just ♥♥♥♥ people off while have them coming back for more.AND GUESS WHAT ♥♥♥♥ERS. IT WORKED. IT ♥♥♥♥ING WORKED. FIX YOUR ♥♥♥♥ AND I'LL GIVE YOU A POSITIVE REVIEW.

												I really liked this World of Guns, but I'm not sure if it should be called ""a game"".Graphics: 6/10Graphics are okay. You won't find many bad textures. It's far from realistic, in my opinion, though.Artstyle: 2/10Extremely simplistic. I'm not saying it should be all explosions and super action, but the game doesn't do too much to make you want to look at it.Atmosphere: NoneNo mutiplayer, no singleplayer... you just choose a gun and (dis)assemble it. It's not possible to immerse yourself into the game.Sound: 5/10Pretty average. I'm not sure if firing sounds are recorder real guns' sounds.Controls: 4/10It could enrage people how clunky it is. You can accidentally move your mouse to wrong direction, if you're doing the best time you can.Gameplay: 6/10Not much to ""play"" other than disassembling and assembling guns. And it's pretty linear. You can also fire guns on a firing range.Story: NoneNo story. You will only like the game if you like guns.Overall: 7/10Note: ""Overall"" is my personal rating of how the game ""feels"" to me in general, not each point taken together. I really like disassembling guns, and that's why I like it.			"

With our revolutionary new system, you can feed us money to magically ♥♥♥♥ out weapons for you! Its completely amazing! Best part is, it takes a millenium to unlock these guns and some aren't even unlockable! You want more?

												I can't really decide to recommend or dislike. Wish there was a middle option.So yeah. You can go and take apart guns, put them together, and watch how they fire. Pretty cool stuff actually. You start of with an AK-47, then unlock the M1911 (I think, haven't played in a while), then the MP5, and then you get a branching path that you can choose from. Each gun costs XP to buy, and when you complete stages like taking apart the gun, putting the gun together, firing the gun, using the gun at a shooting range, speed-disassembling/assembling the gun, etc. you get XP.However, XP isn't HARD to get, it's just...ANNOYING.The problem with this is that you get WAY to little XP to unlock anything before you become bored. I don't think I made it anywhere past 4 guns (AK47, M1911, MP5, Beretta). To get required XP, you will need to constantly go back and play all of these games OVER and OVER again. It gets boring, trust me.I GUESS it would be good to buy the DLC for this, but honestly, just trust me, using it for something like this might not be the best idea.Is it a bad game? Well, sort of. They tried to make it a game, but I feel like just making it an interactive thing would have been much better and I would have given it a higher score. It's really interesting how you can do this stuff, and the guns are great, but since it's so annoying to get the XP needed to unlock the guns, you probably won't get to a lot of them. If they just lowered the XP required or dropped the ""free to play"", put a cheap price tag on it, and then unlocked all of the guns, that would be better. It IS great for gun enthusiasts, though, and I guess it wouldn't hurt to try it because it is free.			"

												I’ve shot pistols before, but never something like an AR-15. Squeeze lightly on the trigger and the resulting explosion of firepower is humbling and deafening (even with ear protection).The recoil bruised my shoulder, which can happen if you don't know what you're doing. The brass shell casings disoriented me as they flew past my face. The smell of sulfur and destruction made me sick. The explosions — loud like a bomb — gave me a temporary form of PTSD. For at least an hour after firing the gun just a few times, I was anxious and irritable.			"

												""World of Guns"" as you can problably tell by the name is a game about (you guessed it) guns! This is an educational game on the disassembly and reassembly of guns. Everything from AK-47 to M4, Barrett M107, Ruger SR9 and much much more. After taking the guns apart and then reassembling them you get to fire them. The best part of this game is that it's free! If you've ever wondered how guns come apart/go back together then this is the game for you. This game is a must have for gun enthusiasts.			"

												I like the concept of World of Guns. It can teach people the mechanics of specific fire arms, which I find fascinating. However, the amount of problems and unfathomably bad, anti-consumer design choices are so insultingly abundant, I hope the developers get banned from using a computer again.Pros- Teaches the mechanics of fire arms- Customizable skins- Variety in firearmsCons- Have to sit though unbearably slow tutorials- Bland royalty-free music- Usually get stuck with weapons you don't care about- Unable to proceed unless you complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t challenges- Have to start challenges over if you don't select parts in correct order because you don't get anything- So much content locked behind a pay wall and DLC- If you select a gun with the points you “earned,” from grinding, you just get a stream of uninteresting firearms.

												I don't think this game is really worth using time on it. It might be kind of cool to see how guns work, but you have to go through a whole god forsaken tech tree to get at everything, and you get a nice amount of add about buying things.Even worse, you have to grind for all the shooting ranges - I want to shoot my darn guns, as well as build them.

												This is a very good game. I really enjoy playing it, especially when playing 'Game' Mode. I like the challenge. The shooting ranges;however, are a bit difficult. For example, Range 6, when using the AK-47, doesn't aim really well at the targets and it's hard to tell where the bullet will hit. I guess practice makes perfect. :P Again, really fun game and I love disassembling and reassembling the guns. 8/10 would recommend to anyone who loves guns.			"

												This review is on the free to play base game. Im given an AK47.These are my first impressions so far.I dont like how I have to click some things and all the actions are done. I reload by clicking on the magazine, the game does the whole reload action. I want to reload by clicking on the magazine release, then clicking the magazine and also clicking on the charging handle ON MY OWN. I have to choose the fire selection through the menu button on the bottom left and not on the damn gun. When you click the saftey on the AK it doesnt cycle Safe>Auto>Semi auto. It is either safe or fire (depending on what you selected on the bottom right of the menu.For a world of guns i need immersion in a simulation, I dont want the game to hand hold me to do certain actions. Edit: OK im sure people wouldnt want to reload all the time manually, but that is what the reload button is for on the bottom right, that button should be the full reload, but clicking on the gun should be the manual (non-handholding) way of reloading.Edit2: I DO like the non-hand holding in disassembling the weapon on the disassembly, but controlling the camera is a bit of a pain.

												Review- World of guns gun dissambly            (SORRY FOR MY BAD ENGLISCH I`M A GERMAN)Everybody who love guns should get this game. It´s very coll that it´s for free and the graphics are easy mady but it´s for free so it doesn´t matter. It´s very interesting to see how the popular AK-47 works or shoot the MP5. Sometimes it´s hard to get the mechanism but there is an slow-morion function too. Also very cool is the shooting range. I like this game very much and everybody who like guns should install it.INSTAKILLER bye!			"

												World of Guns - Gun Disassembly: It is rather good, but the tutorial is like a school lesson - boring. And to interact with the weapon without limits you have to disassemble, reassemble and do the ""challenge"" to reassemble as fast as possible. Pros:- Clear explanation of wrapon work- Cool slo-mo effect- X-rays?!- Overview of weaponsCons:- Gun tutorial is like a school lesson- Disassembly, Reassembly and Challenge must be first done to use weapon without limits. I want the challenge optional.Conclusion is, it looks good but I am seeking something that doesn't make me feel like in school.			"

												Intentionally grindy, you need to play the most unfun games to unlock anything. The interfece is pretty bad for the disassembly portion of the game, meaning the whole point of the game is not good. The shooting range of the game handles incredibly poorly, meaning there is nothing really worth playing this game for.You can honestly find better games on flash sites.			"

												First few guns are fun, you learn what goes where and how it all comes together. Cool. Then you find out you can get 20k bonus XP, and you get it. You buy some more guns. Pretty soon you have no choice but to complete the god awful ""Super Game"" modes, pay money to get more guns, or go through the same steps over and over to get a gun, just to repeat the process again.If you're a gun fanatic and can enjoy spending hours of your life learning exactly what order this or that bolt has to go in, than by all means download this game. But if you're just looking for something interesting to kick back with and not have to think too much (like myself), I would recommend avoiding this game, or at least download with caution, as the amount of easy/free/enjoyable gameplay won't take you far past 3-4 hours.This game has a really interesting concept, and I'd love to see what other guns and modes it grows to encompass, but doing something ridiculously difficult again and again and again just isn't for me.

												The game is harder than I expected. Even sharp stomach ache is softer than this game. When you think you disassemble every nail of gun there's could be, then it comes to be... there's another part of something very small you don't see, what you have to disassemble to progress to finish disassembling and begin to assembling. It is like ""Burn in hell! Why they made such a small parts of guns to make it the hardest things ever?!"" It isn't like rage, I can tell. It is annoying, but you can't be angry. Well... hard weapon imo was pistol Colt. Such small parts, not for me. HK MP5 was... a little better. It was easy, but not easy as Tec-9. CZ-75 is like Colt. Bloody hell and filthy tiny parts. PPSh was easy. Damn those guns. Easy enough, but hard when you do it for time or for achievements like ""sniper"" when you have to do every move rightly and you can't make even ONE mistake.Goin' for Glock 17. I love Glock...I recommend it for you! Do you want it, grab it, play it :3			"

												At first this seemed really cool... BEFORE I downloaded it. THEN after spending an hour or so I found it to be a TOTAL DRM P.O.S.. I mean, you have to frigg'n be ONLINE just to play this thing... WTH?EVERY time you want o ""play""/ disassemble/Assemble a gun, the game has to REDOWNLOAD the model... WHY?? SUppose you live where the internet conenction is bad, or your camping and want to goof off after a long days hike on your laptop. NOOOOOO....Even the shooting ranges are limited, cause it's only for one kind fo gun. You can pick the kindof shooting range you want, choose whatever gun you want and start popping off shots. NO. It's whatever they want to give you, and only a SMALL fraction of guns get to be used in the shooting range.The game is constanly telling you how much more EXP you could have earned by buying a booster pack, and even forking out $40 doesn't unlock every item (good thing I only got the free version.)Disassembly is dumbed down too. Oh sure, some models require you to remove every screw, but, ONLY for that region. Even then most guns assemble+disassemble as an assembly, meaning a group of parts com apart at the simple click of a button. I really don't feel like you learn much.Textures range from realisic, to flat out lazy. The AK and 1911 are very pretty, but guns like the Tech 9 sport few convincing textures (especially the barrel assembly.) The game goes so far as to tell you you can unlock any gun at any time... IF YOU PAY MONEY....While the multiple X-Ray modes, attchments are cool, there's really nothing redeeming about this at all. If I were to actually get a copy that didn't require the internet to even use and still required money to buy, I'd might consider it. But inthe end, it's really a Modern-day corrupt app. And I don't are if the Devs say: ""Well, we want to preven piracy."" To heck with that noise, this exact philosophy is what made sooooooooooo many gamers ticked off about the original features of the X-Box 1. So... Why bother with games like that at all. I don't care if this is more of a simulator than a game, I care about integrity, and I find this game to stink to high noon with questionable business practices.------------- REAL GAMERS DON'T NEED THEIR WALLETS TO UNLOCK FEATURES.

												It is what it is... A gun simulator... Literally.Cool idea, well designed, and the graphics are a solid 8.5-9.0.Gameplay, if you want to call it that is taking a gun apart, and putting it back together.You can zoom in, and out to get those little pieces further inside the gun.Level of detail while zooming is quite impressive.But I feel unless you are a real serious gun enthusiast, this might not be for you.But for what it is, it is quite impressive, and well done.Don't take my word for it, and check out my video by clicking on the link.

World of Guns: Gun Disassembly, Now Including Reassembly!Pros: Guns, ControlsCons: Value, Graphics, Sound, GameplayWorld of Guns has nearly every popular, iconic, and/or influential gun, from the 'Plastic' Glock 19 to James Bond's Walther PP to WWII German Mastchinepistole 40.  Precise controls allow for some quick digital assembly and disassembly with a little bit of practice.However, watery textures plaster the more realistic gun models and the soundtrack will eventually cause a headache.  The gameplay is repetitive to say the least.  A 'field strip' is about 25% of a 'disassembly', a 'game' is a 'disassembly' and 'assembly' back to back, a 'super game' is a 'game' without misclicks, etc. These games give experience points to buy new models but the cost/earn ratio is exceedingly high, leading to a massive grind.As of July 2014, Lifetime Access is 50 USD, almost the cost of any new AAA game.  The repetitive gameplay and free information (cited and copied from Wikipedia) seem overpriced.  Nearly half of the game's 'achievements' are unlocked by buying Lifetime Access, so for achievement hunters, this may be a relatively cheap source of satisfaction.World of Guns: Disassembly, Now Including Reassembly!

												I like this game, and after reading the reviews I have to disagree with many of them about having to already be a ""fan"" of guns. I see many potential ways to have fun in the game, and in the end even if you don't have any fun assembling, disassembling, and operating the guns the game has to offer, there are other models in the game including skeletons, cars, and motorcycles. Really there is quite a bit of fun to be had if you go into the game looking at it like a puzzle/ sim game and you may even learn something about the way guns operate and how they are manufactured and/ or assembled. If that's the sort of thing for you, you should also know there are statistics and info for each gun available if you want to know more information about whatever one you are interested in. Not all aspects of the game are enjoyable (at least for me) after a point you will hit grind (unless you pay) and grind is the polar opposite of fun most, if not all of the time. There is also a requirement (for some content) to invite friends to the game. Now I know that it might not sound bad to need to invite friends to play the game, but if your like me and most of your steam friends don't play these types of games you will run into an issue fairly quickly. Even if your friends will play, you don't want to end up looking like a spamming jerk do you? In the end I think you should just download the game yourself, (ts pretty small so it shouldn't  take long) and try it, after all only you can tell if you like it.			"

												Unable to get it to run right on my new laptop (Windows 10, 64 bit OS, dedicated 3 gig GPU, 16 gigs RAM) - I click on a model and the screen turns to 3/4 blacked-out with a white space in the lower-right quarter. Not sure what the cause is, but to me that sort of issue renders the game itself literally unplayable.When I was able to run it on my old laptop, it was fun for a while, but got boring after the fifth or sixth time detail-stripping an H&K USP trying to earn the XP to unlock a different model.I really want to recommend this game, but unfortunately I just can't in light of my issues.

												This ""game"" is just a really boring mobile game that takes 100+ dollars to actually have any fun with. This ""game"" claims to have hundreds of guns but they all take xp (30,000+) to unlock. Not to mention you have to unlock several guns before you can unlock other guns. Unless you want to spend hours taking apart the same gun from memory (ak-47) you will have to spend a lot of money. Not to mention you get about 200xp taking down a whole ak. Don't waste your time plenty of free non pay to play games on steam.			"

It's accurate, which means the developers took time to learn how to field strip all of those weapons. You can use ""gamemode"" where is shows you how does that weapon work when firing. Amazing.

The game currency can be easily increased by getting experience from assembling/disassembling items.- Easy controls.- Perfect sounds.- Competitions and leader boards.- Steam achievements - which is useless. In-game achievements - which is great because of the huge amount of experience they deliver.- A lot of details. For example, AK has about 100 details and each of them is named on different languages.- The weapons' customization (colours, stickers, e.t.c).- Frequent updates.MINUSES:- The game menu sucks...

												I've had fun with this game. However, after playing it for 11 hours, I've noticed a few things that have turned me off it.1: No way to delete your current progress. This is annoying for me because after leaving it for a few months, I wanted to start again. However, there is no way to do so. At all...2: The quiz is stupid. You can correctly identify 7 models, get 1 wrong, and lose all those points. Why don't I get the points for the the 7 models I got right?3: You pretty much need to buy extra points after about 10 hours of play. I'm at the point where I have to grind the same models over and over to get one new gun, which then gives me about 30 minutes of fresh entertainment, before it's back to grind-city.4: So content is locked off by making it only purchasable by credits, which you can't get by playing the game. Guess what that means? Microstransactions! 5: Whats worse is that there are achivements linked to content only buyable with credits. So to get about 4-5 of the achivements, you are forced to buy credits.So there's my review. A fun game for the first couple of hours, then you hit grind city and all entertainment is lost.			"

												10/10 incredible. Changed my life. The graphics are so good i felt like i was actually there, in the sky, disassembling real guns. The music really helped to immerse me into the game and the game is super challenging especially if you're not good at clicking green arrows. Like I said, 10/10. Changed my life and will  change the way I feel about gun disassembly forever.			"

												I do actaully like this game for all the pulling apart and putting together... BUT it never told me that getting xp would be so boring and it also never told me that it cost 50 dollars to get all the guns. I don't care how many there are it should be 10 or free. But the major thing is that earning xp is so boring, maybe if it didn't take so much effort to save up I would've been a lot happier. To end off they shouldn't have made it free to play if they want you to pay so much.			"

												I've had fun with this game. However, after playing it for 11 hours, I've noticed a few things that have turned me off it.1: No way to delete your current progress. This is annoying for me because after leaving it for a few months, I wanted to start again. However, there is no way to do so. At all...2: The quiz is stupid. You can correctly identify 7 models, get 1 wrong, and lose all those points. Why don't I get the points for the the 7 models I got right?3: You pretty much need to buy extra points after about 10 hours of play. I'm at the point where I have to grind the same models over and over to get one new gun, which then gives me about 30 minutes of fresh entertainment, before it's back to grind-city.4: So content is locked off by making it only purchasable by credits, which you can't get by playing the game. Guess what that means? Microstransactions! 5: Whats worse is that there are achivements linked to content only buyable with credits. So to get about 4-5 of the achivements, you are forced to buy credits.So there's my review. A fun game for the first couple of hours, then you hit grind city and all entertainment is lost.			"

												As an educational tool this gets top marks. Noble Engineering have done an outstanding job in presenting even the smalest of parts in their WoG. Seeing the inner workings of a gun after a complete field dis/assembly step by step, was an eye opener and very educational. There is much potential to this tool and the presentation options when seeing past the subject of guns. Personally, I would prefer a choice of different subjects at the beginning to choose from, not just guns, due to being on principle against guns and the violence they bring but I cannot fault the way they are presented in such detail and functionality overall. Looking forward to discovering what else Noble Engineering has in stock for the future.			"

												This is one of unique games I've ever played. This game will teach you how to field strip almost all used weapons. From Pistols to HMG. I'm very impressed. It's accurate, which means the developers took time to learn how to field strip all of those weapons. You can use ""gamemode"" where is shows you how does that weapon work when firing. Amazing. You got some small challanges that you have to do in order to earn exp. points which are used to unlock a new weapons. Very original game and it's FREE. This is a must play game !!!			"

The game currency can be easily increased by getting experience from assembling/disassembling items.- Easy controls.- Perfect sounds.- Competitions and leader boards.- Steam achievements - which is useless. In-game achievements - which is great because of the huge amount of experience they deliver.- A lot of details. For example, AK has about 100 details and each of them is named on different languages.- The weapons' customization (colours, stickers, e.t.c).- Frequent updates.MINUSES:- The game menu sucks...

												The thing about this game was that it has so much potential! The detail, the fun and everything. Only 1 thing brought it all the way down. It is that it will take ages (by ages, I mean AGES) for you to actually unlock a new gun. Getting XP to unlock a gun will take a long time. You can reassemble and disassemble guns again and again, but it won't give you that much of XP. The only sustainable way of getting XP is the daily reward, which is flawed by itself. Everyday, you get more and more XP (100, 200, 500...) until 3000. Think that it will help you out? I thought the same too. But then, after reaching 3000, on day 7, the count restarted to the measly 100. So much for 'coming on everyday and this reward will increase!'So if you count the daily rewards that you can get in a week, that tallys up to 6800, which at first seems like a lot. But eventually, you have to unlock guns that cost almost twice that amount. So... you just have two weeks of opening and closing the game before you can get to any action. When I play, I always ask myself, what's the point of having so many guns if you can't even use them? The price to unlock all the guns is ridiculous too. 50 dollars?? You might as well just add 10 bucks to it and get Battlefield 4 or something.In conclusion, this game could have worked out brilliantly. Only a flawed daily reward system and the crazy amount of time needed to progress brings it down all the way. 3/10 stars			"

												The game has an interesting idea to say the least. Its cool how you can field strip or fully take apart a gun, but for what reward? You'll eventually get to the point where you grind and grind and grind and grind untill you get the next gun. Guess what you have to do next? Yep, grind. The game holds your hand through the entirety of the game (except shooting range). For example, you cannot make mistakes, if you try and put one thing with the wrong component it does nothing. What they should've done (in my opinion) is have some sort of feed back, like show a little animation of the two parts trying to fit together and failing instead of just nothing.Now on to DLC issues, remember how I was complaining about ""grinding"" up above? Well you don't have to worry about it! Just shove your credit card into the disc tray, pay $50 and get 100+ guns half of which you won't even touch! Also ""4 Cars Pack"" and ""5 Skeletons Pack""???? Why are there cars and skeletons in a game called ""World of GUNS:  GUN  Disassesembly????? I haven't bought these (shocker) but the ideas are cool and I think if they were seperate games. The ""10 Shooting Ranges Pack"" is completely pointless. The one thing I'm not sure about is if the ""World War II Pack"" includes guns in the game right now or exclusive guns only in this pack. ""Starter Pack"" is obvious although it doesn't say what guns are included.Overall, the game is interesting and quite cool, but the way it performs, with grinding being its main problem, even though this game is free and steam makes games easy to uninstall, its still not worth it.

												Dear me, I am so angry!  In case you did not know, Noble Empire created an app called Gun Disassembly II a long time ago.  I, being a fan of going to the local range picked this app up.  That was two years ago.  I have since paid $.99 for 105 guns, not to mention the extra money I spent on the Car Disassembly and the Body Disassembly apps.  You may wonder why this is important.  Well this version of the game requires me to REBUY the items I have previously bought.  Which is funny since the PC application of Gun Disassembly allows me to download my purchases I bought.  If you’re new to this world of disassembly apps & games, get this game but be ready to spend an arm and a leg in two weeks.  BUT if you’re like me who bought these weapons before, DO NOT GET THIS GAME!  Not till  Noble Empire gets there act together and realizes they are ruining a once great relationship with their fans.

The guns are nicely detailed and you learn quite a lot about each gun functions when it is fired. How ever there are some issues. The Spec Ops feature where yu are ewarded for joining their group and having 5 freinds play the game does not work, I've joined the group and have 6 friends play the game and can not claim the rewards for completeing the objective. Another issue is that any new guns they add to the game require credits, a currency you pretty much have to buy to use on these guns. Sure they run a prmo code to unlock it for free, but they are limited and you have to buy the credits if you want to ulock them. The Exp gain is alright, I wish It was a bit higher, I also wish that the quiz system was worked out better like maybe having a 3 strikes and you lose. Overall I'd rate it a 6/10 pretty fun game, pretty educational, but the Spec Ops being broken, and new guns requireing credits is a bit disappointing. Probably will cgange to a Recommend once the Spec Ops feature is fixed.			"

												Great fun for about 2 hours if you're not willing to grind the same gun over and over again or want to pay money. The game itself is good overall (atleast the concept), but e.g. the textures aren't really ""2014"" I think. The MP5's textures,like the whole shooting range, look just horrible. Also I miss extended graphics options, a slider for the music/sound volumes and more competitions at the shooting range just to name a few. This seems to be some App ported to the PC. Please make it a fair game for players who play this game for free and USE the possibilities and resources the PC gives you as platform. Let us get 5-10 guns easily without grinding for hours or having to pay or make it a (REAL) pay-once game. Use another engine that actually USES the PCs hardware to make everything look actually realistic.Summary:Good concept but looks and feels like a rather bad port from the mobile market just to get more money. If you want PC players to actually PLAY this game make it a real PC game.All in all a 3/10 (like the number of guns you get when you're not paying, being a pro or grinding for hours)			"

												i guess i can recommend this game... basically, you start with 2 unlocked models to disassemble and use. that would be the AK-47, and the Human Skeleton. you need a ludacris amount of exp to unlock 1 new model. the cheapest model ive seen cost 24,000 exp and thats for the Takorev Pistol. after almost 2 hours of playing i have 2,800 exp and have run out of ways to get exp. it says when i level up ill unlock like 20,000 exp and 2 new models, however i cant level up becuase ive run out of ways too. dont get me wrong, this game was great on ios when iphone 4 was new, but they made it impossible to unlock new models without buying them.

												The ""game"" portion is implemented very poorly and is not that well thought-out at all. However, just taking apart and examining the inner workings of all the gun models is cool as hell. And it's free.Recommended if you are into mechanics, that one show ""How Stuff Works"", or guns in general. Not recommended if you are an actual gun-toting open-carry NRA fringe ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, because then instead my recommendation would be to ♥♥♥♥ off			"

												This is a good game and very informative. Not that you will ever need to know this but anyway. Good game, graphics at shooting range should be updated though and it would be nice to be able to access all guns at the beginning but that's why there is a 10 us dollar dlc which allows you just that.

												No Multiplayer from the little i've seen, the graphics are ♥♥♥♥ and what little shooting there is in the game is terrible, your accuracy is laughable compared to COD and you don't even get 2 weapons or grenades, no perks either and the starting weapon selection is terrible; Only an AK47 to start with and the next thing you unlock is a pistol. The game requires too much work to get a sniper and i'm pretty sure you can't put attachments on your guns. 2/10			"
