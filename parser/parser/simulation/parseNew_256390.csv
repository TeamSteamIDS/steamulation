												I own MotoGP13 and love it, I didn't think it was possible but this game actually seems like a big step back. Graphics for PC suck, jagged edges everywhere. Audio is terrible. You can't slide the rear into corners anymore (backing it in), Random highsides with TCS on full. AI still seem to always go faster than you mid corner and will ram you from behind at any chance. Regret purchasing this and that makes me seriously sad. Thumbs down on this one.			"

												It's a lacklustre console port. If you can get past that then please feel free to read further.The game is 'good' and probably the best bike racing simulator I've played, and as a biker I buy them all. The physics engine is generally pretty decent, the bikes themselves are faithfully modelled and of course its nice to have the Dorna permissions to include the full roster of teams and rides. But that's it.The game is built on a clearly dated engine that has reached, if not passed its end of life cycle. I'm playing on a fairly competent machine, i7, 16Gb, GTX670, SSD and the game performs poorly with frequent stuttering. Garage scenes are particularly ugly with massive screen tearing and corruption when selecting the bike to confirm which developments to complete. Very poor.Racing is generally good. There's a decent sense of speed and simulation going on though the sound of the bikes is pretty off. AI is generally perfunctory at best. They ride and do what they're supposed to do though have no real character; you can certainly tell that it is algorithm riding the bikes.However the biggest negative is the startling fact that this is a poorly optimised console port and Milestone hasn't done anything to even attempt to hide this fact: No graphics options, poorly optimised UX (for PC), No way to Quit to desktop(!), no way to save custom controller configurations...Milestone don't tend to patch their games. I don't expect any of these issues to be addressed.End of the day I waited until the game was on sale before buying as I'm fully aware of Milestone's track record and history with respect to their games and support there on in. I paid GBP 14.99 and feel that I have a fair value for money at that price proposition.Summary; it is a 'good game' for an unambitious console port with the usual trappings of what that entails. Don't buy at full price! "

												I own the PS4 version of MotoGP 14 and have been enjoying it despite the 30fps lock on the refresh rate.  I decided to pick up the PC version so that I could let the game stretch its legs a bit with the extra power of my computer.Unfortunately the PC version is very obviously playing second fiddle to the console version.  The graphics options are extremely limited (extra fx and hi res textures) though you do get to change the refresh rate and vsync.  The graphics while in the garage seem a bit strange, as if they are being rendered at a lower resolution than the 1080p which the main game runs at, and the textures in the garage are also very low resolution and blurry.There are other oddities, such as cut scenes and replays being locked to 30fps.  Being able to exit the game to the desktop is glitchy, sometimes you get the option to do it and other times you have to kill the game from the task manager.  That's a pretty obvious issue that should never have been allowed through the QA process.I am able to unlock vsync and run the game approaching 120fps but it's very stuttery, the only way to get the game to run smoothly for me is to run it at 60hz with full vsync and this seems to remove most of the problems.Thankfully, the actual game itself is great, the racing is fast and furious and the handling superb.In essence, it's a great game but a poor PC port, there aren't even any options for AA.Despite the reservations I have about MotoGP 14 on the PC,  I'm still thoroughly enjoying it as the base game itself is excellent and the Career mode is really fun this time around.Whether the game is for you or not depends on how you feel about slightly shoddy console ports.....

												The graphics on this game are a bit choppy due to graphics card needing to be upgraded and i understand that but i have other issues. The sound is horrible. The backfire on the bikes sound like someone beating on a drum. Really guys, a drum beat for the backfire sound. lol. Crashes also sounds like someone beating on some metal object. Just horrible sounds. Now, for some reason, everytime i start the game up, i have to redo my controller settings. I don't understand why this happens but its not saving my controller settings. Pitiful!!! One other note, two people so far have told me that the game won't even start up. Go figure. Im not surprised at all with this games bugs. I anticapated the bugs in this game as a result of the '13 bugs but to make this game worse, im not getting this. I think the rights to this game should be given to some other gaming company to produce and that could do a better job at this, maybe EA Sports just to name one. This is really pathetic. Also, the only way i can exit the game is to force close with the Task manager and because of that, i lost my progress. Nice. All that work i did lost.  lol. Oh, and  i almost forgot, im missing some of the Moto2/3 bikes due to DLC. I just bought the season pass DLC thinking i would get the bikes i was missing. Nope, don't have them. If im missing something, please let us know about the missing DLC bikes.			"

												MotoGP 13 was okay (even rather good in places) but ultimately flawed.  However, the improvements required were obvious and should have been easy for Milestone to fix.  Well, they didn't - in fact, they've made it worse.  Much, much worse.There are virtually no graphics quality settings whatsoever and no AA control at all.  In-game graphics are a bizarre mixture of out-of-focus fuzziness for when in the pit, to glossy realism on the podium, to a jagged mess (due to no AA) on the track.  Bike control hasn't improved, still no proper XB360 controller for PC, exiting the game currently requires CTRL+ALT+DEL and Task Manager, tyre grip still isn't modelled, bike setup is still childishly pointless because it does so little.  And now it's riddled with DLC.I'm a big fan of MotoGP but how on Earth Dorna Sports can let such a potentially fantastic license be ruined by such inept software development is beyond me.  Milestone claim to have fully revamped the game engine but the evidence for this is painfully absent.Don't waste your money on this game.			"

												Best physics in a motorcycle game so far.  Been playing on Pro physics with an XBOX One controller.  The throttle response and traction control feedback from this controller is outstanding as it has a hepatic feedback in the brake and throttle triggers.  One I got past the learning curve (no pun intended) the game became very addicting.  The detail at the track (COTA in particular) is very accurate.  Even the billboards and advertising is spot on as seen at each persepctive track.  Finally a motorcycle racing game that I can appreciate.			"

												In it's current form, it seems like a step back from MotoGP 13. There is currently no way to adjust the AA, shadows, fog, etc. There also are very apparent bugs present…for example, once in career mode you cannot exit to the desktop without force quitting with the task manager. There is no way to save controller settings. The frame rate slows down and gets choppy and I even have the 2 settings turned off (AFX and High Res textures) where with MotoGP 13 i have everything set to on and high without the slightest hit to framerate. This iteration feels rushed and thus far a single V1.1 patch has not been released since the game came out in June of 2014. If the patch comes out and the improvements are made then I will change my stance. I want to love this game as MotoGP is a passion of mine. As it stands I barely can add the word ""like"" when describing it.			"

												This game is far from optimised for the PC platform. We've been waiting for a patch to fix many bugs, major and minor, since June, and so far we still have a game working at 75%. The community support from Milestone has been terrible since the launch of this game. Communication has never been their strong point for titles like MotoGP, WRC, etc, which I suppose is equally as bad as their efforts to release games which are worthy of being retail releases. Perhaps one of the biggest gripes I have is the limited video options you get with this title. As per usual in a Milestone game, you cannot change the video settings in-game; the launcher is where you have to make your changes, and once you're in-game, that's it. Not only that, but the options you actually get to choose from are dire, and the game, even when bumped up to the highest settings, looks tacky for a PC game. I wouldn't consider myself that much of a graphics snob, but there's a line you cannot go back over once we're into a new generation.There's a good game in here somewhere, but it's surrounded by problems, from stupid to complex. Therefore, I won't be recommending this game, neither will I be recommending any Milestone product until they pull their finger out to improve 1) the quality of their games for release, and 2) their general customer support.

												I am impressed with this game as far as the way the bikes feel to control once you get the hang of it. At first it was hard to get used to it but after using the engineer to fix up handling problems this game becomes addictive. Its only a shame that the game is buggy and there doesn't seem to be any update available to fix the  bugs. On my rig I seem to be unable to get out of the game as it lacks the button to quit the game back to Windows. I have to quit the game using task manager. Graphics look good for the game but could do with more optimisation for PC graphics as this seems like a a lazy console port. Not worthy of full price but a bonus bargain at 75% off at sale. Though with anymore bugs in the game then I would definitely have felt ripped off. Buy this game only after taking into account that its release for PC compatibility is just below what a good commercial game release should be. Otherewise as a motoGP game it is a solid game to play for people who fancy racing motorbikes  or is a fan.			"

												Il start by saying there isnt much improvement over 13, in fact, besides some AI changes and the addiction of some events, it is basically the same game in term of graphic, sound, physics, overall is the same engine with some tweaks.You can see the diference in AI, specially when you are ridding a weak bike in all classes, on tracks with many straight points, you will have to take advantage of the limited AI behiavor in corners to create gap betwen them and balance for straight parts were they catch you, but if you ride a factory bike, there isnt much diference from 13 in term of dificulty.One thing i think its important to say, like it was in 13, if you are looking for performance, always do Qualifying & Race, believe me, it make all the diference, again, specially if you are in weaker team, starting at end of the pack and trying to reach on front may be a little frustrating since slow riders will make you loose precious time and create a huge gap with the front riders, off course that depend from dificulty and also number of laps, but in 3 laps in realistic, i found that doing the qualifying improved not only my performance but also my experience in the game, since its diferent to fight with 2 or 3 riders that with 20 at same time.Overall, i still recomend this game if you are fan of bikes, its entertaining and still have few challenges to complete, but if you are looking for big improvements, buy MotoGP 15 instead.

Before I did buy this game I was going thrugh the reviews, so I wasn´t expecting a lot. To make this short, this game has outdated graphics, PS3 at the best, it is a bugfest extravaganza, I can´t exit the menu without ctrl+alt+del, there is no exit button, the game has many glitches, no graphics settings, sounds aren´t so great. From what I read Milestone does not give a xxxx about all of they games. If you want to know just try the demo first. I have also tried the RIDE game demo, not good, the bad is that all of these games have great potential and Milstone just don´t care. I wish someone else can step in and make a great moto GP game that looks good, sounds good, plays good and does have an exit button.			"

												I bought the game while it was on sale. The bikes are beautiful but other than that the graphics are quite outdated including the rain effect.The game is quite hard actually I think you need a proper gamepad to play it properly or to have a chance at podium finish. It has helmet camera and while using it, external sounds are a bit muffled which is a nice touch.It also has a rather annoying bug that disables you from exiting the game most of the time so I'm forced to play in windowed mode to be able to go to task manager to shut the game down. Additonally, change to controls won't get saved either. If you like MotoGP then this game is probably good for you. If you're intrigued by MotoGP this game might fill the void until a better alternative comes.Buy it while it's put on sale by steam.			"

												Great game and good sequel to '13, gameplay seems a bit smoother and the added gameplay modes are definitely a bonus.  MotoGP and racing fans in general will be very happy.  I had graphics issues and slow gameplay initially, but found out that it defaults to the Intel graphics card.  Once I got my Nvidia card to work with the game the graphics were great!  Go on google to find the solution (type ""motogp 13 pc not detecting nvidia"" and select the first result).UPDATE 6/22/14:  A few days in, still loving the game but there are some glaring bugs:1.  After playing for a while, when I try to exit the game the prompt does not appear, so I have to alt+tab and exit using task manager in windows.2.  In career mode the menus in the trailer and garage freeze up sometimes.3.  Was qualifying for Le Mans and some of the surfaces on the track were not appearing so it looked like I was riding on clouds most of the time.4.  I preordered the game, but did NOT receive the promised free DLC for the Laguna Seca pack.  Honestly this is what I'm most upset about.Hopefully there will be an update soon that will fix these.UPDATE #2 6/25/14:  Still haven't received the DLC, even though it's advertised on the front page.  Steam took 5 days to respond to my initial inquiry and didn't do anything.  I replied with a reference to the store page and a forum thread with many others having the same issue so hopefully this will get fixed very soon.  Wondering if it may be a Milestone issue, considering all the bugs and bad reviews I've been reading.			"

												If you're a fan of Moto GP or motorcycles in general, I'd say you'll get some decent enjoyment out of this.  It's a shame it's really the only game in town.  Let me say up front that I really do like this game.  That said I do have my fair share of gripes with it.  It seems to perform better than 2013, but for a ""last gen"" game, there really is no excuse for the occasional frame drops I get.  Also, the AI is very weak, seems like a step back from last year, which wasn't great.  The AI is so linear with no personality whatsoever and are basically on rails.  Come to think of it, I am almost a season in and have not seen a single crash (that didn't involve me).  Also the difficulty is basically useless.  I want to win, but I like a challenge so, like last year, I turn it down a little until I get in the groove and then crank it back up.  However, even on medium difficulty I have issues, but it's more the inconsistency of the AI.  I can go out blind folded on Free Practice, Qualifying, and Warm Up and set the pole by 2 seconds, but on race day, certain tracks, the AI will then go out and out lap you by 3-4 seconds!  Also, I have noticed if the AI is in front of you, they are very difficult, but if and when you manage to get past them, magically they suck horribly and will fall far behind you, whereas if you do not get the position back quickly, they will continue to pull from you and there is little to be done about it.  The AI also appears to be bound by a different, more lenient set of physics laws as well, as they are able to hold corner speed that you cannot dream of in general.  Hold tight lines and accelerating faster at full lean, while you're picking the bike up and cannot keep up.  On that same note though some tracks with open fast corners, they always are extremely slow which allows you to blow by them.  Anyways, even though this review must sound highly negative, I do enjoy the game, and it offers plenty of fun to be had, and I will continue to keep playing and getting better.Side note: does anyone play this online as I can never seem to find any active lobbies?

												As of 2016-06-26 the game has been patched really well; it looks great and plays great, even on my Medium PC.I've already played through the game on console but re-bought it for my PC after a recent Steam sale. The game is more or less the same except that it looks better on PC, since I can increase the settings a fair deal, and it also seems to have been patched more or better than on console.What's different from MotoGP 13 is that the physics is noticeably different, the bike is trickier and more technical to handle, which I see as a big improvement. I play sim games partly for the technical challenge. There are more game modes as well in MotoGP 14, and more content overall, than in the previous game. The physics is not as sim-like as in Milestone's SBK games, yet is still challenging enough to be fun and rewarding.There's a huge amount of content considering each bike model handles differently from the rest, and you have three MotoGP classes. The DLCs add even more bike models to play around with. So contents galore !In summary, a really good MotoGP game, it has enough changes and new content to make playing it really worthwhile.			"

 Oh hey, it runs on AMD Radeon HD 6770m! How cool is that huh? Might help sales if the minimum system requirement reflects more accurately what it can run on.Lots of negativity on this title and i got curious as we know sometimes even bad publicity is good publicity no? It was on sale at 85% off so i thought no big loss if it's as bad as the haters say it. From hard to win, to hard to control, to exit bugs and what not, this game has taken a lot of undeserved flak and by extension, the developers. Didn't really want to buy it at first since i already got 13 but the heavy discount made me want to try it for myself and see what all the fuss is about.First, lets talk about the one race (Termas de Rio Hondo) which was exceedingly hard; i got 8th place. Incidentally, that is acceptable for career mode since the team's objective for this round is only 15th place.http://dai.ly/x4anen3Funny that this video haz got more views than my other MotoGP14 videos in which i did well, go figure :D Ok, on hindsight, this poor position may be due to the default setup for the bike which usually seems to be set to fail / lose for every track. It's not really bad per se but it's a safe setting that doesn't allow you to push the performance to it's limit. Furthermore, i did not experiment enough with all the setups nor retried the race too many times so maybe i could've done better.  This explains the frequent difficulty in handling the bike around the corners or poor top speed or poor acceleration when you go by the default setups but the above example is an extreme exception. Most of the tracks so far has been quite easy to master. As of this writing i've just completed the 8th round of the Career mode (TT Assen in The Netherlands) but it's not uploaded yet due to having exceeded my daily upload limit.IMO the developers want the players to fiddle with the setups to get the best results and learn in the process rather than hand-hold them all the way to the last race of the season with optimal setups for every track and every bike. Furthermore, as the bike gets upgrades, the optimal setup will need adjustments.The only problem as far as i can see, a minor one at that, is the inability to save custom key bindings. As for the much gripe about difficulty in winning, there's one other oft overlook aspect; bike upgrades. Initially career mode is tough to win even against easy AI. I thought the AI somehow cheated but really, as a newcomer to the sport, no one expects you to win a podium finish. Besides, a new team is likely to have sub-par bike components and inexperience in bike setups so it's a realistic scenario you're put through. You're afterall an unproven rookie rider so don't expect the top teams to take you in.So what about the exit bugs? Well in the beginning i didn't encounter it until i went into the Career mode. So the claims that it occurs in the Career mode is true but only half true. You see it only exists in full-screen (fs) mode. Not sure if it occurs in all fs resolutions but since i started using windowed mode, i've never looked back. You can see for yourself in this video and also in some other videos of mine that exit is possible in Career mode; just need to press Alt-F4. ( ok shameless self-promotion here :p )http://dai.ly/x4bz25iAs for the complaints about the lack of in-game graphic options, well there's some options you can set in the launcher. And if you need more tweaking, you can use manual override in the graphics driver app. For sure the options are not as extensive as in some games but it's enough to allow balance between performance and image quality. A note about graphics quality; many people say it's dated. Maybe so but if you compare the in-game graphics of Losail night race in the rain and the real-life video of the same which you can find in the unlocked video in the Multimedia feature of the game, you'll find that it's a surprisingly accurate rendition of the actual scene; surface reflections and all.In summation, this game is thoroughly enjoyable - just give it a fair chance. As of this writing, i've already put 34 hours into it. Nothing to complain about really and no game breaking bugs. If you're afraid of savegame corruption just make a backup of the savegame directory which can be found in C:\Users\""your username""\AppData\Roaming\Milestone .Final note: The replay highlights which was present in perhaps all previous MotoGP and SBK series has been removed from this version so you'll have to find your own interesting portion of the replays yourself.Verdict: 7.5/10 Would be 8.5 if the developers didn't skimp on graphics options or game features present in previous iterations. Highly recommended if you don't already own 13, recommended if you're a fan of the series or if you're like me and just want to find out for yourself what's all the hoopla surrounding this release.Unrelated side note: Of all the motorcycle games from Milestone, the one i like best is really Ride just 'coz the scenery is varied instead of just typical track layout. If only Ride has a massive open-world map like Test Drive Unlimited 2 then it would be perfect !!! Either TDU3 needs more motorcycles or Ride needs more open-world. :D			"

I'm in the States and play on PS3 so i have been stuck with Motogp 10/11 and this just blows it out of the water. But that graphics are not that bad and t runs smoothly. the only thing that i have encountered that was off is when i am racing in the wet, my helmet is gray. That only happens in career mode so maybe its just that but idk. It is a must buy if you are a fan of Motogp or motorcycle racing.			"

												I have owned and played every single MotoGP game, and for the last few years I have been buying on PC instead of console.14 is slick game play and makes for some great racing, real close quarters battles.However, this game is currently buggy, even to the point of appearing to be an unfinished beta.1. After a race or two, you can no longer exit the game without using Ctrl-Alt-Del and ending task.2. The graphics are so choppy right at the wrong time. Frame rate drops 5 or 6 times per lap, usually at different parts of the track. It doesn't seem to be related to how many riders are around you, it just stutters terribly, making you run off track. If it wasn't for the rewind function I would never finish a lap.The only way to make the game playable right now is to use RadeonPro or similar to force the refresh rate to 60Hz and push the frame rate as high as possible.When this game is fixed, it will be great. Until then, it sucks.			"

												My bike sim experience includes SBK 2011, SBK Generations, Motogp 13, and now Motogp 14. All are Milestone titles. The SBK series was extremely well polished, great sims, included lots of features, and I enjoyed them thoroughly. The Motogp series, OTOH, has been a bit of a disappointment.Motogp 13 doesn't include SBK standard features such as telemetry data and ghost in time attack mode. Motogp 14 is more of the same. Also, in the SBK series, you had to be extremely careful not to go off track because you'd lose traction if you were on the throttle or brake in anything but an upright position. In Motogp 13, you can pin the throttle while fully leaned over off-track and you'd never have to worry about losing traction. Motogp 14 is more of the same.Motogp 13 had a few bugs but the main one that affected me was the online play. Connectivity through Raknet was horrible. Motogp 14 chose to go with Raknet again so I'm not holding my breath when it comes to multiplayer. Another bug in Motogp 13 was that enabling vsync in-game would cause choppy frame rates. Motogp 14 again has issues with choppy frame rates, remedied somewhat through config.ini modifications, but looks like a step backward compared to Motogp 13. While the replay mode in Motogp 14 looks stunning, in game is a different matter as the lack of anti-aliasing makes for blocky imagery that looks like low-res textures have been upscaled.Another disappointment is the inclusion of more bugs. The controller settings are not saved, forcing you to reinput your settings each time you restart the game. Also, if you play the career mode, the quit option is not accessible, forcing you to use CTRL ALT DEL to quit the game.That being said, I really enjoyed the helmet cam view in Motogp 13, and thankfully Motogp 14's helmet cam retains the same enjoyment. Motogp 14 has also tweaked the physics, limiting your ability to the slide and brake during cornering bringing about a less arcadish experience.Motogp 13 felt like a beta version that was sold to consumers. Motogp 14 feels like more of the same but with even more bugs and graphical issues. A recurring theme of recent Milestone titles appears to be to release untested console ports that force consumers to wait for patches that may never come. While I can find enjoyment in the game, after consecutive releases that have been full of bugs, I've lost faith that future releases from Milestone would be any different. I'd love to see another developer take a shot at Motogp.Purchase at your own risk.			"

												Whilst I recommend MotoGP 14, it has its few problems. For one, the graphics options and, particularly, post-processing and anti-aliasing, are virtually non-existent, making the game not all that great to look at. The bikes and riders are well re-created and they look the part, but the graphics are lacking in the environment department, textures wise. Flat grass textures in this age of graphics is pretty much inexcusable. This said, the gameplay is quite solid and I have had no real issues with it. Controls on an Xbox 360 controller feel much better than they did on the last MotoGP game I played (MotoGP '07) and since then, rather than having to create a team and choose a bike to ride, they've made vast improvements on a progression through career mode, very much akin to the F1 and WRC series of games (especially WRC as they are the same developers) where you join real-world teams. Apart from being a blatant port to PC, it's pretty good so far.			"

												Mirred by a multitude of glitches and errors, Milestone definitely took a step backwards wtih the latest release in the MotoGP series.  The most annoying of the glitches with this game is the inability to exit from the game after entering into a career mode.  Users find themselves exiting using CTRL-ALT-DEL and then ending the game in the systems processes window.  This obviously is a testament to the poor QA by Milestone and their failure to properly BETA the game prior to release.  Several users also complain of a buggy Visual C++ Runtime Error.  Other graphic anomalies and poor intergration with Nvidia drivers makes this promising game a complete bust.  Users will be better off waiting for the game price to drop (which it definitely will in the next few weeks) and/or for Milestone to fix the numerous issues with this game.  STICKK WITH MOTOGP13 and you'll defilnitely come out on top!			"

You know how useful those reviews are, you know, the ones from kiddies that don't know how to ride a motorcycle in the first place, or don't have the funds to buy 14 so thats why they like MotoGP2013 better? Don't listen to Steam Reviews, Youtube gameplay or check out twitch to see how good a game is before you write it off. You are missing out if you don't and are into motorcycle racing, this is a great game with aggressive challenges. It's too real for everyone else. You need a gaming computer to play it, otherwise stop complaining about choppy graphics and stuttering gameplay. It runs perfectly smooth on my machine, if you have video card issues, fix it and stop leaving bad reviews because you'd rather buy another game for your computer rather than upgrading it so you can actually play the new game how it's supposed to be played. Oh, by the way, you're gonna want a controller for this one. Mouse and keyboard don't work very well, for me at least. I highly recommend it.			"

The gameplay is fine, possibly even better than 2013's game, but that gets overlooked when you realize that the career mode only has half the riders it's meant to (and the others are ""day one"" DLC that hasn't been released now some week and a half after the game was released. It's quite disappointing for anyone who wanted to play career and is a fan of MotoGP or Moto2/3 that the riders they're looking forward to racing aren't actually taking part in the races. There's a few new game modes, some of which are interesting, but for me at least, the lack of functioning career mode with all the riders (And the few bugs i've encountered - you can't exit the game if you play career mode, you have to alt+f4, etc) mean that I can't really recommend it. Wait and see, and perhaps it'll get better, if we ever get the support we want from the devs, that is.			"

												This game is awful. Truly awful.If you already have MotoGP 13, DO NOT BUY 14. It's the same game, it's just been given some new menu's, a few crappy new modes, and updated bike liveries. Everything else is practically identical to MotoGP 13. How it took Milestone a year just to do a few crappy updates is beyond me. Lets do a little breakdown...The graphics: Awful, worse than '13 and there's even less options.The UI: Where the hell is the quit button? Non existant. To quit it's CTRL+ALT+DEL.The handling: No different from '13.The AI: Still riding as if you aren't on circuit with them. The biggest problem: The game stutters like crazy. I'm running it on an i7 4770K + GTX 770 OC, yet it's as if every 3 seconds or so it drops to about 15FPS for a few moments, then gets back to normal for 3 seconds, then repeats. This makes it just horrible on the eyes. It's even more obvious in the menu's.My score: 2/10If you really want a MotoGP game, buy '13 instead, '14 will make you feel desperately ripped off. Don't consider buying it until it's around £5.			"

												For under $10 bucks its a good game. Even if at the full price its decent content for the money. I don't see a way to properly replicate the motorcycle environment in your game room like I can a car sim. So as far as physics I cant rate this game because I am using a controller, and I don't have a sim bike. Its pretty easy to play with a controller considering I don't play moto style games much. I got 1st every race so far at pro difficulty. I guess that means the AI sucks. But a nice easy game is fun to have every once in a while. I am not a motorcycle guy. I just wanted a motorcycle game, and it was on sale.  After all the negative feedback I was expecting a lot worse, but at least I did not expect much. Its a milestone game, enough said there.One con is the control mapping page say button number rather than whether it is a-b-y-x Lb-Rb-Lt-Rt. In the game its tells you, but in the mappings it dont. I wanted to know what button was back brake so I can slide the turns. I figured it out, after a bit of work. Moto15 is coming out so this will probably go on sale again. Its runs perfect at max settings on my old out dated PC at 1920x1080 at about 120 to 260 fps mostly at 180.Gigabyte EP45T-UD3PIntel QX965016GB DDR3 PC3-12800 RamGigabyte Windforce HD7970 3GB 384bit AMD Graphics cardIntel 240GB SSD drive "

												The game provides a very reallistic riding experience, especially with TCS off. Very demanding controls but once you learn how to handle the powerful bikes you can go much faster without TCS. The graphics are decent, no clipping, jagged edges, etc on my machine running it at full settings. However the game is plauged by several technical bugs that have no business being in a finished game. The control schemes do not save after exiting the game so if you change the controls you have to do so again every time you start the game up or they revert back to default. Also the game has no exit button. Sometimes alt + F4 works but sometimes you get stuck with having to force close the game with the task manager. I personally have never been able to connect to the online portion of the game even for uploading race times. The game has a lot of potential but really falls short and it feels like the developer just rushed it out with little to no testing. Very dissapointing after spening $40 on the game. With that said, avid moto gp fans will enjoy the authenticity and the actual racing mechanics but the game has very little depth to keep you interested after a season or two. I can't honestly recommend this game to anyone other than die hard racing fans who might at least get some enjoyment out of it.			"

												Game play seems to be great. Better than previous MotoGp titles...can't wait to enjoy it.  As mentioned, jagged graphics are very distracting.  No ability to turn off HUD (mini map, laps,...) ruins the feel of helmet view.  Most important to me is having to spend hours on gamepad customization.  Ended up ditching Steel Series and buying Logitech gamepad only to end up with 360 button layout due to the games glitchy controller code.  Until there is a patch to address these and other issues, I can not recommend.			"

												Edit:Je vous explique comment se connecter en multi:- Lancer le jeu, aller dans reseau- Créer compte, rentrer les données- Aller dans sa boite mail (attention, ID + pass non envoyé par mail) et valider- Une fois validé, c'est bon!- En fait non. C'est validé, mais à chaque lancement faudra re-valider(FALLAIT SAVOIR TOUT CA! TELLEMENT EVIDENT)Bon, maintenant que j'ai joué en multi:- Choix circuits aléatoire. En 4 courses, ""l'aléatoire"" a choisi 2 fois le même circuit.- Sur les 4 parties, à deux joueurs + bots (mits d'office, pas le choix d'être seuls), chaque joueur avait sa course en mode lag. Mais des gros lags! L'écran se fige puis revient et on a fait 30m...et on tombe...A la fin de course, le jeu attend que tout le monde ait fini. Bots inclus!Après retour au lobby, impossible de changer les paramètres de course (ex: vote pour choix de circuit à la place du choix ""aléatoire"").Au lobby, le jeu se synchronise avec le serveur, faut attendre l'attribution des niveaux.Puis une fois sur deux, le jeu crash....et évidemment steam croit qu'il est encore lancé.Je commence vraiment à en avoir marre (pour pas dire autre chose) de devoir casser steam dans les processus à chaque fois que je quite ce jeu!Bref, si vous adorez les deux roues et le solo, j'ai envie de dire pourquoi pas!Si ce n'est pas le cas, achetez en promo pour limiter la casse si jamais vous n'aimez pas.-----------Pour:- Plusieurs circuits- Personnalisation des motos et pilotes sympa- Pas très moche, graphiquement ça tientContre:- Difficile à piloter car la sensibilité de la manette (même après réglage) c'est pas ça -> Razer Sabertooth 360- Je branche la manette, je lance le jeu. Si j'utilise le clavier pour naviguer, il devient prioritaire... WTF?- Mode contre la montre: plusieurs saccades- En jeu, effets escaliers (i5 2500k, 8go ram, R9 290X, SSD, install clean, 1080P full)- Avec la manette, impossible de quiter le jeu!!- Avec le clavier, j'arrive à quiter le jeu, mais il plante ce qui fait que steam croit qu'il est encore lancé (ctrl + alt + supp)- Menus bien fichus, sauf celui des réglages mécaniques de la moto, digne des années 2000....- Pas de vue moseau avant (certains diront: normal voyons!!!), mais je viens du monde des 4 roues et la vue museau pour moi est la seule possibleEnorme contre et rien que pour ça je ne le recommande pas- Mode online IMPOSSIBLE!!!!Ils disent que le nom de profil est incorrect, alors que nulle part on me propose de créer un compte ou de l'associer à un compte crée sur le net.Un pote qui l'a acheté hier rencontre le même problème!!!!J'ai effacé les 15Go et réinstallé 2x en plus de demander à Steam de vérifier le contenu, rien y fait. J'ai regardé sur internet (FR, EN, ESP) et je n'ai trouvé qu'une seule personne (sur 4 sujets trouvés) qui dit avoir réussi à se connecter à internet et qui pourtant n'a vu aucun serveur en ligne.

												Before I buy a game that I think I'll like, I always look at the bad reviews. If I think I'll like, it will most likely be for the same reasons someone else likes it. I saw the bad reviews and thought that I could deal with the little quips that most people found with the game. Man, I was wrong. Granted, I don't know much about Motorcycle sims, MotoGP 13 destroyed this one in terms of sheer likability. I'm more of a Forza person, but I loved MotoGP 13. This one felt very dry and boring.*Edit: Then again, my gamepad doesn't have rumble. That physical feedback is integral in any racing sim.			"

												Pondscum console port with more bugs than bikes, no deadzone/sensitivity options to increase feel and no real graphics options. When the game works its great, but there are too many inexcusable issues that should have been fixed. I do not recommend the game in it's current state, and I seriously doubt the devs will fix it considering their lack of support/care/competence so far.			"

												Hello! after 2.8 hrs playing the game I can say that, it is a great game nice graphics and sounds but still dificult as a game, my best performance was 4th place and with a lot of pressure. Definitly you can not play this game without a joystick so you better think about it.  I recommend this game if you like the speed but if you get frustated as soon as you hit the race......this is not for you, you have try and try and re try to get better.See you around bikers.Ohh by the way, I can not change my nickname ""player1"" and for that reason I am not able to play online......what a shame...

												If you are into GP and enjoy motorcylces this is a pretty good game for you. Not many options out there but hey I've enjoyed it. Career mode is fun and thrilling at times unless you have it on easy. Put the game on some harder settings and you will really get a few for why going into and coming out of a corner is important.I hear MOTOGP 15 is pretty much the same as this one so you might as well just get this. Career mode will take you a good while so you have some plenty of hours of entertainment.			"

												The game is good some glitches like always in all games but its not like unplayable the control is weird at beggining cause is a sim game not a arcade at all if u expect get on the ducati and ride like trinity in Matrix u wont be able by a time, cause u can do it even faster than her but u must know how to. if u want a bike multiplayer ammm the multiplayer manager is like very bad i have been playing this from 13 and i dnt have a single friend since then i mean i have find another guys racing there hope they remember me as i do lol but theres no voice, there is no friend list in game, so u cant send invites at all u must add the guy or girl incredibly i have found at least 4 female gamer names in this game anyway well at least something not so bad in the multiplayer anyway but i let the best part for the end in order to play online u must register in a aditional server list and verify u are a human and stuff like that if u read this Milestone people do something about it u know ur product is good but u are not doing it easy and that my friends is necesary cause if i wanna race when i get home from the  job last thing i wanna do is fight your game in order to enjoy a good race cause u already know u must invert some time in the game for start to have fun i have to invert time in gameplay and also learning ur weird online system Milestone keep on eye on that ""#$% in other stuff something is very nice is a feature called beat the champions or something like that is very very fun cause is like an scenario in fifa u must beat an opponent or severeal in cetanly part of a race based on true moto gp races that ones are very fun and epic if u are like moto gp fan. The game 4 be played like a maniac in single player is very fun and addictive if u like bikes for real cause if u expect turn the bike like a pro in the first 4 hours of game go and find something else, the multiplayer must be adictive too and very competitive if it was more easy to get something from it its a good game but this series still need some work.(as personal): I used to play this since xbox live moto gp yeahhhh that one that used to be a demo with mech warriors in thosee years the company who made the game was named Climax any one any one i mean it can tell me where are thosse guys??? moto gp games used to be very good.

												I have waited for a decent MotoGP game. I did not buy the 2013 version when I read of the problems.This year, even though people were reporting similar issues, I caved in and bought MotoGP2014, hoping I could sort the controls out for myself.Well, the game is FANTASTIC, but it is ruined by a few problems.I cannot exit from the game - Can a game developer seriously forget to put in an exit button? Or if there is one, make sure it actually works? I have to CtrlAltTab. Even then I have to restart my pc every time, as the app continues to run in the background and cannot be closed from task manager.I cannot map my G27 buttons. It simply will not recognise them properly, no matter what I do. I have plenty of experience in mapping keys and buttons & can usually find a way with these things, but this has severe problems - it MUST be fixed by developers.I cannot get my mapped keys to save for next time.So overall, I am trying to play a really promising game using keyboard, which makes precise leaning of the bike extremely difficult.I DO NOT recommend buying this UNTIL these issues are fixed. Sorry Milestone, but I really hope I can return and change this to a positive review very soon if a patch fixes these basic errors.EDIT: 4 mnths later I have decided to change it to a thumbs up. I stand by my review and I am disappointed in the lack of proper fixes by Milestone - they have let themselves down as there are lots of unhappy customers because of this.  But the truth is, I enjoy the game, and I use a workaround to get race v qual pace working correctly.I just have to put up with the annoying ctrl Alt Del & retsart pc every time I want to end the game.And I am using an xbox controller which is ok as long as I follow a set method to avoid losing my bindings.So for the fact that it's enjoyable and unlike other games I will actually come back to this game from time to time, I have decided to give a thumbs up.

												Ok, having played this game abit more with AFX turned off it is alot better and much improved compared to 13.The riding is the best when set to full simulation and this is where it belongs and is most rewarding.Some things lacking are the audio, GP bikes sound crazy but these are very flat.Track detail are very bland some circuit backdrops are beutiful in real life but in the game you rarely take notice of anything beyond the bland grass. Those who to to a track such as Philip Island will imediately notice the beatiful sea from the back straight or the lush mountains surounding Mugello. Makes world  class tracks feel uninspiring.Afew very basic bugs that shouldn't be there are No way of exiting the game when you exit campaing mode. Yes that's right check the HUB it's the number 1 issue. You need to bring up the windows task manager and kill the proces.....ConTROLLs don't save properly sometimes it decides to choose to use saved controls and other times it doesn't.Research selection in Campaing mode gets reset if you restart the race, so sometime you may not get the research points you should have if you're research selection is on something that has just maxed out...Can do better force feed back for controllers, some parts are very good but others not so. I still feel MotoGP 08 is better in this aspect and regarding the sound as well. Graphics are better here but track environment is much better in 08. Yes I am still comparing a 2014 game to a 2008 game....The need for a perfect MotoGP game asside this is better than MotoGP 13 so I guess they're improving. If there is anything they should keep from this game for the future is the ride mechanics/simulation. It's properly good. Everything else working please.			"

Free DLC for MotoGP2 / MotoGP3. MotoGP 14 bikes are quicker handling than all road bikes in RIDE. Racing is tighter on MotoGP circuits than the road races in RIDE. I got it on sale for less than the price of the RIDE DLC that doesn't work (RIDE DLC shows in Steam library but not within RIDE game).

You Can Play Grand Prix, Career Mode, Real Events, Challenge The Champions, You Can Even Play With The Safety (BMW) Car!

												This game is just a waste of money peroid, i can run Arma3 on my system no problem, this game, gets to the last loading screen then crashes, poorly optimized if it even is, waste of money even in a sale, never been so disgusted with a purchase ever in steam, but this is it.			"

												The same bugs which need some fixes and asap. The graphics aren't the best as they promised , and to tell you the truth unless they won't fix it don't ever bother to get in touch with it. The money just gone for nothing, i really try to mention Milestone the bugs i have now , and the sooner the better to notify them.			"

												MotoGP 2014.It is a realistic game with (too) many options to customise your bike.Sometimes you have no idea what you're doing with the customize settings.The racing itself seems fine. It is fun and it will become familiar the further the game goes.A bad thing is Career Mode. In the earlier MotoGP's there was a 'street'-racing start and you got on the real tracks later.In my opinion isn't the career mode that fun anymore			"

												Best Motogp game yet. When I play a good motorcyle game and I find myself riding the bike like I was acually racing I know its a good game. Adjusting bike settings before each racing depending on weather and type of track, looking thru corners, banging the gears down before a tight turn, trying to perfect my racing lines. This is the first Motogp game I got that superbike X game seriers feel. Great game alot of fun.			"

												I am a bit disapointed with this one as it doesnt fix many of the problems that moto 13 had. The use of the wheel for example still hasnt been resolved and the programme lags a fair bit but will try a few thing to see if it stops it . Other than that still getting use to it and will say more later as I am use to it .			"

												A really nice Motorbike game held back by being a poor console port. Pro:Good physicsNice graphics in partsChallengingCons:Simplistic A.IConfig file need editing to enable high resolutionsProne to crashingNeed to close Steam.exe process to properly exit the gameXbox Controller icons don't appear in-game (simply refers to 'button 5' for example) "

												Great game! If you like any kind of motorcyle racing or road racing this game will be fun for you. It has great AI that makes for intense racing and the career mode is very deep. I play alot of racing games and this is by far the best motogp game I've played. Support milestone and purchase this game. The company has been putting alot of effort into motogp and MXGP games recently and I would love to see them keep making great games.			"

												I was a biker for 20 years so was looking forward to this game, but am unable to play.UPDATE:  New gaming pc and its working. The graphics are certainly outdated already, but its okay. With limited options (they also made ""Ride"") in this genre, i won't be too critical. MotoGP 15 looks much better, probably better off picking up the basic ""compact"" version of it for cheap.Some others mentioned bugs, but not enough to think it would be a issue. Well despite being modest graphics (my pc is fine for most of the latest and greatest games and meets the requirements) in the 5 minutes I was able to play it had frame-rate issues and then just froze up and after a few minutes of CTRL-ALT-DEL, ESC and no responses I had to just turn off the PC without a proper shutdown!  So I restarted, lowered the graphics settings and tried again. It froze up in the menus before even starting this time.  I had very few issues with any of my games or my pc - this game must be full of bugs and don't want to crash my computer over it now so can't play!  Should give refunds for this bs! I think the same issue with Ride, they need to fix games before making new ones. I won't buy from them again.			"

												This could have been sucha great game but all the bugs do break the game down to lots of frustration. As you can tell i have played this alot, and it is more then what steam shows as i do have this for Xbox360. Beeing a big fan of any racing game that have Bikes in it and a lack of games in that genre made me push thru and keep playing. But now that MotoGp 15 is out just go and get that and don´t worry about this./Kisses			"

												I like racing in the game - the driving model is decent. Otherwise it is a bug-fest - it doesn't save your control settings, most of the time you cannot exit the game properly, sometimes it crashes. No Casey Stoner among legends. As for simulator I would recommend to add the possibility to jump starts, overdo wheeling, get hurt at crashes thus missing some races in a championship...			"

												If you love motorcycle games, then STOP buying Milestone games.They need to lose their MotoGP license, etc. so an actual game Studio can take over and develop actual games.You've been warned.This game launched once and never again.0.7 Hours gameplay says it all			"

												What a disappointment, the game just feels ""Strange"",  in-game menus are blurred as well the paddock seems to be in 720p, this version does not have any type of anti-aliasing jagged edges everywhere, the controls respond in an odd way.Sound Quality continues bad...  The game frequently crashes and stops working. Good side, the lighting quality has improved, and object quality are better. Whit all this problems i can not find will to continue the gameplay, MotoGP 13 was better.4.8/10			"
