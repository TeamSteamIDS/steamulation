												All I want is an up-to-date baseball game I can play on the PC. I feel like we haven't had one for years and RBI Baseball comes close but its so insanely buggy that its close to unplayable.I've played RBI for just a few hours, here's what I've seen:- Can't throw- Online opponent can't throw- Player I'm controlling starts running off the field- Outs not recognized- Hit-by-pitch not recognized- Pop-up catches not recognized- Mercy rule not honored- Throws going to the playerI'm not looking for a dialed in, well balanced, baseball simulator. I like the arcade feel of RBI, but the bugs are making it a real challenge to play and I can't see myself putting some serious time in with this game because of them... The good news is, they've already patched the game once, maybe we'll see more patches shortly to address some of the playability issues. I do like the feel of the game has potential and it is a baseball game I want to play. But in its current state, don't get it.			"

												This is about as bare bones as you can get for a sports game,  Very limited options, no trades during the season, no free agency, no multiple seasons...  it's generally lacking in many areas which sports games have become known for in recent years.The good -  it has the official MLB license, which means real teams and players.  It's simplistic and very casual, you can just pick up and play, other than getting timing down for hitting it's easy to play.  If you are an older gamer you'll appriciate the throw back to old sports games.The bad  -  The game just isn't anywhere near the standard sports games have been held too far years.  Lack of options, lack of customization, lack of multiple seasons.  While these things were common place back in the the early 2000's when games were limited, those limitations don't exist anymore.  The graphics are kind of meh, that normally doesn't matter in sports games but the player animations are rough, they glide rather than run.  Also it seems to have quite a few issues with fielding on line drives...Generally speaking, Super Mega Baseball is a far superior product, which is only held back by it's lack of a MLB license.  I'd only recommend this game if you're a massive hardcore fan of throwback games.  Even then it's a tough recommendation because the game just isn't very fun to play.. "

												This is the first review I have ever written here on the Steam forums. Unfortunately, this is the first time that I have felt the need to do so in order to warn others of possible support issues with the support for the game. I'm not going to go into details, but if you are thinking about buying the game, go to the forums for the game here first, to see what other people are having problems with and the lack of response by the developer, among other things.If you do decide to buy it, I would heavily advise you to stay under the 2-hour rule for Steam's refund policy,and make your decision in two weeks, so you can refund the game if you too, find it unacceptable.

												This is a nice game. It's a retro style Baseball game with an arcade feel to it. The graphics are decent; not over the top, and not bad either. It's good to see an MLB game on the PC. Positives:A Baseball game back on the PCWorks with a Logitech Dual Action Controller, however some of the controls don't match up; hit is button 1, bunt button 2, steal button 3 (and direction).  All of those controls are easy to use though. :)Pitching and hitting are funSeason mode with statsChoice of 162 games in a season, 82, or 51. (Yes season mode appears to work now so far. the relief pitcher bug is now fixed. :)MLB rostersSounds of the crowd are pretty good, they cheer when they should; sounds cool when someone hits a homerun as wellGames can be played in a reasonable amount of time. I lost 6-2 in my first season game and it lasted around 45 minutes. It took me 1-2 exhibition games to get used to the controls, but they are pretty good.Minus:Fielding is a bit tough at first, but you can set it on assist which means the fielders do the fielding and you do the throwing if needed.Graphics could be betterNo Myplayer, and no trades. Mouse control in the menus (or at all) isn't supported; have to use keyboard or gamepad.There are a few bugs I ran into like a pitcher fielding the ball in the 12th on the mound, and he couldn't throw or move. This only happened once so far though.Overall:Pick up this game if you want a decent MLB game, and you want to support PC sports games.			"

50/100If you are really desperate to play a baseball game on the PC then this game is it. All in all it is a playable game and it does have some of the old arcade feeling and gameplay, but overall the game is a let down and just feels empty and cheap. Now with Steam refunds there is no risk in buying it and trying it out, but you will probably want to wait till you see it on a 75% sale.Pro:  It's a baseball game on the PC It does have some of the old arcade feeling Official teams and season Updated roster and stats (if you care about that) The menu's with player stats etc in between games does look good, very big contrast to the  graphics in the gameCon: The game feels static and empty (as an unfinished game with missing features and details) All players have little to no animations. Specially no idle animations Minimal controls and the control response feels slow and you can't rebind the controls The game constantly gives you control over the wrong fielder when you have to catch a ball and the overal positioning of fielders is really lacking (cos they are static standing AI statues up to the moment the ball goes into the field and you don't have any control over their general fielding positioning) AI fielders stand on the same spot when they do a (foul) catchball. You see 3 AI standing (clipping) inside each other. Looks like one guy with 6 arms Under par graphics and generally low detail The scaling of the stadions are way off. Tiny miniature crowd, huge dugouts, unrealistic tribune size, etc No stadion speaker, no sports commentary (a huge miss and makes it really lack atmosphere) No adjustable camera for batting and pitching and both pitching and batting is done from the batter perspective (home plate) All player models look basically the same, even the star players. They are all the same length, thickness, etc. When you start a game after the loading screen you are immediately dropped into the game as a batter. The first throw from the pitcher is literally within 3 seconds after the loading screen. No (birdseye zoom in or seeing the batter walking up to the plate) camera intro, no nothing. There are some more things I could place in the con list, but you get the idea.Similar conclusions in a video review:

												This game takes me back to my Sega Genesis days playing World Series Baseball and Ken Griffey Jr. Presents MLB on the SNES. As a kid I put so many hours into those games, studied the stats and never blinked once. This is nostalgic. It doesn't compare in any way, shape or form to the MLB games of today as this was made to feel old school.The graphics are basic and the gameplay is VERY fast, which I love. You can play a 9-inning game in 20 minutes and there are no cut-scenes or replays in between plays or innings and that is just fine with me.The menus are very clean and easy to navigate. I didn't expect to have the rosters update and stay current with the actual MLB clubs, so that is a very nice touch. I am playing with an XBox controller and the controls are not perfect. I swear I'll press right on the d-pad to throw to first base but the ball will go to second. Frustrating, but I can live with it. Hitting is very straight-forward and easy. Pitching can be challenging but it is nowhere near as difficult as fielding (atleast for me). I can't catch a fly-ball to save my life. I find it very hard to judge where the ball is going to land.Anyways enough about me. This game is a lot of fun and it is highly recommended for baseball video game fans of the early to mid 90's. I plan to put many more hours into this game!			"

												I originally gave this game a poor review because of the pitcher substitution bug that made the game unplayable. However that was fixed rather quickly (1 day). I am now pretty pleased with the game. I have an occasional graphics bug where weird lines go through the playing field, etc. Quitting the game, then opening the game again and continuing my game in progress fixes the issue.I love this game for what it is. I work in an office 50+ hours a week. I like being able to play a quick game here and there. A game can take as little at 20 minutes. Hitting and pitching is pretty easy. It definitely reminds me of the classic nostalgic games I played growing up. It reminds me of the baseball games on Sega Genesis with more recent/modern graphics. They do a great job of releasing roster updates as well. It's about time baseball comes back to PC.			"

												I'm a WiiU and PC guy and this game fills a nice missing void in my life.  I like the simplistic sports games that just involve playing the sport and not so much a managment sim.  R.B.I.  Seems to be just that.  There are the standard managment options but I don't feel like I need to spend 30 min setting up just to play an actul game.  It is not on the level of the 2k games, but if your a fan of baseball, or classic style baseball games pick this up.			"

												Really fun to play. This is not meant to be an in-depth sim like The Show, just a fun, two-button game where you press a button and hope your pitcher yanks one over the wall. You're supposed to leave your starter in for all 9 innings and laugh when he can't get his 4 seamer above 60mph, but still strikes out the side anyway. Most negative reviews I'm seeing missed the point. This game was meant to be even simpler than Ken Griffey Jr. Baseball for the N64 back in the late 90's, and I think it's done that. Although that game will always be the best baseball game of all time, RBI feels much the same. I would have liked a more intuitive UI. We can't play local multiplayer without two 360 controllers, which is a pain. Feels a bit underdeveloped / rushed. I hope the success of this game will spark development of a cross-platform PC baseball sim (such as The Show or something similar) where people can be more competetive and in-depth.			"

												I really do have fun with this game, but I would not recommend this game to anybody unless you are a hardcore baseball fan and really want to play a baseball game on the computer. When you buy the game, you know that it isn't going to be an MLB The Show quality baseball game, but a fun arcade style baseball game.        I do really enjoy a baseball game on the computer to play, but for how much the game costs, it is not worth it. It needs to polished a bit more, the controls need to be fixed and there needs to be a something that tells you the controls( if there is something besides the loading screen which lasts not long enough to read it, than it needs to be more apparent), and it also needs more content for how much it costs.       I would recommend this if it was $5 or even $10 dollars but it is a pricey $20 dollars and there are many other things you could get for that money. I do enjoy playing the game when I am bored but that is just me. I really do appreciate how baseball is being brought back to the computer and xbox, but this just isnt good enough. I have spent probably over 600 hours in MLB: The Show 14 and am still playing it, so I would love if the PC got it's own quality baseball game.       If the game goes on sale for anything $10 dollars or under I recommend picking it up, but for now you should just wait until it goes on sale.			"

												A trip down memory lane to the sega/snes days. Game is not without flaws, lacks customization, play by play and alot of the little things that make the console games so realistic. It does have season mode(26,52 and 162 games), stat tracking and roster updates along with all major league players.If you own a console you probably won't enjoy this unless you're specifically looking for an arcade experience. For PC gamers with a baseball itch, this will definitely suffice as long as you have reasonable expectations. If you're only moderately interested in baseball I would suggest waiting for a sale.  Hopefully this is the start of more sports games coming to PC.			"

This game is arcadey thru and thru, do not expect any real depth like MLB The Show on PS4. It's the only baseball game we've gotten in YEARS. Show your support and buy this game, have fun with it and get your $20 worth. That way we can get something more in-depth and complex (like we're used to on consoles) for the future. TLDR: Fun game, not complex or deep at all, but what do you expect for $20? Fun enough to pay $20 for.			"

												Great game. The purpose was to take an old game and put a new face on it, and the developers did a great job. The stadiums look beautiful and the players look great. The gameplay is very good and I enjoy playing.ProsCasual playing - if you just want to have fun and not worry about the intricacies of the game, this game is great.Levels - I'm so glad they added the skill levels. I'd rather see a lot of runs and not spend my time cursing, so I like playing on Easy, but if I want a challenge I can move it up to medium or difficult.Fielding - mostly fielding is pretty fun (Fly balls are difficult to catch)Again, they did a great job with the field, players, timing, and scale.MLB rosters (no trades, though)ConsNo dive/jump button! There are so many times when the ball is so close to my player and I can't dive! What baseball game doesn't have a dive button? Dive should be A instead of switching players.There is some bleedthrough of directional control from pitching to grounders. For example, if I'm trying to move the ball to the left and the batter hits it, my fielder has already moved 10 feet to the left by the time the ""overhead camera"" shows me the field.You can only sub players when they're at bat, not in the field.Some foul balls that appear to be close to the field of play are just called foul and you don't get a chance to go after them.The Pros far outweigh the Cons. Great game!			"

												Just a few weeks after I'd expressed a desire for a baseball game with simplified playing mechanics and updated graphics, akin to Super Bases Loaded, I come across this game.  It's exactly the arcade style I was looking for with real teams and players.  I'm enjoying this game, although the AI seems to be a little too perfect even on normal.  Also, some of the controls are not as exact as I would like, and there is no ability to dive or slide for a ball (especially grounders, which can roll through the infield just a few inches away from your player).  Stealing bases seems to be♥♥♥♥♥♥easy for the AI but nearly impossible for you and tag plays seem to be random in your favor.  Overall, a fun diversion and maybe worth it if you can get it on sale for $10.			"

Was looking for a baseball game I could go big and run a franchise w/, maybe create characters, or depending on my mood play every single game of a season rather than having the computer play seasons like one would for other games that allow for franchise.

												Well Im an old schooler. This game is great in my eyes. Brings back memories. From NES baseball to the little, short, fat players from the old RBI baseball. This game is closer to ""bases loaded"" for the NES. If you remember that game, this game is very similar in lots of ways. Minus the fact that bases loaded had no-name players, not MBL players.I havent experienced any bugs yet, by the sounds of it; Im sure I will. But the devs seem to fix things quick if you look at the community discussion boards.. Only played one game so far as I just bought the game. But it was enough to have me write this positive review.

												If you don't have a contorller don't even attempt this game. You have to google how to even navigate the menu because the game only tells you the ""select"" and ""back"" controls. All the control trips are for a gamepad. Clearly not meant to be played without one and it doesn't tell you that before playing.			"

												Seems unfinished... returned it after a single 9 innings.  Fun factor from nostalgia effect is there but the lag time in button responsiveness and the controls just seeming sluggish pushed my ultimate decision.  It's a shame to becuase I was king of RBI 3, my personal favorite of the series.			"

												I'll start with saying that I remember the original RBI baseball.  The gameplay in a singleplayer session of RBI 2015 is largely on par with that experience, which is okay.  There are a lot of additions I want in the singlepalyer experience, but I it wasn't lacking anything it promised on that front.  So if you want a singleplayer experience, it will probably be okay for you.  Not too many bugs.That all being said, I wanted a game with good multiplayer.  What I got was a game with TERRIBLE multiplayer support.- The games frequently don't start- games crash out with regularity, and can't be resumed- When pitching; the baserunner icons on the HUD disappear with disturbing regularity (multiple times per game)- when batting: if the opposing teams pitch hits my batter, but I've started a late swing it counts as a strike.  This is bad because the animation only looks like I've lifted my leg, not made any swing motion- sometimes when fielding the ball, I can't throw it.  Play literally will not progress to the next batter until all base runners are sent home- fielding is terrible.  I can't seem to allow the AI to control that in multiplayer, where there is an option in singleplayer.			"

If I were to buy it again I would feel more comfortable around the $10 dollar price range.			"

												This game blows. The controls are not intuitive and difficult to master while the computer controlled opposing team plays flawlessly and kicks your♥♥♥♥♥every time. The graphics are sub-par, there's no difference in the stadiums, and there are no announcers. I'd hoped this was finally going to be a decent baseball game for the PC, but it seems like a bad port of something made for cellphones. I might as well as have set a twenty dollar bill on fire for all the entertainment value.The only saving grace is the updated pro rosters but that's not enough to save this game from it's basic crappiness. Avoid, avoid, avoid!			"

Posted: May 4, 2015
												I really want to like this game, but there are too many issues, unfortunately. And the way it is now, I can't honestly recommend this game to anyone. My gameplay can be described like this: several minutes of fun arcade-style baseball at a time, punctuated by confounding, frustrating bugs and glitches. It is fun when it is working properly, but then reality strikes and I wonder why I plunked down $20 on this. I'm a die-hard baseball fan and loved playing PC baseball games back in the day. I used to play a game called Hardball! on my old Mac. And on my old Nintendo, Baseball Stars was the best. I was hoping RBI would be a throwback to those kinds of games, but not yet.Let's start with the cons:- Awful keyboard set up with no re-mapping. The controls are unintuitive and irritating to say the least. The right arrow key is assigned to ""back"" in the menu system. Really? And the mouse is unusable for the entire game, including navigating menus. But for some odd reason, the mouse arrow is still there anyway. Just allow me to map my own keys and use the mouse if I want. Trying to navigate through stats and other menus is really a pain in the @55. - Pitchers lose stamina very quickly. I'm lucky to get my starters to go 4 or 5 innings before they're tossing 60mph grapefruits (CPU, too). And I rarely use the ""fast"" or ""slow"" pitches or the left/right movement.- Pitchers don't seem to field groundballs. They will be available to catch the occasional pop-up, but a slow ground ball right to them? Nope. Through the legs and into center. EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION: the pitcher does get activated for some ground balls, such as a swinging bunt or weak grounder near him. But it's the grounders that are hit right at the pitcher where no attempt is made to field it, even though it looks like he's in fielding position and should be able to make a play on it.- Something is off with the overall ""timing"" of fielders, throwing, and baserunning. What I mean is, if I hit a gapper that rolls to the fence, I'll be lucky to get a double out of it, when it should be an easy stand-up double for even the slowest runner. I get thrown out fairly often trying to get to 2nd on what is typically a sure double. Want to tag up from third on a deep-ish fly ball? Good luck with that. It's nearly impossible. Want to score from 2nd with two outs on a single to the outfield? Good luck with that, too. I don't know if the runners are maybe just too slow or the fielders throw too fast. - Fielding glitches: I've had an outfielder catch a ball and then get stuck in the fence, unable to throw. Luckily, the computer runner didn't advance and eventually the play ended and went to the next at-bat. On one occasion the CPU had bases loaded with one out. It hit a routine grounder to my third baseman which should have been an easy 5-4-3 DP, but when I threw to 2nd, no one was there! The ball rolled all the way to the right field fence. When the CPU is fielding, it makes odd decisions. If I have runners on 1st and 2nd with less than 2 outs and I hit a grounder to an infielder, it tries to get the out at 3rd rather than go for the traditional DP. Even if I hit it to the second or first baseman! Also, with CPU runners on base, a routine grounder near 2nd base bag will not be picked up by the shortstop, even though he's running right over the ball! The second baseman is activated to field the ball, but he's no where near it. Similar scenarios happen between 1st and 2nd with pitcher, second baseman, and first baseman.- Baserunning glitch: Sometimes, when I have runners on base and I hit a fly ball, the CPU outfielder will catch it for the out, but not throw it in. It's just frozen there. The game will not continue unless I let one of my runners get out. Frustrating.- Quick-pitching by the CPU. Especially to start the game. If I'm visitor and have first at-bat, as soon as the pitching screen comes on, the first pitch is already on the way! It would be nice if there was a pause before the CPU starts pitching. Even for the later innings, although it's not as quick. But a slight pause would still be nice to get my batter set up or see who's pitching, etc. - Manual fielding (outfield) is kinda tough! Just when I think I figured out the fly ball indicator and sound, another ball goes way over my outfielder resulting in an extrabase-hit for the CPU. Is that just me? I'm reluctant to turn on the fielding assist because I want to do 100% of my fielding, but sometimes I wonder if the indicator is outta whack or I am. - Non-responsive throwing direction. Sometimes my fielder will not throw to the base I'm indicating with the WASD keys. For example, I'm clearly pushing W so my outfielder will throw to second, but the throw goes all the way home or to first. Initially I thought I was doing something incorrect, but I've been experimenting with this and there is definitely something else that is wrong. The pros:- Fun gameplay when it works. There is a sense of satisfaction when you time the swing well and get a nice solid hit somewhere. Or turn a tough 6-4-3 double play.- No annoying replays or cut scenes. I like the minimalist production. Even the homerun scenes are quick and unobtrusive. Most shots of foul balls are cut off so you are right back at the at-bat (although some scenes still follow the foul ball all the way out of the stadium for some reason). - Can call ""time"" even when pitcher is starting to throw. This is great because the CPU quick-pitches already, so if he's quick-pitching me to start an inning and I want to pinch hit, I can still call ""time"" before the pitcher releases so I can put in a pinch hitter.Anyway, I apologize for the long review. But I feel that discerning consumers want a real, honest review, including details. I will keep playing RBI in the hopes that more updates will come along to address these issues. But I can't help but be disappointed that they released a game like this with all these bugs and issues. It's so obviously a half-@55ed port from console and they didn't even bother to test it thoroughly. They're using paying consumers as testers. Not cool, guys. Not cool.			"

												Had high hopes going in, I've enjoyed the earlier entries on NES and Sega Genesis. The computer cheats worse than ever. There is no possible way to win a single-player game. If you're batting, the strike zone is about 150 feet to either side of the plate. The opposing pitcher sends the ball all over the place, but no matter how far off the plate it is, it's still a strike. If you're pitching, the strike zone shrinks to the size of a dime right over the center of the plate. If by some fluke you do manage to hit the ball it will only go out of play foul or pop up to a fielder. The AI fielding is flawless, no matter where you hit it, the fielder will be right under it. The human fielding controls are awful, if he even gets the ball, the fielder throws wherever he darn well pleases, usually not where you want him to throw. That is, if you can get him to throw at all, usually he just runs around like an 8 year old with ADHD.Get an emulator and play RBI 3 for the Genesis. It's at least remotely possible to score in that version.			"

												This game is one of the best games I have ever played. I am an Xbox user and was sad to hear 2K was not going to renew their MLB lease. So I had to search for alternatives. When R.B.I Baseball 14 came out I thought it was very stupid and was not going to buy it. I had settled for ios games and flash baseball games then I found this gem R.B.I Baseball 15. This game is perfect, I have only ran into one bug and it was when a ball got hit to my pitcher he could not throw the ball or move so I had to quit the game and some of the Retro uni's are the same as the home/away current uni, and the Mets have a black alternate uni too anyway buy this game because it is amazing.

												First of all, I love the game.I am having trouble with it crashing every now and again. Which does suck.However, I am willing to let this slide if they fix this issue.Graphics-wise it's fairly clean and it's alright. When the pitcher and batter move at the plate/mound they look like clip art which is funny (and might be considered cheap) but it doesn't take away from the gameplay. Gameplay. It's fun. You control the batter/pitcher/fielders. It's like an arcade game which is great. I like to get straight into the game and have a blast!Although it's arcade in style they update the rosters (even after recent trades!) so it's authentic playing right there!So in conclusion. Great fun up-to-date arcade style game. My only issue is - fix the bugs. I have recently upgraded to Windows 10 so I hope that isn't why I am having some issues. If anyone knows about this please feel free to let me know sabrockie@hotmail.comRegards,Stephen			"

Posted: February 15, 2016
												SUMMARY:Well RBI Baseball is a very bare bones game with little features and fast gameplay, everything from a new batter to pitching changes or a pinch hitter is instant.  This game reminds me of the snes era of baseball games with updated graphics, and even less features than those had.  The game could be decent if the only problem was lack of common features found in all modern baseball games today but unfortunately it isn't.  I really wanted to look past the shortcomings and give this a good review but I can't, too many problems I've never experienced in any baseball game ever.  I only continue to play this because it's the only MLB baseball game on steam, so I deal with.  I can only recommend this game to you if you're in the same position, it's still not a good game.  Just be warned too some people say they lose their season after the regular season ends and the playoff starts, so be warned.You get Exhibition, Season, World Series, no playoffs, home run derby, or all star game.  No create a player, you can pinch hit but can not pinch run or sub a fielder.BUGS:This game is riddled with bugs, some of them just plain break the rules of the game, some are as follows:I fly out to left field, think game is frozen so hit buttons and the runners on 1st and 2nd move towards 2nd and 3rd, this gets the left fielder to throw the ball to 3rd, does not tag the runner, then throws to first who doesn't tag a runner either and I'm called out for a double play.  I did tag up.Again flew out to left thought was frozen, send runner from 1st and 2nd to 2nd and 3rd, he throws to 3rd then 1st, 1st baseman catches ball while runner is between 1st and 2nd and I'm called out triple play.  I had tagged up.I didn't know the how to control runners properly and ended a play with two runners on second, he threw the ball to second and both were called safe and they stayed there for the inning.Some very obvious balls called strikes and vice versa.Shortstop managed to knock the ball down once and it was called an error, which never would have happened after a leaping jump managed to keep the batter from extra bases and keep the ball in the infield.Had a ball clearly go foul but the umpire never called it and it was somehow in play.DUMB AI:I'm not on the hardest difficulty but the AI is till pretty dumb, making mistakes little leaguers wouldn't even make such as:Not taking the ball to first with two outs.Holding onto the ball instead of throwing back to infield/cutoff.Throwing from outfield to wrong base.Once threw the ball from the wall all the way to home plate and I scored while it slowly rolled to the catcher.Steals after ball crosses plate.Doesn't just miss, but starts to swing after the ball crosses plate.Sometimes will just throw terrible pitches, ball after ball after ball.I wish there was more I could say that is good about the game.   The hitting system is cool, it relies more on timing and location of ball on the bat rather than choosing if you're hitting for contact or power or manually controlling if you're going to pull or go for opposite field.I don't have that many hours in this game but there isn't much else to say except new bugs I'd find by playing.Oh, and the worst part, there is no damn CITGO sign at Fenway.  If they can't get the rights for the CITGO every game always has the sign with some other fake logo on it.  It's symbolic, and a huge oversight.  I'm probably nitpicking at this point but it is the only game I've played that didn't have it :(			"

												Baseball is a game of many subtle nuances, this game is as subtle as a swinging brick. Why they bother to put pictures of players and totally meaningless statistics is baffling, it means sweet  F.A. [Fanny  Adams]. If you are looking for a serious Baseball game, and lets face it there aren't any, keep away from this travesty. As for playing a full season, no trades ,no injuries, no point. If you`re looking to kill 10 mins and want a mindless hit and hope game go and play something free online. Until  someone brings back the High Heat series [If only] we baseball fans  have to put up with inane arcade rubbish like this. At £14.99 I could have bought a cheap bottle scotch, which would have given more pleasure and for longer! Bring back High Heat.			"

												Needs work. A lot of work. Probably more work than this team has money for.  This game is terrible right now, barely playable for a game that is $20.  If this game were in alpha and say free to try out so that people could give feedback on how to take the game, then it would be alright.  The fielding mechanics are subpar and random at best, when trying to field the ball, you can either be spot on and miss or 5 feet away and catch it.  Hitting makes no sense, as moving in the batters box should have no effect on how the ball is hit. The stamina system makes no sense because starting pitchers can't even make 4 innings.  As of right now, I would not buy this game, as it is not even close to being worth, especially at $20. Maybe it'd be worth at $2EDIT: coming back to the reviews a year later, I find it criminal that this ""developer"" has paid people to open the game, let it run, and give it a good review, and have them go through and downvote all negative reviews on the game.

												The graphics are a little better but other then that, just get your 1st Gen Nintendo out and play baseball on that, it's a lot more fun. This is not made for the PC, it's just ported for it (the PC) and not very good at all, in fact, it's a terrible port. The controls are dismal at best, gameplay and physics seem right out of the 70s-80s arcades where you pop in a coin and play. This is a dollar store game at best, where no item costs more then 1 dollar.			"

												Would be a good game if all the bugs were fixed. Everytime the CPU tries to make a pitching change the game freezes. Nothing saves as well. Everytime I start the game it stays in 480p. I change it to 1080p and nothing happens. Also, the favorite team or difficulty levels wont save either. Everytime I start the game I have to go and change it. I'd recommend everyone wait on this game til all the bugs get fixed.			"

												RBI baseball 15 is the most broken, busted and bad baseball game I have ever played. I purchased two copies, one for me and one for my brother, so we could play online. We found out you cant return a gifted copy, so I kept mine as well, in the hope that this game gets fixed. This game locks, freezes and rubberbands online. It sometimes wont let you see the runners map and indicators when fielding. The fly ball indicator sometimes doesnt appear. Its not a great game, and its not a game that works either, so what is the purpose of buying it? Stay away, satay far away from this poor excuse for a finished game.			"

												Sorry but even when it's cheap I cannot recommend this game at all. Presentation is pretty bland, no intros, no commentary, crowds are generic as hell. The only thing they chant is ""Let's go!"", yes just that not ""Let's go Red Sox!"" or ""Let's go Twins"" just ""Let's go!"". At times the game even waits for the oufielders to do something even when there's nothing for them to do. Seasons has no trading, just standard MLB matches with the play-offs at the end. Only real positive I have is. the stadiums are well represented. All 30 MLB teams are licenced with all their stadiums. Like I said I can't recommend this game at all unless you REALLY, REALLY need a baseball game to play and you don't have a Sony console, otherwise just get The Show.			"

												The good: -It's a baseball game for the pc.-You can do full seasons or shorten it to 51 games.-In exhibition mode you can make the game be any amount of innings.-It's twenty dollars, so at least they realize it isn't a full game.The bad:-In season or post season mode, all games have to be nine innings. This is way to long for my taste.-The pitching isn't difficult, but it is a little weird. You can throw normal, fast ball, or an off speed pitch. But you can't control up or down, just how inside or outside it is, and you can move the pitch a good bit, but it'd help if the pitching was better.-Hitting is also a little weird. You can control if you want to increase the chances you hit it on the ground or in the air, and obviously the timing matters, but you can't control where you want to hit it too or anything like that.Another thing that is bad and weird, but others may not experience is that it runs pretty badly on my PC. I can run most every other game, Total War, Skyrim, pretty much everything at nearly maxed specs, but I had to take this sucker to 640-400 resolution and it's still not running perfectly.I've heard about other people who's games keep crashing during an actual game, so maybe it's got something to do with that. Hopefully they'll make it more stable.However honestly, the big reason I can't enjoy this game is that I require season mode and I don't have the attention span for 9 innings. If they let a game last 1-3 innings like in Exhibition mode I would play it again.			"

												It's going to take a little getting used to with the keyboard — I've been an iPad player since 2014 was out — but I think it will be pretty great. It's the kind of baseball game that I've been looking for on a Mac for years and years. I've seen a few glitches — just won a game when the pitcher pitched and nothing really happened... stole third uncontested. Stole home uncontested, and walked off. I've seen some statistical glitches on the iPad version, and will be keeping my eye out for those, too (kind of a big deal when a pitcher gives up a home run, but the other team doesn't score any runs!).

												TL;DR - the negative reviews are right, don't waste your time with this game.I lasted 12 minutes before requesting a refund. I'm surprised I made it that long.Pros: It's a baseball game for PC & Mac.That's it.Cons:Terrible usability throughout the game. It's like they didn't think of how PC users would interact with things before porting the game. Also, there's no first time UX experience to help you navigate - they flash the controls on-screen for 1-2 seconds and think that's enough... rofl.No high resolution optimization, or options to turn down the resolution (fuzzy text, bad player models).Terrible controls in-game. No pitch selection.Buggy. I couldn't throw to any base (only the cutoff man).Other minor complaints include... there being no easy way to see ALL a team's pitchers in the roster screen, there are no announcers (the game feels empty).

												I'm not a hardcore Baseball fan, I like to catch a game every now and again, especially if the Red Sox are on. I've found other Baseball games to be very stats and roster intensive and way past my understanding of the game. RBI Baseball is just the level I need to enjoy a hit at the ball park. I can load up the game and continue my season without trying to remember who closed for me two days ago or who's on a hot hitting streak. The difficulty settings are very basic (Easy, Medium and Hard) but you don't need them any more complex for this game.For a more intensive Baseball experience, there are games around for you, for a bit of fun with a competitive feel, RBI Baseball is the way to go.

												This game is a little disapointing in that it lacks depth... I haven't seen any injuries and the season mode is simplistic... With that caveat I DO reccomend this game as a fun, arcade style baseball game on PC.  It is a big step behind the console franchises, but if you don't own a current generation console, then at least you can scratch your baseball itch with this budget title...  it's less than $20, and if you play even a shortened season on it (52 games) you will definitely get your money's worth.  It's not great, but it's fun and competent and it seems to be being supported by the developers.  I hope this becomes a regular yearly release and that the management aspects get deeper.  It has a few flaws - no pitch selection (slider, curveball, etc) and the pitchers get very tired quickly (3 innings max).  Fielding is a pain as well...   Also, it helps to have a controller  - I have a 360 controller.    For awhile the game was opening in a tiny box that could not be adjusted, but I think I got that sorted out...  If you can overlook a few bugs this is a great budget baseball title for the PC.			"

												I'm very happy to see a baseball game on the PC (aside from management sims).RBI is, as the other comments make clear, a classic arcade-style game, not a sim like The Show.So it should be reviewed as an arcade game, not a sim.---Pros----Controller and keyboard support.-Decent graphics.-Very good difficulty levels (not too easy, not too hard).-Full, 25-man, rosters.-Baseball on PC!-Season mode (up to 162 games).-Postseason mode.-Stat tracking.-All-star game scheduled in season.-Real MLB 2015 schedule for 162 game season mode!-Roster updates.-Unique ballparks.-Simply fun game!---Cons----No trading.-Graphics are only decent (player models look nothing like them).-Controls take some getting used to.-No HR derby.-NO TRADING!!!-If you press the swing button (A on Xbox controller), and you are hit by that pitch, it will still count as a strike...-Controls are sometimes unresponsive.-No AAA.-NO TRADING!!!!!!!!!!-No injuries.-AI is usually good, but can be pretty stupid.-Can't sim games in season mode.-No way to change controls (beyond ""Classic"" and ""Modern"" options).-NO TRADING!!!!! THIS IS A BIG DEAL!!!---Verdict---Overall, RBI 2015 is a fun game to fill that baseball gap, but it is far from perfect.If the bugs are ironed-out over the next few weeks, then it would be a no brainer to buy it. However, the bugs make it very frustrating at times. I have lost games due to AI issues or controller bugs.Even with its issues, RBI Baseball 2015 is a good baseball game and you should pick it up if you're a fan of classic arcade sports or baseball in general.

												I have no clue why this game is so disliked by so many; because the game doesn't work? And you didn't give developers time to fix the bugs? Good grief. For people who want to find an arcade-styled game with all the teams and updated rosters, and have fun, this game is the game for you. There's not much to it, there's Season, Postseason, and finally, Exhibition. If there were more gamemodes to choose from, like, for example, home derby and practice mode, where you can practice only hitting or fielding, it would be worth the $20. The game isn't worth 20 bucks for me, more like 15, or even 10, but that's pushing it. Overall, there aren't many bugs that irk me as of yet, and the game's so much fun, and i'm planning to play a LOT more. Pick this game up, but I suggest from a sale. :-)			"

The amount of bugs are so numerous I feel like this game was slapped together for a quick release, yet we get it a month after consoles.  If your in the mood for a baseball game that feels like your playing it on an N64 than this is the game for you.  If you are like me and looking for a great baseball sim than stick to Playstation.That being said at least it's a step in the right direction for PC baseball.			"

												This game was not what I expected at all.  If you've ever played OOTP Baseball this game is the oposite.  It is all about the playing of the games (which its self is very poor quality) and none of the management side.  I'd recomend people to play OOTP its a much better game.			"

												Simple but enjoyable baseball game. But the reason I would not recommend the game to others is because it is simply too buggy in its current state. I have lost 3 games in my season mode in the last two days because of bugs where your fielder would just freeze in place and the only option to fix it is to exit and restart. A fun little game but the bugs are just to frustrating to keep playing.Update- Well after a few months it seems like a lot of the bug issues have been fixed. I made it through the rest of my season mode without anymore issues so I changed my review from a no to a yes.			"

												I just got the game tonight.  From what I've seen and played on the XBOX One and iOS versions, I'm equally, if not more impressed with the PC port.  I've played through a game and a half so far, without any glaring issues. It's an incredibly colourful, well-designed, tightly set baseball game, and I couldn't be happier!			"

												Too many negative reviews here, but has anyone truly trubleshot your game with your respective PC's? It is a cool game, do not expect it to be a The Show or 2K quality sim, this is arcade baseball at its best. Yes, thre are bugs, but here on steam any patches will update your game if you have your games set to auto update, that is what I love about Steam...I almost never have to go searching for patches anymore. For small windowed issue...change your settings to fullscreen.For lockup issues using XBox 360 PC controler...still troubleshooting that one. Overall, it is a fun little game that I welcome to PC...I am a hardcore baseball fan, so I recommend this game to anyone who likes arcade sports games, it is also quite challenging. "

												It's very fun and simple game which still has some minor bugs in it. But if you're a true fan of baseball just buy newest MLB2Kxx for a console.			"

												I've never gotten through a complete game because it's just no fun to play. Some of the old baseball games for the Commodore were better than this klunker.			"

												RBI Baseball is not really a good baseball game I just don't like the way the game was made. If you guys want to play a baseball game get a ps4 and buy MLB The Show that game goes through the real baseball simulator			"

												Graphics, gameplay, controls, mechanics, animations, no trading, no hr derby or bp all makes this a bummer.  I was beyond excited to get this game a while back and just don't enjoy it.  Playing Hardball 4 in dosbox for a graphically similar, but superior-playing game.			"
