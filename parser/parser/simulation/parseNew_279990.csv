												This is just simpler version of Bridge Constructor. Maps are definitely less challenging. Apparently this game is directed to beginners. But is that good game? Yes and no. It is a good game if you didn't play first Bridge Constructor. But if you did, there is almost nothing new and nothing challenging here.VERDICT:If you like puzzle games and haven't played other bridge building games before, this is a game for you. Buy it and enjoy it, you will be surpriced how much fun is in bridge building.If you completed first Bridge Constructor game, you will find no challenge here. Buy it on sale only if you want to get all achievements in short time.Like this review?

												Bridge Constructor Playground is a little nice game about bridge building. It's not good like Bridge Constructor Medieval, but basically you can make the same innovations. The biggest lack: theres is not really a story. You just hop from island to island to build bridges across rivers or valleys. The variousity of landscapes is also very low. There are three different goals: 1. build the cheapest bridge, 2. build a bridge that can handle the weight stress test at its best and 3. build a bridge with only allowed materials. Sometimes there is a limit of money or a certain number of elements you can use. Another goal is to make it safe for trucks. Btw forget about the cars. In the end just the trucks count. So you play each level 2-3 times to fullfill all goals and then you will notice it's always the same. The bridges with less weight stress are always made out of concrete and cable. The cheapest bridges can be wooden but it mustn't be. And for the material bridges mostly steel and wood is allowed both. Yeah it's challenging but otherwise it can be boring.Altogether playing this game was mediocre fun but it's OK. In the end there is that notorious facebook achievement which obviously doesn't work for everybody on the first try. That's a bit annoying.			"

												I think the term 'Playground' in this installment is an indication to the 'difficulty' of it compared to the others in the series. Unlike the others, this game has no limit when building a bridge which I think is a good feature, as it allows you to pass some of the harder levels, which otherwise will have you frustrated and stuck. The addition of badges in this game are fantastic as it gives you 5 separate goals to complete on each bridge, that you can do individually, giving a bit of replay-ability and problem solving for each bridge.There is also a tension/weight meter at the top that displays in real time the pressure on your bridge, which I think is a great addition as it can give you better insight on how/what needs improved on your bridge, and by how much.Overall I think this is a nice addition to the series, albeit it seems quite shorter than the standard Bridge Constructor. If you are a fan of the series I would recommend the purchase or if you are new to it, I would suggest getting the bundle and playing this one first.			"

												Compared to bridge constructor, this game can range from extremely easy to somewhat complicated. This game has no max on budget, but to get specfic medals you need to fit under a budget, only use a type of material, or make a bridge that doesn't go over a certain level of stress. Overall pretty fun and worth a couple hours of entertainment.			"

												Bridge building in it simplest form, worth a playthrough if you enjoy small games that you can relax while playng.You have 5 objectives per level which gives you something extra to aim for if you like to be a completionist.Value for money? Possibly but I had gotten this game in a bundle a long time ago so can't really judge it for that, in which case I would wait for a sale if you are in doubt.			"

												Upsides:- Actual learning value in the area of bridge engineering and understanding of mechanical and physical principles. Even if the physics engine is not flawless and the means are very limited, with the basics it offers it's still a lot of fun. Physics-based puzzles are more interesting than mere logic-based ones. It's more exciting to have that connection to real-life engineering, and it's fun to watch the result play out.- Lots of freedom. Feels like there's not one single optimum solution. Being given several approaches in which to build a bridge (cheap, sturdy, materials-limited) further increases the range of possible ways to solve the problems.- A good bit of creative opportunity apart from the challenges given.- No handholding. It expects you to figure out the advanced building techniques on your own, but gives you scenarios and tasks that subtly nudge you in the right direction. So it's more like the whole game itself is the tutorial.Downsides:- Launcher doesn't save the graphics quality level.- Steam leaderboards advertised, but they seem to be missing.- Advertises an extensive tutorial. As mentioned above, that's really not the case. It's at best a moderate tutorial. (The fact is OK, the false description is not.)- One achievement requires you to share a bridge on Facebook. You can manage to get it even if it fails if you keep trying, but this was almost enough for me to not play it.- Quite a bit of randomness regarding the results involved, sometimes especially between play sessions. That makes it closer to reality I guess.- Not enough musical variety.- Only one setting for music on/off, nothing else sound-wise. But, I guess playing one's own music is the best option here.- Element highlighing not perfect. It removes the one you're pointing at, but sometimes highlights a different one.On a more personal note: I havent's played the regular Bridge Constructor, but I think I wouldn't like it. This is called ""Playground"" for a good reason. Outside of the context of the challenges that give you medals, the element of scarcity (limited building resources and such) is not present in this game, and I like that a lot. People tend to live what they train/prepare for, and I enjoy living abundance.			"

												Recommended, but the least of the ""Bridge Constructor"" series.  The best of the series is Medieval.In this one, it gets too repetitive with having the same scenario, but you must build different bridges to meet the multiple badge requirements per level.   Build a truck-worthy bridge really cheaply, then again more expensive but where no piece is really strained, then again using only X-types of pieces.... eh.It just feels too similar to the regular ""Bridge Constructor"", so I'd recommend getting one, not both.  Better yet, get Bridge Constructor: Medieval...it has a corny ""story"", better challenges, varying goals/restrictions for each level, and feels more varied.  Then if you want more, then get one of the others in the series...The different construction challenges are nice, but not for every level.  Overall: 7 "

												Save your time and money but more importantly your money.  I was duped into thinking this was like a bridge building game that I played around 10 years ago... That game (being 10 years old) is better than this game.The acheivements in the game do not work correctly.  You earn badges depending on material and money spent building a bridge. Even though I met the requirement on several of the badges, I DID NOT GET THE BADGE.  Along with this, the game is very short.  Also, you cannot see 1st person view of the car as it is driving over the bridge.  You can only build flat bridges so no fun ramps or anything when you get bored with how terrible this game is.  Again, do NOT waste your money or your time.			"

												I got this free from a Humble Bundle. If I had paid money for this I would be incredibly sad, especially at a $10 price point directly from Steam.First Impressions This looks like a bad iPad game written in Unity. Probably because it is. Controls The entire UI is clearly based around a touch screen, with the cursor acting as a glorified finger. You can't adjust sound levels in the game, I had to adjust them in Windows mixer because it screams at you. You can enable/disable the horrible music with a button on the start screen, that is the extent of the options menu. There are only a couple keybindings, and none are really useful except for undo. Further Play So after beating the Tutorial missions I wanted to try some of the harder ones. Nope, I have to replay the tutorial missions to get 25 ""badges.""Badges Badges are horrible. It's literally impossible to accomplish all of them in one run, and for the two budget-based ones there are one, maybe two solutions for each. It's infuriating how low the budgets are set, you genuinely do have to do it EXACTLY like it wants you to otherwise you go over budget or load.If this was a iPad/Android Tablet game it would be subpar. On a computer this is just horrible. And it's a ripoff of Bridge Project, which is vastly superior.			"

												AHAHAHA!This is even more fun than the original. The graphics are cel-shaded now, and look better overall. The music is less annoying, but still pretty annoying, but that's kind of part of the experience at this point.This is, in my opinion, and overall improvement over the previous game. Any semblance of a pretense to being an actual game is gone. You just make bridges and many of them go PPPPPBTTH KRCHINGK and fall apart, then the truck clips through everything, and hangs upside-down by the wheels and wheedles back and forth for the 5min you roll around on the floor laughing.It looks better. It sounds better. It's not much better at all :)Best.Worst.Game.EVER.Any bad reviews here aren't in on the joke, and I do feel bad for them.

												This is my first bridge constructor type game, so my review is unbiased by any expectations of previous games!+ I find it to be mostly fun to experiment with different things. Most of the early bridges are very easy to make it safe for trucks.- Connecting the bridge to the sides can be slightly hit or miss. Even though you can see the connector on screen, you have to scroll a bit further the the side before it lets you connect to it.I recommend this game for anybody that enjoys puzzles! "

												Might be ok on a mobile or tablet while 5 minutes on the toilet, but as a PC title it is far too shallow. Also the mechanisms that are there are not explained on any decent way. As part of a bigger bundle it might give you an hour of entertainment, but after that you will most likely never touch it again.			"

												It's a fun casual bridge builder. It's pretty simplified from the previous bridge builder games, but the challenges are a neat touch. I beat this game (except for finishing off the badges) in a few hours, so it isn't really worth the $10 - pick it up on a good sale. They added a new material, concrete, that allows building indestructable columns vertically from foundation points. It makes it trivial to solve most bridges, but you won't meet any challenges that way.			"

												Didn't know what to expect when i bought the game but it is suprisingly fun to play. if you are good it will take you a few hours to earn all the badges that there are within the game. if you are looking for a relaxing physics game than you should buy it.if you get it cheap it is a good value for money. 7/10			"

												Pretty good game. I've played other bridge building games and this one seems like a better one because it has more freedom in building, more dynamic physics and objectives to complete. I'd recommend this but only if you can get it cheap (5 euro)			"

												This is my first bridge constructor type game, so my review is unbiased by any expectations of previous games!+ I find it to be mostly fun to experiment with different things. Most of the early bridges are very easy to make it safe for trucks.- Connecting the bridge to the sides can be slightly hit or miss. Even though you can see the connector on screen, you have to scroll a bit further the the side before it lets you connect to it.I recommend this game for anybody that enjoys puzzles! "

												I received this game as part of a Humble Bundle a while back, finally decided to play it. The graphics are a bit childish, but I think that's the target demographic considering how simple the levels are. I completed the first island with all badges in a little over an hour, I'm going to assume that if I went for it without trying for all the badges it would have taken considerably less time - maybe 30 minutes. There are 4 islands in the game, which look to all be at a relatively similar difficulty so this isn't a difficult or long game to beat. I recommend it as a quick way to kill time. It's enjoyable for a bit but then the music's repetitiveness starts to eat away at you and you quit to stop hearing the annoying honks and ""YAY!""s at the end of every crossing. In any case, worth it on a sale or in a bundle, I wouldn't pay full price for it, but it's still not too bad.			"

												Though a very old concept it is still interesting to play, however I do miss the detail that the older Bridge Construction Set had. This game is beginning to turn into a Zylom / King like game; exploit it until everybody is sick of the game and don't wants to be reminded of it ever existing... Don't let it come that far, devs...			"

												Saw Mixed reviews for this game so I feel obligated to write a review since I quite enjoyed it. It's exactly a more simplified version of Bridge Constructor and Bridge Construcor: Medieval, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I'd highly recommend this game for newbies to the bridge construction genre, as diving straight in to a game like Poly Bridge can be frustrating and lead a person to quit. That's not to say this game is easy. This game teaches you the very basics of bridge building without any hand holding after stage 3 or so. If your primary objective is just to pass each level and move onto the next, sure this is a quick 2 hour game. There are added challenge badges for each stage though which will put even your best bridge construction skills to the test. Use only wood and stone while keeping the cost and bridge stress under limits, that sort of thing. If you're not worried about the challenge badges the game is somewhat easy but that can also make it fun depending on how much creativity you put into the game (take a look at people's solutions to the ""Storm Warning"" achievement for an example - trucks launched into the air).In short this game is as easy or as challenging as you want it to be, and it's anywhere from 2-6 hours long. Value the game accordingly, I'd say around 2 to 3 dollars is the right price, but it's a lot of fun for that price.			"
