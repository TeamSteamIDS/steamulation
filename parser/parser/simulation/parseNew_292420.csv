												Is this the next block buster game? Is this the new cool tank game we all have been waiting for?No, probably not, but due to the fact that there's not much choice when it comes down to tank games, especially on Steam..It's worth your while.The graphics are okay, although a NOT animated track is pretty bad, the gameplay is easy and fun as long as you take this as a quick tank shooting game between lunch and work.It's nothing special, although you can see a certain amount of dedication that went into the creation of this game. Probably more than in to the creation of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review after downing a bottle of Sake...Anyway, get this game if you've got too much money on your hands, or if you just like to drive around in a tank.But, don't expect the next Tank of Duty game.

												Don't buy if you have Windows 7/8, this game is not compatible with these OS.Tracks don't move and the tank are poorly rendered, they glide on the terrain wreaking any immersion.I have the boxed version of Fields of Glory and Dunes of War was tempting, I bought the game again but the immersion is broken.AI is bad and some missions are poorly built, however the pleasure was in driving and battling tanks. Now even this is lost.Update- tracks don't move- no turrets on Tiger tanks, you drive them for a few missions, and later you'll fight a lot of them - no one has a turret- bumping into another tank makes your tank spin round and round- walls fliker during the Stalingrad missions- Sherman tank overeturns at the slightest left or right turn, you have to stop the tank, turn, and then move forwardThis game should not be sold without a warning.

												Tanks - CheckTanks that appear to be made out of lego - CheckTanks with painted on tracks that don't move - CheckTanks that seem to weigh next to nothing - CheckTanks that bounce off of everything in the world and do gnarly 360 degree spins - CheckOverall if you like looking at the back of a tank while the tracks slide along the ground.Whilst the cannon you are aiming at the enemy.....doesn't aim at the enemy.Whilst listening to terrible voice acting And liberally topped with graphics like a 90's console game.This game is for you.If you like games that are playable and you can throughly enjoy.......Well you may be better off looking elsewhere.

												This is a pack of two games (Panzer Elite Action ""Dunes of War"" and ""Fields of Glory"") with lots of potential but excuted poorly in several ways. First, the Tiger tanks are rendered without their turrets in both games. I can't believe that wasn't caught in their quality checks. Second, the tank physics in several missions is like more like a beach ball than a multi-ton armored vehicle. If a tank from your squad runs into you, your tank is bounced off the ground or spun around like a beach ball. In one mission I was bounced into a mine field and blew up. In the D-Day mission, the Sherman rolls over easily at the slightest slope of beach. Third, the tank treads are not animated. Let me also summarize every mission: Shoot waves of enemy tanks. Expect anti-tank guns to ambush you around every corner. Find health. Find ammo. Repeat endlessly. If you are looking for strategy or variation this is not your game. Gameplay gets really tedious, especially in Dunes of War. It becomes a question of ""Can I find health?"" not ""How can I out-think my enemy?"" It's a shame really because the graphics are not bad. The voice actors are pretty good. The historical vignettes with old movie footage are pretty good too. Gameplay is OK. There are no on-screen instructions in Dunes of War so play Fields of Glory first so you learn the keyboard commands. I am still looking for that magic, amazing, well-conceived tank game you can play over and over. This is not it.			"

												This game has a lot of good qualities, but many of them are nullified by the utter crap that is the AI and lack of diversity in gameplay.Many of you will enjoy the feel of commanding your own tank force, as well as knowing that your air force are fighting furiously in the skies above you, and I good thing to notice is that the skybox literally looks almost like real sky.However, know that every main gun you get behaves the exact same way, such as my 20mm Kwk having the exact same effect as a 75mm Kwk. Every shell also appears to be HE, which is something that drives me away from liking the tank combat.From what I can tell, the part of your tank that a shell hits has an effect on how much damage you take. However, many times the AI tanks will charge you, then immidiatly turn around, exposing their engine (which is a 1-shot kill) and running away.It's worth noting that in-game models seem to be made with care, as I was quickly able to distinguish a ZiS gun from a PaK gun. You can also see the differences between infantry models, as well as the weapons they carry. The tank models, however, look made in a 640x400 resolution. Seeing as how the game can run in 1366x768, they just plain look ugly.The missions aren't very diverse. It's always a mix of ""kill everything that moves,"" ""go here,"" and ""don't die."" Thus the game gets boring very quickly. The few siege missions are set up very, very poorly. They allow you to camp around your repair and ammo supplies and kill the oncoming enemies as quickly or slowly as your little heart desires.Overall, this isn't necessarily a bad game, but it's most certainly not a good one either.

												Rating: **I thought this would be more like Panzer Elite. I'm guessing the creators were counting on that. The turret model rendering for the Tiger Tank is broken, meaning no turret graphic when you're driving the Tiger. (maybe this won't apply to you?)This game would be fun but the physics of driving the tank are very poor. The Pz II in FoG is so hard to drive, it is almost unplayable at points. Since the physics are off, the tank driving is ""unique"" at best, and the ""Tiger Bug"" has no patch or any ETA on one, I'll have to give this 2 stars. No something I would recommend for fans of WoT, Pz. Elite, etc.			"

												This is a set that contains both Panzer Elite Action-Fields of Glory and its expansion,Dunes of War. The game isn't too bad and seeing as you get both the game and its expansion there isn't much to complain about regarding the cost.There is three factions in the main game, Soviets,Americans,and Germans.There isn't THAT much tank diversity and a lot of the    models are pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ looking. The game's graphics serve their purpose but are by no means great. The Tiger tank models,for example,are abysmal. The turret on the tigers isn't even there. This is a pretty noticable problem seeing as you will be fighting a LOT of these and in one mission you play as one.Also,the tank treads are not even animated.They're static textures. One thing this game does incredibly well,however, is the environments. You fight in a multitude of battlegrounds such as invading the dunes of Africa all the way to helping out the 101st in Bastogne.The AI is abysmal. The friendly tanks will just run into you and,on occasion,shoot you in the back. The enemy AI will sometimes just sit there as you obliterate them. Another problem is the tank handling. The tanks handle like Go-Karts. You may be trying to round a corner and then all the sudden you flip over. The voice acting is suprisingly good. There is absolutely no strategy involved in the game. The battles are just a rush for the repair station and then you deal with the enemies.You are able to use commands and order friendly tanks around. However,these are never very well explained even in the manual. TL;DRLots of potential here but between terrible handling,graphics that leave much to desire,abhorrent AI,and the repair-rush battles this game was quite the let down.Dont buy unless you are extremely tolerant.

												While this game may not be graphicly impressive or very realstic, but i have had more fun with this than i have had with other tank games out there (namely WoT and War Thunder) the lack of track animation is slightly annoying, there are bigger problems with the game. at certian times it will freeze with its loading animation in the center of the screen, but a quick restart of the game fixes it right up and you can start at the latest checkpoint. As i play through more, diffrent tanks are arrive so that compleant is gone, now i see somthing that is really...quite amazing, the voice actors TRY. your Russian crew sounds diffrent from your German crew (mind blown). Even better are a few changes in the missions (which are long BTW which is fun) in one of the German missions you encounter KV-1s, which are difficult to kill, but they do NOT become the main tank for the rest of the mission (like most games would do) because, as your crew says, they are expermental and not 'battle ready' yet, which is really cool. still, i love this game, and i want modders to find this and make it even better than it already islets break down the reviewgameplay-9/10Story- (its WWII and you are common tankers, so) N/ACharicters- 7/10graphics- 6/10 (2007, i can't blame it too much but, it could be better)Difficulty-8/10(can be changed)amount of tanks 9/10 (no game can be perfect)overall-8.44300194/10 This is not a game changer in the world of tank  games, this is fun, simple and great worth grabbing just for some tank action (or Panzer action, or for those that are good at tanks, panzer elite action)			"

												This game was one of my favourite games of my childhood and I loved it, so you can imagine my surprise/excitement when I saw it on here. My eagerness to play an old favourite quickly turned to dismay. The model details in this version are shocking (tracks aren't even animated ffs) compared to how they were on the original version I played all those years ago. I don't know why this version is so different and disappointing. 2/10 childhood fave ruined.			"

												Panzer Elite Action Gold EditionTo edycja zawierająca dwie częśc Panzer Elite :  Dunes of War oraz Fields of Glory . Na wstępie zaznaczę że części Dunes of War nie będę liczył do plusów i minusów . Skupię się tu o części Fields of Glory . Dunes of War , mogę powiedzieć że lepiej jest odrazu zagrać w nowszą część (Pola Chwały) iż ma ona ciut lepszą grywalność oraz system walki . Dobra lecimy z tematem!Plusy:- Wiele misji , do wyboru trzy kampanie w których jest dość sporo misji do wykonania . Niemcy , Rosja oraz Alianci - Długość misji . Przeważnie od kilkunastu do ok. 25 minut , co jak na kilkanaście misji w każdej z trzech kampani daję imponującą długość gry.- Łatwy , i dynamiczny system walki . Łatwy do opanowania . Co sprawia że musimy się skupić bardziej na przeciwnikach :) .- Różni przeciwnicy . Piechota , działa , czołgi , samoloty , a nawet pociągi pancerne- Efekty nagłych wybuchów , zrzucanych bomb z samolotów i odgłosy wojny dają dobry klimat- Możliwość dawania rozkazów , naszym czołgom towarzyszących nam w misjach , co sprawia że możemy poczuć się prawdziwymi dowódcami ;DMinusy :- Myślę że gra , została wyprodukowana w takich czasach , że spokojnie można było postarać się o lepsze tekstury . Dobra , grafikę nie wliczamy do minusów bo raczej to nie ona jest ważna w dynamicznej rozgrywcę .- Błędy graficzne , bug'i . Jak np. Tygrys bez wieży , zapadające się czołgi w ziemię ,straszna fizyka czołgów (między innymi: jeśli czołg przyjacielski ciebie leciutko puknie to ""odlatujesz"" na kilka metrów , lub możliwość wywalenia się czołgu z maluteńkiego sypu .Serio ? To w końcu samochodziki RC czy czołgi ?) , błędem również stanowią niewidzialne tekstury. Ogromny problem stanowią tekstury ruin budynków . Często można w nich utknąć .- Realistyka . Może i czołgi , jednostki , itp. prawdziwe , historyczne .Ale błagam ! Mała pukawka z malutkiego czołgu może zniszczyć czołg ciężko opancerzony dwoma strzałami ? Dobra , może to i lepiej dla dynamiki rozgrywki .... W Kampani Niemieckiej bywają misję w Polsce . Multum czołgów , setki żołnierzy , tryliony dział , wyrzutnie rakiet a nawet samoloty . I to ma być poprawna prezentacja historii ? - Niepowaga autorów/a do graczy . Widziałem że wybierając niski poziom trudności gra pokazuje informacji ""Graj jak dziecko!"" a w najwyższym poziomie pokazuje informację w stylu ""Nie przejdziesz tego"" . Myślę że to jest kpina z graczy , bo każdy wybiera poziom na jakim chce grać  . 3- /10  - Odradzam . choć można czasami jak się nudzi postrzelać sobie			"

												I don't know I see all the negitive reviews and do not understand . First I had a head injury in 2004 so excuse the grammer spelling errors . I bought this game with bunch others in a bundle for 80% something like that so cost was about 3.00 bucks . I have it  on a lap top that is about 8 years old still good dual core but not cannot handle moderen games . I take it when traveling . Okay the game. so far I have played 2 tanks a panzer II and chezch 38t  both had goals to achive , got killed a few times . the tanks was little hard to drive . could be the computer not sure .  the graphics are okay pretty good for the year it came out as is the tank you have .  I got a night of play out of it so far a panzer III is on deck going into France . and for 3 bucks  I cannot buy a cheap 6 pack of beer for that price . I do not know about the tiger turret but I am told the version I have has been fix with a update .  not there yet even if not oh well . 3.00 bucks and if get 2-3 nights of play out of it works for me .Seems a lot of the game reviews these days are wanting something always for nothing , crying about what they did not get instead of what they did get for such a little price .  starting to think all the negitive reviwers are Clinton welfare people , and not working just colecting a check and playing a game crying about 2.00 they spent for a night of play .Yes the game is okay palys good on a old machine  pick it up on sale not more then 7.00 bucks  and have fun for what it is a old dated game and is kinda fun			"

												After the awesome that was Panzer Elite, the addition of the work ""Action"" to the title is a sad step backwards.The missions are very linear and very repetitive, with no opportunity for long range spotting or gunnery for the most part or room to maneuver, but it doesn't matter.  The enemy AI will blindly and foolishly charge you with a suicidal enthusiasm and their tanks never seem to be a match for yours.All the cool penetration and damage mechanics are gone, replaced by a simple hit point style system.There is no system for modifying your vehicles and repairs and rearming are arcade-ish.If you want a light game that requires no thought and happens to feature armor this might be good for a few hours of distraction.  If you are looking for something like the original Panzer Elite, you might consider something more along the lines of T34 vs. Tiger.			"

												I played the original Panzer Elite upon release and even purchased the re-release as there are not many Tank Simulation games.This Panzer Elite Action Gold Edition is not a Tank Simulation game either.The game play here is exceedingly simple. You drive along, you shoot at the enemy in a very arcade style manner.The voice acting is not bad, and there's an attempt to make you feel you are part of a tank crew.The main, and unforgivable problem, is the physics are absurd. Your tank can't go up an incline, you will roll over your tank so often, the game actually has built in code to flip your tank back upright automatically. You aren't rolling your tank because you approached an angle incorrectly, but because you turned on flat ground too fast and rolled your tank over. Your squad will also accidentally ram your tank and flip you over.You can run over any tree in existence and barely slow down, but you can't travese the smallest of steps.I finally had to stop ""playing"" to see if it could get any better, when my force of tanks was spread out and we were being attacked (as usual) by overwhelming numbers of enemy tanks (that never do anything other than drive straight toward you, then turn to create rear kill shots) and one the tanks in my group clipped me, that bounced me into another one of my units tanks, which bounced me into another one of my units tanks, which bounced me into another tank, and because I'm not driving forward, all the tanks stop, so my command tank is literally bouncing around like a pinball off of one tank to another tank, while spinning like a made top.

Somehow hit a mine and my tank did a nice 360 somersault. So some interesting physics going on. No matter the model all tanks play the same. So tiger vs sherman feels the same as sherman vs tiger. Pretty much a linear game.  Tried multiplayer but it crashed so I don't think it works. About 12 hr to finish on an XP computer, so if you want an arcadey tank game not bad, but I don't plan to play this game ever again.			"

												Panzer Elite Action is basically leveraging the existing assets and engine, but making an action game out of it, and while Panzer Elite is an anthentic WW2 tank sim, PEA is an action title that had you blasting dozens and dozens of tanks during a single mission, not to mention infantry, antitank guns, and more.  As this is action title, you get a third-person view, and you drive with the keyboard while aim with the mouse. Unfortunately, dualstick is not possible, as this is an older title. (If you have Xpadder, use it to emulate keystrokes)  And you get bases on the screen that can refill your ammo or repair your damages. If you get killed, you can respawn at the last checkpoint, which is pretty frequent so you don't need to repeat a lot of the kills. You get both German, Russian, and American action, with the tanks, and there are even AI teammates to help you, and generally AI teammates are very good in assessing threats and eliminating them, but they have several weaknesses: they don't do anti-air (and you need to use your coax MG for anti air in several missions) , they don't do long distance shooting (whereas you can), they don't know how to use a repair depot (you can order them to if you're close), and they cannot do destruction (i.e. take down a windmill as per objective).  Try not to let them die, as playing alone is sometimes rather painful. There are some missions where you suddenly lose control of your AI team mates and you need to go at it all alone, which can be a bit scary at first. Beyond that, squad controls are simplistic: forward sweep, or group formation. Pressing each command repeatedly will toggle through some options such as pincer, scout, attack, and wedge, line, column and so on. As this is a tank, you can choose to do EASY DRIVING, which lets you steer toward the turret aim (but only if you are moving forward or backward), and left/right still means turn / strafe, or use the WASD keys to maneuver the tank independent of the turret. The mini-map will warn you of approaching forces,  and/ or defenders if you are attacking, but just general vicinity, not exact position. You do have binoculars for scouting and if available, call in air support for some bombardment. So while the action is still fast and exciting, there is some tactical component to it, such as taking the high terrain, flanking the enemy, engage at range, and so on. The AI isn't so bright, as they rely on rush and ambush, but they can be a challenge on higher difficulty levels and on tight levels such as Stalingrad, where you get ambushed left and right.  Fortunately, the depots are available quite frequently and you can always backtrack a long ways to repair and rearm if needed. All in all, the game is rather fun to play, if you can get it working. It seems the bink libraries included doesn't work right on Windows 10. Disabling the BIK files seems to allow the game to run properly.  If it's for a few dollars, it is worth a couple hours of your time.			"
