												Loot Hunter is a pirate sim, mostly economic one as you are out to get rich, filthy rich of course, with some twist. The twist being that you have match three combat. That's not so original these days if not the fact that there are no combos in this game, only matches you do yourself count what makes it play very different from other genre mixes with match 3. The game is fairly easy and relaxing, also fun to play.There is trading, rather extensive, side quests and certainly hidden pirate treasure hunting, no pirate game is complete without it. There are skills to buy, lands to acquire, riches to get and ships to plunder. What else one can want?			"

												Rarely a game had shown me so quickly such a desperate glimpse of how boring could be the next minutes if I had persevered... Guess that's what it takes to try a game without waiting for reviews...Pros :- pirates !Cons :- unexisting pathfinding- ridiculously small map- pure stupid/boring grinding right from the start- (really) poor match-3 mini-game, yet it seems to be the only interesting thing to do (it does not stand at all the comparison with the other games of the genre, such as Puzzle Quest and Bejeweled - which you can get for approximately the same price, or less)[EDIT] Sorry for the originally incomplete review :)			"

												I was really excited when I saw this game on Steam for the first time. That looked like child of Pirates and Puzzle Quest. Unfortunately it is weak-minded child. Simplified in every aspect. Simplified in a bad way.In the first moment it may be even interesting, fighting with pirates, doing quests. But this game has almost nothing more to offer. There is no story, you literary can only sail the boat, fight in match three minigame and do random quests. But there is no point to do that after you realise that this is going to nowhere.Summary: this may be enjoying for first hour but after that it becomes terribly boring.VERDICT:If you're a fan of Pirates or Puzzle Quest, look for something else.If you're a fan of fun, look for something else.If you're a fan of be bored, this is a game for you!Like this review?

												Loot Hunter, a derivative name for a derivative game. Funny how that works.A more appropriate title might be Puzzle Quest: Pirates, except with none of the polish and only a loose approximation of the mechanics that made that series such a hit. Loot Hunter is a hybrid RPG/match-3 game, dividing its time between sailing around picking up quests and getting into ship battles where you need to match tiles in order to defeat your enemy. It worked for Puzzle Quest which didn't even have the benefit of being stuffed full of pirates, and it should have worked here, but everything about Loot Hunter is so undeniably and disastrously bland and unexciting.Quests are designed as if they've been ripped out of an RPG Design for Dummies handbook, either fetch quests sending you across the rather small map, or asking you to defeat a certain number of a faction's ship. Upon clearing a given quest you're presented with one that reads identically word for word, only you now have to carry even more cargo or defeat even more ships. It's so painfully mundane that it's almost laughable, so plainly uninspired that it doesn't even feel worthy of criticism.The idea of factions and having to manage wars between them by choosing who you do and don't attack is something I'd have loved to experiment with, but it's implementation is so shallow it's hardly a system at all. The outbreak of war is always in your control, and the only reason to ever start one is because one side decided they wanted some of the other's flags. Of course you never have to debate actually participating in these meaningless declarations of war as you can simply slip some gold to the faction whose fleet you blew to hell and all is forgiven. Its only purpose is to occasionally dock you some funds and add one more checkmark to your list of pointless goals; a wasted opportunity and another tedious aspect of an already enormously repetitive game.Finally the match-3 mechanics themselves (this may perhaps be the first time I've brought up the mechanics or a match-3 game in a review, as they seem so impossible to screw up, being this perfectly established thing) are absolutely dreadful. The lack of cascades (ie. matches made by falling gems) means you're only ever looking for groups of 4 to match, and this makes for a very dull time as it completely removes any strategy from making matches and leaves everything up to chance that you hopefully get a decent board. The power ups you can use during battle are often less effective than just making the same matches over and over, and the complete lack of any balance means you pretty much know who is going to win a battle as soon as it begins and you can see each others life bar.I'm not sure I expected anything from Loot Hunter, but I certainly didn't imagine they could botch mechanics already proven in other games so badly. It's a throwaway experience that will eat your time in the most trivial and unrewarding way possible, constantly spurring you onward by recycling the same content and hoping you go after the carrot on the end of the stick that is the ever growing numbers seemingly popping out all over the screen. Unfortunately for Loot Hunter is seems to have misplaced any purpose for said numbers, or forgotten to create one altogether, leaving you nothing to latch onto but the escape button.			"

												It's not ground-breaking by any means but it's a fun little Match-3 puzzle game where ship battles are concerned, which is a bulk of the game aside from sailing around to different ports to take on missions that range from ""sell this item at this port"" missions, to ""sink X amount of ships and bring back their flags"".   Where the game sort of falls flat however is the puzzle game itself.  I would much rather prefer it to be a live versus type of puzzle combat, rather than turn-based.  Because if you score a 4-in a row or higher of any symbol you get a bonus turn.  Keep in mind that only you act during the puzzle sequence, the enemy just seems to blindly fire cannons at you ever turn and doesn't make use of any of the other actions (repairing, acquiring more cannons, boarding enemy ship, etc.).  You can also take your time as you try to find the best possible matches as there is no time penalty.It's not perfect but it's also not an atrocity.  I mostly loaded it up just for the trading cards, but managed to get sucked into playing it for 2+ hours in one sitting.  Could the game be better?  Most definitely.  But I find the price to be reasonable for what you get.  My biggest complaint has to be the trading.  You can purchase goods in ports and sell them at other ports.  The problem with this is you have no real clue what prices are considered low or high, and the only real benefit of buying anything is to obtain the achievements linked to it, otherwise I typically just sell cargo I plunder from enemy ships.   Who this game will appeal to?  Casual puzzle gaming fans who like games such as Puzzle Quest or 10,000,000 who also love the theme of pirates.  It's a very laid back game and doesn't challenge your mind too much and pressure you to be quick on the matching.			"

												This is a nice casual way to spend an hour or two. I wouldn't really class it as an RPG though. It's more of a match-3 really as the ship combat has a little match-3 based mini game which is quite fun. You also spend a fair bit of time sailing around trading goods to make money which enables you to upgrade your ships.It's a very simplistic game, but great for a younger audience. I play it with my little nephews and they love it :-)			"

												I got this game in a bundle a while back as I was intrigued by the gameplay (part Sid Meier's Pirates, part match 3), and finally thought I would give it a try, thinking it would be fun to play for an hour or two.  7 hours later...I am trolling the high seas wiping out pirates, dodging fleets, and finding buried treasure.  Is it flawed?  YES.  How so?  Well the match 3 doesn't work like it does in 99% of others, in that there are often threes and fours sitting there, but not used.  You have to move between two of the three or four to trigger it, and there is no collateral threes and fours that happen for chains... I assume it is because it is OP, but the documentation is almost nothing, so you can only guess.  Also, you are the only one doing match 3, so it takes turns but you can't really tell what the PC is going to do.Is it fun though?  Yes.   It has cards, too.  Good for maybe 6-10 hours, and gets a bit grindy for achievements or level 15 (and the big ship).Do I recommend it?  Yes.  In a bundle or deeply on sale.  Not as compelling at full price.  Sweet spot for me would be 75% off or better (< $2, but I am cheap).  At that price or in a bundle it is easily 8/10.   Don't pay the full price of $8.			"

												It feels like this game could have been so much more with just a few adjustments. I really like the idea of buying and selling to make a profit, upgrading your ship, crossing swords with pirates and navies alike, and an intriguing match 3 system. Ultimately though it seems like everything comes up short.The end result feels like a poorly made mobile port.The game holds your hand on the trading portion of the game by telling you what is a good buy/sell instead of letting you figure it out on your own, or even tracking what you paid per unit. The result of which just leads to simple grinding to make gold. Questing feels rather shallow with the standard fetch and deliver or bounty tasks. Some complexity or variety could definitely help in this regard.Sailing in itself is a bit of a chore as well. The game could stand to gain from a mini-map (or even, in keeping with the theme, a map item in your inventory that would also serve to track quests), and landmasses seem a bit sticky especially with a lack of path-finding. Accumulation of land also seems like a bit of wasted potential. Why not have it so you can use the land to set up some sort of sugar cane farm or distillery in order to produce your own goods?The match 3 portion has a rather unique twist to it, and this was probably my favorite part of the game, though I feel like this should be tweaked a bit as well. I won't nitpick here though.I respect this developer for his continued involvement and dedication towards improving his game. He seems to be very active in engaging the players and responding to feedback.Can I recommend this as it stands?It's an average time waster if you don't mind the grind, and some might find the match 3 portion rather fun. As for me, I really tried to like it, but is was mediocre at best and just couldn't hold my attention.			"

A casual classic with a trickThis is a typical Match-3 game with some additional contents. The match 3 game is the solution of the naval battles between the different ships of the different nationalities. You might find Treasures, you have to quest, and of course you won't all to soon develope sea legs.In the pirate genre game this is a weak title, but with a twist... Superficially everything else is put on the Match-3 but if you dare to take a closer look you will find out that somehow in this game there is something amiss... Right, all stuff with 3 or more symbols isn't cleaned out automatically, you have to do this all by yourself - that is the strategic part of the game. If you just match 3 your foe might shoot back, you can stun him by matching four or more of one symbol or by matching several different symbols at once. The more you clean out in one go, the more you'll achive in damage, repair, action points, gold or cannons...There are several aims to reach in this game, get a landowner, rich, or a famous sea-captain... Wage war with other nations, of course on a real abstract level.Pro:- Nice Music, really this game has some nice music to go with.- Simple and easy to learn and to master gameplay, you'll having a lot of success as soon as you know how this game ticks.- It has both cards and achievements, both are gathered real fast.- Trading of loot and stuff included... And Bounties ahead!Cons: - The game is at times stupiditly easy... like, oh another pirate? *moans and yawns*- You think at times you are playing Sid Meyers Pirates when you are on the Map, of course it isn't but there is always the feeling that you soon will have to duell the other captain... which gives an old timer like me a real weird feeling.- I haven't found any practical use of the land grants... Damn, I want to build my own sugar cane farm... Rum To Go!- Like any Match-3 it can wear the player off if played over a long period in one go, so you have to take care to play it as a casual game - try to get achievements, once you got them all it might be the time to move to greener pastures already.- The value for money is a bit... low. It would probably a slightly better deal at two or three bucks lower.Recomended but with high condtionsThis game is nice to play as a casual game and off course it's a game which might please anyone who is for this type of game. Furthermore it might be a game that interests people who like Match-3 Games, Pirate themed games or simple games with easy to reach achievements.  And then there is the value for money problem, there are a lot of Match-3 titles around, some like Bejeweld are well worth their money because of the different play styles, others which remain unmentioned aren't even worth a farthing - because of different reasons. This game is solid, make no mistake, but some more unique features - like the stuff with the land grants... would have been very nice addition indeed. "

												Loot Hunter is a casual pirate game layered on top of a basic puzzle game which all might be a bit tedious for more experienced gamers. For someone looking for a new spin on Bejeweled or something to play in quick bursts like a phone game, Loot Hunter exceeds expectations.Want to see more?

												Loot Hunter is a game of questing and looting. There's no story. You start out in a little ship and travel around the map uncovering new ports. At these ports you can buy and sell goods or accept and turn in quests. There are only a handful of quest types. There's bounty hunting, which is taking out a pirate in a marked place on the map and then returning. There are war missions, which call for you to acquire a number of flags from the sunken enemy ships. There are delivery missions which just have you taking x amount of goods from one port to another. And finally there are gathering missions which have a port asking for x number of a specific good, and you have to obtain it by fighting enemies or shopping at other ports to get enough.You can get experience points and other random drops from the enemy ships you sink. Getting enough experience will level you up, giving you a choice between three things every time. You can get more land, which is simply to help increase your rank. You can choose to get more gold, to help you buy more things. Or you can choose to have peace with all unfriendly nations, which will become that way once you've attacked one of their ships. Being at war also bars you from visiting ports of that nation, though you can buy peace with them at any time. Plus you will get land as a reward for some quests and gold for rewards, for selling goods, and for defeating enemies. So everything is obtainable without the leveling, and leveling up does not make you any stronger. To get stronger, you need to find or be rewarded upgrades. These come in the form of items you can equip to your ship. The perks of them range from being small trade-offs of good and bad to large buffs. Getting a good combination will help you strategize your fighting a bit. You can also buy new ships at one port, which will give you more cannons, hp, and equipment slots. There are also a few techniques you can learn and upgrade to help with your skirmishes, which can be purchased at a few different ports. There are also treasure maps you can find, generally leading you to sums of gold. The other bit of strategy comes with buying and selling goods. If you are at a port and one of the goods for sale has a highlighted number, it means it's a good buying price. Likewise, if any goods in your inventory are highlighted, that means they are a good price to sell. This can be used to gain a small profit form port to port, though the stock of goods at ports changes after every fight, so be aware. Now, let's get to the combat, the thing you'll be doing for most of the game. It revolves around a matching game. Swap the position of two tiles to line up a row or column of three or more of the same symbols. Getting more than three will give the effect a bonus as well as grant you an extra turn before the enemy can attack. Naturally, this give you the advantage in an otherwise fair fight. Matching cannon balls fires your cannons. Matching swords makes you do a melee attack. Matching treasure chests gets you more gold for winning. Matching steering wheels gives you more action points. The action points are used to perform special techniques that you purchased at the scattered ports. These can be very helpful for your strategies, along with the equipment and ships you've acquired. Varying levels of enemies can appear, sometimes leaving you outmatched even with the best ship. This is where smart playing, bonus turns, and luck are going to be needed. And these are arguably the most fun part of the game.My issues with this game come into play when you consider how boring and tedious it becomes. The first one or two hours are fun. You explore new places, learn mechanics, get new gear, and everything is fresh. After you've uncovered the entire map, bought the best ship, have all the techniques, have a full stock of equipment, and max out your rank, it gets tedious. You repeat the same few types of quests over and over again. You go to the same ports, back and forth. Your gold becomes next to useless, as does your land. Finding treasure, flipping goods for profit, bonus gold in battles... it becomes rather pointless. And it will take you far longer to complete the land and treasure achievements than any others. Plus, with the battling getting so stale after so much time, the game has a lot of padding and no real end to be had outside of maxing out your rank and getting the achievements.I thought perhaps this game would get more quests, upgrade paths for leveling, more story/goals, more items to loot, more places to explore, or just more things in general with future updated. It has been a while since the last update and even though I asked about such features or new things coming I got no response. This makes me assume not much will change. If it does, then you can disregard a lot of this review if you feel it's tainted by the times. As of right now, the game seems to be a finished product. I got this game for free. It has the start of a good game here. Lots of potential. I just sincerely hope the developers will work on it and make it into the great game it can be. At the asking price of 8 dollars, I can't recommend it. It's just not enough content to justify the price. Perhaps for 1 dollar, 2 at most it'd be fair. 5 would at least make more sense. But even so, it's a steep price for the yet shallow experience. Good for some fun, but not for the price on Steam. Get it on sale or wait for more content to come. Loot Hunter gets a 4 out of 10 for having the building blocks of a good game but not quite making it there yet.			"

												It has its charm. It's basically Sid Pirates meets Match 3 meets Puzzle Street Fighter. Which sounds a hell of a lot cooler than it is in practice. The matching bit is poorly done, no combo system and the power up system is just barely enough to make it interesting at all. You go to various ports and do quests, fight ships, start wars, stop wars, all in a Sid Pirates way but you point and click to guide your ship and overall everything just feels half baked.I still had fun but in no way is this game worth full price and it's almost ridiculously high enough to warrant a negative review for their over ambitious pricing for the game they delivered. However, i did have some mild fun and I got it in a bundle, For a buck or in a bundle this game isn't bad. It's just a shame since it could have been sooooo much better.			"

												Match-3 in a pirate theme, ahoy! Possibly more a mobile game than a PC one, this still has some features that remind me of Sid Meier's ""Pirates!"" saga.			"

												Fun and unique game that's addicting for a short while.  Match 3 combat with some strategy built in and a simple overworld economy to buy and sell goods.  Has rare items to collect and some new ships to save up for.			"

												Loot Hunter is a pirate sim, mostly economic one as you are out to get rich, filthy rich of course, with some twist. The twist being that you have match three combat. That's not so original these days if not the fact that there are no combos in this game, only matches you do yourself count what makes it play very different from other genre mixes with match 3. The game is fairly easy and relaxing, also fun to play.			"

												I don't know why this game gets so many negative reviews. It's a great game!Although the exploring part is over pretty quickly (the map isn't very big), the trading, quests, treasure hunts and fights still go on. The game has 3 factions (French, English, Spanish) with their allied cities, plantations and ports and pirates. You can become a pirate yourself by attacking any of the 3 factions (and buy a pardon in any of their ports). The battle between ships is done by a match-3 game. With match 4+ you will get an extra turn and your enemy won't attack. It only matches the tiles you exchange though, but the game would probably be over too soon if it didn't. As you level up you can buy better ships and equip items you find and get from quests to get better stats. Treasure maps are also attained from fights or quests. You will need to find the location and dig up the treasure. Pros:- runs great- exploring, quests, treasure hunting, and battle- battle mini games (match-3)- cute graphics- great musicCons:- the exploring part is over quickly (tiny map)- it gets repeatively, you'll have to grind to get achievements- the match-3 only matches rows with the tiles you exchangeThese cons did not bother me at all, but I can understand some people would find them annoying. Overall Ifind this an addictive game (I'm still playing and grinding for the last achievements) and can recommend it to anyone. My friend actually asked me about it to buy it himself. I love this game. Good job Rake In Grass!			"

												When I watched the trailer and screen shots on the store page, I thought the Loot Hunter is a pure match-three game and lost interest in it.I was impressed by some other games from the same developer, so I bought their bundle, which also contains the Loot Hunter. After I tried it for several minutes, I found it was not that simlpe in term of game play.The player is set in the boots of a captain living among islands and isles looking like somewhere in the Carribean. You can aquire and complete quests, battle and loot other ships, find buried treasures, buy and sell goods, and upgrade your ship to better models and equip it with looted items, and the match-three game exists only in the naval battle.The first 2-3 hours were exciting and enjoyable. However, after that the game become old very quickly, since there are only a handful kinds of missions, the profits from trading becomes very neglectable, and the battle are also relatively repititive (the system itself is okay, but you have to do it again and again uncountable times, especially in late time where you have almost nothing else to do).So in summary, this game feels like a simplified version of Sid Meire's Pirates. Only recommended when you think the current price of Loot Hunter is worth a two-hour-long game life.			"

												Although Port Royale is a bit different it's a much better ship trading game.The game is very basic and only after a few hrs the game runs out of content and only a few achievements that become tedious.			"

												The worst match 3 game I've ever played.There's no detection on cascades, no time limit, and you can be ganked by much higher level ships leaving you little chance for survival early on.The worst part is how boring the non-match3 is - you're just floating around the same locations repeatedly selling and buying whatever items are highlighted as profitable.
