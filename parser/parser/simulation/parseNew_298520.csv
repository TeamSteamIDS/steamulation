												Sorry I did not change the review when the updates came!Now it has pretty much everything I complained about in the old review. It is an awesome couch game. I won't say much. 1. The controls feel great. Very fluid2. Local Coop is really FunReally great game! I hope everyone starts playing itBUY ITBUY ITBUY ITOld ReviewA couple of things:The Bad:1. No LAN Support, Local Coop (Offline LAN would be great... but nothing of that)2. Being from South America, it sucks a lot. NO Servers avaliables, and the ones from Europe or US give me 400-500 Ping3. Even for the Regions availables, I don't see that many servers. 4. No practice or at least at first glance, not well made tutorials or AI (Not that big of a deal, because it seems pretty straight fordward.. but still)The Good:1. Awesome concept2. Very Fluid and fast pace3. I did not play that much, but found no glitches or bugs4. Mechs!5. CustomizationAgain, correct me if I am wrong in any of the cases, but is my opinion at first glance (I might have not find the places to do it, so I may be talking falsely). I will definetly change my review if these things change. Chears.EDIT: It still needs some things I would like in a game to be awesome.This would be an awesome Couch game. LAN should be definetly on it.More servers!Hope more people start playing it			"

												Orbital Gear. I've never played another 2D game to have as much fun as I have with Orbital Gear. The movement system can be a little strange at times, but after a while, it became a key part to this game in terms of my enjoyment. Tie it in with the weapons and a full server, and the game becomes something I want to sink more than a few hours into after I buy it.Unfortunately, the issue you'll hear most is that there are not enough players, which is sad because this is a great game.

Gameplay: Its unique fresh and really fun, I wish it had sort of singleplayer thoughFor $10 its a little much for right now, but I think the devs will do a really good job on this......This game is actually really fun, if you can play that is.As of right now there is nobody playing this, which is such a shame.So buy this game so there will be more players!

												[Pros]-You control a robot running around and rocket-jumping from planets to planets  while trying to destroy other robots like you. Just...see the trailer. It is more exciting to see it than read it.-The ""Maps"" are beautiful. Seeing how much different are the planets and spaces [literally] between them, is always welcome. Also in some maps require from the players to play differently each time. For example in a specific VERY small map, I suggest you heavily to use mines and a shotgun :)-A very satisfying variety of weapons for you to select. From a ""normal"" Minigun, to a weapon shooting big deadly gravity balls, pulling your enemies inside it!!!Also the weapons work very differently from each other, making you test all the weapons to see which combination suit you better. The weapons of choice is Minigun/Grenade Launcher. It is simple my Jam!!!-You can use 4 different perks: Rocket-Jump, Mines, Shield and Assist Drones. Again, you must test them to see what suit you better. Rocket-Jump is my choice. I just LOVE the awesome stunt I do with it!!!-OOOoOOOOoooOOohhhh yeaaaaaaahhhhh!!! Run, Jump, shoot while you travel from planet from planet because of the use of the rocket-jump, fly near a enemy and blast him with a grenade launcher, WOSKdlsuokootrkqwqdklsdkls *drools everywhere*-Wait for it.......waaaaait for it....JUMP AND SHOOT GRENADES TO YOUR SPOT AND SEE THE ENEMY GET DESTROYED BY YOUR TRAP!!!!!! OH YEAH!!!!-FInally the music is good. Very suitable for this specific game. [Cons]-Main problem: Not many people play the game right now. I am trying to find other player to play the game, but it is difficult. However the developers play the game sometimes [or daily, but I don't see them. I don't know] and this is a very positive in my book. They care and love their little gem.-4 Robots for you to select. Sadly I only like the first one. The other models are....not so hot to say. Need more exciting design.-Sometimes  my character get stuck to a platform and I am a easy target for the others.[Final Thought]This is one of the best multiplayer games I ever played. It is fun, exciting, lot of weapons, beatiful maps, awesome stunts you can accomplice. Buy it so I can finally play the game more often ;)10/10			"

												Orbital Gear is a futuristic and fast paced multiplayer game where mechs battle in orbital warfare. Players are able to further their strategies with an extensive arsenal selection. Skilled players learn to utilize the advantages and shortcomings of these weapons as well as each map's gravitation to best their enemies. There is much to explore in the 12 maps and 2 multiplayer modes. The developers at Night Node continue to update this game with new content and fixes, adding much to its replay value. For the achievement hunters and card collectors, the developers have something for you as well.			"

												Such a great game, but a small community. This game is great, but it needs more guns, maps and game modes. The developers should also update the game regularly so the game doesn't feel repetitive like it is right now. No one actually plays this game, so there are barely any servers to play on. I wish I could reccomend this game, but I just can't. I would reccomend buying this game when it's on sale, but it's certainly not worth the $9.99 they are charging people for.			"

												Fun.FantasticGood:-Art style-Weapons are good and also balanced. But some can be worked on fx the shredder needs to have a little bit more range when shooting through planets but that is just my opinion.- You can host your own game and not only a LAN server but a server you can play with every one in. YOu can make it private so people need to write in the name of the server.Bad: More players would be great. But when you play with people it is exstremly fun but there is not people all the time.

												There should be more people playing this game online. It looks amazing, it plays really smoothly, it has a very fast paced gameplay.The player movement feels a bit strange at first, but you get used to it pretty fast. About the weapons: They are very varied and have very specific roles and situations to be used on effectively. You only get to choose 2 weapons at a time. That means you can't adapt to situations without dying, choosing a different loadout and respawning. Level design doesn't give you that many situations either. The levels are very open arenas, made to showcase the awesome gravity gameplay. It's a bit strange to just walk and use the planet you're standing on as cover. But there's enough weapon variety for people with higher pings to have a lot of fun, without having to rely solely on accuracy to get some kills.There's 2 main gametypes. The classic DeathMatch, and Orbital Warfare. The later one being the most strategic, requiring you to defend your structures while attacking the enemy base. While there is potential for tactics here, the matches tend to be very offensive. There's no tools to provide support roles (you need to kill enemies to repair structures), or to play defensively (the shield item lasts a couple of seconds and doesn't stop enemies). So you'll really need to coordinate with your teammates to create a good minefield defense, or a satellite based defense line. Otherwise, it ends up feeling like team deathmatch with some extra objectives.Placeable roadblocks, a big permanent shield item that can cover an entire structure for 30 seconds but with a 15 seconds cooldown, big mines that follow the orbit of the planet it was deployed on, or an item that teleports you back to your base, could be features that might spice up that gamemode.This is a very well crafted game. I really hope future updates bring some more maps to play on, and some sort of single player contents, for those days when we can't find online games.			"

												Simplicity is both a virtue and a vice in Orbital Gears, a 2.5D side-scrolling multiplayer-only shooter armed with an interesting gimmick: the gravitational fields of deep space.The virtue is that, as a giant mech, you run around planets -- quite literally, in this case -- using their gravity to zip around a solar system-sized map, hopping Orbital Gear from one world to the next and shooting opponents. The vice is that, well, that’s about all there is to it. A paltry two modes, Deathmatch and Orbital Warfare, are included. Deathmatch is self-explanatory; Orbital Warfare is a more strategic team-based affair that’s essentially King of the Hill in space.There aren’t too many surprises in level layouts, either. The six Deathmatch maps and three Orbital Warfare maps are pretty similar to one another.While there are numerous weapons to choose from, and finding ways of making them interact with the environment is enjoyable, the majority of them suffer a common flaw. They have this weird half-second delay in their initial firing - with the exception of the mini-gun, which has to spool up.The total lack of single-player content though, actually negatively impacts the multiplayer side of the equation to a fair degree.Mainly because, even a week and a half after launch, there are at most a small handful of servers available at any one time, and often none whatsoever. Without other people playing, a multiplayer online-only shooter is about as useful as a disconnected telephone.Orbital Gear can be a frantic shooter that pulls you in with its gravitational gimmickry, but lacks the forward momentum to keep me playing for long.Overall 6/10.

""Ultracool 2D gravity shooter in dubstep music""I liked this little PvP game since the first minute of playing.Though it's only in 2D it makes otherwise really fun and is quite challenging. Ok some bots would be nice. You are flying between planets and use their gravity to control your moving in space. Other players also jump around. So it becomes easy and fast chaotically. The nicest are the innovative weapons in this game and the warefare mode. If you can get it cheap in a bundle I recommend you to give it a try.			"

9/10""A truly great innovative gravitational side-scroll multiplayer shooter experience.""First of all I got OrbitalGear (luckily) very cheap and didn't expect much... It is ♥♥♥♥in' great! OG can easily keep up with its competitors & is in my opinion even better than those (TheShowdownEffect, Awesomenauts,...). Orbital Gear is a fast 2.5D side-scroll gravity multiplayer shooter. You play as a mech with a good variety of selectable weapons in a space environment filled with orbital planets. You need to run, jump & shoot while using the gravitation to your advantage.Pros:+ great gameplay+ great weapons (UT,Quake)+ great controls+ great ost+ great multiplayer+ good graphics+ good sounds+ good singleplayer=> ""orbital trials"" ai bots & world leaderboard+ balanced & fun modes+ many host options+ 1click-host your own servers (no lags)+ totally worth your time!Cons:- needs &deserves more players- almost no servers- i'd love to see more mapsGrab a 4Pack (with your friends) and you don't need to find servers...

UPDATEThe promised single-player feature has been released - it's called Orbital Trials where you have to kill certain baddies with certain weapons as fast as you can. The faster you go, the more stars you get. You need to collect a certain amount of stars to unlock the next one.It's an interesting single-player mode, but I'd much have preferred normal Deathmatch/Orbital Warfare battles with bots instead. Still, at least there's something to do in single-player. I've increased my rating below. Original unedited review follows. ----------------------------------------------This game got onto Steam as a result of Who's Gaming Now?!'s free key for a Greenlight vote promotion. In truth, after playing this game for a while, I felt that it wasn't really needed - this game was fantastic, entertaining and it blew me away, and it could probably have gotten onto Steam by merit alone. (Though I would no doubt agree that WGN?! gave it the much-needed exposure it deserved.)Orbital Gear is a 2D space game with beautiful 3D graphics about fighting mechs (called 'Gears'). There are 12 interesting weapons with defining characteristics, 2 game modes (plain deathmatch and Orbital Warfare where teams destroy opposing team buildings) and 4 other mech utilities. A great variety of maps coupled with the weapon choices make for some interesting battles as you mix and match your gear (pun unintended) to get an optimal setup.What Orbital Gear has going for it is its rather fresh combination of 2D platform shooting and planet gravity mechanics. Flying (gliding, rather) around the planets, jumping around from here to there is a rather exhilarating and heart-racing experience. The gravity mechanics really shake up the game a lot, and are a very solid foundation to build upon. (I mean, because of all the gravity, you're firmly planted to the foundation.....never mind.)Where the game (currently) falls short in is the fact that it's for now a multiplayer-only game. Now it's no secret that on Steam most multiplayer-only games are rendered lifeless within months, because everyone will be going back to their DOTAs, their CSGOs, their TF2s, and so on and so forth. As such, during the time I spent playing, I only found a maximum of 2 open games at any point of time, some with only 1 player. Developer Night Node has promised to add a practice single player mode in future updates, but for now I'd recommend being wary of this.Despite the major lack of single player shortcomings, the rest of the game already feels quite polished and well done. I'd recommend checking this game out with a few friends if you have the time. Oh, and the electronic soundtrack is surprisingly great, too.When to buyWith the lack of people in multiplayer, unfortunately I feel it best to buy it from bundles. The single player mode is like a snack - not very filling.8.5/10This game was previously demoed on the Who's Gaming Now?! Twitch Channel[www.twitch.tv]. We regularly demo indie games on the channel, consider tossing us a follow. "

												Since you are probably skimming through the reviews to make up your mind on a purchase, I’ll save you some time and summarise this game with three words, they are cheap (price tag), stylish (graphics) and fun (game play). If that wasn’t enough to convince you, read on.This title is essentially an arena game set upon a 2D platform with 3D graphics, the twist revolves around the clever implementation of gravity around structures and planets, with which the players will use to maneuver their mechs. The system can be confusing at first, but very rewarding once a player gets the hang of it, I was pulling gravitational slingshot and performing swing-by shooting within an hour.The guns themselves are fairly mundane and standard among this type of game, but the twelve of them do vary a great deal in terms of play style and tactics. There are four utility tools available as well, but I rarely see people use them to much effect in game.As for game modes, you have the basic Death Match which is self explanatory. Then you have Orbital Warfare, a territorial tug-of-war in which both teams race to charge up their main cannons for a devastating blast. Lastly you have Orbital Trials, a single player time attack mode that pits you up against patrolling machines on a map with limited weaponry; this was added by the developers after much request from the community.The only problem I had with the game was the lack of bots, so if you just wanted a private match with a friend or two, the arena would feel very desolate. Other than that I felt the community could do better with a few thousand more players, so it would be easier to find games during different hours of the day.The asking price of 10 USD is fine, but if you find this under 1 USD during a sale, it would be a practical steal.

												This game is alot of fun and within about 2-3 hours of playing i went from being horrible to being better then 75% of the players iv come across.+Fun game to play with people.+You can play a few matches and quit and feel satisfied.+Creative skill shooter with planet physiques.+Game loads quickly.+Good variety of different weapons and depending what weapon you choose decides how you play (If you are good anyway). For example if you use a shotgun-esque weapon then you will be trying to close the distance on people and blow them away. I use a long range electricty weapon so i try to keep my distance while using my secondary weapon the phase orb to force people to move in the direction i want them to go. I have ran across some people who are really good at placing mines which was very effective against me. You can place turrets but i have not ran across anyone who does really well with them yet.-At night i have a hard time finding people online to play matches with which for me anyway makes the game worthless until someone comes online to play with which can be a long time since you are probably not going to log in and stare at the screen for hours until someone logs in. So more then likely you are going to log on and if no one is online playing you will close the game and try again later.- Single player seems kind of pointless to a certain extent and is not very much fun (Although i did score in the top 50 on one of the levels). - The maps get repetitive especialy in single player.- If the game had a bigger community i would think the $9.99 price tag to be fine but since the community is so small i think the game is worth 3-4$ at most.

												This game is really such a blast to play, and the gravity mechanic works fantastic. All the different guns are tons of fun too. It would be nice if the environments were a bit more varied, but the main problem is not the fault of the game or design at all: quite simply, there are seldom enough players online to battle with. It is a shame, too, because this is one of the most enjoyable competitive-type games in my entire library, and it would be a go-to if there were more people playing. Highly recommended.

												Would definitely reccomend this. The mechs, fast paced action, sweet enviroments, and awesome shadowing which blankets its minimalist approach to textures are what makes this game amazing. The only thing its missing...people! I'll be at the menu screen going through all the regions and theres only 1 server between all of them. I don't think I've played enough yet to rate it but at the moment it seems to be one of the most exciting games I have played.			"

												Excellent little game for its price, the multiplayer is fast paced and rather amusing with an ok selection of maps and weapons.There are some teething problems with connectivity and matchmaking at the moment which i would have expected to be ironed out since it has been released but nothing more than a minor annoyance.Could use a couple of things to make it better:More customisation for your mech models, a few more weapons, and a few more maps.Other than that, its what i would expect for its cost. I hope some of the above improvements come in the future.			"

												Everytime I start the game up it crashes within 10 seconds after the loading screen. I then have to restart my computer as the game then sticks to your screen even after steam said you closed the game. The game looked like a cool idea that had some intersting features and to be honest I did want to play this game.... but i cant seem to since the game is so buged you cant start it up.*Notice* Eventualy when the game runs without crashing it becomes a really enjoying fast-pace tatical gravity shooter, you kinda need to know how gravity works if you want to be good at the game, if you dont know then learn. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation) Its a really good game that does have bugs and needs some balancing of the weapons. All in all 8.5/10			"

It offers a really fun multiplayer experience and with all of the different guns and maps, every game can offer something different.  This game lets you use gravity to your advantage and to the disadvantage of your opponents.  Almost every object exerts gravity, letting you loop around and get the advantage or make you slow down and get you killed.  The game is aquiring more and more players, so now is a good time to get it.  Seriously though, it wouldn't be a mistake to buy this game.			"

												Orbital Gear is worth playing. It has a unique concept of walking around planets and fighting each other by many different ways. It has a bunch of weapons, and that old-fps very fast paced style which is quite unusual nowaday. It still has a great potential of evolution, which could be unveiled by adding character customisation, more strategic gamemodes (such as a CTF which can bring a defence/offence strategy) and so on. The main downside is that there are no bots, add to that a little community : here you have the recipe to make you either play alone or not play at all...I would give 13/20 with a potential of 16/20 with what I suggested above :)!

The game is also easy to understand and I like how easily you can choose weapons after each death - Try different playstyles!--- It does not include single player (for example with bots) which is shame.

Orbital GearOrbital Gear is a fast-paced gravity side-scrolling shooter. It has some great elements, but also some flaws that prevent me from recommending it.Pros:+ Unique idea+ Gameplay is quite fun at the start and unqiue+ Good soundtrack+ Nice art style+ Weapon, map, and ability varietyCons:- The community is almost dead. I couldn't find anyone to play with on the North America servers and very few people were on the EU servers. This was at about noon on a Saturday.- The gameplay would probably get boring or repetitive after about 3-5 hours at the maximum. I got pretty bored after an hour, partially due to the lack of a community.- Not worth $10.Overall, it might be worth it for the 99 cents I paid, but the lack of community and the fact that the game gets repetitive and boring after a little while prevent me from enjoying the game.

												""Orbital Gear"" is a very very good with a sense of horizontal version of the shooting game, the game increases the ""gravity"" game ideas to the people feel very fresh. But the game currently does not support Chinese, so the game landed in China a few people to open the room to open the server to play with, so before you buy the game, one way or another your best friends playing together. We hope the Chinese official as soon as possible, so that the game can explode rather than no one is interested in the Chinese market, thanks.			"

												Just picked up Orbital Gear and turns out that this is a very fun and challenging little ""Planet shooter"".It's fast paced and the perfect game to kick your friends in their asses every once in a while.They kinda need to improve the movement, because it seems to be a little buggy / very unconventional (the whole gravity thing makes this even more complicated).That's pretty much the only flaw(beside some little balancing problems) I could spot so far.You HAVE to give this game a shot, especially when it's on sale.It's even  worth the full price without a second thought.

												This is a very satisfying game, especially for the price.  I find myself going back to it every so often for some 'orbital' warfare.  This is best played with others as multi-player.  It gets really exciting when everyone's jumping around on the planets shooting at random.  The solo play was pretty dull, in contrast.  The backgrounds are amazingly beautiful and the music fits perfectly with the ambience.  I highly recommend this game to anyone, no matter what your gaming experience.			"

												Edited:[1]  - 2015/03/10++ Pros+ Awesome gameplay;+ Good variety of weapons and levels;+ Beautiful graphics;+ Guaranteed fun (if your settings allow to play at low ping and your have enough friends to play with).+ Edit [1]: Added local multiplayer gaming option with controllers, but limited to 4 players. Still no LAN multiplayer.+ Edit [1]: It seems that the amount of players have increased just a bit, turning the game playable.-- Cons- Classic online-gaming sync problem: http://www.polygon.com/2014/3/11/5491146/why-you-dont-want-an-online-mode-towerfall- Small community (there are no enemies online to play against! You must invite your friends. Specially if your server is Japan or Asia);- No LAN gaming option, like Terraria (Port-forwarding, Peer-to-peer);- Seems not optimized, unnecessarily slow for what is actually running.Final impression:I recommend to buy it at 50%+ discount, because it is still not worth paying the whole price, since the cons are too strong (especially the 3rd ""con"" I listed: no LAN). If they fix this issue, buy it at full price.			"

												I'd first like to point out that this is recommended, but only on a sale. It's not worth it otherwise.This game has a lot of potential. But it rarely does anything with it. The gameplay mechanics are great, online and local multiplayer is fun, the many different types of weapons provide many different ways to play, and once you get used to the unique movement mechanic, it's an amazing feeling to use gravity to zoom around different ""planets"". But the game just doesn't feel finished. It lacks things that I feel are basic to this type of game. It has no ""normal"" single player (which I'll expand on in a minute), no minimap of any kind, and really only 3 types of gamemodes. So, there is a type of single player, and it's not that bad. You just have to kill a certain amount of enemies in a certain amount of time, and unlock weapons as you go. But the annoying part is, this is the only type of single player. There's not any mod where you just pick a world and dificulty, put in bots, and just have a deathmatch. Yeah, there's that in multiplayer, but multiplayer has it's own problems. First off, it's hard to be a ""noob"" in mutiplayer. A good amount of these people have gotten pretty good and using the weapons, utilities, and maps fully to their advantage. Not to mention, the community is tiny. For the whole US, there's usually only one game going on at once. Only one. With maybe 8 people. Not a huge community. Yeah, multiplayer is fun, but since it's so small, they should add more gamemodes for single player.Gamemodes are another thing. There are only three. One for single player, and two for multiplayer. I personally would love seeing modes like survival, juggernaut, etc. Now, as you can see, I am recommending this. That's because, with all this missing, it's still a good game. At least, it has it's moments. When you're playing locally with a friend, it's a great small game to have. And, like I said, the gameplay mechanics are pretty good. It just feels more like an early access game than a finished game.So, overall, it's not a great game, but it's a good game. It can be fun to play sometimes, and it's a good game to mess around with friends. However, it feels like it's missing simple, easy-to-add things that would make it a far better game. So, feel free to get it, I'd just recommend getting it during a sale of some kind.			"

												A fast-paced, challenging, and rewarding multiplayer 2D arena shooter with an interesting movement system. Works as an excellent LAN party game, though we needed to use the game's regional servers to connect.The game did not feel very stable (personally needed a few restarts to get it working), and did not feel very polished (invulnerable time upon entering a map wasn't obvious enough, local/IP-based multiplayer for true LAN gaming didn't seem to be supported). But, with a sale price of 0.99 USD per copy, and costing even less each on a 4 pack, this game was an absolute steal, and an unexpected blast to play with friends at local game nights.			"

												Great game to play with friends. Got this when it was on sale for 1$  (< Total steal!) I love the game.. HOWEVVVEERR the only singleplayer option is some sort of weird ""Time Trials"" that contains a confusing layout and lacks fun (in my personal opinion) I feel like the single player could be done SO much better mabye fighing AI mechs our some sort of wave survival. One thing to also notice if your intrested in buying this game is that there are normaly about 1-2 servers going on with 2-10 players each (of your lucky) so I would recomend buying this game in four pack fourm next time it goes on sale its only a couple dollars and your friends will love u :D Over all very good game would be nice if price was lower it had better singleplayer and was updated more commenly but I really love the core concept of the side scroller shooter mech w/ gravety. Good game would recomend. Four Stars.			"

												A ridiculously fun multiplayer game. It's easy to learn how to play and the matches are really fast paced, so it's really good for when you have a couple of minutes to kill.But there's something you must consider before buying, there's not that many people playing it, so it's possible for you to find no servers sometimes. I say that considering the topics in the discussions, but the times I played it today, I have always found servers to play (the ping on those were kinda high, but nothing that rendered the game unplayable).I don't recommend buying it on full price, but if you can't get it on sale, do it.(It's 90% off until 14 december, so if you want to try it, this is a good time)			"

												Orbital gear is really fun, especially when you get moving, and get into these crazy shootouts running and floating from planet to planet. The only time the game REALLY misteps are the tools that limit the fun of this game. Namely the mines and the phase gun. If someone is using the phase gun it pretty much means you can't jump towards them, as it pulls you into an inescapable gravity well while they're on the corner camping and collecting free points. Mines mean if a person stacks them up, and you try to punish them for camping, you get led into a trap that oneshots you. If they also take the homing rockets, you essentially get needled to death and it forces you to go deal with them. It's very very annoying.The game has some really amazing potential to be tons of fun, but getting punished for being mobile and outmaneuvering someone is really really lame.			"

												The game itself is great and has solid gameplay as well as some good music if your into the electronic type of genre. Which is why im giving it a good review. There is fun to be had, BUT my word of caution is that the player base is small so at times servers can be scarse. There is a gamemode aside from online play that allows you to run through the map and destroy as many small bots as you can trying to beat your best time which can be fun and easy to get into. Although that may not be enough content for 9.99 for some people which s understandable. My advice, wait till its on sale if you want to play it safe, that way you get it for a lower price and the player base may increase from new players coming in.			"

												This game has potential on becoming one of the E-Sports. I've been looking for games with epic battles like this. However, There is no tutorials. I have to learn how to play by reading its controls and 'codex'. Not to mention its controls is difficult. I walked around a small planet by going left. When I walk to the left again, It went right. And this is why it won't become an e-sport. I do recommend this game. It's pure skill. you have to use the planet's gravity around you to create advantages on attacking enemies, Pretty outstanding Multiplayer, full of players going here and there, mines , shield, and satelites everywhere, and missiles, bullets everywhere. In my opinion, I like crowded battles on any multiplayer. (not beginner friendly though)8/10   P.S. this is not 2D sidescroller, this 3D sidescroller			"

FUN.the gravity interactions and the weapons are very well implemented, and once you get a grasp on the movement, on what the weapons do and start getting kills, it's very rewarding.however... yes, it does feel it needs a lot more players and the single player trials do not shine a lot, but it's good to have them nontheless.if you see it on sale, you should definitely give it a try.. after all, it's a great game which only major downside is the lack of players.one tip: due to the lack of players, at the moment the best and quickest way to find a match is browsing the ""server"" sections and join a server with players on it.

												You start the game by picking a primary weapon, a secondairy weapon and a special ability (shield, mines...) and you're off shooting other players and jump around planets and debries (or something) in space. The gravity will pull you down on the planets which could make the game unpredictable. There's a quite big variety of weapons for you to play with ranging from grenade launchers to pulserifles etc. It's no game you would play hours in a row but works really well in short doses. Also, without any bot support you are to rely on online players. At the moment there are still people playing but they won't be in the dozens but this would make a nice party game.Overall I found Orbital Gear to be a real fun and engaging game.			"

												This game is great. At first, you have no clue what to do because the game is unclear about it, so you start with missions and you muddle through that because of the trailer you saw of the game was cool and it had good reviews. Then you look around and decided to try the online multiplayer and you have no clue what the heck is going on because everything is exploding you don't really understand the different weapons or the mechanics but you're having a ton of fun because THAT is what you saw in the trailer. (And then you go back to the missions and realize that they're actually practice for all the different weapon types)What is the game? You're a mech running around a bunch of planets in 2D, each with their own gravity, trying to shoot other mechs. There's a variety of options for guns, powerups and mechs. You can choose between two game modes or try the singleplayer missions for practice.Good Stuff:-Awesome gameplay-Great concept-Simple Controls-Actually and simply just fun to playWhat needs improvement:-Server lag, other people have mentioned this, and they're right, sometimes it's hard to play because of lag-Starting off you don't really understand how weapons work or what you're doing, and the game only partially explains what you're doingIf you give this game an hour, you'll understand the controls and what you're doing and you'll really love it, because it really is a great game.

												I have only played for a bit, but I know all the things I need to know.There are 2 kinds of classes.Noob class: Mines/Turret, Phase orb and hornets.Pro class: Booster, gauntlet and dischargerPros:A fairly good selection of weapons/abilitiesGood gameplayGreat graphics/backgroundsAmazing sountrackCons:Hardly anyone plays it, so you will be lucky to finda server with more than 3 peopleNo one ever uses the shield ability, unless it's for an achievmentPhase orb is simply over poweredHornets is simply annoyingMines is simply frustrating10 dollars... it's kind of expesive for a game no one plays.This games quality is 9/10, but until more people get this, I would say it's about 7/10 "

												This game is amazing! -Fast-phase, gravity based 2D shooter.-Very good graphics, music and sfx.-Excelent and fun game mechanics.-Nice variety of weapons for different game styles.-Controls are well done, but have a steep learning curve.-4 Player Splitscreen (but playing with a controller is even harder).-Servers work fine, but not many players. (come here and fix that!)A must-buy if on sale!			"

												A thrilling multiplayer that actually creates a new sense of gameplay. It gives a somewhat new direction of mulitplayer experience while also feeling familar enough that you don't feel like you are playing Catan for the first time.Simple controls, nice little (could be bigger) weapons list, and as fiar as I have played expansive map collection. However I do feel like that is where the game could be a little lacking. And, there only seems to be a few downsides. Simply put; the selection of maps- that are quite literally the same, no singleplayer/training mode (or even first-timer newb mode bot game), and that NO ONE IS ON ANY SERVERS!Great game to put your rep on the line and battle it out with friends!

If you are lucky enough, maybe you will met some, or play with devs, but if you are not... well, that's always happen to unpopular multiplayer games, so I wouldn't recommend to buy this one. The only way to enjoyed it was when game started, by now almost nobody wants to play Orbital Gear and in a few more weeks/months it will be dead, or bring to live for a short period time by doing free weekend/selling game to bundle/giving it away for free.

Posted: July 19, 2016
												Just plain and simple, this isn't a particularly fun game as far as I'm concerned.  The concept is great; mechs in some sort of 2D space-theme shoot-em-up with massive stellar bodies and varying gravity, but throwing in non-optional and timed ""orbital trials"" just to unlock weaponry is annoying...The Best:- High quality backgrounds, backdrops, and environments (sort of a must-have for any 2D platformer style games these days).  If the trials weren't timed, I'd probably appreciate these graphics even more...- Sky is the limit (or space) as far as ""how good you can get"" is concerned; get comfortable with how the gravity works, how to move around, and be able to switch weapons when needed, but reaction-timing and coordination are serious game changers.The Good:- not terrible digital/techno style soundtracks- challenging fast-paced gameplay- rather challenging movement (in order to complete trials in a timely manner or be reasonably competitive in multiplayer, you'll have to be able to sling-shot around stellar bodies to get to some locations)The Bad:- TIMED TRIALS: you HAVE to follow the progression to be able to unlock each subsequent weapon, regardless of preferences in playstyle- Hit boxes: time and again, thought you just hit that enemy?  Well, it sure as hell hit you.- Lots of different ""Gravitational Bodies,"" but none of them labeled or any inkling of the effect they will have on your or your weapons.The Ugly:- At least on PC/Mac, the keyboard controls are very difficult to get comfortable with; you can hold down the left or right arrow key and start running around a planetary body, but go to jump off or use a thruster and the arrow key held down still dictates your direction (even if you've run around to the opposite side)- No apparent variation in the stats of the mechs to fit different playstyles (slow and tanky, bruiser, fast but weak, etc.)- Timed trials are exactly the same each time; no variation in enemy behavior asside from scripts relating to player position means all you really have to do is get familiar with the layout and weapon characteristics and play a level over and over until earning 3 stars.Overall:As far as controls are concerned, I'd like to atleast have the option to keep the player ""upright"" constantly, and rotate the screen as you move; otherwise my personal opinion is that you HAVE to have a controller with an 8-direction pad for the movement to ever really feel natural, and a monitor refresh of at least 120hz.  Otherwise, as many would agree, if you're looking for a fast-paced, intense, and dynamic 2D game, Orbital Gear is probably for you.  If you get irritated easily when gameplay isn't particularly intuitive and you don't care for timed-trials (like myself) then Orbital Gear isn't.  If you can get past the timed trials, the multiplayer can be a lot of fun, as long as there are enough people online...			"

												I love Orbital Gear. This game, as most people say, is very fun to play. The gravity is essential to control, but once you get the hang of it, its very fun and challenging at times if theres a very skilled player whom you're playing against. The main problem Orbital Gear has (apart from lack of maps and weapons) is the comunity. There is rarely ever people in any and every server, so most people don't even care about checking. I propose that players who play Orbital Gear once in a while or very often but find the lacking community very boring make a group. Just add me and I'll add you to the group and we'll start spreading with time. This way, we can know who and when want to play together, and the game won't be as boring. If you are considering buying this game, I really recommend it. It is very fun to play and if we help each other make the community grow it will be less boring and more fun.			"

												          Honestly, I think this game is great, though the timed challenges (especially for three stars) are a bit over-exagerated. I mean, hoestly. How the heck do you beat some of these levels in under 15-20 seconds for three stars? That's way too hard on some of the levels.           The mutiplayer, on the other hand, is quite enjoyable.... if you can find ANY matches whatsoever. I've only played a multiplayer match once, and I got lucky to play that much. No one plays this game on multiplayer, which is sad.           All-in-all, this is a fun, fast-paced game that doesn't get as much support for what it's worth. I recommend this game if you want a serious challenge for the solo mode, or if you have a friend(s) to play it with.

												Orbital Gear is a really great game that is sadly underpopulated and is missing a few key features like offline solo play.If this game gets the attention it deserves I'd give it a 9/10 for its genre, but in its current state I have to say 7/10 with friends. If you do like this game (or think it looks fun), buy a 4-pack and share them with friends. Trust me, deathmatch with 7+ people is not only chaotic, but insanely fun as well.

A great game to play with friends to see who is the best.Your goal is to beat either all the other players by getting the most points, or by beating another team. Either way it's great!Gotten bored by the slow games? Get this game!			"

												Fast and furious 2D shooter that uses gravity to propel fighters across a star system. Pick from ten weapons, two each to shoot your friends/enemies as you run across planets in huge mechs and fight for points. Matches last pretty long but can get hectic very fast. Only downside so far is some weapons outshine others and the sub abilities are lacking (satalite turret is a ♥♥♥♥♥ and a half).Still enjoyable as hell and on sale for 99 cents. Pick it up.			"

												One of the best and most fast paced multiplayer online experiences I have had.Sometimes you feel like Neo[Matrix films] as you dodge a bulletstorm of bullets and come out unscathed.Easy to learn, hard to master. Especially when you add the combination of multiple weapons and the different playstyles each has. Gravity also adds to the game, as you can utilize it to take you to the other side of the map ordo a quick attack on an enemy that they did not expect.Great game, personally I value this game at least 5x the current price it costs to buy it.

												This game is both awesome and terrible, but one that everyone should buy. Allow me to explain:In Orbital gear, you are some sort of giant robot, walking the surface of suspiciously small worlds that are placed odly close together. Using gravity, you jump from world to world, and using a small assortment of devestating weapons you hunt down other mechs and turn them into spaceborn scrap. It's not a complex game plot-wise, to the point I'm not sure it even has an excuse plot, but that doesn't make it less fun. The gravity physics are a bit magnetic, a nescesary thing to make it so that the game is actually playable, but once you find out how to work around and against them, it's awesome. In one match, I was able to launch myself into orbit, got a gravitational boost from 3 planets, exploded an enemy with my flamer, and killed myself by launching myself out of bounds. It was awesome.Now for the part that makes it terrible: there are no players! I hovered arround for ages, just experimenting with the game physics and waiting for someone to join the server, and when one finally did, it was this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ whose entire strategy boiled down to, ""Hide and use the seaker missiles to do my work for me."" Later I managed to get a game going with something like 6 people, and it was awesome, but that was the exception rather than the rule. Another complaint, one that wouldn't be so bad if not for the first problem, is that the single player mode sucks. I honestly didn't even know there was a single player mode at first until I clicked up the time trial option, and even then it's kind of a crappy game mode. If they had taken the time to create a single player mode that's just like the real game but with AI opponents I wouldn't have any complaints about this game, but instead it's so multiplayer focused that it can't stand up if nobody's online.Verdict: I love this game, and the only reason I could complain is not enough people love it for more to love it. Luckilly, it's on sale! So go buy it!			"

												I feel like I stole this game, I bought it for the .99 and its well worth the 10 they offered. The game play is fast paced and fluid. The characters look cool and the weapons are decent. I would say 60% of the guns are fun and 3 of the 4 utilities I enjoy using.Pros:-fast gameplay-nice graphics-cool weapons-no where to hideCons:-some of the guns are a little lame-cant bind enter as your jump on multiplayer(its your chat key that I couldnt find to change)-the graphics are a little trippy while you are trying to focus. -jumping seems a little lacking, it only feels fluid with the boost which uses your utlity spot.-no ping shown on score board-the large green orb is a little overpowering for such small mapsOverall I would rate this game a solid 8/10.I think the gameplay is sweet and even though the modes are very limited I think they did a good job. I don't usually play 2d shooters but this one caught my eye with the artistic approach and a smaller scale. "

												if you want something fast and violent you've come to the right place. This game is an adrenaline rush, it takes a little practice to get used to the gravity but there is nothing like slingshoting around an asteroids while trying to land a hit on someone also slingshoting through asteroids, there's 12 weapons which all in all are pretty well balanced (although that shoots little black holes that can pull you in is a little annoying) and you have the option to pick different suit upgrades (double jump stuff like that) which makes for a nicely varied experience. highly recommended 10/10 moon rocks.

												Small player base, but not to the point of unplayability. There's always at least one or two servers with players online. No bots for singleplayer matches, but there is a sort-of singleplayer time trial with random alien things that shoot you.Be aware there are a few ""n00b weapons"" that require pretty much no aiming (Hornets and phase orb). But don't worry too much because they're quite low damage and with a bit of skill can be outmaneouvred completely.The more skilled weapons dish out a lot of damage so it's quite rewarding to try using the harder ones. I found some weapons a little underpowered but maybe I was just using them wrong.Good variety of weapons too. Should suit lots of play styles.Orbital physics take some getting used to but it's really satisfying when you hit just the right angle and go spinning around an asteroid a few times without touching the ground. My best advice is to not fight the controls.Worst case scenario, mash random movement buttons and focus on pointing your weapon at nearby players.I only spent $1 on it but it is probably worth the full $10.

												Plays like an arena shooter (like Unreal Tournament or Quake), but in 2D and with interesting movement mechanics due to the gravity. Fast-paced fun. Highly recommended.However: there is basically nobody playing on the public servers... so if you buy this game, get the 4-pack and give copies to your friends. Otherwise you'll have nobody to play with. Since there is no single player mode and no bots, having opponents is a requirement.The game has two modes: a free-for-all deathmatch mode and a team mode based around capturing objectives. The deathmatch mode is fun and works well but the team mode feels incomplete. For example, there is no direct feedback when you hit a target with your weapon. It's also nearly impossible to find enough players to organize teams... so practically speaking, you'll only ever play the deathmatch mode with your own friends.			"

												Heads up: There is no single player. Single player is a run and gun time attack with one weapon. That being said. Orbital Gear is a rage game when played solo. A very GOOD rage game, given how I managed to scream obscenities at it for a good hour without noticing.When you get it right, it's a FANTASTIC feeling.  9/10ths of the time though, you're twitching and hitting quick restart because you messed up that one opening shot / Overshot the next planet/ mistimed when an enemy would show up somewhere for the most effecient run.Seriously, some of these minimum qualifying times are ridiculous. I have yet to see video evidence of how people do these. Multiplayer's a random chaotic mess, which isn't bad. I don't exactly find it engaging when my interaction with someone is, at most, pray the server takes my side and hits this guy before he, or someone else, hits me.			"

												Not much to see here folks. Controls are not intuitive, as sometimes one button will make you move left, and other times will make you move right. The utility jump button sometimes boosts you further up and other times sucks you down to the ground for no explicable reason. But the worst part is it a multiplayer game that doesn't have a single person playing. You can do time trial levels where you keep replaying the same 4 limited levels in the game but with a different gun each time you play them, shooting the same 1-2 types of guys. May have been fun if people played it. For now avoid like the plague. 3/10.			"

												Short answer:BUY THIS GAME. Tell your friends about it! Buy it for them!Long answer:This is probably one of the best VIDEO GAMES i've ever played. I caps VIDEO GAMES because it does exactly what games should do. It adds something new to the world of gaming. A completely different challenge to master. It has examples from other videogames but this game puts its own spin on things. I got lost in this game for hours and I will continue to do so.This game pushes you to the edge of your seat. Flying around makes you cackle like a maniac. Flying by people and raining down hell from whichever weapon you see fit for your play style. It really is a great time when you have a full server of chaos everywhere you look.

I think if people put down their big AAA games they would see there is a wonderful gaming experience to be had in the smaller games. The ones that test the waters of something new while still remaining familiar to anyone who jumps in.If you stuble accross this game please give it a chance. Also tell your friends!

												Great job!Orbital gear is fun, it runs with no problems, has good graphics and explores a new type of gravitation mechanic.I have had a great time with my friends and there are no pay to win mechanics in the game so you have to get good to compete with your friends.The game is great in it´s own way and I am suprised how much I enjoyed the game.I don't have a direct advise for the people making this game but I can say that there is not really anything that makes me wanna come back for more.If this game either got some sort of popularity increase (like if some famous/popular youtuber played it) it could be something alot of people would be talking about daily.Another thing you could do is add some sort of system that makes you unlock stuff, like new weapons.Hopefully someone finds this review usefull, or maybe agrees with what I think could improve the game.So thats all I have to say about this game, over all this game is great and worth the money.

That is, if you care about speed challenges, local multiplayer, and the unfortunately small online multiplayer scene. Even for the occasional free for all or duel, this game will be worth it for most consumers.			"

												Orbital Gear is one of the most legitimately fun games I have ever played. It is fun for the sake of being fun. I'm not even that good, and yet, I still am laughing and having a blast whenever I decide to play it. It's fast, frantic, and wonderfully competitive, while being as simplistic as possible at the same time. I highly recommend this game. Get some friends together, start a Skype chat, and play. And now, until June 1, it's available for just a $1!Pros- Even when running at maxed out settings, it runs ridiculously smooth. Plus it looks gorgeous and has a perfect, distinct style.- The controls, while at first are frustrating, quickly become very familiar.- The use of gravity as a main gameplay element was actually pretty well implemented. Not perfect by any means, but it works for a majority of stages in the game.- The variety of weapons and stages is great. Each stage and weapon feels distinct. Having a favorite pairing of weapons, and a utility (a sort of enhancement for the user's mech) and then proceeding to master that loadout, feels just like having a favorite Smash Bros. character.Cons- Having controller support as an option may in itself sound great, but using a controller for this game sucks. It just doesn't work.- There are a number of different mechs to choose from from within the game. They all look different, with a great retro 80s 90s vibe, but the mechs themselves are just cosmetic, and don't really change anything. Plus within the game, they appear super tiny, so that was pretty useless.- Lack of replayability. Everything is already unlocked in this game the second you turn it on. Weapons, mechs, stages, everything.Anyways though, these cons are very minor as a whole really, and don't in anyway hinder the amount of childlike fun with this game. 9/10			"

												Very good 2D online deathmatch game, like Q2/Unreal if they were 2D and speed were cranked. Graphics are basic but pulled off really well, and frame rate is smooth. Not a game you need to invest crazy time into to have fun. Weapons are good are well done but would be nice if there were a few more. Game probably could use a zoom in/zoom out dynamics to the camera to increase character/enemy size when possible. Have not had an issue finding players yet. Bottom line - Easily worth the price when on sale, but needs a little more content to make it worth 10 dollars. Ignoring price its a good/fun/fast & slick feeling game regardless.			"

												Heads up: There is no single player. Single player is a run and gun time attack with one weapon. That being said. Orbital Gear is a rage game when played solo. A very GOOD rage game, given how I managed to scream obscenities at it for a good hour without noticing.When you get it right, it's a FANTASTIC feeling.  9/10ths of the time though, you're twitching and hitting quick restart because you messed up that one opening shot / Overshot the next planet/ mistimed when an enemy would show up somewhere for the most effecient run.Seriously, some of these minimum qualifying times are ridiculous. I have yet to see video evidence of how people do these. Multiplayer's a random chaotic mess, which isn't bad. I don't exactly find it engaging when my interaction with someone is, at most, pray the server takes my side and hits this guy before he, or someone else, hits me.			"

 Orbital Gear is side scroller shooter game 2D.You got 12 weapons that you can use to kill your other enemies. Use your gravity in your side.You in space vs other robot enemies which also got good weapons , your main thing that you need to do is to destroy the opponents base , But you must kill them before you doing this.Remember to take the energy from them after you killing them! Possitive Facts :  Great movement system. Trading Cards Honestly , The price worth the gameBad Facts :  Not enought players to play multiplayer There is no servers so you can't play multiplayer I don't really like the soundtrack at all.So , I probably really recommend this game , Really enjoyable game to play with your friends!One of the best 2D games I played in my whole time!

												2D, Fast paced, Mech shooter.Orbital gear in a nutshell.The gameplay is fun, you run and jump around a small level trying to kill the other guys. Sounds simpel, and yes, sometimes it is just that simpel. But the planets you jump on have gravity that effects everyone, meanning you have to take into account that if you jump you might not move up, or if you miss a planet you may end up slingshotting yourself halfway across the map. The offline time trials provide a fairly good introduction to the base mechanics but i found that trial by fire in multiplayer did more for me. Because it is really in the multiplayer aspects this game shines. The weapon and map variety is also nice. So far all the levels seems fun and with great opportunities for frantic combat. The guns also seem different and handle different with i quite like. That means that every gun will require a unique playstyle and offer different challenges.To sum up Gameplay: 8/10. The gameplay is excellent if you are looking for a fun and frantic little 2D shooter. Weapons: 7/10. The weapons are nicely varied and well balanced, i do however have some personal issues with the some weapons. Namely the Phase orb.  Sound: 6/10. The guns sound good, the music sounds good and the annoucer is not annoying. All in all, very good. Levels: 7/10. All the levels are small enough to put you close to the action while still allowing for breathing room. Looks: 8/10. Everything looks excellent. The background in the leves looks nice and fits with every level, pretty enough to catch your eye, inconspicuous enough to not be distracting. The weapons looks nice when fired and so does the projectiles All in all: 8/10. Execellent game "

												I wish more people knew about this game, as the community is quite small. The game is fluid, beautiful, and deceptively difficult to master. Great range of weapons allows you to employ tactical and evasive gameplay, as well as laying traps, twitch sniping, and getting up close and personal. As stated above, it looks like it would be easy and straightforward, but the gravity system and the various types of weapons and what they do make it far more in depth than it appears. It is EXTREMELY fun and fast paced. It will get your heart rate going. I highly recommend this game. Get it while it's on sale. $4.99.			"

I caps VIDEO GAMES because it does exactly what games should do. It adds something new to the world of gaming. A completely different challenge to master. It has examples from other videogames but this game puts its own spin on things. I got lost in this game for hours and I will continue to do so.This game pushes you to the edge of your seat. Flying around makes you cackle like a maniac. Flying by people and raining down hell from whichever weapon you see fit for your play style. It really is a great time when you have a full server of chaos everywhere you look.

												Ok, So I didn't play the game for to long, but I got the hang of it. I like it. but like most of these small indie multiplayer games they suffer from a vary small community, I understand its early access and all but its technically ""Out"". I mean you can pay money to do just that ""Access"" the game, regardless of the development faze. I think the game play is strong and I love it, Personally I think the game rocks! but the comminity is short. That said the game has just come out on steam.			"

												This is a nice little PVP death match shooter where you play as a tiny mech in outer space. You can jump from planet to planet with a cool gravity effect that pulls you towards the orbs that you walk around in circles until you jump to another one. So, you have to jump from one orb to another and avoid/kill enemies that are doing the same thing. You can also destroy buildings and repair them and jump on other types of platforms as well. There are many cool weapons to choose from, you have a primary and secondary weapon that you can choose each time you respawn after death. The graphics are really detailed and nice for an indie game and everything works well. I think its worth it for any fan of multiplayer pvp games to try it.I will play more to see what else there is to discover, but after my first match I can say it is a good game and worth your time.

												You know, I really want to say that I  recommend this game. However, I really can't.The gameplay is truly fun, but there are two glaring negatives that throw that all away.Negatives:- Uh, nobody plays? You can look at both EU and NA servers, and you're super lucky if you can find one person to play with. The only way to find people is to go to the community discussions page for this game and beg people. Even the developers don't touch the game anymore, to play nor to develop.- Weapon balance is really bad. Gauntlet and chain gun meta?			"

												ONE SENTENCE REVIEW:Orbital Gear is a 2D side scrolling shooter that does nothing new to the genre, bringing only a bare-bones shooter with bland visuals.LONG REVIEW:Orbital Gear, at first glance, seems to be a cool 2D shooter. You jump from ""planet"" to ""planet"" while trying to aim at your enemies, with a handful of guns. That being said the actual game isn't all its cracked up to be. Playing Orbital Gear is like having a shiny present under your Christmas tree, only to find out that inside that present is an old dusty toy that you already given before. Nothing in Orbital Gear feels new or innovative as I was lead to believe with the description, screenshots, and a few gameplay videos I saw. To sum it up the main gameplay is a mixed between your standard sidescrolling shooter and Angry Birds Space. As you jump from ""planet"" to ""planet"" started to remind of the levels in Angry Birds Space, where once you fling the bird across the planet the gravity will be make you ""slinghsot"" to your target. Similarly to this game. You move around jumping from here and there shooting people left and right, while dodging bullets. Rinse and repeat. As this is the only thing you do in the game, at it gets stale pretty quick since there's only (a total of) 3 Modes in the game. One for Singleplayer and Two for Multiplayer. The singleplayer mode is basically a time trial where the goal is kill and get the stars before time runs out. Nothing special, gets boring quick. Now for the multiplayer portion of this game. There are 2 modes: Deathmatch and Orbital Warfare, Deathmatch is pretty simple, nothing new or groundbreaking. Orbital Warfare on the other hand is the best part of this game where you join a team to protect your home planet and destroy the other, by either collecting power cores and fully powering their Doomsday Weapon or attack head on. This is an interesting mode not only because its unique but also it plays to the strengths of the game. Sadly though I am not recommending this game (currently the game costs a dollar less since its on sale) because the game is sadly dead. And this is the sad reality of multiplayer games once the flames of popularity slowly die down, so does the game. At the time of this review the game contains several servers (namely: USA, EUR, JPN, ASIA), and sadly to say ONLY EUROPE HAS PEOPLE PLAYING. There are no servers available in the other countries EXCEPT EUROPE. And normally there are only two (at the time of this review) and most of the time its almost always Deathmatch, meaning you'll probably never get to play the fun Orbital Warfare since no one plays it. Now the graphics of this game looks good, on screenshots. Sadly though its not really that great, for one when you select your ""mech"" you can obviously tell that the game is made with the Unity engine, sadly though this game doesn't fully utilize the engine, since the game: Dead Trigger 2 looks a lot better. The games textures aren't really that good either. While In-game the mechs may look cool and stuff, but at mech select screen (which is barely a select screen, more on that later) they look ugly and dated. The design of the maps aren't also that good. Some maps look cool while others just look like carbon copies, with just a different background. Now I rarely talk about this but, I feel the need to say this: the UI sucks. From the moment you boot up the game, you're greeted with a menu that looked straight out of a poorly made early access game. Go into settings or the Multiplayer select screens and you're greeted with the bumper triggers of on XBOX 360 controller on the top left and right. This makes me wonder if this game was created for the XBOX 360 but was rejected on the indie store and instead brought here on Steam.And lastly let me talk about its price. I converted it from my currency. So I'm estimating around 5-10 USD. Now let me ask you this is this game really worth it? For 5-10 USD you get a game that's practically dead with dated graphics and bad UI. Do you really think this is worth your money? You can probably spend that money on better things or on a Steam Sale. On the end of the day, No. I do not recommend this game. "

												Okay just as fair review of this, I bought this because of simply little bit of the interest of this game, but mostly because 90% sale.First the gameplay.The game is sidescrolling deathmatch either team or free for all and there is time trial as singleplayer mode, the game is fun and kinda exciting, but without more variation of game modes, that's about it, just select weapons and good to go, no other things.Second the music.Music is pretty kicking to hear and they got variation of it, which is nice.So no problem in that.But now the problem of the game.I seem to find only problem that when you are joined on server and trying to select weapons, it doesn't seem to work, almost most of us having that problem, the way to fix the problem is either relogging to server or restarting the game, but the problem will repeat all the time, except if you continue the playing before leaving or quitting the game.Second problem is that this community is small and maybe even dying because of that problem.If you like this and don't care this problem at this week sale, then go ahead and buy it, but after the sale, I don't recommend to buy it until they fix this problem.Welp, that is all.Doktor Greenman, logging out.

In my opinion, for now the price should be loweredCon 2 The movements are hard to control for newer people. Frustrating to deal with, until you get the hang of it.Pro 1 Tons of weapons and has a generally unique gamemode. Pro 2 This is almost like a battleblock theatre or a mortal kombat, has a story mode and deathmatches/other gamemodes.Pro 3 INCREDIBLY smooth.Rating- 7.6 out of 10. Needs more players.			"

												Bit of an odd game, was quite excited at first by the weird controls, times for the stars seem a little harsh e.g 3 stars = 11 seconds, i get its for a challenge but when you require stars to unlock the repetitive stages in single player to try out weapons its very disappointing, the Learn how to play section was complete BS it just explained the multiplayer aspect of the game and failed to explain controls. So i though hey they have gone to so much effort to do multiplayer ill give it a try but what do you know, there is no one online playing the game. Would give this a positive review if they add a bots mode so i can actually play all the rounds/modes and get a full grasp of what the game has to offer.			"

												TL;DR: I could see this being a really fun game if there was at least twice as much content. As it stands now however I'd say it's not really worth it and certainly not worth $10. Maybe $1-2 tops. The weapons are cool and there's nice variety there and again the gameplay and mechanics are great.I like how this game plays but good god is it lacking in content. I got a 4 pack for $3 and that was arguably barely worth it. There's only 2 modes you can play multiplayer which get old fast when there's hardly anyone online playing and no AI whatsoever.This game could have more longevity if it had a survival mode or any sort of multiplayer mode with AI. As it stands now the only thing you can do in single player and with AI happens to be time trials. Doesn't get more basic than that.			"

												Wow, great!I am not such a fan of shooters, but this one here was even fun for me to try. At the beginning I didn´t know how to get started, but after I figured out what to do this became interesting. The interface, translation and design aren´t the best, but singeplayer was fun to play and not too easy. The basic idea of creating a gravity-based top-down-shooter attracted me; and they say the multiplayer was way better than the campaign. I would love to try it, but so far I couldn´t. If the multiplayer mode is that nice, this would probably annihilate the two big cons I still have: Explanation and price. What I can say according to price is basically, that I guess this game shouldn´t cost 7$, as it looks like a free to play game. I payed 69ct and that influences my opinion a lot. If the developers would sell this for something around 2$ then this would be a fair deal and it could help increasing the number of players, resulting in an active Mulitiplayer community. For the other point I wish a tutorial or something, because there´s a huge lack of explanation. It might be pretty hard getting started, as it happened to me, for example.Oh, by the way, the soundtrack is pretty good, did I mention yet?			"

												I like this game, I really do.It has fun, silly weapons/support items that are situationally OP (depending on map) meaning you need to learn them all and understand when to switch to counter your opponents.Movement is a blast, getting flung around planets at increasingly high speeds and then landing on top of someone with a pulse rocket explosion is great.Visuals are simple but crisp, everything is low-poly but some excellent colour choice and parallax effects really sell it. Each stage is unique in both appearance and layout, every single one is worth experiencing. The mechs themselves look okay at best (very N64-steez), but that barely matters since you view them from such a zoomed out perspective.The sound effects are stellar, and the music is a fun, pumping, Tron-style track that matches the on-screen action to a T.It just has one huge problem: No one is playing it. The only time there is ever a server is when me and my friends go make one to play with 4 players.So fair warning; bring friends who you can hit up to play with you. You will almost never find active servers with more than 1 or 2 people in them, and even then the lag can be just agony.			"

												This game looks and plays pretty well.  My only real issue lies with the fact that the game is tagged with ""Local Co-op"" or I have yet to figure out how to play that way.  I recommend the game to all pvp lovers out there.  But don't buy it if you wanted it for local co-op.			"

If you like games like Race the Sun and such that test your skill and reflexes play Orbital Gear. I can promise you that you will die alot, and i have enjoyed every death.			"

												Keyboard controls are completely unplayable to me. From a standstill left/right are relate to the screen, while jumping they relate to the screen, however while running around a planet they seem to relate to the last button press: Stand on top of a planet, hold left, it'll run around the planet to the bottom, let go, press left again, it'll run right and continue the circle around the planet. Unless you press up or down first, which resets the context.Very confusing and impossible to keep track of.			"

												Got this game free with my EGX 2015 ticket and have so far managed to play it for about half an hour. Initial feedback is that its a fun game with lovely graphics and an excellent soundtrack. It took me a little while to get to grips with the controls and the method of playing the game but once I did I found it very fun. My only critisism is that the leaderboards seem to be filled with fake times (Either that or some people are ridiculously good at this game.

												I love games like this, easy to learn, hard to master. This is a fun relaxing multiplayer skilled based kind of arena 2d shooter with great graphics, satasfying guns and gun sounds. And gotta give props to the background music. And I mean it's a 10 dollar game I got on sale for 1 dollar. I spent 2 hours in deathmatch and I haven't even tried out the other game mode. Would be nice to have a level designer and more game modes, it might have them, i just haven't checked everything out. I was too busy having fun in the deathmatch. I reccomend this game.Edit: Oh and I recorded some of my gameplay here you go if you want to see that the gameplay is like

To put this in perspective I have a PC that can run Minecraft maxed out at full render distance at 70fps no problem. I would recommend this game to you if you are lucky enough to be one of those people who doesn't check the system requirements.			"

												This game is fun and fast paced. It surely might even have the potential to be a new titel in the competetive scene. Gauntlets best weapon in the game. Only one hit weapon in the game --> so Gauntlets > everything else10/10 would play  with the gauntlets again			"

												I won't recommend this game.The basic idea is pretty neat. A ""Soldat"" fast paced with non linear firing trajectories, gravity based levels, etc. Alright.Yet you don't get a good game without a good production.Visuals are OK, though animations aren't really helpful at all. They're mostly doing their job, that's it. The sounds are bland. Musics are below standards, they sound like electro music from someone who just discovered how to make a synth work.I haven't found any bug yet, but that's the least of my concern : the game is nominated in the category ""worse lag of the year in a multiplayer game"", with around 1 to 3 seconds of lag between input and feedback. Figures it's VERY HARD to hit your own foot with this kind of delay, not to mention hitting an actual enemy player. I know multiplayer servers and network code are quite hard to handle, but you don't get to sell a multiplayer only game without a perfect network communication system. Nothing forgives that.Whatever the price is, it's not worth the investment. I won't update the review : you shouldn't ever sell a game that broken.			"

												UNDER RATED. Let it grow on you. The movement in my opinion takes time getting use to. I was navigating sloppily for a while, but it all pays off with practice. Nothing like it. Though the server browser isn't all that active, the single player challenges are addicting. They're tough but satisfying when you complete them. But good luck making a mark on the worldwide leaderboards. I came no where near the times listed. Those records are mindblowing so I play this purely for the fun, stopping to smell the roses. I only care about completing these and enjoying myself. That's more than enough. I could care less if the time aspect was here.The music brings you deep into the game immediately. It's top notch.I also like how it's as fast paced as arena shooters like quake and unreal tournament, if not faster.Abilities like boost, shield, mines seem to be each as useful as one another if you utilize them well and adds that last layer of gameplay that's needed.This is a very unique and original game but manages to be simple and straight forward at the same time. What I mean by that is that there are few gameplay aspects that collectively make up this game that wouldn't benefit from anything additional to that.  Why tamper too much with a great steak. You're not going to put ketchup on that are you?			"

Another one is that controls are hard to catch up with ( and sometimes do bug ( getting stuck / being unable to move ) ) and there isn't much explenation about them in game. All in all it's a great game to play in LAN party with your friends.			"

												This game is a lot of fun to play. The different weapons each provide different strategies and the fact that you can change them in battle (when you die) is great. It lets you optimize your loadout against the guy who just killed you to better get revenge.The only negative is that, so far, I haven't been about to get the game to accept input from my Saitek P880 controller, even though it recognizes it.

												I like this game. But I wish there would be more stages to play through. Only 4 levels..That's it?! Please I want more. I like the weapon design and skill based upgrade system but in all the levels i am playing through same 4 stages.It has a solid gameplay and good sound effects. This game is easy to play but difficult to master. You will think that you mastered the level but in next upgrade (with a different weapon) you may suck in the same level. It requires some good skills to master.And Online play (boy! Oh boy!)...  There are ppl who will kill you twice in a blink of an eye. Too good. Had fun with it, though I died a lot.I bought it for 3$, totally worth it. Surely a keeper for me.			"

												The good:It's like you're a tiny gundam fighting other tiny gundams. Seriously, when you're weaving through the planets in an epic duel with some other tiny robot this game is at its best. There are plenty of guns, equip items, and robots. The bad:People only ever play the deathmatch gamemode from what I've seen, but that doesn't matter really, for reasons to be stated shortly.The time between games isn't long at all, and while there isn't much to do between games, I'd still like more than a ten second break, because once in game, it can take a while, especially with low player numbers, for someone to win. I suppose you could just not respawn for a bit or something, but that defeats the purpose and is beside the point. Because of that, I only ever play for 30 minutes at a time. The lack of bots isn't frustrating, not yet. A game destined to have a small playerbase like this needs them though. If I'm in a lobby and suddenly there are two of us instead of eight, I'd like for bots to take their place. So that all being said, this game is really fun when it shines, and I have no *gameplay* issues with it. The gravity flying about thing is really fun. I follow the 1$=1hr rule, so pick this up while its on sale: I can't recommend it full price. If you have friends, consider the 4 pack (on sale, of course). Four people is a good game in orbital gear, three is doable but that magical fourth makes it so much more fun.			"

												The game is fun, but you can't play it. There is no one online to play with. This wouldn't be a problem if you could play with bots or add bots to multiplayer lobbies. The trial mode is fun, but that is basically a training mode compared to the actual intended combat experience.A game you can't play is a game I can't recommend. Also, I personally like bots in all multiplayer games.One dev stated on the message board that they are not intending to add bot support to this game in the future, and are moving on to produce new games.

Another one is that controls are hard to catch up with ( and sometimes do bug ( getting stuck / being unable to move ) ) and there isn't much explenation about them in game.

												I love this game. The movement works amazingly. Running around planets and jumping from one planet to another is really fun. Especially if you have the booster equiped and time your boost right and send yourself flying around the map, sometimes doing more than one lap.All the weapons function differently and are all fun to use in different combinations. You gets standard guns like the chaingun which just shoot in a straight line, and insane things like the phase orb which shoots a massive ball that can phase through planets, has it's own gravity which pulls players into it and is prone to pulling in the player who shot it.The lack of online community is a big downside however, so if you do intend on getting it, I suggest having a few friends get it too. In my opinion, it's actually way more fun as a party game you play with a few friends.			"

												The good:It's like you're a tiny gundam fighting other tiny gundams. Seriously, when you're weaving through the planets in an epic duel with some other tiny robot this game is at its best. There are plenty of guns, equip items, and robots. The bad:People only ever play the deathmatch gamemode from what I've seen, but that doesn't matter really, for reasons to be stated shortly.The time between games isn't long at all, and while there isn't much to do between games, I'd still like more than a ten second break, because once in game, it can take a while, especially with low player numbers, for someone to win. I suppose you could just not respawn for a bit or something, but that defeats the purpose and is beside the point. Because of that, I only ever play for 30 minutes at a time. The lack of bots isn't frustrating, not yet. A game destined to have a small playerbase like this needs them though. If I'm in a lobby and suddenly there are two of us instead of eight, I'd like for bots to take their place. So that all being said, this game is really fun when it shines, and I have no *gameplay* issues with it. The gravity flying about thing is really fun. I follow the 1$=1hr rule, so pick this up while its on sale: I can't recommend it full price. If you have friends, consider the 4 pack (on sale, of course). Four people is a good game in orbital gear, three is doable but that magical fourth makes it so much more fun.			"

												The good:It's like you're a tiny gundam fighting other tiny gundams. Seriously, when you're weaving through the planets in an epic duel with some other tiny robot this game is at its best. There are plenty of guns, equip items, and robots. The bad:People only ever play the deathmatch gamemode from what I've seen, but that doesn't matter really, for reasons to be stated shortly.The time between games isn't long at all, and while there isn't much to do between games, I'd still like more than a ten second break, because once in game, it can take a while, especially with low player numbers, for someone to win. I suppose you could just not respawn for a bit or something, but that defeats the purpose and is beside the point. Because of that, I only ever play for 30 minutes at a time. The lack of bots isn't frustrating, not yet. A game destined to have a small playerbase like this needs them though. If I'm in a lobby and suddenly there are two of us instead of eight, I'd like for bots to take their place. So that all being said, this game is really fun when it shines, and I have no *gameplay* issues with it. The gravity flying about thing is really fun. I follow the 1$=1hr rule, so pick this up while its on sale: I can't recommend it full price. If you have friends, consider the 4 pack (on sale, of course). Four people is a good game in orbital gear, three is doable but that magical fourth makes it so much more fun.			"

It's basic graphics take you back to the fun time of PS2 when you thought it was the best thing ever made, and this little game, IS the best game I played for 2016. Better than most mech games I've played.			"

												I didn't expect much from this game to begin with because of the sale price of $0.99, but it is suprisingly fun. There is a small bit of a learning curve with the gravity, but over than that a full around good game. My favorite part about the game is the quick and convinient way to just hop into a game and play. I fully recommend the game especially for the amout of game you get for the price.			"

One more thing to add the developer really should make this game free it would have a much less dead of a community if he does that and if he wants to make some money off of it maybe add some DLC or something just for an option or skins for your mech it would really make it more accessable to people who dont have the money to buy this game or just dont want to buy it because of the dead community.

Can you add a team death match game mode? There is only free for all.2. My friends cant join my private server, we can only play in public servers.3. Can you add more guns and utilities?4. Some guns are too overpowered, can you fix them?5. Can you add a voice chat channel? It will be so much better.Thank you!			"

												Macbook pro 2010, 10.10, xbox controllers.The joy I had when I saw the updates roll in was uncontainable. I called my girlfriend over and first had to explain everything before getting to the fix. She didn't care. Neither do you. Here's the deal.Now with working controllers for mac, game parties are way more fun. This fast-paced planet jumping 2-dimmensional (horz & vert) scroller keeps things rolling. The combinations of so many guns and utilities brings about dozens of styles, and while it's easy to settle into a favorite, giving yourself haphazard combinations and trying new approaches is too fun to skip.The local screen gets a little small in multiplayer, but if you have enough experience with the game, you should be able to make it past. I'm still hazing trouble with the fullscreen feature on my mac (as of 5/23/15), but the game is fast, fun, and worth $10. If you see it on sale, snatch it up.			"

												This is a very fun game to play, I will admit that. If you're a multiplayer type of person, don't bother buying this game. This game is a fast-paced, 2D shooter with an arsenal of badass guns... but if you look at this game closer you can see that the multiplayer is basically non-existant and there are no players online, even when you do play with people there are only one or two players actually online. That really bummed me out because this game has so much potential. This COULD be a really fun addictive game to play with your friends and hopefully the devs will fix these problems in the future.

You jump from planet to planet blasting each other with your guns and the most skilled player leaves. Nothing to unlock, nothing to level up, everyone has the same tools at their disposal and it's up to you to figure out the best way to combine them all.

												Great game!I recommend waiting until it is on sale and buying a 4 pack for 3 usd.Not many people play, so it's good to give this to a few interested buddies.If you are just going to get it for yourself you'll probably have to join overseas servers.Good game, wait 'til sale.			"

												I really like this game. It's has new interesting challenging mechanics. If you ever played an FPS like quake or side-scroller moba like soldat and liked it, you would like this game. The gravity mechanics is a blast. Its a great idea and these guys turned out a great game			"
