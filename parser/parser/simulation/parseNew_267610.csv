												So I walked for two hours to get my van, then I drove for an hour to get to the forest to cut down a tree. I watched as the tree fell, a single tear went down my face. I looked at my mission log, and there was a new mission. I then realized I had to cut down another tree that was 2 hours away. I got in my van and began to drive. It was then that I made the decision to drive 70mph into a building. Because only death could save me from this wooded hell.			"

												This game sucks. The chainsaw gives you the most money per tree, everything else earns you less so there is no point in buying machinery. You also move the fastest while on foot, when strafing, the vehicles are super slow. Oh and you also fall through the terrain constantly, there is even a button for resetting your vehicle when it happens so it's not like the developers didn't know about it.Update: Still bad.			"

												Axes and chainsaws baby, the ORIGINAL hack-n-slash.CAUTION: SPOILERS AHEAD!Your first mission has you run off to the ""haunted forest"" to remove three trees so that the undercrop can grow! But why is it a haunted forest? What horrible fate befell those who named it? WHO THE F*** knows! It just is. You're not here to solve some sort of godd**n MYSTERY - you're here to chop down some trees, and that's what your going to do! Plot? Reason? Purpose? You're HACKING DOWN TREES! Why do you *need* a reason? Fine, fine, some Douglas Firs killed your parents and now you're the MOTHERF**KING BATMAN OF THE WOODS. You're not the lumberjack they deserve, you're the flannel wearing badass that they NEED.Are the cops going to chop down trees? Feh, I don't think so. The firemen? Sure, they might have axes, but they're not going to deforest an entire nature preserve on a whim because they're too busy fighting friggin' fires. So it's up to YOU and your in-game vehicle......the CHAINSAW.Sure, you don't actually RIDE it, and yeah - any car that you actually do come across, although parked, glitches like a mother and launches you about 1,000 feet in the air - but does it hurt you? NO. Why?BECAUSE YOU ARE THE GOD**N BATMAN, THAT'S WHY.Now shut up, buy this game and play, the fate of the world just might depend on it.........it *probably* doesn't, because it is a f***ing game about cutting down trees...but ya know...IT MIGHT. It just might.			"

												You start the game as a nameless man with a chainsaw. You wonder who you are and why you are in front of a house. Right about when you get your bearing you are informed that if you cut down 8 trees in a forest on the other side of town you will be paid $12,000. They don’t phone you or contact you in any way to relay this information but you just know... maybe this is all in your head? All you know is that you accepted this commitment and have only 2 hours and 30 minutes to deliver. You look around, you have no mode of transpiration and no real indication of how you got there. The only option is to walk, or in this case sprint. As you are running through town you notice that there are other houses, other cars parked but no people. You run through the entire town and haven’t seen a single person or any signs of life at all. You arrive at the forest where you will begin your job. You find a flagged tree, carefully position yourself in front of it and get to work. After what feels like forever you finish your last tree. You are informed you have finished your job and money appears in your account. Except you don’t have a bank account, it just appears as if somehow you just know you have more money now. You are informed of another job, this one for 3 trees to be cut down next to a farm on the other side of town. You decide that you will spend your money on a van to drive there, everything goes black. You wake up in the middle of town in a van with no indication on how you got there. Who did you buy the van from? Where are they now? These questions will have to wait as your job ahead at the farm has you feeling anxious. You start to drive to the farm when you notice the van says you are traveling at 80 yet you are going slower than you can run. You do not see anyone anywhere in the town, everything feels wrong. The way the van drives, the way it just kind of rotates on its axis instead of steering. You pass the farm and stop dead in your tracks. There is a cow! You jump out of your van and run over to see the only other living thing in this entire world. The cow does not move it just stands there staring at you. You position yourself in front of the cow and look into its eyes and all you see is blackness. The game is over.			"

												First In-Game Adventure: You start out as a random guy with a chainsaw standing in front of a house and you see that you are next to three recycle bins. You wonder who you are and how you got there, and why you are standing next to three recycle bins. You see a tree and you decide you want to cut it down. You run up to it in super lag at 1fps and try to stick the chainsaw which you don’t know how you got into the tree. You try to start the chainsaw but it says you are holding the chainsaw in the wrong position. So you give up and decide to explore. But then, all of the sudden, you feel the need that you need to cut down some trees. You have no way of getting this information, you just know in your mind that you must cut down three trees. So you decide to cut down these trees and you realize that you can run faster sideways than you can forwards. You don’t know why, you just do. In your head you visualize a map. You have no way of getting this map, you just picture it (in the top-right corner of your screen). You run to this place where you feel the trees are and you magically stop. You have reached the end of the world. Small world right? Then you turn around and you see a hideous, very scary sight. You see…a mountain that is literally covered in trees!!! Then you see a crane and decide to jump in it so that you don’t have to look at that hideous mountain anymore. You don’t know how you got in it or what you pressed, but you’re magically in the crane. You can’t get out. You’re stuck. The game is over.Second In-Game Adventure: You start out as a random guy with a chainsaw standing in front of a house and you see that you are next to four recycling bins. You once again wonder who you are and how you got there, and why there are now four recycling bins. Maybe the garbage man came and dropped off another one? These questions remain in your head leaving you in confusion. You see a tree once again and you decide you want to cut it down. You think that maybe this time the chainsaw will actually start…You thought wrong. Once again the chainsaw doesn’t move. You decide that maybe this tree just has problems and doesn’t like you so you decide to run away from this tree that doesn’t seem to like you and you run up a hill. You then remember that you can run faster sideways than you can forwards. You don’t know why, you just do. So you awkwardly run sideways until you come to another tree. You think that this one looks more friendly and will want to be your friend so you can cut it down…You thought wrong. As soon as you get up to the tree and raise your chainsaw, the tree pulls you into it. You don’t know how, since you were standing about 5 ft. away from the tree. How can this be? You are stuck with these puzzling questions waiting to be answered. Anyway, the tree pulls you into it and you go into the tree. You don’t know how, all you know is that you are now inside the tree. But then, things get much more scary. You then fall out of the tree and start falling into a world of whiteness. You look up and you can see that you have fallen out of the world. You can see the bottom of the world fading as you fall farther and farther into the world of whiteness. You look down into the whiteness. It looks very…white. But then, as you start to think that things can’t get any worse…You thought wrong. Black and white lines cover up your screen. Everything fades. The game crashes. You are back at your desktop. Worst simulator game ever…			"

												Woodcutter Simulator 2013's environment is very pastoral and eerily serene. Set in a presumably German valley, the player can hear a constant and unyielding cacophony of chirping of birds in the distance.With regard to the presentation of violence against trees, you're limited to accepting a contract with specifically designated markers. In order to fulfill this, the player walks towards the tree, checks the radar on the bottom right, and begins to rip into that deciduous flesh. Upon felling the great beasts with the chainsaw you'll hear their moaning creaks and be treated to a third person perspective of the tree collapsing.Unfortunately the engine does not model physics too well and you're not free to hack away at trees. The act of cutting down a tree is simply a matter of pressing a button and watching an animation. So with all of this in mind I'd say that only simulation devotees and people like myself who enjoy investigating the curios of Steam should pick up this title.			"

												In this game, you have to fell trees. Lots of them. Initially with a chainsaw. For each tree, you need to watch a minute (60 seconds) of unskippable animation that is the same every time, accompanied by cheesy ""best of telephone hotline"" synth music. This game is making me lose my will to live.You'll be bored to tears before you earn enough money to buy the more interesting equipment, and there's no guarantee the boredom will stop even then. I haven't gotten that far yet.Other ""features"" include* plenty of invisible walls* water that doesn't actually do anything (who needs bridges)* shoddy modeling (saw one house sunk into the ground up to the windowsills)* shoddy forests, looks more like trees stuck on a meadow than natural growth* does not actually simulate woodcutting, merely animates it* walking is faster than driving* the game gives you hours to complete tasks done in minutes* glitches galore (autojumps high when running over small obstructions, saw sound continues when going to the pause menu, sun still makes shadows when set and below the horizon, you can fell yellow-banded trees anywhere, not just where your mission says you should - just keep felling in the forest you're in, game puts you in the car no matter where it is - leave cars at different points on the map to travel quickly, van drives 70 km/h over any type of terrain).* more boring than any truck simulator in existenceWoodcutter Simulator doesn't actually simulate woodcutting. The ""tree radar"" is ridiculous, the chainsaw felling technique is downright dangerous (always cut with the side of the saw, never the tip; do remove the wedge after cutting it; the wedge cut should only cut 1/3 to 1/4 of the diameter into the tree; the back cut needs to be at least 1 inch higher than the bottom of the wedge), and the direction the tree falls in bears no relation to the direction of my cut (I've had some trees fall towards me, even). Falling trees can't get stuck on other trees, and there would be no way to free them if they did because you can't fell trees the game doesn't let you (another indication that this is not a simulator).I recommend this game to people who enjoy the feeling of having wasted their money, or who like to show off to others what truly boring games they own. Everyone else, don't buy at any price. Going outside and watching the gras grow will be a better use of your time than seeing badly modeled trees fall in badly done ""simulation"".			"

												Best game ever 10/10Don't listen to what everybody says. These graphics, the gameplay, controls...just...beautiful. The plot twists are amazing. I couldn't believe that one time I cut the log with my axe, AND IT SPLIT IN 3, not in two. This is seriously a master piece. It was hard not to cry at the ending, once I chopped the last pine tree in existance. There was something about flinging that chainsaw through the poor plant's body that just made you feel so many...feels. Once the pine fell on the ground, and I needed to put the individual pieces in the truck was just...horrifying. It was so vivid you know? The graphics of the poor pine being shredded into pieces just was an unforgettable experience.This is by far one of the best games i've ever played in my life. Totally recommend this game.			"

												Given the title of the game I started with fairly low expectations. Sadly, even then I was let down by the early game. Its true that I have not progressed very far however I feel the game lacks polish. It was glitchy and crashes anytime i plug in the power cord while running on battery. I also wound up walking on top of trees after finding I was unable to climb up a hill trying to get to my objective. The game and interface are not very intuitive. Figuring out where to go on the tiny minimap is confusing (the tutorial is no help being simply a series of 20 second text overlay videos pointing out UI elements), and once you do reach an area figuring out how to use the chainsaw is frustrating. Once you do it simply turns out to be finding the right spot to stand and pressing the action button, no skill or planning involved. The game would certainly be a lot better if it had a more open world sandbox feel. If I were Stihl I would be dissapointed that customers were having this experience with the starting chainsaw being prominently branded. I hope it gets better as I am able to purchase higher end equipment. "

												When I was given this game as a wonderful suprise gift I was overjoyed with the idea of ushering forth some kind of apocalyptic nightmare to virtual nature. I took on the first mission to stalk my lumber-based prey through the hills and found that I was limited to only slaying designated trees. Fair enough, I thought. However, when I came to the target I discovered that the only interaction this game allows is aligning the apparently incoporeal player in the correct position before hitting space bar to have the game take control and cut down the tree for me. CUT DOWN THE TREE FOR ME. The very least they could do was give me the satisfaction of cutting things in a terrible and ill-thought out way but no, there is only one way to cut trees and that is by allowing the game to cut the trees itself. What is freedom without the freedom to fail miserably and hilariously? It is no freedom at all. I am a prisoner, and Woodcutter Simulator 2013 is my hellish prison.			"

After getting burned once by a different title from them I swore never again. The only reason I even have this is because I got it with a simulator bundle. Supposedly the development team was different on this one so I thought I'd give them another chance but it's not worth the HD space or bandwidth to download it. The idea itself has potential if you're a simulator fan but it's so horribly optimized and the gameplay is awful.			"

												This review contains major spoilers, read carefully!The world of Woodcutter Simulator 2013 is an interesting world indeed. Trees fall after being murdered cut down by our hero. He is a magic hero, after the tree cut is finished he vanishes and then uses his magical powers to make all of the limbs off the tree, at times spending the trunk rolling across the map. However, he is a simple man. I started the game expecting a machine like in the movie Fern Gully that let me just drive around and collect some wonderful trees. The game said no to my dreams, handed me a chain saw and hyperflexible arms and told me to get to work. After cutting down three trees and using explosive magic to remove the limbs, I was told to go clear some underbrush. Waiting for Rain Forest Destory 2014, but Woodcutter Simulator 2013 meets my tree killing needs for now.			"

												This game is a total heated up vomit covered cat turd. It's one where I imagine the designers and coders hate their lives and their jobs. I imagined it being kind of unique and quirky kind of like Farming Simulator but no. This is something else. This is a hate letter to the gaming industry. I've recieved better games from cereal boxes and kids meals (see Sneak King for the 360.)  What kind of animals make a game like this? The first issue you'll likely notice, unless you are blind, is that you are stuck in first person view. The point-of-view is from a camera which only seems like it protrudes from the lumberjack's ding dong. Secondly, there's everything else. Terrible animations, sounds, controls, and interface. This hits the abortion-of-a-game homerun. I was gifted this game and I want to refund their money.			"

												Well worth every penny...... if you enjoy flushing money down the drain. I bought this game with childish glee, and literally could not wait to rev up my chainsaw and get to some cuttin'. My enthusiasm, however, was quickly curbed when I got into the game ""proper"". Words fall short when trying to explain this atrocity, invisible walls are everywhere, the chainsaw is considered a ""vehicle"", and the player strafes faster than a bullet train. It even managed to remove any aspect that makes woodcutting so interesting to begin with, even felling a tree is just an animation that you have no control over. This game truly is the ""Big Rigs"" of the simulator genre, albeit blotted of any conceived notion of entertainment. Buying this, even as a joke, is nowhere near worth it.			"

												Somewhat unusually I had some hopes for this title. There have been several surprisingly enjoyable games simulating mundane activities as of late. Unfortunately this one didn't join them, but I'll keep it short.The mouse control is clumsy, movement is awkward and slow.First person chainsaw action was less like the anticipated Doom and more of a line up pixel perfect and press space bar to let the game do all the cutting.The tree physics aren't great and ignore branches, trees bounce off each other unconvincingly.The game apparently expects you to follow roads when walking, causing some frustration with invisible walls in the woods.

												It was daylight when you woke up in your ditch. You looked up at your sky then. That made blue be your color. You had your chainsaw there with you too. When you stood up there was wood dust all over your clothes. Your hands were full of blisters. You wiped them on your grass, so now your color was green. Oh Lord, why did everything always have to keep changing like this. You were already getting nervous again. Your head hurt and it rang when you stood up. Your head was almost empty. It always hurt you when you woke up like this.You crawled up out of your ditch onto your gravel road and began to walk, waiting for the rest of your mind to come back to you. You can see the car parked far down the road and you walked toward it. ""If God is our Father,"" you thought, ""then Satan must be our cousin."" Why didn't anyone else understand these important things? You got to your car and tried all the doors. They were locked. It was a red car and it was new. There was an expensive leather camera case laying on the seat. Out across your field, you could see two tiny people walking by your woods. You began to walk towards them. Now red was your color and, of course, those little people out there were yours too.			"

												I launched this game with some hope. That hope started to die away as I heard the hideous title music, steriotypical of most simulators. I pushed it aside, and continued to browse the menu. I was vaguely impressed by the animation from the main menu to the options menu, and was impressed further still with the video settings. The audios settings were detailed enough, however the controller settings didn't exist. The only options were to invery the 'y' axis and change sensitivity, nothing to do with the actual assignments. So I clicked 'New game'. It gave me the option to do a tutorial or start. So I clicked tutorial, only to descover to tutorial to be a low quality video lacking any form of audio. So, I weeped inside as I saw the last flicker of hope die away, but still I continued and started the game.The game loaded quickly, for me to be stood with a chainsaw, and no form of instructions on how to move or do anything. So, I used my instints and placed my fingers on WASD. Surely enough, I moved as normal. However, when it came to looking around, moving the mouse only moved an on-screen cursor, not changing the direction I was looking at all. Again, I used my instincts and held the right mouse button and moved the mouse again, this time the camera moved. I cried some more as I moved about, being forced to strain my finger by having to hold right click for the whole period of play, similar to 'Roblox'. The difference with 'Roblox', however, is that 'Roblox' has some redeeming features. 'Woodcutter Simulator 2013' however, does not. I then attempted to acheive something in the game. I pressed space, expecting to jump, as the game told me I was in the wrong position to use the machine. I so assumed jumping didn't exist. It may still do, but the game seems to lack a control guide of any description, so I can never know. There was a gloing booklet on the UI, and I clicked it. It brought up a quest to chop 4 trees down in the New Forest and an option to accept, decline, or cancel. I clicked accept and a 1 1/2 hour timer came up with 0/4 trees chopped down. I looked at the godawful minimap in the top left and assumed the large tree was my destination. Sure enough, when I got there there was a glowing arrow above it. On my way, I discoved something the game DOESN'T lack in; Invisible walls. I spent a long time trying to find my way around them, like some sort of sick, twisted maze. I wandered around, hoping to find some option to cut a tree down, and none appeared. Some trees had yellow bands on them, and so I walked up to one of them. A radar with a dot on appeared in the bottom right, and I used common sense to figure that the tree was the dot. I got the dot in the centre of the radar, and pressed space. I then started to cut the tree down. About 40 SECONDS later, the tree finally toppled. It's leaves then popped off, throwing the tree into a wild spasm. I was then released from the cutscene, only to find the tree had not registered as one of the 4 I had to chop down. About 20 seconds later, it registered, and I moved onto the other 3. I finished this, only to find yet another quest to chop down 3 more trees a 5 minute walk away. That's 5 minutes PLUS finding your way around invisible walls. I still feel like I have acheived precisely nothing after 2 quests and a whole lot of finger strain.Overall, this game is utter♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ An ocean with the depth of a tide pool. Drowning in mediocrity.2/10 for you number-hunting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Do not recommend.			"

												Oh what a gift this was! This was my first Simulator game, and my oh my what a terrible experience it was.This game is riddled with bugs, which makes me question whether it even went through any quality control what so ever. The first bug I experienced was a lack of control of where the hell my guy was moving, at first I thought my 360 controller fell off my tower again and the analogue stick was wedged forward, but sadly it was not the case. Other bugs which players may encounter are:- Loading a save game and falling through the world.- Just falling through the world in general randomly.- Trees falling through the world after being cut down.- Trees falling on vehicles and knocking them over.- Sprinting into a vehicle can launch the player into the sky (Actually the best part of the game when I got it to work).- Driving through trees!- Random invisible walls when trying to skip across the terrain when the objective is just behind the hill you're trying to get over.- Trees not falling over after cutting them, which means you need to shunt it with a vehicle for it to fall. Otherwise you can't cut down another tree...- Random game crashesOther than the horde of bugs, sorry I mean features, which this game has to offer it lacks a tutorial which informs you how you actually play this game e.g. how and what trees you are allowed to cut down. This was not so obvious at first, this teaches me for not playing the 2012 version eh? Anyway, there are video 'tutorials', but the videos are just soundless with text displayed at the bottom giving you of very little detail, maybe the developers couldn't record them selves talking without laughing hysterically at what they've thrown together. These videos also don't play some times, I had to restart the game a couple of times in order to to watch all of the videos.The map is fairly big and you have no vehicle to help get you around any quicker. But you know, having vehicles in this game is rather pointless because all you need to do is sprint and move diagonally in order to launch yourself across the map to get to where ever you wanted to go. You don't even need to change 'location' to cut the trees you need, you can stay in the same area for a couple of missions until all the cut-able trees are gone, then you sadly have to move once again across the map to cut that last tree you need to earn that sweet sweet 3,000 something. I have no idea what the currency is in this game, perhaps you're paid in wood for the wood you've just wooded (Sounded a lot better in my head).I could go on and on about the many delights which this game has to offer, but I will say this...It is a terrible game with no clear goal to start with or to continue with. There is no real involvement in cutting the trees, you just need to position yourself and hit the 'GO' button. This game is not worth the full price, nor is it worth half price. At best this game is a gag game to give your friend on his birthday, or a game to gift some one just to show them how much you loathe them.Can't wait for Woodcutter Simulator 2014.			"

The main menu is sublime, the quaint melody and the beautiful scenery made me feel like a child again. I shed a tear, called my family into the room and offered them the greatest pleasure of viewing this masterpiece alongside me. Of course, while initially sceptical they accepted.Upon choosing the single player option you can choose to play either a tutorial or go straight into the main campaign. As I didn't want to keep my audience waiting I chose to jump right into the fray. It was nothing like I expected, there was no waking up, grabbing a cup of tea and calling the wife before setting out to chop wood. Your one and only goal was to chop wood meaning in a dark souls-esque style you wouldn't be able to prepare for the oncoming mission beforehand due to it's open world nature. I was beginning to feel foolish in front of my family for not choosing the tutorial but to my surprise it was all explained in game anyway! After being issued a mission ""Kill 4 trees"" a picture of a tree on the minimap directed me to my goal and I ventured to it on foot.*30 minutes later*After reaching the tree marker I was instantly admist a sea of trees larger than those seen during my adventure to the goal. This was the place, the place of do or die. Walking to my first cuttable tree (you can only cut trees with bands around, showing the care for enviornmental safety this game has - a vital feature to stop people imitating the game on any random tree) I pulled out my chainsaw and felt a thrill. This was my first kill. Watching the gruesome yet wonderful animation (lasting approximately 7 minutes) the tree had fell and disappeared but regardless of reasons my objective of killing four trees was marked ""1/4"". A wry smile and a strange bloodlust filled me as I continued towards the other trees. ""2/4"", ""3/4"", ""4/4"" and I was done. I felt like a god returning to base. I held the fate of those marked trees and I could sense the fear within them. I killed a few more to make an example to those who would dare rebel, keeping my people (trees) safe from those anarchists. At that point I decided to turn off the simulator, for if I strike the wood too often my people would live in fear. The true addiction to this God Simulator lies in the multiplayer. Will the kind, foolish god win the support of the people or will the more assured, logical god win the rise to power? Of course I already know the answer.I don't want to rate this game as I no longer consider it a game. But to all who purchase it be warned for I am God in this world. Fear me. Loathe me. Envy me.

												30 minutes of misery was enough.MENTAL ANGUISH, BROUGHT TO YOU BY STIHL.Chopped 8 trees in 30 minutes after figuring out what the heck I was supposed to do because the tutorial videos were completely broken.Seems like at first you get 6k per mission, which if you buy a van so it doesnt take 20 minutes to run to the next four trees to chop, youd have to do 20 some missions just to get the first piece of machinery. A single tree takes 30 seconds or so to chop with the terrible animations.So, no thanks.0/10 Don' even.I'm noticing a trend from this developer...			"

												I'll be honest I didn't expect much from this game but even so it didn't even meet my low expectations. Van drives on grass, through rivers all at the same speed and all with an identical turning cicle. You can walk quicker sidewises than forward. One of the jobs disappeared half way through it - losing progress. Cutting a tree with a chainsaw is just a case of walking to the exact spot in front and hiting the action button. Should have at lease had you trace the cuts with the mouse. Would have been more fun had you got access to the interesting vechiles at the start but no you have to wander round the map (slowly & aimlessly) making small amounts of money so you can buy a single vehicle. Sort of wonder why the developer bothered to be honest...			"

												I literally have no idea why anyone would *WANT* to play a game about woodcutting, yet here I am and I was oddly intrigued. I played for like 25 mins and I can honestly say I have no ♥♥♥♥ing idea what I was doing that entire time. The tutorial are videos and none of them played for me so I had to wing it and find out to how to do everything. After walking forever to get to the tree symbol and som more time figuring otu which trees I can actually chop followed by trying to find out where I have to stand to actually cut the tree.. I was confused as to why the trees were cutting like at an angle? This♥♥♥♥♥♥is bizzaree, but I guess if you're a wannabe lumberjack you might like playing a game about cutting trees? Sure, let's go with that. Graphics are basic enough, not horrible not great. If you really want to... cut wood... well, you don't have any more options besides woodcutter simulator 2013 now do you?

												Okay, I ended up getting this for 50 cents because I had to know.  I wondered who out there this game was for.  Figured looking over the company managing aspect of the game would at least briefly educate or entertain me.  While I did not expect to mess with it much, one I figured out how to actually cut a tree down (something even the tutorial videos never bother to teach you) I figured out the unintuitive interface I learned that all there is to do is buy a few pieces of new logging equipment.  That is the extent of the ""run a whole logging operation"" aspect of the game.  Make enough money to buy a tractor with a saw (where you can walk sideways faster than it drives, because you Zoidberg scuttle at absurd speeds) and you get to cut the same number of trees with it.  A major logging operation is still considered 5-8 trees.  The game puts a time limit on this, buy I don't know why as it is 2.5-3hr.  Real time hours.  For something that MAY take 15 tedious minutes.I understand now why the town you are in is devoid of all life except you.  In a world with this little interactivity where your only lot in life is walk or drive to the next tree and try to get the money to get something else to get to the trees with and hit one button to see the same canned tree-felling animation and repeat, they probably all climbed into their saws.  It would explain why no one is in the sawmills, woodchipper, or train station.  They've all flung themselves into the machines and perhaps murcifully denied you those industry services the game says you interact with.  I wish this game could be so bad it's good.  As it stand I could only see showing it off as a showcase of things that should not be or if you need a mindless repetative task so you can do something with your hands while you watch TV.  I can't think of anyone who wouldn't avoid this anyway, but even if you're some sort of business tycoon game fan with a lumberjack lust in you, there is nothing in this game for anyone.			"

												It's a woodcutter simulator; I wasn't expecting much out of this game, but it met my expectations. Initially you run around with a chainsaw and cut down trees for money, and then use that money to buy tree cutters, and log haulers, etc. The physics can be glitchy at times, sending your player or car flying through the air, but you don't die from it, so it is not frustrating, but hilarious more than anything. Also, you can no-clip through large trees while driving vehicles, so that is unrealistic, but hilarious. Its a simulator with meme-tastic moments. Either get it in a bundle or don't pay full price for it.			"

												As a fan of the simulator genre, and someone who spent five years felling trees, I had realistic expectations for this game.  It failed to deliver in nearly every way possible.  This is a horrendous failure for the genre.  They essentially remove the player from every aspect of actually cutting wood, and engage the player in every other way possible, all the ways they didn't advertise. Clunky ControlsI hope you don't want to drive in anything other than straight lines, and I hope you are used to walking around taking 3-foot steps at a painfully slow pace.  The mechanics of the game require you to be in a particular spot to initiate action, and while your slowest walking speed is painfully slow, they seem to want you standing on a dime, because you just can't take a small enough step to be in the right place the first time.  Oh, and did you want to look around with the mouse?  Get some tape for your RMB.  Did you want a chase cam for your vehicle?  I hope not, because once you set the cardinal direction you are looking with the mouse, you're locked on.  ""Wanna go for a walk?""  A more accurate title may have been, ""Walk around with a chainsaw simulator"" you will spend more time wandering around the map getting to the objectives than actually performing them.  Your walking speed is painfully slow, your sprinting speed is rediculously fast.  Really, why would I buy a van to deliver myself and supplies to the jobsite when I can run there faster and my legs never need repairs?Safety last!The game makes an utter mockery of safety.  You are felling trees, what would you wear?  At least stick with the stereotype and give me a flannel shirt!  I get the impression you are out felling trees in a t-shirt and shorts, hell, you might even be wearing flip-flops (you can't see your feet, which is probably for the best) As you cut the tree, the cutter keeps the bar only half-engaged in the wood, just asking for a nasty kick-back, and hey, what are wedges? who need one of those? If you are going to simplify gameplay to the point of being no-fun at all, at least be safe and accurate!Booooring!You know what the most exciting part of felling trees is?  It's the art and science of cutting the tree, getting it to fall with the lay of the rest of your cut logs, gaging the wind, slope, and making precise cuts to guide the tree onto your targeted bit of ground.  They took all this skillful operation of an exciting bit of equipment, and pared it down to a cutscene.  Not a particularly good cutscene.  If I didn't have practical experience, I'd be led to believe that Stihl makes giant red markers, because that's obviously not a kerf you're leaving on the tree! In the height of opposite-land, while it takes you a painfully long 30 seconds to make your face cut and back cut, limbing the tree (the longest and most boring part in real life) and makes it the part you look forward to, because it means you again have control, and can walk up to a tree and push a button... wait, you won't look forward to that. Graphics, does anyone have any graphics?  The max resolution is well below my standard screen resolution, and with all the graphics cranked to max, well, it's lackluster.  You'd think a chainsaw would call for some visible particle effects, but I guess they wanted to reinforce the idea that you're just drawing red lines on the tree.  Heavy EquipmentYeah! heavy equipment, maybe they skimped on the chain saw parts to emphasize equipment operation, right?  WRONG! the heavy equipment is as irritatingly over-simplified as the rest of the process, and as boring to use.  I've owned this game for half an hour, and I already have buyer's remorse... did I mention I got it on sale? If this game was free to play, it would be over-priced.  You should be paid to play it.  Save your $5, if you want to waste time, there are many actual games that can waste it more enjoyably. "

												Table of Contents:- Foreword- Graphics- Gameplay- Sounds- Controls- Quality- Overall Experience-ForewordSo, first of all, i didnt expect much, what should i even expect from a simulator game?Yeah, there are some good simulators, but most of them are just♥♥♥♥♥♥-GraphicsThe graphics and level design were better than in other Simulators, could still have been much better, even with a low budget.-GameplayThe gameplay was insanely boring. When cutting a tree with your chainsaw it takes a 30 second animation untill its completly down. Pretty much one of the most boring games there is.-SoundsWhat should i say about Music in a simulator game? The music in every simulator game basically sounds the same.About the sounds themself, they are not that good, some of them sounds pretty unrealistic, some sounds are not even existing, the game just feels pretty weird.-ControlsThis is the main reason why noone should ever get that game.Its a 3D First-Person game, but you have to hold rightclick to change what you're looking at.If you dont hold down rightclick you basically move your courser around the screen. Would have been better the other way around imo.Also by combining Shift, A and W you could sprint insanely fast.-QualityWell, as i mentioned before, you could sprint insanely fast when pressing the Sprint key, walking forward and sideways facing in a 45° angle. You were even faster than a car. Much faster. Like twice as fast.When starting the game it changes your screen resolution which ♥♥♥♥ed up my screen because i've got 2 screens with well-positioned windows. Its annoying if thats just getting destroyed by the game starting.As i said, controls are bad. You can walk through most tree's.It didnt save the setting twice for me, didnt try a third time.The game crashed my whole PC kinda when i wanted to put it in windowed-mode, i just had a complete black screen, couldn't even do CTRL+ALT+DEL, couldnt close down woodcuttingsimulator2013.exe, i basically couldnt do anything anymore. RIP.The animations are pretty slowly playing and bad, doesnt look realistic.The physics were insanely bad, my car was driving through the river, coming out on the other side (with an insane airtime of like 10 seconds even though it should have been 2 seconds not even) and continued to drive.The Car controls feel like bad car mods in minecraft.-Overall ExperienceOverall, i think thats one of the worst games i've ever played. I wouldnt recommend anyone to get, even think about getting that game... Honestly, its just bad. Btw. if you wonder why i've got 3 hours of playtime, after half an hour my mom got back from london, i forgot to turn of the game so i was still ingame for some time.			"

												Okay Noobs trying to cut tree's DO NOT CUT TREES LIKE THEY SHOW!!!!!!! It's not the right way... it does have the concept but you will hurt yourself and or someone or even a building. I'm certified by the US Federal Service chain saw and I'm Giving you a Warning!! I dis Aprrove that they show because the angle is to deep and you DO NOT cut threw the ridge. What happened to using the GUNNING SIGHT? UGH This games a fail...... Also why cant you use a wedge and a felling axe to Aid your felling. Just take the UBAN FORESTRY class and CHAIN SAW CERT and then think about felling a tree. Thx			"

												This game gave me a headache. The camera for some reason seems to be close to the crotch which is weird. Straffing sideways is the fastest way to travel across the map. If you walk up against a vehicle you shoot up in the air. You walk right through the water and when you are going down or up an inclince you go flying up in the air afterwards. Despite all of this wonky♥♥♥♥♥♥you can't go up to the top of the hills because that would be breaking the game. The controls are stupid too and aren't obvious I found that it was easier to look up the controls on the internet than look them up in the game because the help menu is vague as ♥♥♥♥. Its so mind numbing. It hurt me to play this game. Thank god I didn't pay full price for this game and got it in a bundle.

												Nooooope. The game begins. You have a chainsaw. There are trees. That is all. You don't actually aim the chainsaw. You don't even hold the button. You literally run up to one of the pre-approved ""this is cut-able"" trees and click one time, wait for a 10 second graphic. Wander over to the next tree and repeat.If there is some stategic level or some sort of lumber mill management, I haven't seen it yet. I'm not sure I'll make it past the ""running through the woods looking for acceptable trees"" stage.			"

												I am sure if you owned any of the previous Woodcutter simulator games you will have been all over this like a bout of the clap.  But if like me this is your first step into the world of woodcutting simulation then what you get will truely surprise you.From the moment this game loaded up I was speechless.  When you start off you have a basic chain saw and some trees.  After an hour of play I had a chain saw, some trees and some wood.Can't wait for my friends to buy this so we can play multiplayer.  This is probably the best wood cutting sim out there and having played it I am tempted to quit my current line of work, buy myself some kit and go chopping down trees!This is even better than Euro Truck Simulator.

												The best game I have ever played, absolutely phenomenal. The controls are almost an instruction from the god of woodcutting. The gameplay is just something else, i've spent hours on this game and haven't been bored for a single second. The word 'simulator' stands out here as there was several times during gameplay when I truly believed to have stepped into Hugh Jackman's shoes from X-Men where wolverine is acutally a wood cutter. This is a good sign for a game. At least, it was until I began to believe I was Hugh Jackman in real life, which led to monumental disappointment. Would not recommend this game to anyone who isn't Hugh Jackman. But if you are Hugh Jackman, it's utterly fantastic. 10/10			"

												Are you an insomniac that needs something to put you to bed? You've Tried Melatonin, Alchohol, sleeping pills, a combo of all 3. Or maybe you need something fun to do while you're tripping balls on LSD, mushrooms, or whatever synthetic you kids are using these days (again maybe some sort of combination)THEN WOOD CUTTING SIMULATOR 2013 IS YOUR GAME!The game in a nutshell1. Walk to tree (Or drive close with your van)  but, not too close not to far away, make sure that tree is in yoru green circle, using the keyboard is a treat while you tap.. OOOOO too close.. tap back.. OOOOO too far away.. Trying another approach, OK I""M IN THE CiRCLE THANKS!!!!2. Press space..3. CUt 1 (10 seconds) CUT 2 (10 seconds) CUT 3 (same).. TIMBER (wait 10 seconds to delimb) 4. repeat for # of trees on mission.I've played for 30 min or so now, and I have a headache from the monotony, I may have fallen asleep for 10 of those 30 min so there's that.This is great for your hardcore lumberjack types who want to cut down trees, then walk around to find another one to cut down.  Maybe you like graphics and detail:The amount of detail is too much for my 1gb graphics card, and dual core 3ghz processor, 3-4gb of ram is easily eaten by this 500mb download. I had to lower my resolution and dumb down the graphics so it wasn't choppy. So if you have a High end gaming PC and really want to test it out, get this game as a benchmark. Will it run Woodcutter simulator 2013 may not have the same ring as crysis but I'll be damned if it's not true.			"

												Woodcutter Simulator 2013 is an exciting simulation game. I would firstly like mention that games such as this must captivate you with its simplest mechanics - and WCS13 does exactly this. Each tree felled offers a rollercoaster of emotions, it makes one feel things that they have not felt since they were a child, emotions such as pure innocent euphoria. I have ""cut"" hours from games such as DotA 2 and MineCraft in order to play WCS13, and I am glad I did. WCS13 has not only boosted my confidence and ability as a lumberjack in real life, but has also improved my organisational skills and ability to meet dead-lines. You see, the in depth job-assignment-system (JAS) requires the player to continually think about the most efficient method to complete the given task. Boy, those dead-lines are indeed heart racing. But they are as exhilarating as they are rewarding. With each cash payment for your job you know you are closer to purchasing the next vehicle that will further your experience in WCS13.Despite all this, the creators of the game were still able to produce such a charming yet casual sound-track. The catchy, upbeat songs will have you almost jumping out of your seat ready to dance!I give this game five cleared Brazilian Rainforests out of five.			"

												You play a ghost that is tasked with endlessly cutting down trees.  This is why your chainsaw never cuts through trees but instead leaves a red line.Until you cut your first tree you have no idea you are a ghost, it's all very sixth sense really.  But the moment that camera pans back revealing a tree falling with no-one near it you realise the ghastly truth.  From that moment on the story really kicks into high gear.It isn't until the final act of the story that you find out the reason for your ghostly tree cutting.  I don't want to spoil it too much, but you'll need the axe from the fifth mission for the good ending as it is the only way to severe mother nature from her roots.			"

												WARNING: If you're looking for an easy out-of-box type of experience, then stay away from this Sim.Do I recommend this game?... 50% Yes, and 50% No. If Steam used a Star Rating, I would give it 2.5 of 5 Stars. It's a love / hate relationship. I love the idea of this Sim, the creativity it involves, the scenery, the sounds of nature, and the sounds of machinery. It has free play value, or you can create your own strategy of how to complete a task.But, I do hate the technical difficulties the Sim dishes out and you have to waste time fixing them. It's sad you have to do such things on something you paid for. On the other hand, recovering from an object collision detection error has a challenging element of it's own. Some errors you can fix within seconds, others may take minutes.After ironing out the graphical errors and finding the right settings that work best, it's a pretty fun Sim. However, I'm a ""chill out"" type of Sim person to begin with and I have patience with editing game files. I'm a hobby programmer, so I have an unfair advantage other gamers don't have.I would also like to point out I've discovered there are 2 different sub-versions of Woodcutter Sim 2013 that both say they are version 1.0.0.6. One version does not include the Flatbed Truck, but the Steam version does. For some people that might not be saying a whole lot, considering it was a last minute add-on that wasn't planned out very well. For one thing, the engine tune sound does not change while driving the Flatbed. Another thing, the trailer has Drive Wheels instead of Free Wheels, which tend to push the tractor over in both slow and fast turns. However, this does amount to combined horse power so you can climb hills faster while transporting the Feller. On the other hand, it's hard to drive the Flatbed around tight corners in reverse because the 2 Drive Chains work against each other. So, there's advantages and disadvantages to work with there. You have to compromise with strategy and learn the terrain.The PhysX for the Sim was not coded for entire realism, but you do get the ""jest"" of things while operating the machinery. You will not find proper weight and mass PhysX in Woodcutter, nor any of the previous Sims released by UIEG. The collison detection still needs lots of work, because you should not be able to fold a tractor parallel to the trailer, that's just absurd. You also should not be able to drive a Utility Van into a Feller at ground level and cause the Feller to fall over, but I guess I'm just nick-picking now... lol.Speaking of those Collision Detection errors... If you play Woodcutter using the default settings, then there's a high probability you will experience gradual degrading functionality. Especially with the logs, trees, and vehicle tires. Sure, everything starts out great, but eventually the game engine is going to ""burp"" and you'll find yourself fighting with the Self-Loader Truck while attempting to pick up ""ghost"" trees or logs. The crane clamps will begin to pass completely through the objects for no apparent reason. Sometimes shutting down the Sim and restarting it fixes the glitch, but it's not always going to work like that. The same is true for vehicle tires when they find an invisible hole in the pavement to fall through or get stuck in (restarting the game might work, might not). Paying for vehicle assistance sometimes proves to be a failure as well and you'll still find yourself restarting the game to fix it. You might find yourself dropping trees straight through the ground, or see a tree bobbing around in the grass like a fishing cork. You might even discover an invisible object in a place where it wouldn't usually be as you slam into it while moving around in the forest and it causes you to dump your load. Sawmill logs might magically vibrate themselves straight out the end of the trailer and you'll have to gather them back up. If you put trees in the yellow log truck, they might slip backwards as if they are sitting on grease (what happened to tie downs?). You can press the ""1"" key to jump out of the Self-Loader Truck and your shoulder can tap the tractor and cause it to flip over on it's side, then you have to work the crane again and push the tractor back over. Luckily the trailer is more durable and allows the tractor tires to pass straight through the front-end... LOL... but don't count on it, you can still lose your load in the process. I could go on and on over the crazy things I've seen in this Sim, but the point is to be careful and be aware these things can happen. Save your game often and name them so you'll know where to start over at, if you have to.There is something you can do to help avoid the glitches more often. Search the WoodCutter discussion threads on Steam for the file ""device.icom"" (notice the period) and you'll find instructions. Basically you have to turn down the graphics and increase the refresh rate.You can also use cheat codes to help you get out of a jam, so also search for ""cheating.login"" (notice the period) and you'll find instructions for that too.What is this Sim worth? As it stands now, probably $2.49 and lot's of patience. At least you get material to work with, but you have to figure out how to make it run better.			"

Just shred it and never think about it again.			"

												This game is an absolute mastery and a strong contender for game of the year.From the beautiful landscapes, to the immersive sound-design that makes you almost smell the fumes as you use your ®Stihl chainsaw to effectively harvest lumber.Although the first-person aspects of the games are great and feature the most fluid controls i've ever witnessed, the game truly shines in management mode. The game accurately represents the daily dealings of a small lumberyard, as a 17 year veteran of that business i know what im talking about. If you dont know what to get your loved ones for christmas let this be it, it WILL change their lives.			"

												I bought this game as it looked really cool. Didn't read reviews. ""This game is almost 3 years old, all bugs must be fixed by now"" I said to myself. I was wrong.I started a new game. Spawned in the yard of my house(?) with chainsaw in my hand and I guess eyes taped to chest. I see a tree in my yard which I think is the one to be cutted, walk to it. Can't walk to it, there's invisible wall preventing me. Okay... There's another tree I go cut it. Wrong position. Aww snap... Well anyway.... Let's walk around to see what to do, oh there is gas station but nothing else. I do U turn and wonder where to go... HEY! *Snaps fingers* I need gas to use the chainsaw... Make another U turn, my characters just bumps up to the sky hitting an mystical ceiling. Wtf... Manage to get to the gas station after landing safely unharmed. Can't buy gas. Oh there's a nice book in my inventory(?). Cut down 1 tree and a weird map with marking comes to my eye corner. Go to the mark... See a yellow arrow in the sky pointing to grass. This must be a bug, there's no tree where the arrow is. Try to cut down pretty much everything around... everything is in wrong position. Cancel the task(Cost 450$ without ever seeing the guy who wants it done). Take new task... cut down 3 trees. OK. Run there wildly through trees(?????). Oh there's the trees, someone circled them with yellow tape that's nice... Cut down the trees and get the money... This game sucks badly. Quit the game. Never again Woodcutter Simulator 2013			"

												Have you ever wanted to be a simple Woodcutter?  Do you find yourself sitting in your chair dreaming about cutting down trees? Dream no futher, because Woodcutter Simulator 2013 is the game for you! The game starts with you recieving a mission to cut down a few trees with your chainsaw. The woodcutting mechanic is basically line up in front of the tree, press a button and watch the animation of you cutting the tree. Rinse and repeat until the mission is done so you get paid. After that you will get a new misson, to cut down more trees, with the same mechanics. It is proven that playing this game for more than an hour is a danger to your health, so just stay away from it.

												I bought this game 3 days ago, I cannot get on the game. I see alot of other people have had this same problem. I have tried alot of different suggestions and nothing is working. Can anyone help? I have windows 7. I have farming simulator disc that works fine. This is my first download on this computer, it is a IBUYPOWER computer. I am sure I am doing something wrong, just don't know what. It says it is downloaded and it is in my library. When I hit play it comes up for a few sec then disapears. and returns to the home screen. It says I have played for 17 min. in 3 days. It says syncinizing for a sec then disapears.. Thanks for any help!			"

												Have you ever wanted to be a simple Woodcutter?  Do you find yourself sitting in your chair dreaming about cutting down trees? Dream no futher, because Woodcutter Simulator 2013 is the game for you! The game starts with you recieving a mission to cut down a few trees with your chainsaw. The woodcutting mechanic is basically line up in front of the tree, press a button and watch the animation of you cutting the tree. Rinse and repeat until the mission is done so you get paid. After that you will get a new misson, to cut down more trees, with the same mechanics. It is proven that playing this game for more than an hour is a danger to your health, so just stay away from it.

												As far as simulation games go this is probably one of the worst I have ever seen. To put a price tag of 14.99€ on this is more than a complete rip-off. I got this game together with 6 other simulation games at -90% off and that is still too expensive.The only fun you could possibly get out of this is when you play it with some friends, that is if you actually have friends that own this ""game"" and you are able to figure out how to play together.Not like you'll be able to see your friends since there are no character models outside of driving a vehicle.There isnt really a reason to drive a car either since you'll move faster by just running and strafing.If it wouldnt just crash randomly and glitch out most of the time you might have some fun together, then again you could do more enjoyable things to begin with.

												I bought this game as it looked really cool. Didn't read reviews. ""This game is almost 3 years old, all bugs must be fixed by now"" I said to myself. I was wrong.I started a new game. Spawned in the yard of my house(?) with chainsaw in my hand and I guess eyes taped to chest. I see a tree in my yard which I think is the one to be cutted, walk to it. Can't walk to it, there's invisible wall preventing me. Okay... There's another tree I go cut it. Wrong position. Aww snap... Well anyway.... Let's walk around to see what to do, oh there is gas station but nothing else. I do U turn and wonder where to go... HEY! *Snaps fingers* I need gas to use the chainsaw... Make another U turn, my characters just bumps up to the sky hitting an mystical ceiling. Wtf... Manage to get to the gas station after landing safely unharmed. Can't buy gas. Oh there's a nice book in my inventory(?). Cut down 1 tree and a weird map with marking comes to my eye corner. Go to the mark... See a yellow arrow in the sky pointing to grass. This must be a bug, there's no tree where the arrow is. Try to cut down pretty much everything around... everything is in wrong position. Cancel the task(Cost 450$ without ever seeing the guy who wants it done). Take new task... cut down 3 trees. OK. Run there wildly through trees(?????). Oh there's the trees, someone circled them with yellow tape that's nice... Cut down the trees and get the money... This game sucks badly. Quit the game. Never again Woodcutter Simulator 2013			"

												First Impressions:I'll admit I haven't played very much of it to see if the purchasable vehicles made the game more engaging, but I wasn't able to get past the ""chainsaw"" stage as it just wasn't very fun.  You'll basically be accepting quests and going to cut down trees to earn money, which you can then use to purchase vehicles.  As I said though, it's all very monotonous and boring (surprise surprise).  You don't actually get to control the chainsaw...you simply find the ""quest"" tree(s), stand in the right spot (with the help of a radar), and click a button.  The AI does the rest.  Maybe the game gets better, but I was too bored to wait around to find out.  I picked this up during a Bundle Stars sale (10 games for $4) and glad I didn't pay full price.

												This isnt a game, this isnt a simulator, this isnt 2013.  You dont get to cut wood, you dont get to simulate running a lumbermill.  There is no economic system, no management, and no entertainment at all.  This developer and publisher have a bunch of games like this on steam right now for $15, all of which are ripoffs.  This isnt even demo quality, its more of a nearly featureless alpha.  I cant even get the game to start anymore, which is disappointing because I wanted to cheat to see how well developed the expensive vehicles are (utter♥♥♥♥♥♥i'm guessing).  please do not support this dev, I dont want to see anymore budgetless games like this anymore.

												Have you ever wanted to be a simple Woodcutter?  Do you find yourself sitting in your chair dreaming about cutting down trees? Dream no futher, because Woodcutter Simulator 2013 is the game for you! The game starts with you recieving a mission to cut down a few trees with your chainsaw. The woodcutting mechanic is basically line up in front of the tree, press a button and watch the animation of you cutting the tree. Rinse and repeat until the mission is done so you get paid. After that you will get a new misson, to cut down more trees, with the same mechanics. It is proven that playing this game for more than an hour is a danger to your health, so just stay away from it.

												shoot me. simulators don't get worse. where do I start. ok so the idea is that you run (literally) to jobs and cut dowqn trees. If you are thinking you get to weld a dangerous and powerful chainsaw like in doom circa more than 20 years before this ""game"" think again. you basically have a weird docking system and then a slow mistake free perfect automated process. repeat that a dozen or so times and you get a little bit of cash after an hour or so of this you can buy loggin gear. now I'm thinking hell yeah the game is starting! Well the first thing I could afford was a van. which I assumed would be faster than running everyplace... wrong. not only is it more mistake prone you furthermore travel about 1/3 the speed of just running. speaking of running since you will be doing it all the time to same time. it turns out to be even faster is you go forward and sideways so you will have to learn to navigate at 45 degree angles on the map.summary don't buy it not even for free. this was clearly somebody just scamming the gaming community and they had no intentions of making a game even good enough to be called a simulator.overall score -1the developers and valve should be ashamed to have this on the market.EPIC FAIL!

												This game is really not very good.The controls are very poor with awful default settings, the graphics are very dated indeed, and I fell through the terrain almost immediately.  At this point I turned it off.  I didn't even cut down a single tree. "

												I bought this game as it looked really cool. Didn't read reviews. ""This game is almost 3 years old, all bugs must be fixed by now"" I said to myself. I was wrong.I started a new game. Spawned in the yard of my house(?) with chainsaw in my hand and I guess eyes taped to chest. I see a tree in my yard which I think is the one to be cutted, walk to it. Can't walk to it, there's invisible wall preventing me. Okay... There's another tree I go cut it. Wrong position. Aww snap... Well anyway.... Let's walk around to see what to do, oh there is gas station but nothing else. I do U turn and wonder where to go... HEY! *Snaps fingers* I need gas to use the chainsaw... Make another U turn, my characters just bumps up to the sky hitting an mystical ceiling. Wtf... Manage to get to the gas station after landing safely unharmed. Can't buy gas. Oh there's a nice book in my inventory(?). Cut down 1 tree and a weird map with marking comes to my eye corner. Go to the mark... See a yellow arrow in the sky pointing to grass. This must be a bug, there's no tree where the arrow is. Try to cut down pretty much everything around... everything is in wrong position. Cancel the task(Cost 450$ without ever seeing the guy who wants it done). Take new task... cut down 3 trees. OK. Run there wildly through trees(?????). Oh there's the trees, someone circled them with yellow tape that's nice... Cut down the trees and get the money... This game sucks badly. Quit the game. Never again Woodcutter Simulator 2013			"

												Got this in a bundle for less than a dollar and still fell like I didnt get my money's worth.  I was never in the right position for the saw and never figured a way to get into position.  Just frustrated and suggest you avoid this unless you really feel the need to imagine cutting down a digital tree (since it won't let you)...Or just go play minecraft and do the same thing, really.

												Actually not too bad. It is a little boring only because it is exactly what the title says- a woodcutting simulator. However, using the machines can be fun and it is fairly well built, even with some funky mechanics. It gets boring after a while and it is tough to deal with the same animation every time you cut a tree.			"

												This Game is now 2 Years old. My PC is not the best one, but it still can run this Game. How ever, i dont really like this Game. The Models are not 'ok' (like what Rammus say). The Hand is like a Cube. The Way how you cut the Tree is very very not realistic af. I wasn't playing this Game long, because it was very close from to get AIDS. lol.All in one: Do not buy this Game, only you want to be a real Woodcutter!			"

												The character's constantly on the move, no matter what you try to do with the controller; the best you can do is send them in the opposite direction, or look around. This game is as broken as Matt Hardy, but not in a good way. DELETE!			"
