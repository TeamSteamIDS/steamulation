												Very short game, I finished it in 4 hours. While playing, I didn't find the game to be that much fun, and I would not recommend it to anyone unless it was free.			"

												DO NOT RECOMMEND! this game is nothing more than the PAYING version of the online game Dinner City. Dinner city is a free online game which is the SAME GENERAL CONCEPT of this game. Please, do not waste your money.. or your hard drive space on this POS. - H/K Gamer Review			"

												This is by far my most favorite Dash game! I really put some time into this game making sure that I accomplish all the goals efficiently. Like all Dash games, they have a simple formula but this one in particular shines the most as there is even a silly story to give you that extra motivation to play. Great for all ages!			"

												Pain... I kept wondering why the F$#¨% i bought this thing....the Tycoon addition to the name definetly tricked me... but it was the first and only time.. Thx to this game i will always triple check a game if it has Tycoon added to the name....Its stupid, plain silly. No challenge, yet no chill. Its just sad... seriously dont buy this think ""oh manage a restaurant type o ♥♥♥♥"" nope nope, its more like a celphone game, clicky clicky type of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ crap.If i got this game for free i would seriously sue the mofuc&*&			"
