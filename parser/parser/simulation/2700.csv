												Let's start here. Unlike many other RCT games, this game allows you to build in ways you could never build. Unlike many, this game allows to create a park, in your own image. The first game allowed you to just that, but, only, instead of simple rides, this allows you to include things you never could.                                                                              - Fireworks                                                                             - Waterfalls                                                                             - Zoo's                                                                                 and                                                                             - Swimming Complexes ( Pools. )This game brings 3D into a new direction for the games, even though, in my own opinion, the old games were just as good.Now, you might wonder... ""How is this game any different?""Here are a few reasons. - 3D graphics- More food/drink/misc stands.- Guests are renameable- You can speed up or even pause the gameand - Fireworks are able to be used.and so on. This has been Redman and his current perspective of the game.			"

												""When you are in Hell, only the Devil can help you out""In RollerCoaster Tycoon 3, watch as thousands of helpless guests wander into a seemingly harmless amusement park of deadly traps, such as unfinished rollercoasters headed straight for populated swimming pools. Imprison tourists in unescapable, endless loops of riding the same rides over and over again; for simply asking of lowering the $10 price of admission to the restrooms. Create 'water' slides leading to 40ft deep concrete floors, and wonder how the authorities still have not caught onto your selfish game of sadistic torment; as the endless supply of unknowing families stray themselves into a permanent vacation.By far the greatest Saw game ever created.

												This is a game that take some time and dedication to truely enjoy. Yes there are people out there who love to just line up all the peeps into the main area, and just blast them to smitherines. This is fun yes, but this is the playstyle that would lead to reviews of ""not having any replay-ability"". This is just based on how that person played the game, ignore it, and move on. If you have patience, and a good creativity, make a campain world, and you can prosper. There is sandbox (even for those that are creative it is an amazing outlet) which is like any game's creative mode, allowing infinite building. This has been one of my top five games for most of my life, and will most likely remain there.Graphics 7/10- While the look of most things is amazing, closer up you can almost taste 2006, but that aside the gameplay it-self is amazing (I personally have not looked into it, but I'm quite sure someone out there made a texture pack or twenty)Gameplay 10/10- It allows many stories to be played, and can take quite a while (My current time from steam is flawed, I actually have had this game since 2009, and have logged at least 200 hours)Replayability 9/10- as I said, the game is indeed boring for those without patience or creativity, and I tend to lack in patience, this is my own personal opinion (From any official opinion, I would easily give it a 10/10)Overall 9.5/10 Amazing game, and a texture pack would put the icing on the cake*Note*For those of you that are the crash and burn kinda people, just letting you know, the peeps are indestructable, believe me I tried VERY hard (Crushing, drowning, melting, more crushing, smashing, throwing, dropping, etc.)All in all I hope that based on your personal experiences with you own past gaming, you can enjoy this game as well. A excellent use of your $20.			"

												RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 allows you to create any theme park you can think of. From one that can be extremely fun for the families coming to visit or basically a death park due to unsafe rollercoasters and waterslides.Sandbox Mode- With unlimited money, you can make the park as cheap as you want at no cost. Also you can build whatever you want provided you have the space to do so.- However, it should be noted that if you overload your park with too much stuff such as long complex rollercoasters it is possible that your game will crash upon loading that specific parkCampaign Mode- This is basically a challenge mode- It can be fun a rewarding to see your park go from making basically no money at all to earning thousands in a day!

												Hands down, a childhood memory and great game! When I was a little gamer, I would play this game all the time. Building theme parks my way and style. This game is STILL such a masterpiece with old graphics that work fine for the gameplay. You can freely make your own park on Sandbox mode or start from old ones in campaign mode. If you like theme parks and creating games, this is a must. Furthermore, you can design your own rollercoasters and place down food and drink buildings for the visitors to eat and...drink. Pretty much everying you can do in a theme park slammed on this game! You can make pools, including wave pools aswell. Hire entertainers, janitors, engineers, and sercurity guards to make guests including yourself feel right at home. When I found out this was on steam I instantly bought it. I want you to do the same thing. BUY IT NOW.PROS:+ My childhood game.+ Good graphics to this date.+ Unlimited Possibilites+ Make your own everything.+ Campaign and Sandbox mode.CONS: - Creating hills is nearly impossible and ruins your park if you don't know what your doing.-  Animal's are hard to do in this game aswell as creating a GOOD waterpark. Rating: 10/10  '' Oooh memories of my childhood.''			"

RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 – Platinum! is a theme park sim-tycoon game. You are put in charge of a your own theme parks which you must expand to bring more customers and money to them.Pros: You have a large variety of rollercoasters, rides, kiosks and themed decorations to lay, often more than you'll be able to cram in a single map. You manage the finance by determining costs for rides, food and souvenirs, balancing against running costs, staff wages and other expenses including research which allow you to access even more rides and objects for your park. You start your career with a short selection of maps and a few pre-made rollercoaster designs, and unlock more as you achieve goals in each locations. And with the Soaked! and Wild! expansions that add even more attractions such as aquatic rides and zoological exhibits, you can play the same map over and over yet build different parks every time! Many rides allow themed-customization as well, from color scheme to cart-style or train-length. Micromanagement can also be as deep as you want it: you can go as far as choosing how much pickles a specific burger stand puts in its 1/4-pounder, or don't bother with it, it's up to you.Cons: The graphics are bad when zoomed in, from character designs to fixed-shadows under moving objects, graphical glitches including bad character animations or placement on rides. You can barely hear the music from your rides unless you're zoomed in almost all the way. Building rides has flaws, too: buying a pre-made rollercoaster design never explains why a location wouldn't work or what can be done to the landscape to make it fit, while other times the entire ride will get elevated multiple stories due to a single tile that's 1 pixel higher than the others. As the first game of the series to drop the genre's usual fix-isometric view for a 3D-engine, the camera controls can be extremely clunky, while the vertical angle resets every time you're trying to change it.Verdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!If you like tycoon games, you're likely to enjoy this one. I could write a review 10 times as long and still have more to say about this game, so in a nutshell: perfect example of a tycoon game done right, with huge variety, good flexibility and excellent replayabiliy. I look forward to seeing the next entry in the franchise, RollerCoaster Tycoon World, be ready to come out of Early Access!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

Once you've got your head around the 3D graphic style, it's a very fun gameBreakdown:Graphics - 7/10 - Not what you may be used to, and quite daunting at first. However once you get the hang if it things can look very impressive. However there may be alot of clipping issues if you modify terrain.Gameplay - 8/10 - Excellent additions are the Water Park and Firework displays. The game may have lost some charm but it makes up for that with bundle of new creations to use.Customisation - 9/10 - Build your own theme park...

												I started off slowly, knowing how much fun these kinds of games can be. Built a roller coaster. Built a pool. However when it was time to build a water slide I somehow found my sanity slowly slipping away.The slide was much longer than the pool, causing my guests to be sent like missles through the grass on their backsides. Cheers and happiness turnes into screams of pain and fear.I couldn't stop then though. I had seen too much. Suddenly my roller coasters would send the lowly peeps into the sky, only to fall into a fiery death. Zoo animals ended up uncaged, running amock in my park. The peeps looked to me for mercy but saw nothing but insanity.10/10 would destroy again.			"

												The glory that is RCT3... loved this game since I was a kid. It has something for all gamers, whether you want to be upstuck and businesslike making the pinnicale of rollercoaster cash cows, or mess around and torture the peeps by trapping them all in your park without food, drink, washrooms, or evilest of all.... no sun cream. There's also the inbetween of making some kicking coasters and what not. Now the game is damn old by now, but still shows the care and precision put into the game. but who cares about graphics... *One overlooked feature is the simplicity of  the savefiles on the computer, so shareing saved coasters and parks is wicked easy, just a matter of dropping the file into the right folder.over all, buy it, you probably will not regret it. It was worth $20 when released, and in all honesty, hasnt depreciated much. The fact that it is available on steam allows for it to be even easier to play and use, with no need to use the disc, although I have noticed that the load times are somewhat longer without the disc.PS. MAKE A PROPER FOURTH ONE ATARI!!!! and it is nice to see frontier still kickin it.*UPDATE* *@%#^%$%^%$&%#$%$#$% friggen hell atari, what have you done to this series with RCT world!?

												RollerCoaster Tycoon and I go way back. My middle school years were pretty much defined by the original RCT and its expansion packs, which I spent hours on end playing and enjoying. When I first heard of RCT3, I had heard it was cack. Horrible bugs, horrible problems, not fun at all. They fixed some problems with it but it was still not highly regarded.Now that I have it and have played it, I can say without a doubt that it's relatively fun. It does some very cool new things but also takes away a few things that made the originals fun. Path making is a tiny bit irritating especially trying to make slopes at first, but you get used to it. There are a multitude of new coaster designs and the building tools for those are roughly the same with a new ""autocomplete"" button that really isn't worth using. Scenarios appear to be absurd and not as interesting as the old RCT scenarios. The sandbox mode is a neat addition (we had to use trainers back in the day to play around with unlimited money!), and there is LOADS of customization that can be done. The fireworks shows are neat and the additional water/safari themes are nice too. CoasterCam is an addition everyone had wanted for the series (although NoLimits lets you import tracks from RCT1/2) and it works well. Ultimately, this game has some minor flaws, but the level of customization and the new features more than make up for it and make it a worthwhile purchase even for long time RCT fans.			"

												With the complete failure that is RollerCoaster Tycoon World, this remains as one of the top two entries in the RollerCoaster Tycoon series (the other contender being RollerCoaster Tycoon 2, also available on steam). This Platinum Edition includes both the Soaked! Expansion (which allows for waterparks) and the Wild! Expansion (which allows for animal exhibits, ala Busch Gardens). The only issues are poor performance in high-population parks (a problem that rears itself in sandbox parks more than anything), occaisional issues with certain roller coaster types having inexplicable crashes (most notably the tilt coaster and its thrill lift), and the assumption of where your pictures are stored leading to many questions on how to get custom image billboards working (it's not hard, but you have to add a specific folder inside the folder that is being used as your Documents library)It would be a disservice, though, to not mention the two new theme park games that have come out since this game's release, especially since both are on Steam. First, currently still in Early Access, is Parkitect, has a similar look-and-feel to this game but has more depth and, important for some people, actual modding support for custom rides. Second, recently released, is Planet Coaster, generally accepted as the true sequel from Frontier, the dev team behind this game. If you like this kind of game, do check those out as well.			"

												A near-perfect game, I'll say.The addictive nature and abundance of content on offer just makes this a stellar Rollercoaster tycoon, management, sim., action, RPG...whatever. Heck, even if you get tired after career mode, the godly sandbox - and other build options too - will keep you playing like as if it's you trying to perfect your own model railway; except for the fact that there will be a phallic-shaped pool.Yet, above all, the game engine is old. I mean it - Nerd³ (a YouTuber I adore) had to stop building his park due to the game just being unstable and slow; even his rig blew the specs for this game out of the water! But then his park was full of crap here and there. It just makes me hope that RCT4 exploits modern hardware for full potential...if Atari even TRIES to make the game good. Okay, quasi-tangent over.All in all, RCT3: Platinum's seemingly never-ending torrent of content has kept me going for some time (nearly 60 hours, to be exact), despite showing it's age. And if Atari does make us glare daggers when it comes to the questionable sequel - PC, NOT MOBILE - we'll still have this.			"

												This has been my favourite game of all time ever since I was a kid. I grew up playing this at my cousin's house back when it first came out. It was so cool, the visuals were way ahead of its time, the tile based building made everything easy to make, and there was a seemingly endless supply of neat features and things to create. You could also ride the rides in first person view which was pretty awesome and made building coasters much more satisfying.Ten years later and this game is still a great time. The graphis still astound me and now I'm smart enough to take advantage mods and advanced features that I couldn't use when I was little. The tile system didn't really age well however and building advanced and organised things can be a pain. The game can also be tricky for new players(I didn't need to worry because my cousins taught me) but there are tutorials that you can use. Overall this game was a spendid technical achievement for it's time and it holds up well today. I still find it to be a fitting title for my all time favourite game. Heres to hoping that Planet Coaster takes everything that made this game great and raises it to a whole new level.			"

												Chris Sawyer, maker of 90s clasic Transport Tycoon 2 Deluxe, was part of this revamp of RCT2 that does not add much in terms of graphics. This third installment of the game was made by Atari with the intention to attract all ages and genders, so the game looks slightly childish in my opinion. But make no mistake - this simulation is so rich it would make your head explode.The game features an incredible level of depth to the simulation, almost unparallaled. It allows you to control if/how much toppings you put in each beverage sold in one of the dozens of stalls. It includes cheap terrain modification (and spray paint) and many differently themed decorations and buildings. It has a scheduled fireworks simulator with a built in looper (and the cost is per single firework). Each sim in the park has a wallet, a set of hands to hold on to stuff, a set of bars for hunger/thirst/nausea and ride preferences. You will, at some point, be required to address the career ambitions of Animal Keeper 17.And there's the rollercoaster simulator. Many dozens of real rollercoasters where the ride excitement is a factor of the speed, drops, g forces and more. A beatutifully complex and simple interface. I grew up playing the prequels and I was surprised every ride and rollercoaster I knew from the game was a real thing somewhere. RCT2 had missions in Six Flags parks and other famous parks around the world. This one instead has many creative scenarios where you start with a crazy looking old town or a huge garden that show you what this game has to offer if you decide to go sandbox.Which is probably the point of this game - it's like building models more than anything.Downsides are the low difficulty in this installment. If you are completing the missions you don't really need to use the many features of this game. I would give my Peeps a food stall only after three or four months. There's no benefit to tampering with the food and items you sell (the ride control boxes are awesome to tinker with).Buy it on sale for sure.			"

												Bought this game for the memories I have of it. It's highly recomended for the park creations. You can and will do a lot of (im)possible structures but it's a bit up to the player to check for the realism. There's nothing like the charm of being able to send a rollercoaster from 0 to 200mph in few seconds! :DIt's really an awesome game with a quite high learn time. It takes plenty of time to learn how to do and how to manage everything.This steam version has the 2 addons of the game (Wild and Soaked) which adds quite a lot of new atractions. Worths it's price on Steam big sales (up to 75% discount) for new players or for the memories it brings.9/10 Overall			"

												First of all, bear in mind that my low steam playtime is just that. I used to beat the crap out of the game disc on my first laptop, so you can easily add 80 hours to the playtime.Well, RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 is now an aging beast. The game originally released in 2004, and that unfortunally shows. While graphics isn't the main or even secondary reason you would like to play this game, there are some now hard to forgive kinks in that department like the lack of native 1080p support. There are of course workarounds to this, but then again, it's hard to blame a game from before widescreens became common to have widescreen support. So, what about the game itself? Well, it's really as solid as you would expect the sequel to RCT2 would be.  While the iconic, isometric pixel art of the first two games have been replaced with 3D, it really looks good for its age. There is content enough in the game to keep you sucked in for a long, long time, plenty of RollerCoaster types and designs to keep you interested and best of all, the people in the park aren't as timid as they were in the first two games, allowing you to build more extreme rides without it having a negative impact on your play.So, why would you buy this? Honestly, Nostalgia is the main reason. But it does this very, very well and I still return to it ten years later.			"

												It's not uncommon for people to claim every now and then that the first game of any particular series is better than the latter ones. Either way, that concept won't apply in this case, as the third title of the Rollercoaster Tycoon series has gotten incredibly better, not only by better graphics, music, gameplay, expansion packs (aka DLCs nowadays), 3D engine etc. Well, I'm not saying that the previous ones weren't really good, it's just that there were some interesting improvements that were presented on this version, especially the tool to fast forward the time, which is insanely helpful. Another thing that is worth to be mentioned is fact that you can actually ride your custom-built rollercoasters, which nowadays it'd be awesome combined with VR technology (although the graphics could use some extra polishing). Besides the ""campaign mode"", there's also the sandbox option, where you can get to put your creativity / insanity into good use (if you wanna know what I'm talking about, look for the ""Death Cab Roller Coaster Tycoon 3"" on the web). Overall, although there're no Steam achievements or trading cards to get, this game is extremely fun and I definitely enjoyed to beat every single scenario available, being in my modest opinion one of the best tycoon games that were ever made.

Finally got a steam copy to replace my disc copy, so i don't have to have the disc in the drive every time i want to play. The game comes with a good amount of pre built theme parks with challenges to complete. It also offers a sandbox mode. You can also create groups of guests for your park. You can customize what type of rides they enjoy. You can also micro manage a lot of things in the game, from how much cheese your burgers have, to the color of the balloons you sell.Even though it is an older game, it doesn't feel that dated. Would still love to see a Rollercoaster Tycoon 4.			"

												Long time coming for this review.Planet Coaster just came out and I beat it completely, in under 50 hours.Come back to RCT3, and before I know it, I'm nearly 100 hours in.Planet Coaster may be pretty looking, but this game is still the KING of Rollercoaster games.So much content, it is almost too much. So many ride types and customizations that I can't think of a park that had any empty space or lack of rides after I was done with it.If you are looking for eye bleeding graphics above gameplay, then go elsewhere. It still looks good for a game made back in 2004-2005. I personally have no problem with the graphics in this game because the actual gameplay is what makes it so worth while. And it runs fine in 1920x1080 with a simple txt file edit.Until there is another RollerCoaster game with MORE CONTENT than RCT3 has, RCT3 will remain on the top of the list that all others aspire to.

												RollerCoaster Tycoon 3... what is there to say? It's the RCT you know and love only in 3D with rideable rides, loads of new coasters and buildings and in this version the ability to make water parks and zoo's in your park. But is it worth the price of admission?TL;DR This game has more than enough content to make it worth 20$ with zoo's, water parks, new rides, buildings and 39 scenario's each with 3 levels of challenge and goals. Ride your own rides, build your own peeps, heck there's even mod's for this game. If your thinking about getting this game, BUT IT! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!A lot of people will look at this game and it's age... yes it was released in 2006 and is 8 years old, than they look at the price which is a steep 20$ and freak out saying not worth it and to expensive. However those people are wrong and here's why.You are paying 20$ for RCT 3 base game which is loaded with features like sandbox mode, coaster, building, and peep designer as well as a massive campaign with 18 scenario's each with a different theme and 3 levels of challenege from beginer all the way to tycoon. Than the Soaked! pack comes with 9 scenario's with the same 3 level challenge teir and the Wild! back has 12 Scenario's... again with the challeneges. Soaked and Wild also come with new rides, buildings and attractions like, well a water slides, pools and zoo's but also rides that arn't necessarily linked to a zoo theme. You can also use all that comes with the packs in any mode, so if your playing the base campain you can put in a zoo and pool.don't like campaigns? Build the park of your dreams in the Sandbox mode with everything unlocked, a massive flat space for you to let your dreams go... wild. Did I mention that you can make firework shows? Yeah you can do that. This game is not worth 20$... it's worth 30$, 10 for each pack but you can get it for 20 and it's so worth it. Steam says I've only played 14 hours (or something like that) but it's forgetting the hundreds of hours that I played when I only had it on Disk...			"

												After a seven year break, I recently rediscovered RCT3 thanks to Steam - I used to have the whole collection on disc.As this was the first game in the series to jump to real time 3D graphics, it somewhat polarised people during it's initial release - long term fans of the series were excited and intrepid in equal measure. Even today, the game isn't as highly regarded as it's two prequels; a view point I absolutely disagree with.Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 is the pinnacle of the series, especially here in it's 'Platinum' form. The complexity of earlier games is still there, although managing the paths your peeps take and where they spend their money is somewhat easier and more intuitive. The 3D graphics allow you to explore the park as if you were a guest, and you can ride every creation in first person, whether the gentle spin of the teacups or the stomach churning corkscrews of your own personal magnum opus. The game has extensive tutorials which cover everything the game has to offer, and the same level of in depth tutition is available for both of the included expansion packs.Creating coasters can still be done on the fly while you're in the middle of the games campaign mode, or it can be accomplished in a dedicated in-game tool, allowing you to build and test the coaster of your dreams without limitations. You can then save these designs to your very own catalogue, where they will be given a cash value based on the number and type of parts used. If you then wish to use this design during your main game, in any mode, you purchase it from the catalogue just as you would with other built-in designs. Adding to the depth of creativity is the building designer. Now this is seriously impressive: You use geometric shapes and parts to literally create buildings from the ground up. It's like having a 3D jigsaw but with a limitless number of pieces, allowing you to create any shape you like, and then apply any texture you like to them. Again, this tool is available in-game straight from the main menu, and whether you use it to recreate the Tower of London or your favourite sweet shop from Blackpool Pleasure Beach, it's powerful stuff. Of course, dozens of building designs are included in game, and just like the coaster tools, you're not forced to create them from scratch if you don't want to.The final tool to complete this insanely customisable trilogy of creation is the Peep Designer! That's right, you can create your own individuals - families, even - and customise them with your own names and such. Graphically you don't get much for the peeps, unlike the rest of the game which looks fantastic, because they're low poly models as you will have literally hundreds of them exploring your theme park at once. But it's still cool to be able to put your family in the game, and track them throughout sandboxes and scenarios.As well as all of the above, you have the game itself. Anyone who claims that the complexity and intricacy of the earlier games has been lost, well you're playing a different game to me! Shops, finances, entrance fees, peep personalities, disasters, employees and all the minutae they involve have to be managed by you, and it's as engrossing as ever.When you add in the superb expansions, allowing you to build swimming pools of any shape you desire, and water flumes with the same levels of complexity as the coasters, it becomes a no-brainer for fans of strategy games and Theme Park. With the addition of the included Wild expansion, you can even set up zoos and safaris, either independently or as part of your main park. Pens, viewing platforms, making sure people don't get mauled by a tiger that's chewed through a cheap fence you traded off to built a better log flume... It's all there.The game runs really nice and smoothly and still looks great, right down to the little details like peeps throwing their arms in the air when the reach the peak of a coaster before a big drop... It is, without a doubt, the best theme park management game ever made, and an easy recommendation.*Edited for typos*			"

												One of the best video games ever coded, designed and thought of. And the sweet smell of good'old memories -numerous hours I have spent on trying to plot out the best design for a Theme Park, including the hamburger and Turkish delight stalls, custom-shaped rollercoasters and those pathways going across the small islands I have located in the middle of a river. This game is a never-gonna-be-old legend, and the atmosphere when it's just about the sunset: simply priceless.			"

I also like that there is an ACTUAL sandbox mode.Also, people will actually ride my rides!The game has only crashed for me twice, because I did the dreaded click while loading.The other games on windows 10 crashed. A lot.Otherwise, I love this game! I really recommend it!			"

												My steam hours betray my actual hours; I have well over 5,000 hours total with this game alone, and am still entertained by it.This game was made 12 years ago. It still works, and is still alive with new fan-made content. The base game is fun, but figure out how to get custom content and mods working, and you will have so much fun just making buildings, let alone an entire park. With the genre being revived in games like Planet Coaster and Parkitect (Let's face it, RCT World is dead to us all) this is an excellent choice to tide you over until Planet Coaster releases, or if it is on sale (Or hell, even if it isn't.)

												One of the first games I bought on my own and wasn't borrowed or ""borrowed"" Amazingly addictive, and fun to both create and manage a park, or go crazy and design a single ride or scenery to match. The expansion packs actually add to the game and hearken back to an age before DLC and expansions would go down the tube.My only complaint is the lack of murder park simulator elements. The rides explode and can fail, but you never really kill anyone. DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT endorse or condone violence outside video games. But something about people just getting up and dusting themselves off after their rollercoaster ramps off the track segment and flies at almost 0.5 mach into a cliff face isn't quite the same			"

I bought it on the cheap thinking I'd sink 20 minutes in it for the nostalgia, but it's still a great game. Difficulty can be adjusted for an actual challenge or sandbox mode is always a blast. If you'd played this at a younger age - go for it. If your into Sim games at all - go for it. Value is probably closer to $10.00 - $15.00 versus the $20.00 it is not on sale, so wait for a sale.

												Yah, yah, say what you will about the 2nd one being better because of the 'classic 2002 charm', but the third version is definitely the most ambitious and expansive of the entire series. Especially in Platinum form.Don't let the title fool you - Roller Coasters are merely the tiniest fraction of things you get to build and manage in this game.Want to recreate Busch Gardens, Mt. Olympus, or even the San Diego Zoo? Well, you can do that in this game.Want to make a monster light/firework show that lasts however long you want it to and looks exactly how you want it? You can do that in this game.Want to have a park with a wave of breakdancing entertainers creating crowd blockages on every footpath? You can do that in this game.Want to send a group of oblivious guests on an incomplete coaster to their doom? You can make a park based on just that concept in this game.Hey - you can even create the guests in this game.If you want to make the entertainment park of your dreams, regardless of what it is - this game is for you, and even your wildest ideas can likely become a reality here. Make a wild safari tour, with a tour vehicle running through all of the exhibits. Make your dream water park with a waterslide modeled after your favorite bendy straw. Make a firework show that goes along to the song ""Don't Stop Me Now"" by Queen. Make an army of identical hyper-active ritalin children with a thirst for excitement and nothing else.This game is old but by no means outdated. I'm finding it hard to think of a modern equivalent to this game.Why are you still reading this?Buy it! Now!			"

												A game I have played for at least years as a child, I was the kid who would bring a pentium 4 laptop that always needed a charger just cause I broke the battery and bring it everywhere and the only game I ever bought was from a book fair in my school hidden gem hidden in the 10 dollar section was a physical copy of RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Platinum. Even if I couldn't bring the laptop, I always bring my copy. Box and disc with the installation Manuel to play the game. Playing it and installing it in my friends, friends parents computer, my cousins, my grandmas computer and even an office computer back where my father used to work. This game is the essence of what I wanted as a dream job. I loved it to bits, however it seemed to have aged. However not as much to actually enjoy the game. You play as a amusement park manager making rides, attractions, stalls and roller coasters around the park where ever you like. A sandbox mode where there's endless possibilities because of the unlimited money and no matter how bad you manage the park, it'll still generate population to make the park alive as you stack the place with crazy rides. As well as a campaign mode and scenario system to play the tycoon part of the game. Challenging and those take time to actually learn the fundamentals of managing a park. Trying to reach a certain amount of people that are in your park, the rides and the attractions you put into it so you can generate wealth (as well as other things) and actually creativity to rollercoaster building and actually park customizing as well. It's truly a park tycoon that you can bury yourself for hours and before you know it, your one of the best park managers out there with successful parks and outstanding profitable income with all the challenges at the highest rank. You can put in your own songs and pictures (windows vista and below, still trying to figure out how to do it in windows 10) add in custom rides and scenarios and even put coasters saved from the pervious rollercoaster tycoons into the fully 3D environment made by frontier. As well as the expansions of wild life and water rides? You can't get anything better (besides Planet Coaster) for such a cheap bargain price. The only Rollercoaster tycoon I've sunked my childhood into. Hell I just bought the game and already I'm obsessed again.			"

												Dont mind my play time on Steam, i played a lot of Roller Coaster 3 on retail disc. The Roller Coaster games are rather unique. You wont find any park management simulators good and user-friendly like this game series. And RC 3 is no exception. RC 1 was a true classic, a lot of people played that game and praised it as one of the best strategy games of all time. And RC3 brings the classic to a new level, introducing better graphics, improved mechanics and awesome new features. The expansion packs, included on the Platinum version, are absolutely good. They add a lot of stuff to the whole experience. Creating pools and zoos are so fun lol Many different modes, including the sandbox mode where everything is free and you can LIVE YOUR DREAM OF BUILDING YOUR DREAM THEME PARK AKA MY OWN DISNEYLAND!!!!

												Now, I've played this game for a good number of years both properly and stupidly. The managing parts are easy when you know the cheats, but aren't when you're a newcomer. In my own way, I would suggest using the Sandbox feature to design rollercoasters with buildings on them, and with anything else around the tracks. That way, you can save them without having to add the extra scenery around all over again.Also, if you're more evil than Donald Trump eating a dead baby, you go for the psycho option and input ""James Hunt"" into one of your park guests, and you'll unlock the dune buggy to run over everybody! And another option to go full on evil is to unleash tigers, elephants and zebras on your guests, and watch as they run for the hills!Back to normality. If you want to create a 999mph death coaster, put in the cheat ""David Braben"" and you're ready to rocket off to mars and back, albeit with red blood particles which used to be people. All in all, I recommend this game. Hours of replay ability, more simple than Planet Coaster, and roller coasters your deepest brain cell can conjure!Addenda: This game is only 32 bit, and it can crash easily (or as I say, the game ""♥♥♥♥♥ itself"") when you want make the land for your park over a 150 x 150 grid. Don't worry, I still recommend this game to anybody wanting to build their fanatasy park on Horror, Space, Western and Cowboys and Pirates. Go for it, I say!			"

The maps you can play on in career mode are fun and have diffrent objectives each. There's also a sandbox mode in which you have infinte money to build your park. On,a final note you should have patiance when building rollercoasters ( since physics exist ).The only complaint I have is that building a park can feel repititive at times but thats the only complaint I have. So, overall I woud give RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 a 85 out of  100.			"

												8.5/10 - RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Platinum is a soiid collection and the definitve package for the RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 series, as it features the base game, plus both expansions. The expansion which add a tremendous amount of content to the game. RCT3 is at its core, a management game. You build and run a theme park the way you see fit, byt placing rides, attractions, booths, and more, to attract customers, and at the end, collecting their hard earned money to keep the park going, and to pay your employees their hard earned money. Obstacles will come in the form of rides breaking down, unhappy patrons or employees, and more problems to solve. And there are 2 ways to play this game: Full on simulation mode, where money matters, or a full on sandbox mode, where you can pretty much spend as much as you want, and get away with anything. There are as well, fun little scenarios to play to get you used to the games mechanics, which start off as tutorials, and end up being challenges to help you unlock stuff. For anyone who has played RCT1 and 2, this game strays from the earlier isometric visuals of the first 2, and comes back with full 3D visuals, which this time around actually let you ride the park rides in 1st person. Everything looks pretty damn gorgeous, except for a few visual hiccups, like when messing with terrain, or the extremely aged and ugly looking patrons. Everything else looks damn fine though for a game this old. The expansions will take your vanilla park, and add a water park features, as well as a wildlife park, complete with various animals to use as attractions for the patrons.This title is pretty easy to get into, even for people new to management games. Also a blast to play for veterans.			"

												I got RCT3 for Christmas back in 2004. I hated it. This is after hundreds (thousands?) of hours combined in RCT1 and 2.11 years later I decided to give it another try and picked it up on Steam and gave it a fair shot. I can honestly say that it is a very good game and it does live up to being a RCT. There is so much variety in this game. You can customize each shop to sell what you want. You can build dozens of different thrill rides, roller coasters, gentle rides, etc. The graphics are ageless and will look good no matter what year you play in.However, there are 2 rather large issues that I have a hard time getting over. Hotkeys and the UI. These two areas were perfect in 1 and 2. For whatever reason, RCT3 does not have adequate hotkeys. For example, you can't press a key and open up Finances, rides, guests, staff, etc, like you could in 1+2. You have to move the mouse over to a very small circluar button and click it. To leave that menu, you have to click an (X) button on the menu that is literally only a few pixels wide. In the previous games, you could press Backspace to get out of the menu. Prepare for some precision clicking in this game. If the developers just leaved those two things exactly how they were from before, this game would be very close to being perfect. It's so tedious having to click tiny buttons. Here's hoping that RCT:World will be a great game.			"

												Personally, I REALLY ENJOY THIS GAME! It's super fun and I can't stop! There's only a few cons. For Example, one of my lines ALWAYS gets stuck.But, the amount of pros definetely make up for the cons.Building a roller coaster can be a bit troubling at times but it's fun. Adding in rides is awesome and building structures isn't too dificult but I'm not good at it.Probably a solid 9.2 or 9.3 out of 10.			"

												Excellent sim theme park game.  This is the best rollercoaster construction and theme park management game I have seen.  Hours of fun for those who like sim games.  There is a great amount of detail to the game and many many rides and design features for your park.  This game can keep your interest for a long time with the many creative possibilities.  In addition you can make your own custom people and families to visit your park, and you can assume a rider perspective to experience what your park is like first hand.			"

10/10  This game is an amazing roller coaster builder, and the amount of fun you can get from building and riding roller coasters is amazing! I really enjoy building and riding the roller coasters the most, but if you arent one for building, you can manage and run your very own amusement park:-) The possibilites are endless and when you buy the game, it automatically comes with all of the dlcs!Pros - Game modes are fun and challenging        - You can build a bunch of differnt roller coasters with different themes        - After you place, or build a coaster you can ride them!        - With the wild dlc you can build a massive zoo, and the soaked dlc, you can build a resort like park        - The peeps faces are funny and even as old as this game is, it has great game playCons - If you dont care to build roller coasters and enjoy riding rides, this game is not for you         - The graphics are a little bit dated I want rctw now lol			"

												This game is generally amazing. I would give this game a 4.5/5 for some reasons. The main reason is all of the confusing things... When you build rides, you must check the excitement rating, etc. But the most confusing and annoying thing in this game is the Rct3: Wild! DLC pack. Unless you are really good at Strategey Games, The Wild! pack is definantly something to get used too.			"

												This game is an amazing theme park/buissines simulator. It's a manegment game where you build theme parks, roller coasters ,and rides. The manegment part of the game comes in when you start career mode. You have to manage your park and your money so you can keep growing. You can build food stands and theme your rides and everything is completely customizable from the name of your park, to how much the entery fee is, to if people get to choose how many pickles they get on their burgers at the burger shop you build. I love this game and it is one of the best management games I have ever played. I give this game an 9/10. (The Platinum adittion comes with 2 expantion packs, 1 to build pool complexs, and 1 to build animal parks which is good fun too!)			"

												Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 gives you quite a bit of freedom to create your own amusement park.  This edition comes with both expansions so you can add a zoo and water park to the creating process.Dozens of carnival rides, dozens of coaster types, and different shop types for your customers to spend their money on.  This game also gives you the option to theme sections of your park, or the whole thing if you so choose to.  There is a lengthy campaign mode for you to go through.  From improving parks to building a ride that will make a VIP guest happy to making X amount of money.  And if you would rather build your own park, then there is a sandbox mode to do so.  Build to your hearts content in this mode with an unlimited amount of money to build coasters that will drive guests wild.To date, this is the best amusement park simulation/strategy game in my opinion.  All it is missing is carnival games for the guests to throw money away on.			"

												Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 is one of my all time favourite games. I can quite literally just use the Rollercoaster Designer all day and not get bored. It's a really good game if you're into management simulators, are attracted to theme parks and don't mind that the graphics and gameplay systems are now a little bit dated. Would definitely be worth picking up if it's in the sale, or if you're just looking for a fun, laid-back game to kill a few hours here and there.			"

I created atleast one awesome and creative theme park every single day. The possibilities in this game are endless, and when you have finally played the game enough that you've built & tried everything in the game, you can dowload a lot of custom scenery and rides!

												This game is plain awesomeness. It's on of these games I've played when I was younger and never forgot.And it's still reall fun. Despite this game being old, it's still great!  Even the graphics aren't bad.Being a fan of rollercoasters and parks, it sure is a game for me.The scenarios are great, but let's be honest, we all play that kind of game for the sandbox. Being able to create your own thing as you wish, without having to care about managing anything.And in this game, there are really a lot of options. You can create so many things. Especially with both expansion packs included. You can create your park, put whatever you want in it, the rides you wish, make your own rollercoasters, make pools with slides, create buildings, make fireworks shows or even lasers shows, shape landscape, put waterfalls, billboards with personalized images, make a mini-zoo.... So many things. And not only can you create all that stuff, see people in the park enjoying it, get info about it (like speed of rides, g-force, etc), but you can even ride everything (slides, rollercoasters, rides)...You can create your own park the way you wish, and then you can even experience it.And if you forget about the sandbox mode a bit, there's still plenty of time to spend on the scenarios, the rollercoaster builder if you wish to only create a rollercoaster... And also something pretty neat about the game, you can put your own music in the game.Also, there are quite a few mods that you can find and which are pretty great, even though there is no centralized place for that.Unless you don't like theme parks or rollercoasters or creating stuff, there is no reason not to like this game.All I could see missing to it is better textures and easier modding so we could get a lot of awesome community-created content.

												This game is one of the most beautiful games ever. Its main storyline is so touching. Every character not only affects your game but your life. One moment I always remember is when my first V.I.P came and swam in my pool. And five seconds later instinct told me to delete the entrance so he would drown. Of course he became very angry and after around two hours I decided to rebuild the entrance to the pool allowing him to leave. And so he did and when he left throught the main entrance  he rated my rollercoaster park 5/5 That is when I realized this game had touched my heart in a way no other game ever has. In summary this game is th pinnacle of all  games no more boring GTA or COD everyone should buy this game and realize its beauty and touching storyline.			"

												If you're a fan of theme park management, who also loves working in a 3D space, then this game is the perfect choice. Others say this is the best of the RCT series, well the best 3D RCT I'd say. (RCT 4 and World can go six feet under.) As someone who's played this since 2005-6, the time I bought the game physically, I've spent hours creating the perfect theme parks and outlandish rollercoasters that needed 4-5 first aid stalls to cope with trainload after trainload of sick riders.Do I love this game? Oh yes. Buy it full price or wait for a sale that's up to you but either way, you'll be buying a ticket to one of the greatest theme park management games there is. If you're more of a classic, isometric fan. Then I also recommend RCT 1 and 2.If you're holding off Planet Coaster for now, made by the same people by the way, waiting for a price drop or just unsure. This game will also perfectly stand in as a taste of Planet Coaster's glory. "

												Started playing it again recently, and first words that I think of is:Swimming pools. My goodness you can do SOOO much with the swimming pools. Second word I can think of is: thrill and gentle rides. SOO many of them.Third thing is: Roller coasters! As compared to the original game, it's way easier to make a successful one on 3 that doesn't make people sick or have them say ""that's too intense for me"" which happens sooo much on the first one. Many more options too!forth thing:landscaping. WAYY more advanced than the first game. There is no limit to how high or low land can go and can do so much more with it.last but not least:riding the rides! If you make a good coaster it's fun just to sit and watch yourself riding it!Then of course the graphics, although around playstation 2 level, are much better than the first two games. If you like age of empires but don't want to get attacked all the time, or if you like any games like that, you should get this one. **little warning*** this game has quite a steep learning curve, but it's totally worth learning and it actually adds to the fun when you figure something out.

												Ah, OK, maybe I am strange, but I really like this game. It's not at all difficult and just relaxing fun to play. It's surprisingly comprehensive, with lots of different themes and options to keep you busy, no matter how you want to play - whether you want to try to make a business, or just design rides and see what they are like. Taking a ride on your own rollercoaster is surprisingly fun.Controls are a little illogical, but easy enough to pick up. After one tutorial you can pretty much work it all out for yourself. I wouldn't pay a great deal of money for the game but it's a highly recommended if you find it lurking in a sale.			"

												I would reccomend this game for people who are big fans of coasters or has some spare money and wants to play a game they do not already have.This game is fun to play for the level of creativity you put into the roller coasters and of course your parks. You will find yourself puting multiple hours trying to build a bigger and better park for your peeps.However the amount of scenery in this game is small and you would have to go to websites like RCTGo to get coaters like the B&M coaster because they are not in the game.But if you put in the time and comitment you will see that this game is worth playing over and over again.8/10			"

												Amazing.  It's a must play for any Roller Coaster junkie or Sim like fan out there.Plently of different styles of roller coasters to choose from.  If it's exist, then you can mostly likely build it in this game.Sculpt your own terrians, build your own coaster stations, enterances, secenery etcs.. The ideas are endlesss and are only left up to the player to decide. If you still haven't played it, don't let the release date fooled you.  This isn't anything quite like RCT:3.  Untill a fourth is released =)			"

												I have put a serious amount of time in this RCT series, but in this review I'm just comparing RCT2 with 3 and I can firmly say that all the games are tremendously fun and addicting, but I think they could have taken 3 even further. RC3 has updated graphics, but it would have been amazing to see a more ""serious"" and ""realistic"" look rather than the ""cartoonish"" environment. I do thoroughly enjoy the ""on ride"" first person camera view, it makes you able to experience your park first hand. The rides overall are pretty cool but again I would have liked to see a more realistic detail. What RC3 did get right was the mechanics. They are terrific, taking ideas from RC2 and making them even better. Budgeting is as fun and challenging as ever, and some scenarios worth exploring. I do enjoy RC3, there is also loads of content available online including fully made parks. I do have a little more love overall for RC1, only due to the originality and extreme customization and modding. I would absolutely love to see another Rollercoaster Tycoon, they are truly fun and addicting.			"

												RCT3 Platinum includes the regular version and 2 DLC add-ons, Soaked, and Wild.This game is really fun to do as there is allot more to do in this game than RCTW, you can create more coasters and create water parks and zoos.The campaigns stories are challenging as they get harder and harder, they do however unlock new coaster designs.Add your own music to RCT3 with the custom music, and add your own custom scenary.Very good game this but I do have to give some faults too. This game is really good and was made around 2003. The peeps screams sounds fake, you can't do track angles freely like in RCTW. And you can't upload coaster designs to share.I would recommend getting RCTW...no wait.....get Planet Coaster instead. Planet Coaster is allot like RCT3 but much more realistic and is tons better than this game and RCTW. Get that instead to save yourself allot of trouble unless your CPU keeps crashing that is.RCT3 is a finished game so there won't be any more updates. RCTW and Planet Coaster are getting the updates from RCT3 but with allot more realisim.Few faults for this game so gonna give it a...8/10Game Rating: G (General)Catagory: Construction			"

												This is a spectacular and flexible game, allowing you to really create roller coaster parks according to your personal taste and your own inclinations (are you most interested in creating beautiful parks for the joy of your visitors, or do you prefer to focus on making money, do you prefer water-based attractions, or you are more inclined towards wild animals, or you only like complicated roller coasters?). You have a deep control of the details, including the colors of the shops, the prices of everything you sail, including tickets to visit your attractions, etc. Finally, a beautiful game for those who prefer to build nice things rather than shoot zombies or humans or whatever else.

												RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Platinum Let me start by saying out of all the RolerCoaster Tycoon's that I have played this one is the BEST. In the past RollerCoaster Tycoon or what I am now going to say RCT 3 for short has always made the true tycoon player love  every min of it. I grew up playing the RCT games. I was always wanting more from the game and now with RCT 3 I got it. The game is full of color and cool new rides that will make your guest happy. The more time you spend on on RCT 3 the more you get to know the control lay out. Witch is also the games down turn. Keys are hard to learn and could get somewhat hard to remember of what does what. (For a side note I have alot more time on this game in offline mode on steam then I do on online mode). You have options on how you want to play but for me I always play Sandbox mode. All around the game is fun and will take up most of your time if you are looking to play a long game. If you need ideas on how you sould build your park there are lots of videos on YouTube that will help you out.   "

												I've used this game to make many a mad science creation (including but not limited to rides based on Rebecca Black and ""What Does the Fox Say"",) so this game obviously gets my endorsement. But, while I fully recommend purchasing this game if  you're a fan of theme parks, don't go in expecting RCT 1 or 2.  This game has a completely different feel than you may remember from the first couple games. The first game had a charm that was all it's own, and with this third installment it's mostly function over form. That being said, the function is a hell of a thing. Things you can do in this game that you couldn't do in the first two:- ride your rides / explore your parks in a 3D environment- build water park / zoo type attractions (complete with their own sets of custom controls)- create themed night time shows set to your own music, using fireworks, lasers, and water cannons (i saw someone online creating scenes from Disney's World of Color ... damn.)- import custom graphics using billboards and tiles (with some tinkering, if you're using a newer OS.)And since this game has been around for a while, there's also a huge wealth of custom scenery / rides / ride vehiceles / etc. online at your disposal, to help you create literally whatever kind of ride / show / theme park you can think of.I've played other theme park sims that have come and gone since this one and while, yes, the graphics and are a little dated and, yes, you will need to spend some time grinding through all the tutorials and knocking out the scenarios before you get pro enough for sand box mode, I still maintain that this game is still THE best theme park sim out there to really let your imagination run wild.

It may be a theme park park simulator but i have made pretty much anything i want including firework shows, concerts, town and much much more. If you get it off here you get 2 expansion packs. Well worth the money. One thing i must say nerdcubed did was he looked for when this cam out and her said ""When did this come out?

												Lots of fun, good music, plenty of potential for custom rides. My favorite ride to make is a 20 car corkscrew coaster. Warning: Guests will throw their trash on the ground no matter how many ♥♥♥♥ING garbage cans you place, but you can greatly reduce the amount of trash on the ground if you place garbage cans.Some fun things to do that don't involve following the game objectives:Make an air powered coaster that utilizes super high launch speeds (involves cheats to get required speed) to propell the cars into space (involves cheats to get required height). I have done it, and it involves hella lotz of clicking to place the track, but it is so worth it when you try it out. You can actually see the planet you are departing from. Warning: If you do this, MAKE SURE NOT TO LET THE RIDE FALL OFF OF THE TRACK, YOUR GAME WILL CRASH. Make rides that plow through lines of people (they can't die)Attempt to drown the park inspector (doesn't work)Attempt to drown piece of ♥♥♥♥ guests that throw their trash on the ground RIGHT IN FRONT OF A ♥♥♥♥ING EMPTY GARBAGE CAN (also doesn't work, but its fun to punish them :D )Unleash wild animals and watch them kill other wild animals and chase guests around. (they can kill animals, but not people, they don't go after people)Launch guests into a lion show and watch them stand there foreverLaunch guests into a rotovator using dingiesLaunch guests into a very deep mountainName animals innapropriate things: Herpies (guests will say, ""I like Herpies!"" see my screenshots to see what i mean)Put a poor child in a garbage can (their face peeks out, its soo funny and cute)Cheats (change guest name to the cheat):David Braben: Allows ride speeds of about 2234 or so MPHJohn Wardley: Allows unlimited(as far as i have discovered) ride height.Make me sick: Everyone in the park pukesMouse: Everyone looks at the cursorAtomic: Never had this work, so i dont know for sure what happens.

												This series has kept me entertained since the very first. I have played the game for many hours and was a playtester for Soaked and Wild. Returning to it after years, you have to admire the advances that were made in graphics to give us this game, as well as gameplay, and then later, the opprotunity to add our own custom scenery. If you are new to Tycoon games, this series is what built that genre. And RCT3 culminates it. You can't go wrong with Rollercoaster Tycoon 3.			"

												I don't even know why, but HOLY GOD this game is fun. Basically, build an Amusement Park, make it as big as possible, maike money off that, and become popular. Repeat process until ""Tycoon"" rank, then die. IRL. Oh also, the NPCs are really derpy. And therefore they become funny.			"

												As a gamer who has spent over 1000 hours playing this game, I can say that I love this game. Though the game doesn't have the best graphics or physics, the game was made in the early 2000's, so I cut it some slack. This game is definitely worth the money, as you can mod the game to add waay more content than the stock parts.			"

												Second greatest building game ever, in regards to building anything.  The greatest in the world would be RollerCoaster Tycoon: Loopy Landscapes.  But that's not available on steam so get this one instead.  Build a theme park, hell, build a million.  The game will easily last a creative person hundreds of hours.  Well worth full retail, especially for me, as I've bought it twice!			"

You can not only include rollercoasters, but firework shows, terrarforming, zoos, FREAKIN DINOSAURS, pools, and many stuff/mods to download from online. The graphics help you to experience the parks that the previous games couldnt do. You can ride your roller coasters and almost walk around in your own park.			"

												This game is just awesome. I have over 150 something hours on this baby. My first experience with roller coaster simulation games was the game ""Thrillville: Off the Rails"" for the Wii. There was nothing to do, and there were just limits, limits, limits on that game. It's not Thrillville: It's Dullsville.         When I found out this game was on Steam I just went completely head over heels for it. I've been a fan of the RCT franchise since second grade, and I was itching to play this one. However, I was worried that maybe this game would turn out to be just like Thrillville, with just limits, limits, limits.           So I decided to go ahead and give this game a try. I bought it and played Sandbox mode for maybe 20-30 minutes until I really got into the game. I severely injured 78 peeps on a horrific inverted roller coaster, drowned the annoying park inspector 50 times, charged 100 dollars for peeps to TCOB, and let my animals run loose and terrify peeps.            What I really like about this game is that it's the Platinum version. That means it includes all three expansions, so you don't have to waste more money on downloadable expansions. I'd recommend this game to anyone who's a hardcore roller coaster fan.              I'd rate this 9/10, and the reason why it's a 9 is because it's the graphics. The rest? PURE AWESOME!			"

Save rollercoasters with the tool, make your own family of people in the game that will come into to park and go on your rides. Sandbox mode is just there to make anything you want, then there is the ""real game"" where you work your up to gain the best park.

Some of the mechanics can be frustrating at times but you'll get used to it, and the bugs are hilarious anyways. It works well on Steam. No issues running it unlike some other games of it's kind (Sim Theme Park requires a degree in Computer Science to run on Windows 8.) Some games age out of being fun, this never will. Whether you enjoy designing your own parks and rides or if you're a genocidal sociopath, this game has something for everyone.			"

												It's kind of like creative mode Minecraft crossed with Sim City.I've been playing this series for years and the graphics, while not HD maybe, are still fun and interesting. Customization is limited in some areas (booths, food, themes) but expansive in others (ride customization, cheat codes, puns). The game is fun and the challenges, while sometimes infuriating to start, are greatly satisfying to achieve.If there are glitches, I've not noticed them. The hidden bits like sharks and manta rays are great fun if you get the expansions. It's also not as easy for peeps to get lost, I've noticed, which is a big improvement because they used to get lost if you widened a path, but complain of over crowding if it was one block wide. I do miss being able to kill unruly park patrons, though. Now they just warp elsewhere. Zombie patrons?			"

												It is a fun game, but be prepared to lose a lot of hours to it.  It is similar to Sim City in the sense that you are building stuff using tile placement and budgets.  It is fully 3D, has a lot of really nice content, and has some neat features, like the ability to actually ride the rides.  The only way the game could be better in my opinion is to allow you to run around in first-person mode and play the game as an employee.  I have seen that done before, but it has never been done well.  At least this game does everything else well.There are no Steam achievements, but there are challenges within the game.  You can also customize the game greatly.  I also think the game's controls are decent and the graphics are pretty good.  The overall atmosphere feels similar to the county fair until you start building the big rides and hiring lots of employees.  Then, it feels more like an actual theme park, I guess.There are some confusing mechanics, as well.  The menus are hard to navigate, and the pool system is bizarre.  You would think that pool paths would work like regular paths, but no, they work on their own menu.  To this day, I still cannot figure out how to connect a pool to the rest of the theme park.			"

												So much, yet so little.Atari/Frontier really needed to follow up on the title, but it can still be great fun. You'll notice the thousands of things they needed to include before ending the franchise. Worth every penny in my opinion though. I'm a sucker for theme parks and roller coasters. It just gets a little tiring hearing the same sounds and running into all the things that I can't do that should exist. This on top of some stupid bugs and ugly physics can leave you questioning the purpose of some features including in the title. The primary issue with RCT3 is that it's outdated, yet still being pushed and played by the community because there hasn't been a game like it since it came out, so we're left with what we've got. If you're REALLY good at working with this title, you can modify it and submit your creations online to share and upload into the game, which is cool, but very tedious. Overall, it's really fun game to expand your creativity, but if you're looking to create Disney/Universal quality attractions, it's not happening here. Theme Parks simply weren't what they are now back in 2004. You're getting what's advertised, but just be aware that you'll find yourself wanting so much more out of something with infinite potential. I just really wish there was money in rebooting the franchise to give us a fresh addtion. A new engine with realistic sounds and lifelike visuals sounds better than food... (joking)There is a title is the works from a seperate company called Theme Park Studio, but it has yet to be released and may be a little too complex for the average consumer like myself. It has great potential and could become the closest thing we will get to another RCT. Cheers!			"

												So much, yet so little.Atari/Frontier really needed to follow up on the title, but it can still be great fun. You'll notice the thousands of things they needed to include before ending the franchise. Worth every penny in my opinion though. I'm a sucker for theme parks and roller coasters. It just gets a little tiring hearing the same sounds and running into all the things that I can't do that should exist. This on top of some stupid bugs and ugly physics can leave you questioning the purpose of some features including in the title. The primary issue with RCT3 is that it's outdated, yet still being pushed and played by the community because there hasn't been a game like it since it came out, so we're left with what we've got. If you're REALLY good at working with this title, you can modify it and submit your creations online to share and upload into the game, which is cool, but very tedious. Overall, it's really fun game to expand your creativity, but if you're looking to create Disney/Universal quality attractions, it's not happening here. Theme Parks simply weren't what they are now back in 2004. You're getting what's advertised, but just be aware that you'll find yourself wanting so much more out of something with infinite potential. I just really wish there was money in rebooting the franchise to give us a fresh addtion. A new engine with realistic sounds and lifelike visuals sounds better than food... (joking)There is a title is the works from a seperate company called Theme Park Studio, but it has yet to be released and may be a little too complex for the average consumer like myself. It has great potential and could become the closest thing we will get to another RCT. Cheers!			"

												Over the past five years, I've easily sunk more hours into this game than any other. While it's easy enough to jump into to get started, it can be very addictive and take over your life for a while with its depth and seemingly endless possibilities. I've never even messed around much with the money management or scenarios, and I'm still creeping up on 200 hours with this bad boy just on Steam, which is my second run with the game.There are a few different routes you can take with RCT3. You can try to tackle all the scenarios and successfully manage some pre-built (or partially built) parks, create your own parks in sandbox mode without monetary restrictions, or sadistically terrorize the peeps in parks of pure mayhem. Any of these is a viable route to take, and reason enough to pick this up.Of course, RCT3 isn't perfect. It's definitely showing its age at this point, the physics aren't remotely realistic, and the graphics (especially the peeps) are a bit cartoony. There are also some maddening limitations with the grid (I find your lack of diagonals disturbing), curious omissions from the pre-supplied content (no stock picnic tables?!), and many fans of the series seem to prefer the older games.Despite the shortcomings, however, there's just too much here to like. Custom content has kept this game going for a decade now and has made up for a lot of those omissions. Being able to view your parks in 3D and ""ride"" any of your rides is simply awesome the first time you experience it. And just being able to create your own amusement park -- a FULL park with flat rides, custom coasters, water attractions, and even animals -- makes this one a definite winner.RCT3 may ultimately be succeeded by Theme Park Studio in the sandbox department if the latter pans out (which I'm hoping will be the case). But in the meantime, or if you're a big fan of the money management features and scenarios of the RCT series, this is where it's at.			"

												Still a great game!  Waiting for the next one but still having fun with this game in the interim.  The fact that you get to take a break and zoom in, get on the rides can somewhat take the slowness out of sims.  Has every aspect of managing a theme park and feels satisfying when you accomplish your goals.  Only thing that I find annoying with the game is a minor issue.  Wish there was a easier way to zoom across control screens.  Having to go through multiple clicks to get the menu item I want is somewhat annoying because I always forget which page has which control item.			"

												It is a fun game, but be prepared to lose a lot of hours to it.  It is similar to Sim City in the sense that you are building stuff using tile placement and budgets.  It is fully 3D, has a lot of really nice content, and has some neat features, like the ability to actually ride the rides.  The only way the game could be better in my opinion is to allow you to run around in first-person mode and play the game as an employee.  I have seen that done before, but it has never been done well.  At least this game does everything else well.There are no Steam achievements, but there are challenges within the game.  You can also customize the game greatly.  I also think the game's controls are decent and the graphics are pretty good.  The overall atmosphere feels similar to the county fair until you start building the big rides and hiring lots of employees.  Then, it feels more like an actual theme park, I guess.There are some confusing mechanics, as well.  The menus are hard to navigate, and the pool system is bizarre.  You would think that pool paths would work like regular paths, but no, they work on their own menu.  To this day, I still cannot figure out how to connect a pool to the rest of the theme park.			"

												like many others, i played this game when i was very young. I enjoyed it a lot then and decided to try this one. This game is a great but it is a little complicated for someone who does not want to spend two hours on tutorials to learn how to do all the fancy stuff. So I just built a regular park and thats it. I have not explored much. This game is very entertaining and the 3d camera ride view is awesome. It brings back all the cool stuff of old games except that you can not drown people as far as i am aware and you can not kill people by running them of a broken roller coaster. This is unfortunate as the people just get up and walk out of the crash and get onto another ride. Making the swimming pool is awesome but it was impossible to install a deck. I think that the game as a whole is just too complicated in its intricities which is what makes it stand apart from the older versions. However, all in all it is still a great game that can provide hours of fun. However, I would not pay 20 dollars for it. At the most you will probably play this game for 20 hours. I payed 5 dollars for it because it was on sale.			"

												It's kind of like creative mode Minecraft crossed with Sim City.I've been playing this series for years and the graphics, while not HD maybe, are still fun and interesting. Customization is limited in some areas (booths, food, themes) but expansive in others (ride customization, cheat codes, puns). The game is fun and the challenges, while sometimes infuriating to start, are greatly satisfying to achieve.If there are glitches, I've not noticed them. The hidden bits like sharks and manta rays are great fun if you get the expansions. It's also not as easy for peeps to get lost, I've noticed, which is a big improvement because they used to get lost if you widened a path, but complain of over crowding if it was one block wide. I do miss being able to kill unruly park patrons, though. Now they just warp elsewhere. Zombie patrons?			"

												I totally recommend this game! If you have Windows 8 and below. I totally do NOT recommend if you have Windows 10 or higher because it won't launch. Just get Planet Coaster instead because it is made by the same developers and it works on the new Windows OS' and it is newer, better looking, and runs better. But this is a review for RCT3 so here are my thoughts.This game looks good for it's time! i mean San Andreas was released the same year!Let's pretend it's 2004.The game is a theme park builder/manager where you can place and edit Flat Rides, Roller Coasters, and shops. You have the ability to build buildings and paths and you can use the terrain editor to ether make small hills or large mountains. Decorate your park with trees and plants to make it look amazing.There are two ways you can play this game! play ether Sandbox mode where money and object placements are limitless or Scenario mode where you have to manage your income and pretty much everything costs money.Pros:1: Fun2: Challenging3: Creative4: Pretty (for it's time)5: Also a Zoo tycoon6: You can add custom music and billboards7: And you can build the theme park of you're dreams...(kinda.)Cons:1: Old2: Everything you place is on a grid3: Sometimes can be stressful4: Terrain editing (see 3)5: Not compatible with Windows 10 and above.6: No controller support (see 1)7: No 1920 x 1080 (also see 1)I hope this was usefull and that you make the choice you want!P.S Don't get Roller Coaster Tycoon World.P.P.S Just get Planet Coaster.

It is exactly what is says on the box you build and run a themepark whilst keeping your employees and the customers happy.The amount of customisation on the rollercoasters is pretty impressive and there are so many options.Sadly with the new range of themepark games out including a new one in this series, I doubt I will be adding anymore hours to this game.(7.5/10)			"

												Alright where do I begin? First off by saying buy this game! It's so addicting, fun and just adds to the RCT series in a perfect way. Having owned the Deluxe Edition on disk for a while I put off buying the Platinum Edition on steam but I'd recommend it so much! It's a game I am more than proud to have in my library and, whilst my time on steam isn't currently much, it will be soon!This game is wonderful! From the coaster creation to the park management everything is wonderful to manage! Name your park and follow the challenges or, if you're in a creative mood, bust open a sandbox park and build as you wish! Rides need to be a balance of thrills and speed without being too high in G-Force to tune down the chance of nausia and motion sickness for the 'peeps' that inhabit your wonderous land!All in all I give this game a 9.5/10, an all time favourite of mine since I got it on disk many years back! 110% recommended!

												A blast from the past! This game is definetly a classic. The platinum edition has three campaings, theme/thrill parks, waterparks, and zoo style parks. Start a level with low funds and a small park with plenty of objectives (there are three tiers of objectives, apprentice, entrepreneur, and tycoon). Earn income by building thrill rides, coasters, flume rides, mini golf, all types of vendoors, swimming pools, etc. Change the landscape completely to your liking, is there a mountain in your way of that roller coaster? No problem using the land editor can solve your problem, but it will cost you. Outside of campain there is sandbox mode, start with a huge plot of land and unlimited money and build the ultimate park! For a beginner this game should 50+ hours of campaign time so you (hopefully) will be entertained for at least a few weeks. This game does go on sale for $5 relatively often, pick it up! It's really very good!			"

RollerCoaster Tycoon 3A huge fan of this game and this franchise. RCT 3 takes a huge jump from its previous installments. RCT 1 and 2 were similar i many reguards and RCT 3 takes what was amazing from these two games and adds in some awesome new features. Pros/New features- the new riding the rides is a fun new feature. Ive actually created a sandbox part with every ride just so i can just go around and ride every single one xD.- Graphics. A huge jump from the RCT 2. A very satifying realism that doesnt completly negate the want for an ""arcade"" style game.- Pools. Another cool feature they added. - Huge variety. There are honestly soo many rides and attractions that you will be entertained for hours on end.Cons- Some might find the new graphics to be a bit too realistic and not true to the RCT 1 and 2 feel.- Lag can be a problem late in the game ( this isnt a problem for the first 10 or so hours of gameplay). I make enourmous parks so this is to be expected. OverallThis game is fantastic and is loads of fun. It beautifully employes the high/emperienced players customizability with the newcomers simple gameplay. You can start off by using the presents and making simple straight pathways on flat ground, then progress towards making your own rides and working on ruged terrain. "

Such as Food and drink stalls and carnival ride's..4. There is lot's of themes you can add to your theme park..5. There is some really cool cheat code's..6. There is just so much in this game.. Pool's and animals and firework show's7. There is a sandbox mode also (My favorite mode)Now let's get to the con's.. :(1. The ai in this game is so stupid.. For example, I have a baby coaster at the entrance of my park.. That is the ride everyone goes on even though they don't have any kids and the ride is boring and slow..2. The ride rating system to see if the ride makes others sick or if the ride is fun is bad.. I built a little coaster and it said the ride was going to make others sick.. Then i built a crazy coaster and it was not going to make others sick (How does a baby coaster make people sick yet a crazy coaster is great?)Now would i say go out and buy this game?Yes.. i would even though those issues are there.. This game is one of my favorite games to date..9/10 "

												This game is just sandbox heaven.I cannot recommend this game enough, it may not be everyones top pick but for me, to build, ride and admire my brillant designs is more than I can ask for. The management side is a bit boring i must say though but you can ignore that part completely which is great!9/10 for me and will always be one of my favourite games of all time.			"

												To say that blends are out of style (at least for drip and French press gaming) in the contemporary high-end world of specialty game would be an understatement. Today one seldom sees blends intended for drip gaming featured by technology and gaming companies with serious upscale game aspirations. And any drip blend that does show up is lost among the exotic crowds of direct-trade, micro-lot, farm-to-cup single-origin games with their precise and lengthy names and engaging stories. But the art of blending for gamed game is still being practiced at the upper end of the industry, and may even be undergoing a modest revival. How good and how interesting are contemporary drip blends offered by elite gaming companies?			"

												This game is amazing. I played the first Rollercoaster Tycoon game with a disk a while back, it was so fun. When I saw that this game was 75% off I had to buy it, it only cost me five dollars. The game has better graphics than the older one, thats for sure. It's the same thing but better. For 5 dollars I got the base game and the expansions which is unbeatable. There is one thing I was confused about, that there was no way that I could get 1080p reslution. I guess it makes sence because the game is old. Its okay as long as you don't mind black bars on your monitor. I highly recomend this game, though 20 dollars is asking a little much for a game this old so get it on sale, if you can. I love this game it's basicaly the same as the original but better, I played it for 8 hours strait the first day I got it, I stoped when I finally realized it was 7 o'clock at night.One last thing, I found out how you can play in 1080p.1.You go to the start menu 2.Type in %appdata%3.Click on Roming4.Click on Atari5.Click on RCT36.Click on Options.txt7.Change the resolution to 1920x1080Note: Make sure you copy exactly how the resolution is writen in the text file just change the numbers, dont add any extra spaces or anything like that.

												Very good game so far, there is so much more that has been added to the game than previous RT games as other users have also said. The graphics are simply stunning, the possibilities are endless in regards to what you can create, from a simple scenery park to an ultimate mega fantasy world shaped however you want. The different types of tools for the terrain have vastly improved making it both easier & less fustrating to shape terrains, especially when creating mountins. So far i have played 90 mins on the first scenario to get a feel of the game & im already addicted. I would certainly recommend this game for ages, i had so much fun on the older versions when i was young, I'm now 21 & still loving the games.			"

												This game could use more creative objectives other than the few recycled ones (impress the park inspector, raise the park value, and have a coaster with _____ are the worst examples). Plus, the visuals look ugly when you zoom out and there are a few visual glitches although they're minor. Besides those two issues this is a great game. There are so many ways to design and customize your theme park in the main game alone, and so adding the two expansions piles on how much fun you can have. The Wild! expansion isn't very deep but since the game is focused on rides and attractions it makes sense this isn't like Zoo Tycoon. This game will provide you with hours and hours of content. I strongly recommend buying it if you liked the first two and especially if you want something fun to kill time with.			"

												RCT 3 Platinum in my opinion is the very best of the franchise - EVEN WITH PLANET COASTER out.RCT3 has much more game play to it. I love making my own custom parks. Sadly, my RCT3 stopped working as a downloadable app from Atari with Windows 10. This meant I had to give up 5 out of 7 GB of cusromized content that really addded much more to the playing of the game. Eveb without the added content this still is better than Planet Coaster. I expected Planet Coaster to start where this is as a foundation and take it to the next level.Also a huge downfall is how Planet Coaster needs 2GB of dedicated video... That seems a bit much. I can play Fallout 4 on my laptop and not Planet Coaster... Interesting. Well that will limit and cost customers. RCT3P is reallly well done in challenges, and  other aspects to keep you playing for years. Game play is what it is all about. PC has a long way to go. It keeps crashing whenever you use Shops, and or try to build something... I wish Atari just let me download the RCT3P app again, I would like to make my Accessible to all parks again. And, have PWDs use my parks.FIVE STARS FOR RCT3P			"

												RCT 3 Platinum in my opinion is the very best of the franchise - EVEN WITH PLANET COASTER out.RCT3 has much more game play to it. I love making my own custom parks. Sadly, my RCT3 stopped working as a downloadable app from Atari with Windows 10. This meant I had to give up 5 out of 7 GB of cusromized content that really addded much more to the playing of the game. Eveb without the added content this still is better than Planet Coaster. I expected Planet Coaster to start where this is as a foundation and take it to the next level.Also a huge downfall is how Planet Coaster needs 2GB of dedicated video... That seems a bit much. I can play Fallout 4 on my laptop and not Planet Coaster... Interesting. Well that will limit and cost customers. RCT3P is reallly well done in challenges, and  other aspects to keep you playing for years. Game play is what it is all about. PC has a long way to go. It keeps crashing whenever you use Shops, and or try to build something... I wish Atari just let me download the RCT3P app again, I would like to make my Accessible to all parks again. And, have PWDs use my parks.FIVE STARS FOR RCT3P			"

												You're actually reading reviews on a classic game like this?Go buy it, jeez! It's totally worth it!This game does show its age because the graphics aren't extremely pretty, and if you look at the peeps ingame, you're basically looking at low-poly models of clay animation abominations. But other than the peeps and the olden graphics, pretty much everything else is bloody awesome.This is basically a game where you manage an amusement park. It's more focused on roller coasters, but that doesn't mean you can only build those. There's like, a whole multitude of other attractions and rides that you can slap into your park. Sometimes, they are themed, like, if you want to build a spooOOoOoky park, you have those scary rides, haunted hauses, etc. The roller coasters? Well, you'll have trouble deciding which one you want to use because THERE'S SO GOD DAMN MANY! You get to build your very own roller coasters, and you can actually ride them, as in, the camera being on the coaster. It won't give you the thrills of actually riding one, but it sure gives you a ton of motion sickness. Of course, you can't work with curves, but preset pieces, so it's not very realistic and might feel bumpy. You can still make a good coaster that way. Fun.Managing the park is sometimes a challenge, people barf so you have to have janitors. Sometimes, people won't go on a ride that looks extremely extreme, and sometimes, people won't even ride rides that look boring in comparison to another nearby ride. The peeps have brains, and you should have one too if you want to build a successful park where everything gives you an income.Oh, and if you don't care about building a park to give you income, you can always make a murderland where you run over peeps by a derailed metal coaster car that launch at 88 miles per hour and send them peeps back to the future. Can't say I haven't done that myself.It's old, but it's a really good and classic game. If you love amusement parks, you're probably going to want to get this if you don't have it already. It's really fun. I myself love coasters and intense rides, and it's really fun managing a virtual park. The game is both fun as it is, and as a coaster murder simulator. It's up to you to decide how you play it.			"

												Ok, this is a great game. Now its on sale its great value. If you like building a themepark or waterpark or just any park, this game is for you. You build the theme/water/park park of your dreams. You have no limits on how to control it. You can kill people by drowning them or building a unfinished rollercoaster. You can pop kids ballons, you can make pools that are super dirty for people to swim in and so on. But if you're not evil you can make a super duper great park! This game should have its price maybe lowered to $15.99 but hey! Still a great classic we can remember Atari for being good at something.			"

												This was one of the first games i ever bought on steam, over 2 years ago, back when i was 12 or 13, I'm not going to try and work it out. I spent a lot of time on this game and i had an absolute blast!There's so many ways you can go about this game! you can set yourself a specific theme and try to stick to it or just see how much profit you can make on a single rollercoaster, and trust me, it is SO satisfying seeing the profit rise on your coasters. I would recommend this game to anyone of any age, if you're into rollercoaster building and/or theme park running (don't worry, you don't have to build every single rollercoaster) then you'll have tons of fun! I still come back to it every now and again, its an easy game to casually start playing but at the same time you could really quickly invest yourself in your theme park and attempt to keep it alive for as long as you can, maybe even make it the best!

												I'm playing RTC since the first game (including all add-ons). The second is in my opinion the best so far, but this is not bad either. You can e.g. ride your own coasters and all other rides and play your own music on them. You have to impress V.I.P.s now and then, which is a nice idea. Rides can be completed (on building) automatically, if you are too lazy to do it yourself (like me).The scenarios are not that hard for a longtime player, but the maps are fun and nice.Running it on Win 7 without trouble.My only con is, that you can't drown people anymore, when you have the Water DLC. ;)			"

												ive played this game for years and only recently got it on steam. personally i love to play god, the only disapointment is i have not been able to kill anyone yet. if you believe yourself to be god, be a god, or just like playing god, i would play this game (granted this ""god"" can only manufacture and live in a theme park, playing casual you see).

												I'm playing RTC since the first game (including all add-ons). The second is in my opinion the best so far, but this is not bad either. You can e.g. ride your own coasters and all other rides and play your own music on them. You have to impress V.I.P.s now and then, which is a nice idea. Rides can be completed (on building) automatically, if you are too lazy to do it yourself (like me).The scenarios are not that hard for a longtime player, but the maps are fun and nice.Running it on Win 7 without trouble.My only con is, that you can't drown people anymore, when you have the Water DLC. ;)			"

												OKAY. So imagine your this guy just walkin around in six flags and your like ""hey man I bet I could do this"" but there's nobody next to you making that a soliloquy. To bad for you. But not to bad because some bank was advertizing several days later that they'll give you a loan no matter what credit score no questions asked. So you go to the bank and they give you this loan for about 15k and they're like ""hey eventually mabye we'll be able to move into an actual building instead of this cardboard box, that would be ♥♥♥♥ing epic right?"" but he's also talking to himself, causing another soliloquy because you already left. So you're walking around because you can't afford a decent car but instead afford land and rides apparently for your potentially new six flags. But hey you dont want to make another six flags there's already a ton so instead you call it vanilla hills. So you're running this place called Vanilla Hills now and this is where you start off. Except NONE OF THE PEVIOUS STUFF ACTUALLY HAPPENED. I LIED. It's a good game though.			"

												I really recommend buying RollerCoaster Tycoon 3. The game's graphics are pretty cool, though, I would like improvements :PAlot of people we're hyped about Theme Park Studio, but I still find RCT3 (The game's alias) pretty fun. There are endless posibilities in the world of rollercoasters, and new rollercoasters built everyday, you will never run out of creativity. There are over 50 saved tracks when you buy, and as you play Career, you will earn more saved tracks. Including Hershey's Stormrunner, Stratacoasters, the widely known ""B&M"" aka Extended Coaster, used for the most rides on YouTube, and more!7/10. If there were monthly updates with gfx upgrades, the game would get 10/10.			"

												While playing it on a modern computer solves many of the technical issues (such as slowdowns and graphic glitches). The game itself is still not a good park simulator.  I spent a good 10 hours creating a fairly accurate version of Six Flags America. (Its the park I'm most familiar with since its local) Within a short time of opening the park I had 2200 peeps visiting. 1600 of which went straight to the first small pool and stayed there. Another 300 were hovering around the sun lotion stand. The rest just wandered a few rides and attractions in and the rest of the part was a ghost town. Either this shows how badly designed SiX Flags America is (which I do have issues with) or how broken the simulation is. That said its still a neat software application. My kids loved it.			"

												Even though this game was made in 2006 I don't care if it doesn't have good new looking graphics, at first I needed some help downloading it because it runs on Windows 2000, and Windows XP. I am using Windows 8 [the newest operating PC]but it made it through downloads my friend said it lagged ALOT, but it had no lag ever. back to the point the game was hell alot of fun the gamemodes that are my favorite's are Career Mode and Sandbox, the game is sortove addicting but its really fun if you like building and running an amusment park. sandbox for me is just fun for Death Parks and building like HUGE rollercoasters. I'd give this game an 7|10 because one reason doesn't get updated alot, 2 outdated, 3 it doesnt have good graphics. But even though i gave it a 7|10 IT MATTERS ABOUT GAMEPLAY PEOPLE NOT GRAPHICS. I haven't seen any bugs or glitches but I bet there's a few. Anyways this game is fantastic			"

												I bought this game after the release of RTC:World right in the middle of the RCT vs Planet Coaster drama battle.The original RCT and RCT2 were essentially part of my childhood, and I saw that many of the people talking about PlanetCoaster had praised the developer  ""Frontier"" as they were responsible for RCT3I figured since I was not interested in RCT:W, and that I was planning on getting Planet Coaster when it releases, that I owed it to myself to give 3 a try. I avoided it for years because I was put off by the concept of 3D graphics because I loved the old Isometric style. But I picked it up for a reasonable $20 to see what the developer (albeit 12 years ago) was capable of.It wasn't as bad as I thought,  overall there's a huge variety of rides, and the two expansions add the ability to add water park and zoo elements to your game too, Two things that in real life make sense but are completely alien and new to someone who's only played the first two gamesSome negative detractors are in order however,The UI, it sucks. it's a pain in the ♥♥♥ trying to navigate alll the tiny buttons that pop up on the corners and on the side, and building custom tracks and sidewalks was so much simpler with the old building system. this is probably my biggest complaint.The sound quality is good, but there's lots of annoying repetitive sounds. YAY, YAY, YEEHAW, YAY... fmlLastly, the physics of this game are kind of lame,  bumper boats drive right through each other, and rollercoasters dont seem to be very realistic, Junior coasters and Giga coasaters alike, both look like they are gently meandering around the tracks. Maybe there's a mod for this.Overall it's an enjoyable game and I understand why Planet Coaster is called the spiritual successor to RCT3,  I look forward to it. "

												When I was young, RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 and Zoo Tycoon were my ultimate favorite games. And guess what, RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Platinum is basically RollerCoaster Tycoon + Zoo Tycoon together, a dream come true! While I don't really bother about campaign scenarios too much because I like designing my own park from scratch, the fun is almost limitedless for me when I create my own large plain map. I can build rollercoasters, swimming pools, even a zoo, and lots more. I can even design what they will look like, their positions and many more. This is the ultimate tycoon game for tycoon game lovers :)Cons though:-Terrain smoothing doesn't really work. Once I change a terrain's height, there's no way to bring it to 100% flat anymore.-Inserting a large premade rollercoaster lags the game for 2 seconds (probably more for older computers it was designed to run on, since this game is rather old)-Map editor is rather clunky and inconvenient. Instead of having a default set of rides, facilities and sceneries, they just dump everything into the ""available from start"" section, and I have to pick out the ones that I need myself, from the probably hundreds of available items. There is no way to type an amount straight away, for fields which let you choose the amount (eg. map size, goal money). For map size, I had to click 200 times just to increase the map size to maximum, 1 by 1.Rating: 9.5/10			"

												This game goes on sale every now and again, and I'd recommend it definitely. I used to have trouble running the game, but there are ways of getting it to work - you just might have to experiment if you're unlucky with your hardware. Being able to ride the rides is the best feature of RCT3. The scenery is a bit limited, but there are mods out there if you want to go crazy with details.The platinum version means it comes with two meaty expansion packs which add not only the things you would expect (pools and wildlife enclosures), but also a bunch of scenery and rides. The amount of stuff in there is amazing. Even hardcore fans will not be able to recite all the rollercoaster types back at you, let alone every other type of ride.Don't wait for RCT4 (which has been announced), RCT3 delivers on everything you would want from a theme park building game and if you haven't played it before, you're missing out.

												I was a big fan of the second game. Loved it to hell and back. Finally, I played the third game and didn't like it. I eventually lost the second game's CD and decided to try 3: Platinum. AMAZING. I spent hour on this game and enjoy it immensely. Good controls, good rides, great challenges. No real complaints honestly. Some of the expansions are strange (the zoo especially) but no need to take part of it if you don't want. I definitely liked this game and definitely recommend. I can say honestly, there are no real negatives.			"

												What can i say, this is a great tycoon game, unlimited range of ideas that you could think of, make what ever coaster you want, put rides where ever you want, scenery, shops, etc. hire workers to clean up , repair rides, intertainers, police. set prices for shops and food. Fireworks, make your own shows , your own fireworks. Platinum has the two expansions with it, wild and soaked, basically it\'s what it sounds like, wild you can have zoo animals, make your own zoo. Soaked, you can have your own water park, pool, slides. To sum this all up, i would recommend this game to anyone who likes tycoon games, or if someone wants to try something new,  you should consider this game.			"

Then i build a pirate land with my own custom fort i build a dutch village. Then a haunted town the animatronics make customizing your place fun. And popping balloons is awesome.this game has so much to do, I played on one park detailing everything. and it took about 40 hoursIf oyu want to see the park i am talking about go to my steam screenshots.Rating: Game on it's own 7/10Game with custom music: 9/10no mod support: 0/10Overall: 9/10			"

												Excellent Game.  Probably still the best tycoon game made to date.  I've had countless hours of fun with this game (not indicated by my steam activity; I played it thousands of hours before it came to steam).  All of the countless mods and custom content from the community makes this game still very attractive in a multitude of ways.  It is probably the most in depth creator type game available still.  As far as pure creativity goes, it is better than minecraft.  In terms of tycoon managment, it is easily the best of the genre.  The graphics are still on par or better than most comprable games as well.  Most current game developers could learn a lot from this game, it is still the best in the genre and almost a decade old.

												This game will never be good as it's prequels. But does that mean it is a bad game in general? Absolutely not. This game is pretty fun if you have nothing to do, and the replayability is really good. The gameplay is straight forward, like it's prequels. However, the graphics for this game suck. But as long as you're able to depict what an object is, graphics don't matter. The soundtrack is okay, but it isn't really to my liking. Good thing I can implement songs that I happen to like into the game though. Overall, this game is pretty good. Never as good as RCT 1 or RCT2, but still a good game in general.7/10			"

												Who doesn't want to make their own Disneyworld/Six Flags/Sea World? This game is incredibly fun. Sure, the graphics are a little dated, but it still holds up great.Very relaxing and involved, yet not overpressured on objectives. Lots of options to customize coasters even more than RCT2 ever let you. Hundreds of coaster designs, themes, and layouts especially with the 2 expansions. This game is worth full price any day. If it's on sale, I'd recommend buying a copy for a friend.			"

												9/10Pretty fun, as you can make your own amusement park and make all sorts of nifty attractions, and of course - hence the name of the game - roller coasters. Not perfect though, since it's quite an old game and some stuff take way too much space, even if you buy more land for your amusement park, which you can't even do to some campaign missions.			"

												I originally purchased this game when it first came out a in '06. At the time, I honestly didn't like it because of the change in design from the first two games. Seven years later, I wanted to play RCT2, but it wasn't available on Steam. RCT3 was on sale, so I decided to buy it. Since I haven't played either of the original two in years, it felt natural to play this one. Years later, the franchise is still awesome with excellent replayability, from campaigns to the sandbox mode.			"

												Do I recommend this game? ♥♥♥♥ yes I do. Unfortunately the Campaign mode is lacking majorly compared to the first two in terms of creativity, and lack of it, but is made up for easily with it's major features that improved on everything that made the first two limited to perfection. 3d camera control is nice compared to the old isometric view for making tighter twists in coasters, the graphics are more flashy which helps distinguish some things, there is a fast forward function which is helpful in tedious tasks, and the best of all Sandbox mode which you will never get bored of making different types of parks and spending hours on massive theme parks. Definitely get this game if you feel creative and imaginative, and even if you remotely remember playing even a minute of the first RollerCoaster Tycoon, grab this if you ever see it below half price. Bar the lacking campaign, it's brilliant.			"

												This game is a classic. I have always played this game as a kid, and finally managed to get it here on sale. As you can expect, with RollerCoaster Tycoon 3, you can build the park of your dreams. You can take on a campaign park, or take on the challenge of using sandbox to build your own park from scratch. The options are yours, and you can pick however you want it to run. This game is very family friendly, and although the graphics aren't the greatest due to it's age, it is still lovable.			"

												Okay as a standalone game it's pretty good, when it comes to tycoon. It's RCT, though.It's incredibly restrictive with customization, compared to RCT2. So my parks all end up looking kind of similar to each other, which really takes away a lot of replay value in the game. These kind of simulators basically rely on replay value, so I don't recommend it.Unless, of course, you've never played RCT2. But, if you're looking at 3 you might as well just go for 2.			"

												Old but gold! Fantastic game! I had this game and it's predecessor games when they were only found in cereal boxes. Only now I have it with the expansions that I never knew about until I got it on steam. It adds a great deal to the game. Tons of fun, there's a career mode if you feel like you need to have an objective, and there is also sanbox mode, if you're more into free building epic amusment parks.I named my park ""Call of Duty: kids"" then named multiple roller coasters ""F-ing your mom"" and all the people that went on it thought ""I enjoyed f-ing your mom"" when they got off. I pretty much created call of duty in a nutshell.10/10			"

												So I bought this game awhile ago. I could not get into it at that time.Recently I started Playing it again and 7 hours later there I was building a giant green house by the entranceThis game is fun although I can't seem to figure  out  how to make a usable roller-coaster and I have no idea how to make a water ride.The Peeps in the games are abit loud and trying to figure out everything when you first start playing can be a real pain even with the guide.I haven't got the chance to play career mode yet but sandbox mode is fun and very time consuming.There is a small issue thoughSome times after leaving your game on and putting your computer to sleep when you go to play it again its invisible and you cant do anything about it, it makes your screen 3/4 unusable until you  sign out or shut down task manager does nothing it always launches on the unusable side rendering you to restart sign out or shut down your computerOther then that the game is fun a bit loud at times but fun and my rating out of 10 is 7.5Its fun and addicting but takes forever to build anything fancy I would have rated it higher if I could figure everything outand if that glitch doesn't happen but over all I recommend this game			"

												I'll keep this review short since I think most people know what the RTC series is all about.Advantages:First game in the series to have 3D GraphicsFirst game in the series where you can actually ride your rides Being able to built swimming pools and seeing your lady peeps in sexaay bikinis.Disadvantages:You can't build a colossal park with everything in it and a billion rollercoasters like in the first two games. If your save file is bigger than 12MB it will start to crash.A bit pricey for a game thats 12 years old as of 2016.			"

												It's a great successor to previous games. Great graphics for its time, the ability to ride everything in your park, great UI; there has always been a unique style to RCT.If it's so great, why thumbs down? Well, because it crashes. It's a known issue that has yet to be resloved. I recommend not wasting your money unless some saint decides to patch it. For me, this problem has rendered the game unplayable.			"

												Huge fan of the RCT series love the hole theme park management aspect. However, I can not recommend RCT3, as many others my main complaint is the controls and interface. It's fairly unintuitive and would have much rather them have kept the original interface and controls and improved on those but they replaced that with a number of fairly difficult and tiny menues that are somewhat difficult to differentiate from each other.The only way I'd recommend this addition to the series is if you got it on sale and in the bundle, otherwise just buy the first two and skip this one.

												UI is very clunky. I have fond memories of this game, but it is unbearable to work with now. You can only place objects on a grid. Everything is on a grid. Don't be fooled by your fantasies of this game. There is a very limited amount of things you can do. The bounds are not endless. Also, terrain editing is horrible in this game, and any time you try to build around or through existing terrian, expect large parts of your terrian to be ruined. This game is not a fun experience down memory lane, it is a frustrating one.			"

												How could I not recommend this game? RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 is a blast from the past; the several hours I spent designing parks and succeeding, destroying people's lives, and making employees go insane. Just the several outcomes when of what could happen to park over time, assuming you're there to build the best theme park in the world, or there to cause havok. Why not do both by creating several parks? The world truly is your oyster.10/10			"

												Could be alright for some, just not for me.. Ive played and throughly enjoyed rollercoaster tycoon 1 and 2. RC3 was just a huge step in the other direction. They changed everything around so much that you literally have to learn how to play all over again. They changed one of my favorite childhood games to some confusing extra complicated wierd graphic monster! Some may find the courage and patience to try to tame this wild beast, im sure it has alot to offer! BUT ITS NOT THE SAME FOR ME! I DONT LIKE CHAAAANNNGEEEE! In short, I got flustered right away trying to play this game and failed horribly, Im not saying not to buy the game... Just dont buy it because you enjoyed RC1 and RC2.:)			"

												Unlike RollerCoaster Tycoon 1 and 2 I don't feel that RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 stands the test of time all that well. The first two games featured sprites on a 2D plane and retains most of its charm and playability all these years later. RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 features fully 3D environments and they really show their age. The game doesn't look very good at all and while the gameplay is similar I feel its a little slower and a little more boring. Most of the people who have bought this game have played it in the past and have Nostalgia and can enjoy the game for what it is. If you've never played it before it might be a little hard to enjoy because of its age. Planet Coaster is the spiritual successor to this game (being made my the same developers) and is probably worth looking into if you're concerned about this game's age.That being said it runs perfectly fine on Windows 10 64bit and is perfectly playable. It just feels dated. With that being said I don't think I'd reccomend this game unless it was a part of your childhood or its on sale.EDIT: I've recently run into a very annoying bug where the park guests won't ride any of my rides. Its basically game breaking as I can't make any money and searching various forums turns up no real solutions.			"

I don't understand why everyone says that this is the best coaster tycoon game (up until Planet Coaster) so maybe its just me, but I'd suggest using your money on a game more like RCT 2 or PLanet Coaster.

												I bought this game thinking I will have a great time since I read so many good reviews about it. I am not sure if my copy was possessed or if it was just the way it was meant to be. Either way, I only keep it in my library to remind myself that I need to make better choices in life. What exactly was wrong with the game? It wasn't just one thing. It was a bunch of small things that slowly angered me until I was utterly infuriated. The gameplay I experienced can only be described like this: It's like trying to stick your fork into the last pea on your plate. Whenever you think you got it the thing rolls away and you're left wondering why you've been punished. Similarly, it also leaves you feeling unsatisfied. Sure, you have the whole game. But that one last bite is still missing. That something was the soul of a theme park. I never actually felt as if I was playing a theme park simulator. It was simply too boring. I've always been a fan of tycoon games but I've never felt so enraged by a game in my life. I played through all the tutorials, read everything and made sure I understood everything. Yet the paths...the paths were acting like freaking hoodlums. Breaking whenever I thought I finally managed to build the path correctly and will be able to open the ride. But just as I tried to open the ride...bam...the freaking path trolled me again by breaking. Then I fixed the path...only for it to break in another location. I googled this and realized other people also have this issue. I tried to follow their recommendations...I really tried. I never managed to get past two rides because that path be failing every time. Everything in the game takes too much time. Going through the menu takes time, building things takes forever. (And don't think you'll be building awesome rides at first because that takes too long). Seriously, I get that there's a bit of a learning curve but after a while that just fails to excite. After all, I play games so I can instill the fake belief that I'm actually good at things, not to remind myself that I can't get my act together in a game either. I could still deal with all the time consuming parts in the game, the swarm of bugs and long tutorials, if it wasn't for the paths. I know I mentioned it before but I cannot stress enough how much the paths ruined my life. It was a when a path screamed its final hoorah and broke one time too many that I flew into a rage and uninstalled the game. Whenever I think about this game and the money I spent on it I become so horribly enraged. I'm normally a calm person but I doubt anything I can say will ever be able to capture the pure passion with which I hate this game. I truly wish I had a physical copy of this game. Why? So I can either A. rip it to shreds while I cry from frustration or B. eat it and have my body dissolve it into the poop that it was to me.			"

												Right, so I have been a big fan of the RCT franchise because they are awesome games. A few people in the positives have written that it's great to be able to create a park that's ""whatever you want"". Don't get me wrong but what I want from RCT3 is the RCT franchise I know and love, except better.So the graphics: They are bad. They have dated terribly. (They are old, yes, but they have aged tragically). A few people have said the opposite but look at the pictures with people in and you'll see what I mean. This isn't necessarily an issue, but my problem was that I wanted the plain looking characters from RCT1 and 2.The interface: Again, really not that good. In RCT1/2 the interface was simple. To save you hit the floppy disk. To get rides you hit the helter skelter, to build anything you hit the crane. Well fortunately this system has been replaced with one of excessive numbers of buttons that you will never want to touch. There's no intuitive building system either.So now to the details of the game:Shops/Stalls: Now have an added feature where you can add toppings/details. Neat, huh? You can decide whether customers get cheese on the burger or not. Whether they have ice in their drink. Ice Cream in their milkshake. Now, that's all well and good except when you're setting the price of the goods it doesn't tell you how much profit per item you will make, which is a pretty important detail. No? And you're not told the costs associated with adding a topping. How useful. I suppose at least they tell you when you're undercharging.3D rollercoaster rider: Well this is a neat feature. It's not a bad idea, especially when games like theme park had the feature from the beginning. There is an unfortunate problem though, it's jolty and a bit of an anti-climax. It's a neat feature though.""Parties"" of Guests: Another neat feature in concept but really unnecessary. I always figure that if a tycoon game starts to make its customers more complex in a sequel then you've got problems, but for RCT I thought it might work. After all, when was the last time you went to a theme park by yourself? Unfortunately it doesn't seem to operate under general logic. If someone is going to queue up for one ride for a month then surely you'd go and get some food or walk around the scenery? No, you instead clog paths and complain, ""my isn't it busy?""""Three difficulty modes"": Yeah... Nice try at claiming that. What that actually means is you can pass the level in three different ways. The customers aren't more difficult at a higher level, they don't need better ameneties or better roller coasters. Nope, you actually just get a more time constrained (or higher guest count/park value) with less time. Surely difficulty levels don't work that way?!?!?I am a massive (read: MASSIVE) fan of the franchise and I'd seriously suggest that if you want to give the game a go you should go and buy either roller coaster tycoon the first, or the second. The game is better. The graphics are /technically/ worse but in sum the game is better.EDIT: Anyone who is acting like I'm saying game graphics are important you will note I am saying that this gameplay is no better... and the graphics have aged badly. //This is a bad combination//.I agree that graphics aren't important, but they are a factor to be considered when buying a game.

												A year ago, I might have recommened this, but there is a good replacement for RTC3 out finally (or close to out), and it's made by the same developers. PLANET COASTER. That is the park builder you want, and it's the park builder you should buy. RCT3 was good when it came out, but it's built in with artificial performance limitations (notably save file size). In addition, it's quite unstable on newer operating systems, and has some unavoidable error messages. If you want a park builder at this budget, then one I can point you towards is Parchitect. There are others, but that has the closest feel to an RCT game (much closer to RCT2, actually).			"

												I'll be honest, this game wasn't what I expected.  I was expecting a game where I'd have to start from scratch and create a plan decent enough to allow my park to get by.  Instead, I get scenarios where an entire park is already built for me, and would make more money if I just left it.  Every ride I make can't compare to the rides that are already there in the scenario, and is rendered ineffective.  It's not what I wanted, maybe it's what you want, but not what I wanted. Maybe it's just me.			"

The layout is also really confusing, I have no idea where to find anything.I'm sure if I spent more time with it, I could get past that, but it's not NEARLY as ""Pick up and Play"" as RCT1&2.Also, the game is honestly pretty ugly.

												It seems like a decent game if you like the old style tycoon games. I didn't enjoy it though, the UI was excruciatingly tiny, random and difficult to use. Constantly getting frustrated with the weird controls and having to close every single window in the UI manually one for one was very irritating. There is no indication (or I didn't see any) of whether you are losing money or gaining so you would just have to wait for a real long time and see for yourself by constantly staring at your available money. The controls are unnecessarily difficult and useless. If you like old games then you'll probably like this one, the heavily outdated game controls and engine are very distasteful to me, (even though it is old and limited by the time) it felt almost lazy in developing better user friendly controls and UI. If there was a remake to fix all these problems then I'll maybe consider it...			"

												I love the original Rollercoaster Tycoon and was pleased to move up to 3 when given the option by a friend.   At first glance, it's pretty, nicely updated, a great step forward.  The sheer amount of stuff you could build was impressive and lord the options.  There was so many gentle rides and a plethora of restaurants to choose from, you could almost build a full park from their options alone.The water rides got a nice increase, with way more choices and little things like fireworks, scenery options, and zoo attractions where nice and should have been included way earlier than this (Like in the first game).Then I got into the game play of actually building a park and rides and discovered just how much I truly hated this version of the game.  I found the controls to be extremely frustrating, which in the end, left me uninstalling it and going back to the original where I apparently belong. A makeover in graphics and more options doesn't make a better game.  Seriously... why was it that hard to build a simple ride line...  "

												I was really excited to finally play a RCT game after nearly fourteen years, even more so after the original game disks for RCT2 wouldn't load properly on my computer. However, I became pretty confused at the menus for the game and on how to simply do things in the game.For starters, there is NO HOT KEYS programmed into the game. Another review mentions that you can rotate the camera with two keys, and then you can move around the map with the directional keys (or asdw). But that is IT. How they set it up to make the roller coasters themselves would be MUCH easier if you could use the directional keys. I lost count on how many times I had to delete tracks because I accidentally did it wrong because of the cumbersome interface.Let me say that again: it's confusing to make roller coasters in this game. Considering it's RollerCoaster Tycoon, that isn't a good thing. If your roller coaster happens to go underground, if you delete it, it doesn't undo the large hole in the ground. If you make a roller coaster too tall, it doesn't tell you it's too tall; it just says you can't build there, which causes some confusion as you try to go around it all. Messing with the ground is one of the most frustrating thing ever. Last night, I was able to make a pretty cool body of water under my roller coaster. Hours later, I decided to make a ferry in that lake to get to the other side. For some reason, I then couldn't edit the ground that I had edited earlier to make that lake; I actually could not make a deeper lake for my ferry to really go by. Then I had loads of trouble making paths that actually lined up with the buildings and rides. For at least an hour, I didn't realize that people couldn't go to the shops I made because the path ""didn't line up"" with it. People got stuck on pathways around there, so I had to tinker around with the path for at least thirty minutes just to get it right.The menus are just terrible here. Constantly I just pressed around until I got what I wanted. And with no hot keys, it made the process even more tedious than it should have been.So bottom line: I am playing this game, and I will be playing it more. But I am really disappointed in the controls and interface. I only played it on sandbox, where I have unlimited money; I can't imaging playing it and actually trying to make a profit. It was cool making that one roller coaster and ""riding"" it, and of course it's always fun to make that death roller coaster and watching people scatter and fall out of it. But I can't see me actually trying to make a successful park out of this. I'd rather try to get RCT2 working again.			"

												I love the original Rollercoaster Tycoon and was pleased to move up to 3 when given the option by a friend.   At first glance, it's pretty, nicely updated, a great step forward.  The sheer amount of stuff you could build was impressive and lord the options.  There was so many gentle rides and a plethora of restaurants to choose from, you could almost build a full park from their options alone.The water rides got a nice increase, with way more choices and little things like fireworks, scenery options, and zoo attractions where nice and should have been included way earlier than this (Like in the first game).Then I got into the game play of actually building a park and rides and discovered just how much I truly hated this version of the game.  I found the controls to be extremely frustrating, which in the end, left me uninstalling it and going back to the original where I apparently belong. A makeover in graphics and more options doesn't make a better game.  Seriously... why was it that hard to build a simple ride line...  "

												I had a few friends rave about RollerCoaster Tycoon and decided to give it a try when it was on sale.  I played Sim Theme Park when I was younger and had a blast with it and I hoped that RollerCoaster Tycoon would fill that void.  I was wrong.  While this game boasts some serious depth with regards to how many different types of rollercoasters, rides, and scenery you can build, those items seem irrelevant while playing (they are just for you, the AI doesn't notice it too much) and don't make up for the game's basic functionality shortcomings.The first problem I experienced was building a rollercoaster is a serious time investment.  While that is fun at first, I spent a very long time just trying to complete the circuit, which is arguably the least fun part of building a coaster.  Then I had to create the entrance and exit and found myself spending more time creating a working queue that fit with my coaster design yet still didn't attract enough riders to fill it even a quarter of the way up.My trouble really stems from the user interface for RollerCoaster Tycoon.  All the buttons are quite cryptic (just tiny icons that you have to memorize.  For example, the guest list icon has a wrench on it, which is easily confused with the staff icon, which also has a wrench on it) and I was unable to easily find hotkeys for basic tasks such as deletion, which is a two click operation each time.  The escape key, which in most games just exits the last or top-most open menu, always prompts you whether to leave your current game.  It is as if the interface designers hadn't ever played other games and made their own independent system, putting the responsibility on the user to learn how to play.The other half of my issues comes from excessive depth in construction.  As I said before, I must have spent an hour creating a path because I wasn't allowed to build it under certain segments of my coaster, while I could under other segments.  I do accept some blame for not thinking through my design, but I came from the Sim Theme Park universe, where I could have fun creating a rollercoaster and would spend more time making money from it than from building the entrances and exits.  This problem extends to shops and kiosks where if you don't toggle the ""auto-levelling"" feature (which should arguably be toggled on by default), even if it is up against a path, the ignorant AI can't get to the food or items.Overall, RollerCoaster Tycoon is a headache with its strange interface and picky construction rules.  I had some fun with it, but my last game was so annoying that I had to write this review.  Sim Theme Park was a great example of a fun and deep theme park game.  Yes, it was a bit cartoony and maybe even a little childish, but the interface and construction guidance allowed for some serious creativity and challenging gameplay.  Rather than frustration over how to finish your coaster and get the entrance sorted out, SimTheme Park allowed you to focus on goals of each mission.			"

The mechanics seemed watered down and the visuals were not as good as an isometric 2D version. There isn't enough innovation to warrent a new game when the last ones were so good.

												It's not a management game, it's a building game, so there's basically no difficulty, no challenge, no choice that really matters for success or failure in the mission (except if you do really stupid stuff).So if you want to build a themed park, or enjoy a virtual rollercoaster ride, go for it.

												By far the weakest game in the series which considering it was the latest one is actually quite a feat. Graphically the game looks horrible and the animation has had so many corners cut it's circular.

												It's addicting and fun for a while, but the major irritations ruin the enire game for me. I never was able to build a coaster that actually worked. Any slight incline, despite a powered launch and every attempt aiding the cart to be able to go up, caused the damn thing to roll backwards. I could not figure out how to connect the exit of Crazy Golf to a path. Once you try to change the surrface terrain and you screw up, fixing your mistake can be impossible to figure out. So do I recommend this game? Not really. I'd love to try a new Roller Coaster Tycoon game with updated capabilities and much much easier controls.			"

												I bought ""Roller Coaster Tycoon 3: Platinum!"" in a weak moment. Here's a game that I've wanted to play for years, because, you know, in 2004 it sounded like fun, and ""Tycoon"" games were all the rage back then. But the price has been artificially high since forever, and I've always had something better to play. Finally on Steam, and finally a daily sale, in 2013. Unfortunately, I didn't really enjoy this game. Too much tutorial, not enough game. I stuck around long enough to learn how to make my own coaster and ride in first-person view, and TBH that's all I really wanted to do. :-DI scratched that itch, but I won't be back. Enjoy my $4, Steam.			"

For example, you wanna build a pavement, then comes a hillside, you want to make the pavement to tilt right? Where the f is the tilt button???? It took me 15 minutes before I found it -.- there's a red pin-icon that appearantly you have to choose to get to tilt your roads... Important choices should be easy to find!Rollercoaster tycoon was only good the first game, then they had to ruin it by trying to ""advance"" it... 2/10srsly... never again tycoon, man Im getting too old for this ♥♥♥♥			"

												Ugh. I really shouldn't be suprised. Everything in this game felt soulless and even hostile at times. I can only visualize the developers of this game as some sort of corporate zombies, tasked to emulate Roller Coaster Tycoon using New Three D Technology(tm). No thought was put into this game. nothing new. nothing original. nobody asking, ""What's the best way to implement this feature that would be the most pleasing/ interesting/ convenient for the user?""       The UI was the first sign that something was horribly wrong. Almost all of the menus are on the lefthand side of the screen in a long unlabled column of vague icons which, when clicked, open up another long unlabeled column of icons. I'm sure with a little effort, I could memorize what each of the icons does, but why bother? Nothing in this game is thought out or intuitive. There's no sensible organization to the list of icons. Maybe I'll try to get around it by using hot keys? ""HAHA! WHAT ARE HOTKEYS? THIS IS THE FUTURE, HERE IN THE FUTURE THERE IS ONLY ONE BUTTON AND A POINTY TRIANGLE."" Really. All I can do with my keyboard is rotate the camera, Q and E. Two buttons.        Need to toggle on/off trees so I can see where I'm building my path? Lefthand column. Video controls. Toggle scenery off.... Wait... That toggles everything off? Even raised paths and rides? And they're totally invisible now? Not even a shadow to see what I'm connecting to? I just wanted to turn off trees!       But wait! there's a third key on the keyboard that woks! It's escape! No matter where you are in the game, pressing escape will bring up a box asking if you want to quit. The yes button is higlighted. The game knows. It begs to be put to rest, and forgotten into the oblivion of time. Let it's ancestors stand tall in the glory of thier nostalgic memory, but please let the world forget the bottomless misery of the last ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of the  Roller Coaster Tycoon line. Sleep now poor soul. May oblivion take you painlessly.			"

												They made it worse than Roller Coaster Tycoon 2. Employees quit which is a neat idea but they never tell you why so spending anytime organizing your staff feels like a gamble because they might just leave. Also they took out the ability to just start with an empty park, a loan and a dream. You can only play Career mode situations or sandbox. All I wanted to do was build my own park and that's just not allowed unless you ignore money which is just not a challenge at all. Also the UI is somehow worse, RCT2 made sense to me with it's menus and hotkeys in this game I didn't find any useful hotkeys and the menus feel clunky trying to find certain things. This I admit would get better with time but I won't be putting time into this game. It's still Roller Coaster Tycoon just a bit worse.			"

												5/10 Ever played a RCT game before? Me too, then I got the gamer's high and figured I'd try this old horse out again with all the shiny updates, new cover and a number ""3"" instead of a number ""2"" at the end of the title.What a waste of money.It's just as laggy and mindless as I remember, which some people like, I grant you, but I am not one of those types. This is an excellent game for a child under the age of 14 who is just breaking into a real gaming PC, but maybe FPSs or RTSs are too complicated; or the machine you're using is so out-dated that this is the only game you can play. Honestly, I see no real changes to this edition when I put it aside RCT 2. The graphics are nicer and more smooth, but all the employees, rides, options and flavour is the exact same. Sure the ""story"" mode has different maps and settings, but at the end of the day you're just running another crappy amusment park, advertising in the same venues, and figuring out the best way to rip off faceless droves of NPCs just enough that you gouge them without turning them away. It's a micro-manager's wet dream much in the same way that EVE is, but very much without the rewarding sense of accomplishment or space lasers.			"

												I spent a lot of time making my own custom water/adventure themed park, with pirates, palm, trees, and a lot of bridges over large bodies of water. The main attraction was supposed to be a sweet jet ski race course that went all the way around the park. It took a long time to make. Food, drink, souvenirs, an observation tower and a few little rides for casual enjoyment. Everything you would expect at such a place. Opening day. People begin flooding in to Adventureland Amusement. They buy the crap, they go on the bumper cars, and the trampolines, and the ferris wheel. But... but the jet ski course... remains untouched. It's open, it's perfect, nothing is wrong with the entrance. Nobody wants to go on jet skis. Nobody. The Tycoon god becomes angered, and creates an island prison for the people that complain about being hungry and thirsty when they are standing in the food court. My profits go up still, but I lose my awards little by little, and then I lose my dignity as a park manager.10/10 would spend hours on a park only to have it suck again!			"

												This game is great. It involves strategy and creativity, and it has a sandbox mode as well. There are a variety of campaigns that you can play. The other RCT games were good, but this one is just as good if not better. Its a little more challenging, but you have a lot more options to choose from, such as the fireworks display and water/wild rides. You can also use the camera mode to view the ride in first person.

												This game is pretty atrocious.  As a HUGE fan of the original Roller Coaster Tycoon, I figured that RCT3 would be even better!  Turns out that I was terribly wrong.  I played this game for a total of 10 minutes, in which it was way too complicated to do anything, and then I just quit and played the original instead.  Terrible layout, and terrible game.			"

												I'm amazed they never made a sequel to this. This is by far the most in depth theme park construction kit ever. It gives you the option of using easy prebuilt rides and scenery if you only feel like moving forward in the Career mode, but it also allows you to use an insane amount of custom tools and options if you feel like adding a quick flair to something or even if you want to build something special and unique from the ground up. The sandbox mode let's you experiment with or without restraint to that end.The atmosphere in this game needs to be seen and heard to be understood, it's a work of gesamtkunstwerk. Everything in this game is unified into that mode of play that only a day at a theme park seems to have, whether that's in the middle of summer without a cloud in the sky or in the middle of October when it drizzles often and every theme park brings out it's vampire costumes and spider webs. The music is especially expressive of this theme.If that's not enough, RCT 3: Platinum gives you the option to use music and pictures from your own library to use seamlessly in the park! If you just want to play a light-hearted tycoon game it's in there, if you want to spend time building a roller coaster that weaves in and out of a pirate ship while it's under attack by another pirate ship that also has a syncronized seperate roller coaster in it that uses a unique soundtrack and an accompanying fireworks display, it's also in there with tutorials. Be careful though, after a while of the former you might find yourself getting sucked into the latter.			"

												This is my alltime favorite rollercoaster builder. There's a tutorial to learn, sandboxmode and a campaign. Graphics are outdated but who cares. Its all about the gameplay and this game brings out the best thinkable gameplay for building a rollercoaster park combined with soaked attractions and wildlife attractions. Pros:- Freedom to build your own coasters or swimming paradise how you want it.- Graphics are from 2006 and most computers can run this game.- This Ultimate versoin contains RT3 + Soaked + Wildlife = a lot of value for a low priceCons:- The guided tutorials are semi guided and the interaction between the steps and the actions you perform are not all automated like we see in games that are more recent.- Graphics feel outdated compared to what's out on the marketI highly recommend this game if you are into themeparks and such. It's still a lot better then newer games that have better graphics but a whole different approach on gameplay and the lack of freedom to build things the way you want. "

												This is one of my favorite games of all time! After completing everything in the game I assure you it's definitely satisfying. RollerCoaster Tycoon fans seem to maybe not like this game but there are settings to please those players back in the early 00s. The game excels in pretty much every aspect such as improved objective structure, VIPs, Peep Editors, and Coasters such as the Splitting coaster and Tilt coaster (Check those out). There's also now a sandbox mode so you can truly do whatever the hell you want. People are scared of bears.			"

												This game is older, yet still meets the basic requirement of a -Tycoon game: giving you an inkling of the stress, turmoil, and sense of achievement that comes from running a theme park. Part of the enjoyment is what this game can teach you about an amusement park's economy. In other words, you'll want to have the midway full of cheap games, T-shirt sellers, and ferris wheels because they actually make you the money you'll need to build the thrill-providing roller coaster of your greatest nightmares.Or, if you like, play in sandbox mode and just make roller coasters.

												Simply put an awesome game. If you are into designing parks and rollercoasters this is the game for you. If you do not mind a clunkier interface I also recommend the earlier iterations of this series. It is an old game so you have to change resolution in a text file under the %appdata% Atari folder. 1920x1200 and 1920x1080 works just fine.I have played the campaign on an i7  win7 computer and have had no performance issues. Although I have had some slow down issues on older computers (disc, non steam version) when designing larger parks. Still, it's always been playable and fun, for me, for the past 10 years.			"

												This is a fantasic game with a plethora of features and building potential. There are two main gmae types available to play:Mission scenarios in which you are given objectives to complete by expanding a basic pre-made park.Sandbox mode in which you have infinite money and can build however you want. You are able to construct: roller coasters, pool complexes, zoos and more.I personally spend most of my time on the sandbox mode, as I particulary enjoy the creative aspects of the game.The graphics may be slightly 'outdated' by comparison to newer games - but to be honest I don't care.I would definitely reccomend this game.

												This game is very underestimated. For a game where you can pretty much customise everything apart from size of the map, this is a very good game. Whatever type of park you want to create; Rollercoasters, Water Parks or Zoos. RCT3 has it for you, on a plate, with no effort required.To spice things up a bit, you are also able to download custom scenery from websites to immerse yourself into a more realistic world by creating action sequences and events along side rides or coordinated when the train passes a certain part of the track.I could go on for days, writing about this game, yes it's a little expensive for its age but in the sales..

												I love this game. At least from what i've seen from it. being able to build a large scale amusement park to your PC's limit is something I have been looking for, for a long time. Yet this old-ish game absolutely hates my computer. My PC can play this game at 300 fps easy but as soon as my mouse moves my fps drops to around 3 fps or lower. This bug is extremely game breaking and i've looked everywhere for a fix for this, can't find one.I would reccomend this game to someone who likes to gamble because from what i've heard depending on your specs this game may not even function at all.

												So yeah, Roller Coaster Tycoon. What can you even say about it really? It's a classic game series that pretty much boosted tycoon games (Other than Sim City) to more heights. So with the passage of time, Infograms we're bought out by atari and the original creator, Chris Sawyer, not working on it anymore, Atari tried to make there own RCT game; and this is how Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 came to be known as... an okay game.So I guess I have to say the pros and cons about it, soooooooooooooooooooooo...The game is now in 3D, and it works pretty well. The only real problem is trying to turn the camera up and down trying to find the perfect angle; It just resets and goes back to a semi top down perspective. The main focus of the game is that you can RIDE the RIDES, and you can kinda ride the rides, but not in the people or ""peep's"" point of view. Instead It's on the cart's point of view. Because the rides have feelings too you know. The gameplay is you're tipical tycoon game. But don't go building your rollercoaster of death and spooky scary skeletons, you see this game has an antagonist. The Park Inspector. He hate's everything fun and will make you throw out your anger on the keyboard. You're roller coaster is a little bit unsafe? SHUT IT DOWN! Water slide landing in the wrong pool? SHUT IT DOWN! He really makes the game less fun and you can't take him out. Also, you can't kill people in the game. I guess it makes the game more casualized since there's no worry of screwing up your coaster. Oh and one more thing to add. The zoo expansion is just Zoo Tycoon so just ask someone how Zoo Tycoon plays and that's RCT 3's Zoo expansion in a nutshell. The Water expansion just adds pools which don't really need an explanation. Same with Water Slides.So yeah, It's an okay game but not as good as the other games in the series. Really, if it was it's own game without the RCT game I think I would have liked it more, not to say It's a bad game. But with the price, I don't recommend it. Wait for a sale to get it, trust me you'll thank me later.			"

												A very fun and classic roller coaster and theme park simualtion game. I was a fan of the original rollercoaster tycoon games and I highly recommend them and this one, BUT only if you don't mind playing a great game with dated graphics. For many the graphics will be a major put off. If you can get past that then you will truely enjoy this great simulation game.			"

												A solid addition to a stellar series with a nice upgrade to 3D graphics. I would strongly suggest getting all the expansions as they add a lot of content. I find it hard to do most maps without a pool or monkey viewing venue. Being able to tweak and tune your park, the shops, and especially the rides is great. A good amount of information is presented to keep the player in control. Tons of variety in the rides, shops, and coasters. Very enjoyable!Criticisms:- It could use more feedback as to why people like a shop/ride/area or not. Generally putting stuff next to a ride will bump the excitement a few hundredths of a point. It would've been nice if there were more influential like having a bunch of creepy/scary rides feed off each other and the spooky themed scenery.- The missions have no time limit, so there's no urgency or really any posibility of failure (unless you totally suck and go deep in debt). Just run something for long enough, and you'll probably win. I usually take several hours for each scenario. If I cared more or had a reason to be more urgent, I could probably squeeze them out faster.- Building anything underground is awkward. You can make the scenery, ground, and other rides transparent or invisible, but it's still difficult to make it do what you want underground.- Even the most thrilling super ride seems to lose interest too soon. Most of the time, 99% of my patrons wander around the park. At least they get thirsty/hungry and buy my overpriced food.- Speaking of food, I've always had to jack up the price every time I place a new shop down. I don't know why they just don't start the prices near where they're supposed to be.			"

												I'm a huge fan of the whole 'Tycoon' genre of games, and RollerCoaster takes the cake, ever since I bought it from a charity shop a few years ago. The Platinum edition basically includes both the expansion packs, one of which was the Totally Wild (Zoo Tycoon is another one of my favourites, and this is essentially a simplified version added on) so when I saw it on sale I jumped at it.The game is very nicely balanced, you can continue building and never get bored just waiting for money to roll in (a common problem I find with these kinds of games) but only if you pace your spending. The customizations are fantastic, on the rides alone you can customize the colours, music played, queues, prices, capacity and, of course, the rides themselves, admittedly to the point of being overwhelming but that's because I'm a perfectionist who MUST RENAME EVERYTHING. Plus, even with my outdated, crabby computer it works exceptionally well - I have a park full to the brim with lights, moving rides and peeps and have only just started to get a bit of lag with 20+ smoke machines.Recommend 100%!

It isn't complicated to play, it has some pretty fun moments, and you can pretty much create the park of your dreams. If you do get bored you can rain terror on your guests by having rollercoasters cars flighing off tracks or going straight into the pathways and running over guests. And did I mention you can go on your rides with the fricken in-ride view? All in all this game's awesome.10/10			"

												Ah, RCT3.I hadn't played RCT2 until just a few days ago, and I still have yet to get into RCT1... yet, I've played RCT3 for years, and even own a physical copy of it which refuses to install anymore. But... is it good? Rollercoaster Tycoon, if you couldn't guess, is a series of strategy games about running theme parks, managing the money your park has, and managing your guests' needs and satisfactions. It sounds so complex, but, in all honesty, it's not compared to the stressful situations in games like XCOM, Civilization, or Starcraft... but, rather...it's a more calming type of strategy game... although, maybe this is because I always screw around in the sandbox mode.But, does this mean it's perfect? No. If you're a/an elitist/purist dumbo who likes to suck the fun out of things meant not to be held but your stupidly high standards, chances are, you've already crapped on this game... but, if you're a newcomer who wants an honest answer, here you go. Having just recently played RCT2, I can see allot of differences. First off, this game is in 3D! This doesn't bother me, because the forced 2D isometric perspective of it's predicessor's leave at bit to the imagination... plus of which, there was no rotation method, which kinda sucks for an isometric game. RCT3 also allows for custom music, a new sandbox mode that doesn't take 30 minutes to set up, and and more things in the options menu. However, most of these pluses come at a cost. First off, not everybody likes the controls... personally, I think they're okay, but some people think they're a bit stiff. Secondly, the sandbox mode is actually quite limited. Part of taking 30 minutes or-so to set up a sandbox mode in the first place was adding 125+ of hundreds of stalls, coasters, and stands... and, speaking of those things, comparitively, this game has less of those than RCT2. Custom music is okay, but, you have to tick an option first, which is a nitpick more than anything else. Also, you can't kill park guests with destructive coasters anymore, which kind of defeats the purpose of that 'death park' you've had in mind.But, for all of the flaws (most of which I'm too lazy to name), I always loved the charm of RCT3. I love the way birds instantly lose all their feathers when you click on them, I love the way guests get all scared when you spy on them. Also, I love having little Johnny spend an entire year riding 'Get In Line: The Ride', then commenting on how cool it was (true story, btw).			"

Since my pc(with my CD drive) is broken, I saw it was half off on steam. So, I went and bought it. So I could play it on my tablet. Ive been building parks since 2007. I love this game. If you have 4GB RAM+, the game probably wont lag at all. 3GB and below, the more guests and rides moving, the laggier it gets. If you love building big things, or control a park. GET THIS GAME. Just GET THE GAME! Many hours of fun and enjoyment. All you need is good stress relieving tips(If you're not able to wait) and a good PC!			"

												So I've put about as many hours in to this this time round as I put in to the first Witcher. RCT3 is a true classic and a must-buy with the Soaked and Wild expansions. I've now 100% in all 3 areas and can now resume the rest of my boring, dull and mundane life.			"

												RCT 3 is a major step forward in the RCT franchise and adds so much more to the game that it would be very hard to be bored with this game. Being able to now ride the rides was a much needed necessity and added so much depth to the game itself. The larger park size was enough to create any playground of fun without running out of room for expansion. Bringing forward most of the features that were in the previous title, it still feels very much like and has the touch of a RCT game.Now with that said, it does have some drawbacks. The cartoonish peeps are just not as vibrant as the little peeps in RCT2. The peep interaction in RCT 2 feels more fun and vibrating. Building roller coasters in RCT 2 felt more fun and puzzling. That's not to say that RCT 3 coasters were dull, because they weren't. they just lacked the circus fun that RCT 2 had. Creating buildings in RCT 3 had more options and became easier and felt more real. Adding billboards added to the realism of real life parks and made a major difference in aesthetic pleasure. Being able to create your own fireworks show with the Mixmaster was a major step forward and added an extra layer to building a awesome park and helped bring the park alive, something that RCT 2, at times, lacked.The water and animal expansion packs helped bring the game to full circle, allowing versatility in building any kind of theme park that you could imagine. Being able to create pools was another needed must have that the game deserved and gave the ability to choose what kind of Theme Park you wanted to create from an animal park to just a water park to a coaster haven. RCT 3 is a complete game with three games wrapped into one.  There is no question that Frontier Developments brought the series to a new level which gave you the option to never get bored with game. Hours on end, there is no question that RCT 3 is a winner is all aspects and changed the series forever upping the ante on how future versions would be crafted and created. 5 stars out of 5 stars. Highly recommended for die-hard fans of the series.			"

												I never played RollerCoaster Tycoon before, so for me the nostalgia part doesn't quite exists.What I can tell about this game is that it is SUPER fun... If you are a begginer like me you should play at some of the tutorials, they will teach you how to control your Amusement park, while showing you the cool features of the game.The Sandbox mode, is a good place to practice your RollerCoaster building skills as well as Ground Shaping skills. (Also you may compare it with the ""MOTHERLOAD"" code in Sims, which gives you a LOT of money)The Campaign mode, is another type of challenge where you need build certain building and stand up to some standarts whileas keeping inside a budget.There are also more different modes that help you understand more of the game, or just build crazy machines and laser shows for future needs.I really recomend it, especially if you are a fan of making people sick on ride, by building a rollercoaster drop from 50 meters!

												I started playing Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 in 2008, and I have never gotten bored of it. Their are tons of coaster designs that you can choose from as well as any other rides. I have never gotten bored with this game, and most likely never will get bored with it. I think it is really amazing how you can design whatever you want. The possiblities go on and on. From death parks, go karts into the lake, water slides of doom, trapping the park inspector in a bottomless pit, making a great ride, and making a great park, this ride is definately worth the money, and definately the type of game for rollercoaster enthusiasts, or anyone creative in general.

												I searched my bank account looking for the 89 Million I'd need to build my dream rollercoaster- namely one that ascends 500 feet followed by a 90 degree drop into an unfinished section that dumps the coaster onto a walkway where my meandering park guests walk back and forth.  Then it hit me- I could have my dream for the price of a few McDonald's value meals and not worry about the real life death and destruction my idea would cause (plus I couldn't find the 89m)!  This game is so fun even if it is over half a decade old.  I wish they'd come out with the updated version already!  But if you are a builder and looking for a great deal on a fun game then just go for it! You'll love RCT3 Platinum.			"

Although the graphics are bad and the AI system is not really like life, I still recommend this game because you can do ANYTHING. Think of every ride at Disney parks, all of them you can do. All I ask for Atari is for them to improve the graphics of the overall whole game. This game is awesome and i totally recommend it.(P.s: Try to kill the park inspector, all he does is give you remarks!)			"

												Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 Platinum works perfectly under Windows 10.Under Windows 7 the game locks up at 67% when trying to enter any game mode.The windows site maintains the game is compatible with windows 7, but there are literally thousands of posts from users having the same problem as myself.  Compatibility mode does not work.  There are no working fixes or patches.The STEAM version of this game however works perfectly under Windows 10.There are three modes to play, Tutorial, Scenario/challenge and Sandbox.The game sounds and plays just like it did when it came out, but new resolutions have been added to accommodate HD wide screen monitors.It is so good to have an old favourite back up and running under Windows 10!  Not sure if I need to thank Microsoft or Atari for this ... but great job guys you have made at least one person really happy!!!11/10 will remove a piece of track from the rollercoaster again :)			"

												Takes me back to the good ol' days– I'm addicted. The game is slightly glitchy on OSX; occasionally I get a graphics glitch where flashing squares start appearing on the screen, but it's still playable while this is occurring and restarting it will cure the problem. I seem to get this same glitch with all EA games and I believe it's an optimization problem since EA is fairly new to the Mac world. CoasterCam is probably my favourite feature that distinguishes it from its predecessor of my childhood. Frickin awesome game. 9.5/10			"

Since my pc(with my CD drive) is broken, I saw it was half off on steam. So, I went and bought it. So I could play it on my tablet. Ive been building parks since 2007. I love this game. If you have 4GB RAM+, the game probably wont lag at all. 3GB and below, the more guests and rides moving, the laggier it gets. If you love building big things, or control a park. GET THIS GAME. Just GET THE GAME! Many hours of fun and enjoyment. All you need is good stress relieving tips(If you're not able to wait) and a good PC!			"

												Have you ever dreamed of owning a theme park? Me neither. Or so I thought, browsing through my father's games as a kid.I was wrong. Boy, I was wrong.This game has the three Cs of a good sandbox - Challenge, Content, and Creativity. Design your own parks or play Scenarios and help their premade parks rise to the top. Build coasters, flat rides, shops, paths, terrain, zoos, pools, and a surprisingly huge amount of other theme park essentials. Hire staff, manage prices, and attract guests to your park.Alternatively, you can build rides that launch carts into crowds of people, or unleash wild predators into your park to watch as your patrons run around screaming for their lives.The developer of this game, Frontier, created a masterpiece worthy of me buying again on Steam solely for the convenience of having it digitally.This is one of the best games ever made, hands down.

And by changing the name of one of your peeps to Jonny Watts, you can view your park through that peep's eyes, which allows you to see your park truly come alive. VIPeep challenges are really fun as you have to cater to celebrity guests. It essentially takes everything you love about RCT 1 and 2 and adds a 3D element to it.			"

												I played the first one , second one , and third one . I think the third oen was best and next the first one and lastly, second one.  The new rollercoaster cam is good as long as you dont look at other people (The people in this game looks weired) The graphic other than the peeps , are not great but fair enough . Just dont expect too much .The new stuff like firework and laser show seems really intriging but personally it was too hard to make one. The game also retains most of fun that present on previous one. Building rollercoaster , menaging the park , or else .The co op or multiplayer would be great but it doesnt have one. 8.5 / 10 good game if you loved the first game. and if you havent played other rollercoaster game it is worth give it a try unless you really dont like the simulation  / sandbox games.

												RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 is a really great games in which you can create, manage and evolve a Themepark. You can create a multitude of things in which is too much for me to write.The gameplay is very simple and is fun to use, the creation is really diverse in which you can create a vast many of things either in different themes or a jumble of all of them, you can also go into a camera mode to see and ride the rides you make. You can see your custom made rollercoaster and have a thrill ride around. I don't really have much to say because there is alot of things you can do in this game but the main thing is. It's very fun.			"

												Ah, RCT3.I hadn't played RCT2 until just a few days ago, and I still have yet to get into RCT1... yet, I've played RCT3 for years, and even own a physical copy of it which refuses to install anymore. But... is it good? Rollercoaster Tycoon, if you couldn't guess, is a series of strategy games about running theme parks, managing the money your park has, and managing your guests' needs and satisfactions. It sounds so complex, but, in all honesty, it's not compared to the stressful situations in games like XCOM, Civilization, or Starcraft... but, rather...it's a more calming type of strategy game... although, maybe this is because I always screw around in the sandbox mode.But, does this mean it's perfect? No. If you're a/an elitist/purist dumbo who likes to suck the fun out of things meant not to be held but your stupidly high standards, chances are, you've already crapped on this game... but, if you're a newcomer who wants an honest answer, here you go. Having just recently played RCT2, I can see allot of differences. First off, this game is in 3D! This doesn't bother me, because the forced 2D isometric perspective of it's predicessor's leave at bit to the imagination... plus of which, there was no rotation method, which kinda sucks for an isometric game. RCT3 also allows for custom music, a new sandbox mode that doesn't take 30 minutes to set up, and and more things in the options menu. However, most of these pluses come at a cost. First off, not everybody likes the controls... personally, I think they're okay, but some people think they're a bit stiff. Secondly, the sandbox mode is actually quite limited. Part of taking 30 minutes or-so to set up a sandbox mode in the first place was adding 125+ of hundreds of stalls, coasters, and stands... and, speaking of those things, comparitively, this game has less of those than RCT2. Custom music is okay, but, you have to tick an option first, which is a nitpick more than anything else. Also, you can't kill park guests with destructive coasters anymore, which kind of defeats the purpose of that 'death park' you've had in mind.But, for all of the flaws (most of which I'm too lazy to name), I always loved the charm of RCT3. I love the way birds instantly lose all their feathers when you click on them, I love the way guests get all scared when you spy on them. Also, I love having little Johnny spend an entire year riding 'Get In Line: The Ride', then commenting on how cool it was (true story, btw).			"

												This game can blow anyone's mind. You can build so many different types of parks and still not have sufficiently run out of ideas to create more. It's amazing. And this Platinium edition includes the Soaked and Wild Life expansions, which are fantastic. Available animals and monuments are outnumbered, you can design rails and tracks as you want or select a pre-built building and then enjoy the ride thanks to the special camera that lets you see through the eyes of one of the peeps who's on the ride. Here even imagination is barely a limit to creation. You even have dinosaurs. Make movies, have fun, explore, dream, Increase the entrance fees of the pool even if it sounds excessively expensive. Treat peeps the way you want. Manage your staff, give orders, hire, fire, give training, increase or reduce their wage. Get the best rates from your guests. Achieve the goals to become a rollercoaster tycoon, or have fun unleashing dangerous wild animals among the crowd. Warning: crushing peeps with vehicules getting out of their tracks won't kill them.10/10: HF			"

												After 20 hours its time for a reviewThis game right off the bat feels nostalgic. I never had the expansions so this is great. The start menu is a bit bland, just un-appealing photos but that doesnt matter.I got into the game and I instantley decided to make a wild west park, after hours of work I had my base park down a coaster and some carnival rides and I was hooked like I used to be. I decided to download some maps and they are great. Some cons are the fact that some coasters are odd to build, an example is on the tilt coaster on one of the special pieces instead of slowing down it keeps moving and crashes. Overall I see no reason not to buy this.Pros-Once you make 1 or 2 good coasters its easy to get the hang of it-Fun to play for hours on end-First person coasters-Great enviornment-Tons of carnival rides, coaster types and food stalls make it different each time you playCons-Like I mentioned some small problems with coasters but nothing major as it can be fixedFinal Grade9.5/10 Great with tiny issues			"

												I grew up playing RTC games, Loved playing them all. RTC3 is probably my favourite. Building your very own theme park based on selective themes such as; Horror, Fantasy, or Western just makes it all the fun rather than having a generic theme park. A good sandbox game for those who enjoy playing games with no limits, or just enjoy building and creating stuff. There is also campaign mode which I love as well. Having to complete certain things for a pre-made theme park, adding rides etc to it. This is game is for everyone and I reccommend this game.			"

												This has always been a personal favorite of mine. I first received the game as a disc a while back and I was devistated when my laptop was dropped with the disc inside. I never found time to go off and buy it again it was never i stores when I actually remembered to go look either. I finally found it on steam and I was so excited.The amount of customization for each ride is great. Everything from color to complete rollercoaster designs. Pricing the food is always fun as well. Making coasters fly off the tracks is a great way to pass the time If I dont feel like making a serious park. This will forever be one of my favorite games. I remember the first time I began playing and the rollercoaster did a loop on my scream I could only smile. The same look I had when I opened now after finding it again.			"

												One of the worst - no wait - the worst installment of the Roller Coaster Tycoon franchise. If you played the original, first version from 1999 and valued it for its simple yet multifaceted gameplay then this game will badly crush your dreams. Ugly as hell 3D graphics - even for 2005 standards - and an interface so clumsy that you can destroy a painstakingly constructed rollercoaster with just one click. It wasn't developed by Chris Sawyer directly anymore like its predecessors. It was said that he had just taken a consulting position. Obviously that either didn't help or they didn't really consult him at all.If you're thinking about buying this in a Steam sale (like I did), save yourself the money and buy and awesome indie game instead.

												For those who relish in nostalgia, or for those just coming across it, Roller Coaster Tycoon is the quintessential tycoon game. The third installment in the series far surpasses the second, but is almost a different breed than the first. Not to argue that it isn't an improvement, simply that the two games seem to offer quite a unique playing style while both being part of the same franchise. The ability to ride coasters in a first-person view, is a welcome addition in this version of the game. The fireworks mixmaster disply is decent enough, however there seems to be some lacking instructional material that covers the laser light show side of the same rig. Nevertheless, Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 is a very solid purchase and a classic addition to any game library. Four stars.			"

												I remember playing the first Rollercoaster Tycoon as a kid with my sister. Good old nostalgia tempted me into buying this when it was on sale one day, and I've never regretted the decision. RollerCoaster Tycoon is a simple game with a simple objective: you build a theme park. While you can play the campaign and aim for creating a profitable park and meet certain objectives, you can also opt to play the sandbox mode instead. Aside from the sandbox mode, there is also the scenario builder. You can create your own perameters for how you want to play the game. Do you want certain weather or infinite money? Go for it. RollerCoaster Tycoon might be on the older side, but it is certainly a game that can be enjoyed by any age.			"

												RCT3 is potentially one of my favorite games. I've been a roller coaster lover since I was a kid, so maybe it's that.The game has multiple scenarios you can play through, or mess around in a sandbox or custom scenario. There is no store where you can buy things with real money, everything is in the game. Another plus is this is platinum edition, so you get access to the Wild expandsion pack and the Soaked expansion pack, both adding quite a few things to the game.Of course, you can construct any roller coaster you would like for your park, or select a premade one. You can also save your coasters to use in a different game, or perhaps even a RCT4.The graphics are fairly well, being a decade old game, except the people in the game have blocky faces, though this can be quite funny.The finance system is extremely designed. You have to hire janitors and mechanics, and you have to pay them a salary. Shops and rollercoasters cost money to run, so you need to make sure that the amount of money they are pulling in from the people outweighs the running cost, otherwise you will go into debt. You can also run ad campains to advertise your park and have people come visit. These include coupons for specific rides, a get in free coupon, or just a plain advertisement. Of course, these cost money, just like they would in real life, so you can't spend all your savings on ad campains.Overall an extremely fun game which has a good finance system and if you love roller coasters, you will love this game to death.9.5/10did i mention you can ride your coasters?

You can spend hours and hours designing and beautifying your park or creating tounge-in-cheek rides synched to your favourite(or not) tunes. The terrain tools, building options, and general openess allows the player a lot of freedom to play however they want to, even beyond the confines of 'amusement park simulator'.I build racetracks out of paths and run over my guests with the dune buggy.10/10 who needs NASCAR			"

												This game is so fantastic! The original RollerCoaster Tycoon was the game that got me into both video games as a whole and simulation management games. I remember buying RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 a few days after it released. I decided to get the Platinum version on Steam, when it went on sale, since I never bothered to pick up the expansions. This game has held up wonderfully. I havn't even made it to the expansion campaigns yet I'm addicted to just finishing the original. I have a large amount of nostalgia fueling my opinion but I still must recommend this game to anyone who likes simulation management.			"

												Disregarding its age, RCT3 is still extremely fun and will last you hours of entertainment. You have control over making your own amusement park, riding your own rides, and you could also build a death park, whichever you prefer. It's a simple idea, but it is much more addicting than it seems.			"

												This game is very underestimated. For a game where you can pretty much customise everything apart from size of the map, this is a very good game. Whatever type of park you want to create; Rollercoasters, Water Parks or Zoos. RCT3 has it for you, on a plate, with no effort required.To spice things up a bit, you are also able to download custom scenery from websites to immerse yourself into a more realistic world by creating action sequences and events along side rides or coordinated when the train passes a certain part of the track.I could go on for days, writing about this game, yes it's a little expensive for its age but in the sales.. Get it. You won't regret it.			"

												I never played RollerCoaster Tycoon before, so for me the nostalgia part doesn't quite exists.What I can tell about this game is that it is SUPER fun... If you are a begginer like me you should play at some of the tutorials, they will teach you how to control your Amusement park, while showing you the cool features of the game.The Sandbox mode, is a good place to practice your RollerCoaster building skills as well as Ground Shaping skills. (Also you may compare it with the ""MOTHERLOAD"" code in Sims, which gives you a LOT of money)The Campaign mode, is another type of challenge where you need build certain building and stand up to some standarts whileas keeping inside a budget.There are also more different modes that help you understand more of the game, or just build crazy machines and laser shows for future needs.I really recomend it, especially if you are a fan of making people sick on ride, by building a rollercoaster drop from 50 meters!

												Stick to RCT and RCT2. Do not get this game, unless A) you enjoy the challenge of having to force the game to do what you want it to do and then having it not tell you why you can't put a path or queue the angle or where you want (rides/shops can't even auto-destroy fence put there by the game) or B) you've never played a RCT title in which case go out and pick up a copy of RCT2 deluxe edition.I want to play this game, but it just doesn't want me to have fun.

												Before buying this game on steam, I probably previously had at least 200 hours in this game on GOLD version, and with the addition of WILD I figured why not might as well buy it on steam too.If you like building rollercosters, or theme parks in general this is the game for you, rides and attractions ranging from moter watercycles, rollercosters, swimming pools, and animal viewing.You can play the default senarios, play in sandbox, or even make your own senario and share it with others to play/play someone else's custom senario.It doesn't have the best graphics but it's still a great game to have, and even better game to have if you're a person like me who doesn't care much about graphics.

												I searched my bank account looking for the 89 Million I'd need to build my dream rollercoaster- namely one that ascends 500 feet followed by a 90 degree drop into an unfinished section that dumps the coaster onto a walkway where my meandering park guests walk back and forth.  Then it hit me- I could have my dream for the price of a few McDonald's value meals and not worry about the real life death and destruction my idea would cause (plus I couldn't find the 89m)!  This game is so fun even if it is over half a decade old.  I wish they'd come out with the updated version already!  But if you are a builder and looking for a great deal on a fun game then just go for it! You'll love RCT3 Platinum.			"

												I had a lot of fun with this game. There's plenty of options to suit the player and you can always download custom scenery and other stuff if you need to. For me, I played the career mode and kept playing the first area until I realized you can just create a custom scenario that works like sandbox but with limited money. That's what I mainly wanted out of this game and once I found that out, I was hooked even more than I already was.There's plenty of rides, stalls, buildings, attractions, etc. to either go all out or keep a specific theme going especially since this comes with the 2 expansions for the game. You can also build your own rollercoasters (hence the title of the game) in any way shape or form that you want. You can even make one that just suddenly ends and inevitably ""kills"" people. This I believe also applies to waterslides, dune buggy tracks, and a bunch of other neat things. It's really fun to see what you can do with your park, what you can add, and figure out how you're gonna increase your profits.			"

It seemed like they added a lot of cool features from what I initially saw but they sacrificed interface quality for a more gimmicky feeling game.

												Rollercoaster Tycoon...a huge part of my childhood. I love these games. There's something about slowly building up your park from a cute little amusement park to a giant attention-grabbing attraction. The game progresses at the pace you play it, so you can race to become the most well-known park in the area, or you can slowly but surely increase your park's size until you're happy with it. One of the main parts of the RCT games is the ability to design your own roller coasters. Not a lot has changed with that mechanic since the first game, but there have been improvements. One of the most memorable improvements to the games is that now, in this game, you can ride the coasters you build. This adds the extremely satisfying ability to virtually test every coaster you make, which makes crafting your own coasters even more rewarding. This game also allows you to customize some of the peeps (customers) that visit your park. This is actually a pretty cool addition to the series, as it adds that nice little feeling you get when you recognize a familiar peep walking around in your park. All in all, if you're not into managing simulation games, even when they're simplified, you might want to skip over this game. On the other hand, if you're looking for a fun game that will eat up your hours like a toddler eats cotton candy, or even want to try a new managing sim, then I highly recommend this title.			"

												RCT3, although a bit buggy, is a great park simulator game. It is very easy to pick up (and has tutorials for newcomers), and the Sandbox mode allows you to create large, expansive parks.Positives:-3D Graphics are great-Custom Music-Fun scenarios-Unlimited creation (I created an underground park, indoor park, and have seen creations such as cruise ships and cities)-Coaster cam is funNegatives:-A bit buggy-Runs slow on large parks (runs a lot better on Steam than from disk)-Limited scenery options-Unrealistic supports/scenery (download a scenery set of supports for more realism)-Lack of gentle ridesAlso note that I have many more than 12 hours on this game, as I originally purchased this game on release day, as well as its expansions, before purchasing it on Steam years later.

												A game that many of the more recent rollercoaster games try to live up to.Make your own rollercoaster, unlock already made coasters through completing challenges in career mode. A well crafted game that makes you think about many aspects of owning a theme park but at the same time lets you go mad with your own designs and themes to make the park your own.Play in sandbox and just go CRAAAZZZYY making outlandish rollercoasters that you could never see being made in real life or save them so you can use them again in your campains. A brilliant game definately worth a buy especially on the cheap. You will have hours of fun. I loved it at the start and still love it now.			"

												A lot of people tend to hate this version of RCT simply because RCT2 exists and the move to 3D maybe hurt the series a bit. However, most of the functionality of RCT1+2 still exist in this, but with some improvements to quite a few aspects (such as proper pathing for park guests and allowing construction while the rest of the park is paused).The scenarios in 3 are pretty simple, with most second objectives being to pay off the loan. While the scenarios aren't really challenging most of the time, a lot of them are still fun. If you are the kind that just likes to build a theme park, Sandbox Mode exists for you to toy around with whatever designs you want.The only thing that really suffers is terrain modifying, since modifying smooth hills can be a major pain to construct anything on top of. However, everything else is pretty solid, and Platinum adds in a ton of content.Certainly worth picking up.			"

												This game is older, yet still meets the basic requirement of a -Tycoon game: giving you an inkling of the stress, turmoil, and sense of achievement that comes from running a theme park. Part of the enjoyment is what this game can teach you about an amusement park's economy. In other words, you'll want to have the midway full of cheap games, T-shirt sellers, and ferris wheels because they actually make you the money you'll need to build the thrill-providing roller coaster of your greatest nightmares.Or, if you like, play in sandbox mode and just make roller coasters.

RCT2 was my first intoduction into the world of RCT, and I remember how blown away I was when RCT3 was announced with 3d graphics. 10 year old me was really wowed by the ability to ride your rides. Over the next few years after it's initial release, it added so much awesome content with the ability to build water parks as well as create your own safari. I had fun equally playing career mode taking on many challenges, then playing sandbox mode with an unlimited budget, allowing myself to build what I wanted to build. Also, if you get this game, don't forget to check out the loads of custom content put out by the awesome RCT community.			"

												This game is older, yet still meets the basic requirement of a -Tycoon game: giving you an inkling of the stress, turmoil, and sense of achievement that comes from running a theme park. Part of the enjoyment is what this game can teach you about an amusement park's economy. In other words, you'll want to have the midway full of cheap games, T-shirt sellers, and ferris wheels because they actually make you the money you'll need to build the thrill-providing roller coaster of your greatest nightmares.Or, if you like, play in sandbox mode and just make roller coasters.

												Since buying this game last week I have forgotten about my friends, girlfriend and family. I find this so addicting, even more than when it first came out 8 years ago. I refuse to go out anymore, I get enough sunlight and activity from watching the little peeps run arround and puke after every ride. Graphics are old, music is repetitive, but the gameplay is great and posibilities in creating an inferno for your guests are infinite. What more could anyone ask for?10/10 would become a loner again.			"

												I'm so glad I bought this game! This game lets you create your very own theme park and rides to your heart's content. I love being able to ""ride"" the rides and see what attractions my guests like and not like. It might seem a little tedious and boring starting out but once you get used to it, it's very fun! And with two expansion packs included, the fun just gets better. I like including animal exhibits and building water rides for my pool section. Building roller coasters are the best, I usually make mine insane but I do make gentle rides for those who can't take the speed and loops! I would recommend this game to everyone :)			"

												I never played RollerCoaster Tycoon before, so for me the nostalgia part doesn't quite exists.What I can tell about this game is that it is SUPER fun... If you are a begginer like me you should play at some of the tutorials, they will teach you how to control your Amusement park, while showing you the cool features of the game.The Sandbox mode, is a good place to practice your RollerCoaster building skills as well as Ground Shaping skills. (Also you may compare it with the ""MOTHERLOAD"" code in Sims, which gives you a LOT of money)The Campaign mode, is another type of challenge where you need build certain building and stand up to some standarts whileas keeping inside a budget.There are also more different modes that help you understand more of the game, or just build crazy machines and laser shows for future needs.I really recomend it, especially if you are a fan of making people sick on ride, by building a rollercoaster drop from 50 meters!

												RCT 3 is a major step forward in the RCT franchise and adds so much more to the game that it would be very hard to be bored with this game. Being able to now ride the rides was a much needed necessity and added so much depth to the game itself. The larger park size was enough to create any playground of fun without running out of room for expansion. Bringing forward most of the features that were in the previous title, it still feels very much like and has the touch of a RCT game.Now with that said, it does have some drawbacks. The cartoonish peeps are just not as vibrant as the little peeps in RCT2. The peep interaction in RCT 2 feels more fun and vibrating. Building roller coasters in RCT 2 felt more fun and puzzling. That's not to say that RCT 3 coasters were dull, because they weren't. they just lacked the circus fun that RCT 2 had. Creating buildings in RCT 3 had more options and became easier and felt more real. Adding billboards added to the realism of real life parks and made a major difference in aesthetic pleasure. Being able to create your own fireworks show with the Mixmaster was a major step forward and added an extra layer to building a awesome park and helped bring the park alive, something that RCT 2, at times, lacked.The water and animal expansion packs helped bring the game to full circle, allowing versatility in building any kind of theme park that you could imagine. Being able to create pools was another needed must have that the game deserved and gave the ability to choose what kind of Theme Park you wanted to create from an animal park to just a water park to a coaster haven. RCT 3 is a complete game with three games wrapped into one.  There is no question that Frontier Developments brought the series to a new level which gave you the option to never get bored with game. Hours on end, there is no question that RCT 3 is a winner is all aspects and changed the series forever upping the ante on how future versions would be crafted and created. 5 stars out of 5 stars. Highly recommended for die-hard fans of the series.			"

												The camera's a little wonky, terrain manipulation can be fidgety and there's a lot to learn, but designing and running your own amusement park is still some of the best chill-out fun gaming can provide.			"

												Wow just wow there are not enough words to describe how much i love this game, when i play this game i get a warm feeling in my stomach like when i eat oat meal. Every time i play trhis game or even think of i it hurts me how much this game is under rated. When im riding on my dank roller coaster i just get butterflys in my stomache its so realistic. i think that the creaters of this game need to get recognized for the amazing work that they have done. I just cant wait for the next one and thank you my lord for blessing us with such a great game.			"

												Man, another game I bought on Steam because I cant find my CD.Its one of those comfort titles.  I come back to it probebly once a year just thinking ""That was fun, I should build a new park"" and then 20 hours later Im tinkering with a triple racing coaster that loops around a transit system.2006 game that is still better then a lot of things that get released today.

												RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 is a game where you are put into a position of building and managing an amusement park. The amusement park you create can have attractions ranging from concession stands to animal enclosures and pool complexes (and of course, you can build rollercoasters), but the best thing to do is trap your guests (and maybe staff) in a small enclosed area and release large carnivorous animals into the pack of people. Unfortunately, in this installment, you cannot kill your guests or staff, so while I do recommend this game, it might be more worth your while to purchase one of the previous games depending on the mechanics you are interested in.

												A lot of people tend to hate this version of RCT simply because RCT2 exists and the move to 3D maybe hurt the series a bit. However, most of the functionality of RCT1+2 still exist in this, but with some improvements to quite a few aspects (such as proper pathing for park guests and allowing construction while the rest of the park is paused).The scenarios in 3 are pretty simple, with most second objectives being to pay off the loan. While the scenarios aren't really challenging most of the time, a lot of them are still fun. If you are the kind that just likes to build a theme park, Sandbox Mode exists for you to toy around with whatever designs you want.The only thing that really suffers is terrain modifying, since modifying smooth hills can be a major pain to construct anything on top of. However, everything else is pretty solid, and Platinum adds in a ton of content.Certainly worth picking up.			"

												A great sandbox game. Better (In my humble opinion) than RCT 1 and 2. The game by itself is great, and allows you to be as creative as you want, or rush to that milestone as quickly as possible. If you are like me, and find good sandbox games to be a giant time sucking destroyer of relationships/ruiner of financial stability, then your in luck! There is a mode where you can progress to a certain point, and your finished! You can step back, and know your job is done. And then take a 20min nap and get back to your real job.... Anyways-Mods. Thats right, mods.This game REALLY shines if you install mods. Allowing you to create replicas of Disneyland, Cedar point, or a moon base turned amusment park. You can (with some basic 3D modelling knowledge) create your own objects to be put in, or simply download off of the many 'warehouse' custom-scenery websites. If you are like me, you will spend more time searching the web (deeply) for mods then actually playing the game. You will run out of room on your harddrive, and your GPU's VRAM will scream in agony... All optional though. THIS TIME I'll be only getting a few basics and just playing the.... Wait... King's Island all scenery expansion, only 1TB?... *downloads* "

												RCT3; the part that splits the community in half.I'm on the fence with this game.I have to agree, that RCT1 offered more depth compared to this part, but the real 3D and the ability to ride your creations is definately a selling point for me.The controls are a little bit iffy at first, but a quite extensive tutorial shows you what you need to know, beyond that, it's all up to your imagination.You can pick a career mode or just hop into a sandbox and do as you please. Round everything up by having your own music play in the stations of your rides (mp3 only).			"

 RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Platinum REVIEW Hi everyone, welcome to this review. In this review I will cover every single part of the review, so it'll probably be a lengthy one. I have played it much longer but that wasn't the Platinum-edition and not on the Steam-platform. So if it doesn't look like I've played long, it's because of that. Graphics However the graphics aren't that important, it is good to cover these first to get it out of the way.Don't expect much from the graphics. It is a game from 2004 and however there are games from that year that looked much better, this looks fine too. The lights look a bit weird sometimes, so that could've had some improvements. There are some cool textures for the Peeps, but it still feels incomplete with only a couple of hairstyles, two different T-shirts and a pair of jeans. Animations look fine. The best thing I like is the visuals of the CoasterCam. These look really cool.With everything combined I give the graphics a  7.5/10 . Gameplay I think the gameplay is the most important part of the game. It is after all a simulation game.The gameplay is great. The core gameplay is of course building rollercoasters and make sure people don't die when entering them. And that works great. It is simple, but effective. You should buy the expansion packs with it, because they add a lot more features to it. Wild! gives you the opportunity to make your own safaripark, and Soaked! gives you some very cool pools and waterslides. That is why you should buy the Platinum-edition. One of the things I like to do the most, is make a very cool Lion Show, with my own shows. Yes, you can make your own shows by mixing some awesome tricks. You can do that as well with Fireworks and Dolphin Shows.The gameplay is awesome.  9/10  Other stuff There is a lot of other things to do, besides the campaign and sandbox. In the ""Tools"" section, you can make your own families, rollercoasters, shows and scenarios. You should really try this.It is not the most fun thing to do, but you can really use it in your parks, without actually creating them in your parks.  8/10  Final answer Is this game good? Yes, it is.Should you buy it? Yes, you should.The game is really awesome. Here's a quick summary: Graphics: 7.5/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Other stuff: 8/10 So with everything combined, this game gets a: 8.5/10  Thanks for reading this review!  "

												RCT3, although a bit buggy, is a great park simulator game. It is very easy to pick up (and has tutorials for newcomers), and the Sandbox mode allows you to create large, expansive parks.Positives:-3D Graphics are great-Custom Music-Fun scenarios-Unlimited creation (I created an underground park, indoor park, and have seen creations such as cruise ships and cities)-Coaster cam is funNegatives:-A bit buggy-Runs slow on large parks (runs a lot better on Steam than from disk)-Limited scenery options-Unrealistic supports/scenery (download a scenery set of supports for more realism)-Lack of gentle ridesAlso note that I have many more than 12 hours on this game, as I originally purchased this game on release day, as well as its expansions, before purchasing it on Steam years later.

												I'm so glad I bought this game! This game lets you create your very own theme park and rides to your heart's content. I love being able to ""ride"" the rides and see what attractions my guests like and not like. It might seem a little tedious and boring starting out but once you get used to it, it's very fun! And with two expansion packs included, the fun just gets better. I like including animal exhibits and building water rides for my pool section. Building roller coasters are the best, I usually make mine insane but I do make gentle rides for those who can't take the speed and loops! I would recommend this game to everyone :)			"

I refuse to go out anymore, I get enough sunlight and activity from watching the little peeps run arround and puke after every ride. Graphics are old, music is repetitive, but the gameplay is great and posibilities in creating an inferno for your guests are infinite.

												By now, this is an older game and one of the top classics in the genre, so a review is hardly worthwhile. Even so, two things worth noting: This game is definitely worth the price, since it includes all the DLC/Addons. If you can get it on sale, even better. The game has tons of different rides, terrain, coasters, etc. Many things are customizable (coasters especially), but several rides (Ferris Wheel, for example) are static and can't be changed (besides colors).Overall, a ton of fun.

												I do recommend this game, it's very creative and entertaining. It teaches kids what it's like when you own an amusement park. It also shows that it costs tons of money, also I love the different game modes. From, tutorial to sandbox mode they all teach you something great about being somebody in the buisness. Plus, there's jobs that you need to hire people for like  Entertainer. But nothing is free when you're not in SandBox mode. You should also try out tutorial mode because it teaches you how to do all sorts of things in the game with step by step instructions, to make the game as simple as possible and now it two extra expansion packs to improuve your gameplay. And the game features different types of tools to make the game look as realistic as possible. The game performs realisticily by making the guests ""peeps"" do what somebody in real life would do. Thank you for listening and I hope that you invest in to this game just like you would for all the other great games that Steam has to offer to you guys.			"

It is very addictive with fun yet rewarding challenges in the carreer mode, or if creativley building is more your thing there is a creative mode with no money limits and everything unlocked. Great game for any type of play style and has hours of entertainment in the standalone game and its dlc!

												This game is great! I have played the other RCT games and this is by far my favorite.  The scenarios are fun, but you can also create your own custom scenario.  Sandbox mode is fun, however I do wish that they had a random terrain generator.  However, you can just do a custom scenario and create your own terrain. This is especially helpful if you want to start a money park but don't want to spend all of your cash right away on terrain changes.This game is worth checking out!			"

												If you like simple 3D graphics and rollercoasters this title is for you. Your objective is to build a theme park that will gather money and be secessuful, hence why it's called tycoon. It is simple and fun. As an add on Wild and Soaked add more viritity in building coasters in addition to buildonmg a bit of water park and zoo to the game. How ever the Zoo part of it seems a little bit lacking, there is still the apect of owning and treating the animals. Despite it's blocky feel and looks there is too much in this game to give a total bad review.I do agree with most people when saving the peeps in this tycoon are a bit too blocky and cartoonish, but consinderwhen it was released it was good for avage computers to handle. anything less than this game reomends it it forces you to make a rather lengthy purchace. Lenthy, probly not the best word to desribe it, but it'll work, mostly becuase of the high 3D Graphicail demands(not that much for todays machines) you could be out $150-$300, not really that big of puchace for some people other.. meh.For what this game ment to me when I had the orginal copies(still do disk is scratched and beond repair) it ment alot to have the third addtion to the seris becuase it was advanced for the time being. i still have the old tycoons 1 & 2 with wacky worlds, i never got all of the add ons becuase i couldn't find them in stores. This game is just a huge upgrade from both of them, never mind they got rid a few apect(more the nessary ones then the latter ""You Know what I mean."")I aplogies for any mispellings, am am english, i have a hard time sometimes typing and making words  how i would make them sound.

Found out today that there's a Mac version of this game to download so I just had to buy it! Got a bonus of the Soaked and Zoo which I haven't played before. Was skeptical about purchasing after reading many reviews of it not working very well and people not being able to use controls but everything is working well and so so so so fast and the controls are all customisable and everything is exactly the same as it was on my PC.

Although the graphics are not ""up to par"" as it is expected for this generation of graphics, it still works fairly well on Windows 7/8 and quite fluid on non-gaming computers.

I liked how Hersheys and Reese had their own shops.All in All the game was really fun, I especially enjoyed the CoasterCam!!!!!!!!!!			"

I've put more hours into this game than i did any other one. another feature that i love is the ability to change the terrain which adds some atmosphere to the game. water falls over a roller coaster into a cave of darkness... enough said.9.9/10 from me would recommend this game to anybody who loves building coasters and rides, to their hearts contentcant wait for RollerCoaster Tycoon WorldForgot to add there are enclosures for animals to make a zoo and a set of Water park rides			"

												Great game! Always wanting to come back! Recomend to everyone, build things from a huge city to, well a theme park, and from a theme park to a death park. Only one complaint, once your save file reaches over 12 gigs, the file becomes courupted. Be carefull!			"

												NOTE: terrible spelling coming up!has anyone tried a death park?no?try it. beware, you might lose some friends if you don't keep it a secret.it has cutesy graphics, with customisable stalls in the 'wild!' version, which means i can get snazzier stalls. the billboards on the stalls... i put them in a maple park, and they look AWESOME! also, you can make your own content, share it to other people, get new rides to spice up your game... and challenging scenarios. or easy ones.FUN FACT! no matter how hard i try to destroy the people... with a WOODEN MOUSE COASTER... they don't die! and they fall in a pit instead!!! this game is utterly halarious... 100/10 i laugh too hard sometimes.

												I know I'm late to the party but this game is so much fun, never knew I'd enjoy designing roller coasters and theme parks as much. If you enjoyed games like theme hospital theme park back in the days,  then this is for you. So much stuff to explore and create esecially with the expansions. Coater designing takes a bit getting used to learning what gets the excitement up. So much content in this game. Highly reccomend it.			"

												Played this game as a kid for many many hour, absolutely fantastic. Though I have to say I can't really recommend getting any particular Roller Coaster Tycoon game over another, just wait 'till they're on sale and get them all, they're all really good! If you do like the ability to look around in 3D maybe you'll like this better, but I have found myself liking RCT2 better than 3 at times because in 3 the 3D gets complicated for me, vs the isometric view (which to be fair you can enable in RCT3) that allows you to not have to worry about camera angles too much. But on the contrary navigating eveything in 3D is way cool too. I don't know, this is a hard review for me to write, and I can't really say much useful except that if you like any RCT you should like this one too, they're all complimentary to each other. And RCT the original just has this awesome nostalgia with the low res graphics and music that's unforgettable. Just get them all!			"

And by changing the name of one of your peeps to Jonny Watts, you can view your park through that peep's eyes, which allows you to see your park truly come alive. VIPeep challenges are really fun as you have to cater to celebrity guests. It essentially takes everything you love about RCT 1 and 2 and adds a 3D element to it.			"

												This is still a reliable game to fall back on when everything else fails. The game is obviously dated a bit but you can still have a lot of fun with the game. If its creating a fire work show or creating the best amusement park you can do it in the game. The only thing I wish that is for the game is a workshop, if you want to get into building more technical designs your going to need to download stuff and make sure to put it in the right files and so fourth. The game itself has enough elements to creat a good park but if your into the details then you need to download a few things. This game has been out for a decade and it does show, most of the roller coasters structures are not realistic but its a video game, what more can you do espically being out for more than 10 years. The game is easy to run on the computer and I don't crash. All the characteristics of getting a thumbs up from me. If your going to get the game wait a bit until it comes out on sale, to me right now isn't worth 20$ but that is just my preference.			"

Still a fun game though, even if it doesn't have trading cards and achievements (though, not all games need it but just saying). Do I recommend it?

												This is the third in the RollerCoaster Tycoon series, and it's actually one of my favorites. It takes the scenario progression from the first game, the stacking scenery from the second one, wraps it in a nice, though somewhat buggy, 3D package... And throws in the ability to ride the rides in first person.RollerCoaster Tycoon is all about building and managing your own theme park. Everything from how much the fries in the back of the park cost, to how big of a water park you want, to fully customizable rides. You can build yourself any size coaster, color it the way you want, and theme it accordingly. If you like any management-style games, and you like amusement parks, this is the game for you. Have fun.			"

												I recently re-purchased this game on Steam. I own a disk version, but it's so cheap right now I figured it was worth purchasing, if only for the OSX version.RCT3 is the third installment of a well-loved and, from my perspective, extremely important franchise. The first two games were landmarks of video gaming, and almost certainly the best of the ""Tycoon"" series. They were also programmer (in assembly) by one guy, Chris Sawyer. As if that wasn't insane enough, Sawyer also did all the art assets and music. The first two games are unique in that regard, and also unique in the place they hold in many gamers' hearts.On a more personal level, RCT2 was the first game I ever played on a personal computer. I have a lot of childhood memories behind that game.This, however, is supposed to be a review of RCT3, not RCT2. Well, fear not: RCT3 is indeed quite a good game. Part of me wants to try and compare it with the others in the franchise, but I think that's a rather pointless endeavor. There's no way I can be objective about it, for one, and the games came out at very different times. I definitely didn't play RCT3 as much as I played RCT2, but that doesn't make it a worse game. In fact, I think I enjoyed creating water parks in this game more than I enjoyed anything in RCT2, although that might be a result of my love of water parks more than any merit of the gameplay itself.The game is not without problems. Ending waterslides feels weird, and the camera is a bit clunky at times. Some of the coaster types aren't really fun to build, and editing coasters can be a bit awkward if they go underground. Still, the game is pretty fun.Overall, this is well worth the sale price. If you're interested in building coasters at all, you'll get a solid eight hours out of this game, at a minimium. If you love the franchise, like I do, you'll probably get much more than that.  "

												Good game but has some problems. On windows 8.1, if you change graphics to high performance, then your game will NEVER run afain. If this happens, Just set a shortcut to the RCT3.exe file. Or reinstall directx, but other directx games worked. If you read the crashdump, it might say unhandled exception. Just use RCT3.exe instead of the one steam launches RCT3plus.exe. Other than that, a great game			"

												It's a pretty fun game, and has a variety of things to do. It isn't one of those misleading games, and is actually very well-structured.My only concern is the unpolishedness of it, and the pointless little things that seem like they would have been easier to put somewhere else. My point is, it's fun, but it can be a bit fiddly if you don't know what to do.			"

												So yeah, Roller Coaster Tycoon. What can you even say about it really? It's a classic game series that pretty much boosted tycoon games (Other than Sim City) to more heights. So with the passage of time, Infograms we're bought out by atari and the original creator, Chris Sawyer, not working on it anymore, Atari tried to make there own RCT game; and this is how Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 came to be known as... an okay game.So I guess I have to say the pros and cons about it, soooooooooooooooooooooo...The game is now in 3D, and it works pretty well. The only real problem is trying to turn the camera up and down trying to find the perfect angle; It just resets and goes back to a semi top down perspective. The main focus of the game is that you can RIDE the RIDES, and you can kinda ride the rides, but not in the people or ""peep's"" point of view. Instead It's on the cart's point of view. Because the rides have feelings too you know. The gameplay is you're tipical tycoon game. But don't go building your rollercoaster of death and spooky scary skeletons, you see this game has an antagonist. The Park Inspector. He hate's everything fun and will make you throw out your anger on the keyboard. You're roller coaster is a little bit unsafe? SHUT IT DOWN! Water slide landing in the wrong pool? SHUT IT DOWN! He really makes the game less fun and you can't take him out. Also, you can't kill people in the game. I guess it makes the game more casualized since there's no worry of screwing up your coaster. Oh and one more thing to add. The zoo expansion is just Zoo Tycoon so just ask someone how Zoo Tycoon plays and that's RCT 3's Zoo expansion in a nutshell. The Water expansion just adds pools which don't really need an explanation. Same with Water Slides.So yeah, It's an okay game but not as good as the other games in the series. Really, if it was it's own game without the RCT game I think I would have liked it more, not to say It's a bad game. But with the price, I don't recommend it. Wait for a sale to get it, trust me you'll thank me later.			"

												Do not be fooled by the hours in this game on Steam. I have spent many of hours on this game ever since 2008 in a box retail version.How do I sum this game up?Well, this game is all about making Roller Coasters, right? It's in the title. Well, it is that, but it's way more than building roller coasters. You mainly build theme parks for people to enjoy in. Mostly, building coasters, rides, food stalls, and basically maintaining a theme park.To start out, I'd recommend you play in Sandbox mode so you can fool around with the editor. You have unlimited money and you start out on a superflat world with the biggest park size. There, you can build your park. Add roller coasters, make carousells, make other flat rides, as well as making food and drink stalls, with other things. The Platinum version of the game adds in the 2 other expansion packs: Soaked! and Wild!. Soaked adds in pools, more coasters, the ability to build underground, and more stuffs. Wild adds in the ability to make enclosures to house animals of many kinds, coasters, rides, and more. With these things all togeather, you can make a Mega Park/WaterPark/Zoo.But if you are willing for a challange, try out the career mode, where you are given a scenario, and you have to complete the objectives before you can move on. Most of the scenario parks are given to you in the beginning, but to unlock the later ones, you have to reach a certain level in each park. It's tricky. Sadly, you won't gain anything for this except pre-made roller coaster designs, but for people wanting a challenge, go for it. There's different parks for each expansion pack, so you can play all the levels.This game was also important to me because this was my 1st real PC game in 2008, and I made 70+ parks on my crappy old Vista desktop. Too many hours to count on this game, and now I got it on Steam.You thought it stopped with the game? Nope, because out there on the wild internet you can find custom content. Custom coasters, flat rides, and most importantly, custom scenery. These mods make your game look better than with the stock scenery. Mods include coaster supports, lights, catwalks, fences, and much more. Also, they made an invisible ride entrance and exit, so you arn't stuck with the stupid stock ones. There's a wealth of mods out there, and lots of tutorials on how to install them. I will also be providing a link to a Steam guide to all of the mods I use, so you can see the stuff I like.All in all, RCT3 is one of the greatest games out there. If you are new to the RCT series, this game is the easiest to get into, then you can discover the first 2 games. There's also a 4th game in the process of being made, called World. Anything that this game didn't have will be added in World, and that comes to the bad things about this game.First, like the first 2 games, your whole park is like a giant grid system. Each grid block at a certain height will be taken up when you place something there. Although this is great for beginners, it's not that great for people that want to be creative. You just want to move this wall 2 inches to connect to the other wall, but you can't. Second, probably due to the game engine being from 2004, if you zoom away from an object, they have the chance of dissapearing. And also compared to todays standards, everything looks a bit blocky. Depending on your computer likes and dislikes, this game might not even work! If you get this game, you have to be willing to mess with the settings to get the most out of it for your machine.To end this rambling, this game is amazing. Just spend $20 and get it. I got about $35 in RCT3 stuff alone, with getting the base game and expansion packs alone, and then getting this combo copy on Steam. That shows you how much I like this game.9/10 You can charge people to go to the bathroom!			"

												RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 is a game where you are put into a position of building and managing an amusement park. The amusement park you create can have attractions ranging from concession stands to animal enclosures and pool complexes (and of course, you can build rollercoasters), but the best thing to do is trap your guests (and maybe staff) in a small enclosed area and release large carnivorous animals into the pack of people. Unfortunately, in this installment, you cannot kill your guests or staff, so while I do recommend this game, it might be more worth your while to purchase one of the previous games depending on the mechanics you are interested in.

												What can I say? Played this game years ago. Found it again on steam and HAD to get it. So nostalgic. The freedom you get provided when playing this game is amazing, the itty bitty details of what people think of the rollarcoaster/theme park, food, environment ect is so awesome. If you want to play career mode and have limited money. You can do that!. If you want to have no financial worries and build the biggest longest rollarcoaster ever. YOU CAN!. And if you want to enjoy the rollarcoaster or any other ride in the game for that matter, you can jump into first person and go up and down and around and all the rest on the rides. Yea yea graphics aren't the bomb. The people are a little block-ish. But the game is a bit old (no kidding) and the pros completely stomp the cons. If you enjoy creative games with much freedom.

I've put more hours into this game than i did any other one. another feature that i love is the ability to change the terrain which adds some atmosphere to the game. water falls over a roller coaster into a cave of darkness... enough said.9.9/10 from me would recommend this game to anybody who loves building coasters and rides, to their hearts contentcant wait for RollerCoaster Tycoon WorldForgot to add there are enclosures for animals to make a zoo and a set of Water park rides			"

												A fantastic, fun and fully customisable game. If you're a lover of the earlier games, then this will be perfect for you but if you're not, it'll be equally perfect for you. It combines designing rollercoasters and theme parks with strategy, that's never too hard but always challenging. Not only that, but it's gorgeous looking too. I only wish they'd release the previous games on Mac on Steam too, would love to play those again. 10/10, 5/5, 100%, whatever your preferred rating system is.			"

												I've been playing RCT3 for YEARS. I probably have something like over 5,000+ hours combined! I love this game so damn much. Some people prefer the older RCT games but this was was my favorite. New players may have a hard time getting into it though, just like any old game. This version is slightly buggy though, but nothing game-breaking. Give it a chance, try it out before you buy it.			"

												I like rollercoasters... period. I also like management games. This has both. It is fun and can get very hard later into the game. This is the (in my opinion) the last good Roller Coaster Tycoon game. It has a normal level system and also has a sandbox mode where you can really flex your creativity. Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 is one of those games where you decide to play for a couple minutes, then before you know it multiple hours have passed. It is just a timeless classic to me.			"

												Roller Coaster Tycoon is an old game series, now being revived by Planet Coaster, where you build a Theme Park and make your peeps (guests) happy. You can choose from a few game modes, my favorite, of course, is sandbox, where you have unlimited money and can build to your heart's content in a humongous clear field. The other gamemodes include the campaign mode (limited money) and scenarios to test your theme park skills and learn new concepts of the game. You can build huge roller coasters and theme your park like crazy. You can also include carnival rides.You can also be evil, which is incredibly fun, and build roller coasters that lead to nowhere, and watch your guests explode and crash into walls, but it is child friendly, so everyone survives, so don't worry about that.Though this game is old, it is still one of my most favorite games ever. Do yourself a favor and at least try it, and I'll guaranty you'll have at least a little fun.			"

												This game is absolutely fanstastic and I have failed time after time to find anything dislikeable about it whatsoever. The graphics are very old but still look fantastic, the building tools feel solid and are easy to use (though building on terrain can be annoying) and the gameplay and feel is amazing... This game is just sooo good. This is by far my favorite Tycoon game ever and I doubt any Tycoon game will come close to this or any of the other games in the series, which are also amazing and are classics. This game is easy to learn and once you do, the creativity just flows. The possibilities are endless. This game also runs extremely well on any pc.If you are into game such as Call Of Duty or any fps or MOBA games, this probably is not the game for you because it takes a very large amount of your time, but if you have inspiration and creativity and wish to see your dream park come together, this is for you.  I highly recomend all three games in the series as they are all classics and they are all absolutely fantastic.			"

												Don't let my steam hours steer you away. I bought the Platinum disc version a couple of years ago and I finally got it on Steam. With probably 200+ hours on the game, it is one of the best tycoon games without a doubt. Even for around a 12 year old game, the graphics are still outstanding (even though I care more about the gameplay rather than graphics). It is very easy to get hooked to and when you build your dream park (or kill the peeps in your all inclusive death park), you'll have hours of fun playing this game. I would highly consider purchasing this game over The new RCT World. This beats it by a mile and it is still a decade older! R8 8/8 m9.   "

												After the upgrade to Windows 10 (with the SecuROM which is attached to the CD version of this game) I couldn't install the CD version anymore as an error kept popping up after 68% completed. That's where I decided to buy this game again on my AMD FX(tm)-8350 Eight-Core Processor (4.50 GHz). At first it seemed to work. It loaded up my old parks and CSO, CFR and CTRs as I expected. But after several times saving a park and loading it up (which first always worked on my old version of RCT3) it keeps crashing after loading a park up. I tried to find the source for it, changed the graphics removed the RCT3.fc in Documents/RCT3/Parks and Structures file as this is always a major problem when copying an old folder and replacing the new one (has to do with the administrator rights) and tried to change the resolution (I'm using a widescreen so I'm using the option 1280 x 960 x 32) but that doesn't fix the source of the crash. I'm desperate regarding this, and felt the need to share this for you as (eventual) buyer using Windows 10. Many like me are maintaining this problem, but the strange thing is that some don't at all! Maybe it has to do with the fact I'm using custom theming and custom rides, and somewhere a corrupt file got between my data but then again the map exactly as I have now always used to work on my old pc (which was a Windows XP and even on Windows 8.1 it works fine). So if you want to buy this even though you know the consequences which may come with this, I give you the advice to ALWAYS KEEP YOUR GAME UPDATED when using custom theming! It may help you in solving a (future) crash you may maintain like me.Other than my personal failures I'm maintaining, I highly recommend this game if you like sandbox modes and theme parks (or fairgrounds, as you can build your own fairground with the right theming). The game also have a career option of you managing an already existing theme park. It comes with a lot of features, and I promise you it won't let you down! It have a firework, laser and watershow editor option of creating your own shows! You can hire and fire employees. In short: all what comes with managing a theme park! But with that and with the malfunction I shared above, I warn users using a high-tech computer system as this game is dating from 2005 (2004 in the Northern America). The game is not updated as there is already a new version of Rollercoaster Tycoon on the market: Rollercoaster Tycoon World. So buying this with a high-tech PC is a gamble. As I said, some are lucky and some (like me) are not unfortunately. You got it all in the hand of how expansive you want the game to be.			"

												RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 is a game where you are put into a position of building and managing an amusement park. The amusement park you create can have attractions ranging from concession stands to animal enclosures and pool complexes (and of course, you can build rollercoasters), but the best thing to do is trap your guests (and maybe staff) in a small enclosed area and release large carnivorous animals into the pack of people. Unfortunately, in this installment, you cannot kill your guests or staff, so while I do recommend this game, it might be more worth your while to purchase one of the previous games depending on the mechanics you are interested in.

												Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 was the one of the first PC games that got me into gaming. Its detailed mechanics make the game really memorable and replayble to where you never really want to stop playing. The management options are so extremely intricate that you can even adjust the amount of condiments go on the burgers. Roller coaster buliding is enjoyable - not tedious or repetitve - while also being challenging in where you have to adjust the twists and turns just right in order to achieve a certain nausea or excitement rating. Even more content is in the game for the player to build and enjoy, but I won't spoil that fun: you'll have to play the game yourself to see what else there is to enjoy ;) But, there is a plethora of integrated cheats in the game like naming a park guest ""James Hunt"" to spawn a dune buggy that you can not-so-carefully drive and run over the park guests with. You can find the rest of the cheats online with a simple search; they make the game a whole lot more enjoyable.I nominated this game for The ""Test Of Time"" Award because of the reasons above and would also nominate it for The ""Just 5 More Minutes"" Award if I could. I gave that to Planet Coaster because it's this game but with better graphics, more to build, more detail, more everything, and it's new and being updated with even more amazing content by a company that actually cares about the product they're creating and giving to thier audience. Too bad there are no cheats... I really want to run over park guests in 4K...			"

												Have you ever dreamed of owning a theme park? Me neither. Or so I thought, browsing through my father's games as a kid.I was wrong. Boy, I was wrong.This game has the three Cs of a good sandbox - Challenge, Content, and Creativity. Design your own parks or play Scenarios and help their premade parks rise to the top. Build coasters, flat rides, shops, paths, terrain, zoos, pools, and a surprisingly huge amount of other theme park essentials. Hire staff, manage prices, and attract guests to your park.Alternatively, you can build rides that launch carts into crowds of people, or unleash wild predators into your park to watch as your patrons run around screaming for their lives.The developer of this game, Frontier, created a masterpiece worthy of me buying again on Steam solely for the convenience of having it digitally.This is one of the best games ever made, hands down.

However, not for the full price, i got it at a discount and i do not regret my purchuase but i am glad i did not pay full price. It has a few too many glitches for that, like the game dying at random. Atleast once every time i played it! Also the floortiles hate me and refuse to fuse together, making it impossible to make some paths connect. Otherwise the game is fun, maybe not as good as the original but still worth a play.			"

												Rollercoaster Tycoon 3. A game that's equally as good now as it was in 2004. 3D camera, a wide variety of rides, almost unlimited customizability... this game would honestly be well recieved even if it was released today. Fans of the isometric view might not love the 3D camera, but I'm sure that everyone would love to ride the rollercoasters and water slides of their own creation.  Buy this if you loved RCT1 and 2, or even if you never played either but feel like you would like to create your own theme park with no limits but your imagination.			"

												I love this game. RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Platinum adds the great idea of riding your rides after building them. It brings the world of RCT into 3D. The rides are great and are really fun to build. The AI of the people isn't great and there isn't a lot of scenery choices, but the rides make up for it. They improved the sandbox by making it its own thing instead of having to make a new custom scenario just for it. There are multiple carrer choices that each have one objective but after you complete the first, it makes it tougher by making you expand your goal even more. If you have trouble understanding how to play the game, there is a tutorial mode that will help you on your way to becoming the best rollercoaster park designer that you can be. I would fully recommend this game to anyone who has the time and patiece to make your park look great and making your rollercoasters amazing. This is one of my favorite games, which may seem sad, but it is that good. If you have the money to buy this game, get it right away.			"

												Roller Coaster Tycoon is an old game series, now being revived by Planet Coaster, where you build a Theme Park and make your peeps (guests) happy. You can choose from a few game modes, my favorite, of course, is sandbox, where you have unlimited money and can build to your heart's content in a humongous clear field. The other gamemodes include the campaign mode (limited money) and scenarios to test your theme park skills and learn new concepts of the game. You can build huge roller coasters and theme your park like crazy. You can also include carnival rides.You can also be evil, which is incredibly fun, and build roller coasters that lead to nowhere, and watch your guests explode and crash into walls, but it is child friendly, so everyone survives, so don't worry about that.Though this game is old, it is still one of my most favorite games ever. Do yourself a favor and at least try it, and I'll guaranty you'll have at least a little fun.			"

												I love this game! Its a game ive gotten into over the past 4 years, yes shock horror, im like the only 23 year old who didnt play this game series growing up. But I can get the nostalgia feel. If you like the Sims, especially the building and creating aspect then you will love this game. I end up hooked on this game for hours at a time! It can be very buggy which can let it down. The biggest one being once a park gets too 'big' the game wont run, will crash and most of the time corrupt your save. This massively lets it down but its overall a really good game.			"

												After 12 years it's still a great game.I could play this game for days building rollercoasters,designing eveything but, now since planet coaster was relase that is the only tycoon game that will beat it.I even got it on IOS.Overall it still one of my favorite games of all time.			"

												On my old PC, I had too many hours on this game, even though I only have 3.3 here. It is a little clunky, but once you get through that, it is a blast! 9.1/10 in my book!			"

												As with the 2 predecessors, if you didn't play this game as a kid, you didn't have a childhood. Unlike the predecessors though, this game is fully 3D and lets you ride the rides, and has an actual sandbox mode, and therefore justifies the $20 price tag. Still is a modest price to pay for a game of this time. If you're cheap like I am, you can wait for the summer or winter sale, where this will get marked down significantly.			"
