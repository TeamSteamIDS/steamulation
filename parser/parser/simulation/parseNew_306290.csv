												One of the best mods for  almost forgotten ""russian Jagged Alliance"" game 7.62.  It takes the game on the new level, drastically changes gameplay from idle ""search and kill"" to more or less sane ""explore and make decisions"". New missions (including new side of the conflict and prologue), new weapons, new situations and far more means to make gameplay convienent, but still complex. Car management,  human needs, interactive objects...Everything is done with care and love. Reaaly good job, guys. thank you!			"

												Is this a fun game? Yes. Is this a great game? Far from it.You are a mercenary, and you are in a foreign country that is ruled by a dictator. There are a few different factions that you can side with who are vying for control, including going it alone. You hire and manage personell, fight battles on generic 3D maps, and complete quests. There is a large selection of guns, equipment, and vehicles to use throughout the game.If you were a fan of Jagged Alliance 2, you will almost certainly enjoy this game. It is similar in principle, but far more in-depth in many ways than Jagged Alliance. The biggest gameplay difference is that this game doesn't use action points, it uses a real time system with pause/auto pause. There are a couple of things to keep in mind:1)The game is very buggy.2)The inventory/stash system is terrible. I have probably spent at least 20 hours of my play time trying to organize items.3)The game is poorly translated. 4)The first few hours are extremely difficult. 5)Most of the objectives are straightforward, but there is not much hand holding in this game.6)Performance seems to be poor. I have a medium build (i5 3570k, GTX 480, 12GB RAM, SSD) and have played with the settings. Lots of AI movement seems to result in massive drops in framerates.7)Speaking of AI, it is, more often than not, very bad.Despite all this, I still recommend the game,  It has a blend of TBS/RTS, managment, and RPG elements that is very rare in this setting. Worth a look for any JA2 fan, just don't expect much polish. For $5, you can't go wrong. "

												While at this time (10/8/2015) the game is very buggy and will regularly crash it is still worth the only $5 price tag. I don't know of many other games like it. If you enjoy both tactical shooters and RTS games I would give 7.62 a try.			"

												Harder than High Calibre. Second mission include your squad of 7-8 unprepared people vs. 40 bandits.This is no Rambo so many enemies shooting at one target make a hit.Micromanagement hell. I love it.I'm the strange guy who still read manuals to basically everything.Hard Life have none. Or does have but in barbaric language.Some things can't be found with the intuition and common sense, mostly because engine limitation and workarounds done because that.Also you should know that Hard Life is old russian mod that made backbone for Blue Sun Mod for High Calibre, so good and important it's avaliable on Steam.Configuration tools touch many aspects (like ""random encounters"" frequency), add features like hunger, vehilce mainentance.Descriptions of everything have more details and contain vital informations. Don't use Old/Dirty/Rusty guns with Cheap/badly made ammo. You either do nothing to enemy or it can blow in your hands.More and more niuances, no manual, you need to read forum posts to find answers or by yourself.Still - big thumb up because game IS good.

 This is probably the best game ever i have bought for few bucks!  And now about the game.Pros: +Very hard or even Hardcore. (its very hard even on normal)+Gun physics are great.+Looting system is very good too.+Wepon modifications.+Other physics in the game are great too. (except what buildings can be destroyed)+All your crew members are very important for you if they die, thats it, you lost them and there is no way to get them back.+Health and injuries system, its very realistic, and you can easily bleed to death or get to bullet in your head or just a scrap from explosion what you or your enemy made and THATS IT you are DEAD!!! Cons: -No good toturial.-It's way too hard at the beginning of the game.-Bandits will keep attacking you and you will have to last stand against them for really long time until you get bigger squad size or better cars.-Mercenaries (squad members) are way too expensive.-Map isnt very big and only few towns.-Few Combat Maps outside the towns, so you will keep fighting in zones again and again, but that isnt the main problem. My verdict about this game: 1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must play			"

												Allow me to congratulate on the two ""reviewer"" below me for their contribution to the 7.62 community, one of them played the game for 20minutes and his/her attention span was depleted, while the other was unable to comprehend the game`s auto pause function, God bless them.So back to the review..The vanilla game is full of bugs, don`t even think about playing it, if you purchased it on steam you automatically have the option to play the venerable Blue Sun Mod(BSM) with the added unofficial patch. But you are here to read about the Hard Life Add On(HLA)so read on.This mod was only Russian for ages and just recently been ""translated"" to english and it shows. A lot of the time you will read incoherent text, and some of the descriptions will still be in cyrillic but the game is playable as is, just pay attention.The game also lacks of an english guide or manual so a lot of things won`t be explained or apparent. Many new mechanics were introduced like ammo and weapon quality, merging items, fixing and fueling vehicles and dialogue choices based on skills,new quests and locations. The basic concept of the mod is brilliant because it adds a ton of new, interesting and essential features that should have been in the vanilla game from day one. However the execution is far from perfect or even good to be enjoyable unfortunately. The more time I spend on the mod, the more apparent its shortcomings become.Ammo and magazines are badly distributed between vendors, ammo quality unrealisticly affects brand new weapons jamming frequency, weapon stats are unbalanced and added weapon conditions are inconsistent. The same beat down, broken, rusty weapon will be found on every enemy in the game so firearm scavenging will be nonexistent from circa 2hrs of gameplay when the player is able to afford new guns. This in turn will degrade the looting element of encounters after combat, to a mere how much I can stuff in my trunk and how quick I can get rid of it. Damage has also been altered to the point where 5.56 and 7.62 rounds are unable to drop targets. Sad..The player has access to many vehicles and they need to be maintaned and refueled. Upgrading them is also implemented and adds a nice layer of immersion. However it seems that most cars(and bikes)are made of glass and randomly will break down even after a service at the mechanic. Strangely the player with a mechanic skill of over say fifty is able to fix most issues even without a toolbox on the field. Since the game is(and always was)unstable saving often is recommended so breaking down usually results in an instant reload which makes the feature more an annoyance.New side quests and a completely new main quest line has been added. Most of the Npc`s have been given new functions and dialogues, train stations are also present.(even if obsolete within 3hrs of gameplay) There is a good variety of quests not just go here kill this or that type but actual escort missions with negotiations. Unfortunatley some of the missions and maps/enemy spawn locations make no sense and they feel badly designed, rushed.Enemies have been buffed to the point where you will want to break everything and anything around you so be prepared for frustrating encounters. The accuracy and spotting of enemies is nothing sort of hilarious and will give you a lot of grief. Enemy experience level is not implemented in any way, common bandits and elite soldiers are all immune to suppressing fire and can hardly be shocked ever.(This is one of my biggest gripe with the mod, a group of bandits will happily march through a hail of bullets from an LMG while their friend kneeling behind them puts a round into your head from a broken homemade carbine from 100+ meters)New locations and options to make money have also been added like a gun shop, agency and mine. These work very well, so is trading and smuggling, the available items are cool and interesting.(Even though the limited amount of money traders have can be annoying at times) Money however is easy to get but equally easy to spend on.All in all the original game has been greatly enhanced by this mod but I think that it just missed its mark to be truly good. The new mechanics of HLA need to be improved a lot for it to be a definite choice over BSM(+)Mercapocalypse.I will recommend it based on purely because of the potential and the effort of the Russian community.

												This game takes patience, both in terms of play, and in terms of putting up with problems.7.62 is a Russian spin-off of the Jagged Alliance series, and in my opinion, what it tries to be, it does incredibly well.  I enjoy the combat mechanics of this game and the variety of equipment that is at your disposal; what's more, you can modify weapons, interchange armor plates, and craft some items in your inventory.  For what it is and when it was made, 7.62 is a lot like the old ""Men of War"" series, mixed with real-time JA style.  While it does some things right, micromanagement becomes a science in this game, and so does constantly saving your game.  Some missions are quirky, and many things about this game are ""hard"" to grasp.I'd said in paragraph one, this game takes patience.  That may be a bit of an understatement.  This game also requires a lot of tolerance, and forgiveness, when it crashes.  Trust me, there will be occasional crashes if you plan on playing for more than an hour at a time.  Is it worth it?  To me, absolutely.  To others?  Well, it may or may not be so.  If you're looking to manage down to the bare bones a squad of trained soldiers and face off against very dangerous enemies, using realistic bullet dynamics (and challenge to go with it), there is a lot to like here.  If you plan on using exploits, you'll probably love this game even more, because no matter what, there is always a challenge, even if you have the top-of-the-line gear.The only place where Hard Life really goes wrong is in that it's just a mod and it is very far from perfect, and the developers did not decide to take it beyond that.  It fixes much of what's wrong with the original ""High Caliber"" and gives you a good stage to start on.  It fails, however, to seem like a game that is going to be continually updated with new things.  This is a classic game that has been re-released with better accessories; it's definitely worth it to me, but again, this is a game that you will either love or hate.  If you wouldn't buy an outdated game, this one's not for you.  If you wouldn't buy a game that will probably crash a few times, this one's not for you.  If you hate micromanagement, hate hard (and sometimes infuriating) enemies, this one's not for you.  If you can appreciate imperfection and deal with the fact that the base game is from 2007, you may want to add it to your cart!			"

												Hard life is a diamond studded, gold bow laced around a gigantic soft turd.This mod has some great ideas and adds real depth and content to the game - but you won't ever get to enjoy it because the sadists who created this mod hate fun and hate players.Anyone who has played 7.62 knows the real focus and the actual good part of the game is the tactical combat. The devs in all their wisdom, decided to remove the record action key, which previously played a central role in being able to command a full squad without wanting to kill yourself irl, now ""gameplay"" is reduced to smashing the spacebar key to pause after EVERY ACTION.Moving on, Bizarre ""hardcore"" changes that make no sense and only offer value to the kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who enjoys artificially increasing difficulty and save-scumming to completion. Weapon balance is completely skewered, despite the clear bias towards russian weapons, there a sea of changes to damages and accuracy ratings that make no realistic sense.Not worth the install in its current forum. Maybe we get a future update that addresses some concerns, but given how long its been out - probably not.tl;dr: russian cocktease turns into a miserable baba yaga who ruins your life "

												I'm not enjoying this game. The interface makes very little sense. I've spent two hours wandering around talking to NPCs and so far, leaving the base camp has proven impossible. I've looted bodies NPCs have killed and traded them for money and hired a dude and bought him a shotgun. But leaving camp is impossible. Did I say the interface is confusing? (I was a fan of Silent Storm and since this game claimed to be along the same vein, I bought it. So far, I'm not seeing the similarity.)What would fix this game? Maybe a tutorial would help. Perhaps some sort of indication as to who to talk to for missions would help. I love open world games, but this one is too confusing to navigate.			"

												7.62 High Calibre is a real-time tactical strategical action game released in 2007, similar to Xcom series while in the battling mode but in real time. You are a mercenary tasked to find a russian who stole from colleagues who hired you. There's some RPG elements inside.You will need to find clues, upgrade yourself, hire other mercenaries, equip them, find your target. You know who he is, you don't know what he has. You'll find him, and when you do, you'll know what he has and you need to make it out in one piece while completing your task.The storyline is nice, but the replies from the NPCs are kinda repetitive. The music is nice, the graphics are ok. There're quite some interesting choices you can make, the camera is a little hard to control. Pausing is crucial during engagements.7.62 Hard Life is a fan made enhanced version based on 7.62 High Calibre, released in 2015, provided free and comes with the steam workshop, The workshop doesn't have much but there're a few good mods. It's harder to play compared to 7.62 High Calibre due to the sheer amount of enemies, but you'll be able to handle it if you've played the original first. Weapon pack mods are recommended to lessen the difficulty by a little and adds more diversity in weapons.I would totally recommend it to Xcom lover, but you need to be more patient with these game compared to Xcom. It's already worth its current price, but do grab it when there's a sale, being thrifty is a virtue.			"

												in short THE BEST realtime with pause(RtwP) squad based tactics game in my book.if you like guns, tactics, detailed paper doll with lots of inventory space, detailed handling of ammo(can mix ammo typs in mags), micromanagement of equipment and gear on your mercs, this game is for you.dont be turned off by the realtime component when you come from a turn based background, like jagged alliance 2. you can and i usually play the game, in battle that is, with maximum manual time slow. so the game run very slow, on top you can allways pause to evaluate situation and change or adept orders.imagine like a permanent bullet time, you can select with +/- numpad how fast game time runs in 3danyways, if you decide to pick it up, enjoy. if you like the genere you can not go wrong for the price.
