Early Access Review
								We see a lot of games advertised as a Dungeon Keeper sequel. It keeps happening, but we get things like ""Dungeons"" (dungeon theme-park) or EA's recent ""Dungeon Keeper"" (please insert micro-transaction) game.Dwelvers is actually, legitimately, really like Dungeon Keeper. Gameplay consists of cube terrain chunks you can mine out or build upon. You can dig rooms out, construct farms, dining rooms, kitchens, prisons, and other things a dungeon should have. The game is also 3d in a sense. While you cannot built a multiple layer dungeon where one room is on top of another room, there is a limit to how steep of a wall a creature can climb. This means impassible cliffs are a thing.Maps are randomly generated. You can select difficulty level and input a seed number (or accept the random number offered to you), so there's infinite replay in the game.Your minions have needs. They need sleep, food, and booze. If their needs are not met they will become unhappy. If they get too unhappy they will rebel against you and attack your other minions.Everything costs resources to build. The resource system is much like Settlers. Rooms can process resources (a kitchen can turn flour, water, and wood into bread) into other resources. There is also a trade system in game where you can send out trade caravans to exchange one resource for another. This trade system is nearly identical to Settlers.Traps are a thing. Ever play Evil Genius? If you haven't, you should. Evil Genius was Dungeon Keeper meets Austin Powers combined with a hefty dose of creative trap components which you had to assemble into an overly complex, excessively slowly moving death machine that gave plenty of time for secret agents to escape from. Dwelvers has trap components you can construct any number of death machines from. Excessive complexity optional.And on top of all of this, you have to of course defend your dungeon against various heroes and other monsters who will try to ruin your day. If you lose your Dungeon Heart, its game over man. Defend the Dungeon Heart at all costs.One thing to keep in mind is that this game is early access. The core gameplay is there, but the game is not yet finished. Not by a longshot. The number of rooms, furniture items, and monsters is limited. The game isn't remotely balanced when it comes to defending your dungeon. You can be wiped out by the very first enemy you encounter in the first 30 seconds of the game if you're unlucky. There is also a surface world. You can see the surface world but you cannot yet interact with the surface world. Presumably there will be interaction between your underground realm and the surface world at a later point in the game, but as this is early access this is not yet implemented.The game has all of the core pieces in place and functional. The game is stable, enjoyable, and entertaining. But because the game is early access it is still incomplete. Players may run out of things to do after a few hours of gameplay. Once you build up your dungeon, construct all of the rooms, and have the basic food supply chain going you've beaten the game and experienced all content in the game.My verdict:The game is an enjoyable and fun sandbox style dungeon builder, but you're going to run through all in-game content within a few hours. This is not due to a fault in the game, but rather its early stage in development. Presumably there will be more stuff to do implemented later on in the development cycle. More monsters, more rooms, more pieces of furniture, more enemies, and more challenges.			"

Early Access Review
								Comparisons between this and War For The Overworld are, of course, inevitable. The fact is, however, that despite the basis of both games on Dungeon Keeper they are very different beasts and I heartily recomend both games to anyone looking for a Dungeon Keepers sequel. WftO is a much more traditional Dungeon Keeper sequel type affair, despite that fact the the (lovely) devs on that team were legally obliged to shout at me whenever I mention that particular EA franchise in relation to their game. They're still great guys, though! :)But Dwelvers is what we're here for so as well as just saying it's a great game I guess I should describe it a little and highlight the differences between this and Dungeon Keeper/WftO.Bottom line? Dwelvers is more in depth and complicated in terms of management of your creatures.A bit more in-depth is to say that it takes the dungeon building of the original and expands upon it in a somewhat Minecraft-feeling type of way. You don't just mine outwards to expand your dungeon, you can also mine up and down and the massive levels very quickly become truly huge, with overland access points and monster rooms scattered here and there, as well as resource points and The Maze.As well as the addition of the third dimension in terms of exploring, there is also a lot more to do to keep your creatures happy, fed, and equipped. Gone is the gold of the original which would fuel an automated chicken farm. Now you have to carefully manage your crops, mills, kitchen, fishers, brewers, and ensure there's enough space for everyone to get to the table laden with food. It makes it feel more engaging than the original and adds a big dimension that makes it feel like a living dungeon rather than a ... I dunno ... Almost like a franchise in the original? You threw gold alone at it and it worked however much you messed up your layout. This is a different beast and you should really be prepared to deal with the layout problems that will inevitably crop up.Defending your dungeon is quite aa lot more in depth than the original as well. Or it can/will be at least. As well as your indirectly controlled creatures you also have your delightful array of traps which is where things get deliciously sadistic. As with Minecraft's redstone circuits, gone are the days of a line of automated cannons and it has been replaced with a potentially massively complicated hydraulics system.Potentially? Yep. You can have a pressure pad which makes a cannon fire or a wall squish someone very easily, but you can also push the boat out and use the already impressive array of hydraulic systems to make gob-smackingly complex trap systems on mulitple levels doing all sorts of terrible things to your enemies. Blowing them up and squishing them are just the start, if you want to put the time and imagination in.So, verdict?This game is in alpha. It shows in the rough menus and UI elements, particularly the missing tooltips on some windows, but it's already lightyears ahead of Dungeon Keeper and a very different beast to War For The Overworld - If you're looking for a traditional DK then I'd point you toward WftO but if you're looking for something that builds on the original in terms of management and building complexity, Dwelvers is definitely for you.

								Feels like Dungeon Keeper with some Dwarf Fortress mixed in. The core mechanics are already very solid for an Alpha version. If you loved Dungeon Keeper, support these devs. This seems like it could be the real spiritual successor to the series.			"

Early Access Review
** Key was provided by developer for review purposes ** This review is of the 0.9f-3 version of the gameI will try to update the review when I canDwelvers Dwelvers is a fun mangement RTS where you create your own dungeon. I will add a TL;DR at the end.GameplayDwelvers is a dungeon lord game that is simple and fun. The game has multiple rooms, decorations, specific items, character types, and has a good management system. One of the things which was a joy, a true joy to notice was that you could use magic to posses a minion and this perspective it is a rewarding feature. As this is an early access currently there are bugs and problems which most likely will not exist in the final version. The gameplay is fairly simple and you can toy and find out how everything works, however there is a tutorial to tell you at least the very basics of the game although it would be nice if there was another tutorial to help understand every feature. Dwelvers even has some traps and the ability to equip each individual minion. It has enough features to easily add hours upon hours to your gameplay time in its current state. This game has a lot of replayability and freedom with customization which is key in any type of management game.Graphics/MusicThe graphics are fairly simple but also are a part of this game's charm in my opinion. This game feels simpler and more casual for it. The music is empowering to help delve in a game like Dwelvers. It has a type of fantasy and freedom feel to it. Overall the graphics and music are part of the reason I have faith in this game. (although mainly because I love some of its features)Kickstarter CampaignI decided to add this portion as the minds behind Dwelvers are launching their kickstarter campaign soon and I think this game needs to be supported to be able to rise above and beyond. Check out their campaign here  to help add an idea of what this game is and going to be. I encourage anyone that if they like the game to support at least a bit of the Kickstarter.BugsSince I am a lazy person instead of posting my bugs into the discussions I have decided to put any bugs I find here.- When pressing Ctrl+Alt+Delete to open up task manager to check something else while in fullscreen mode cause it to act as a windowed program and be able to change it’s size if mouse in near the top or right of the screen. This along with being unable to move the cursor to a significant portion of the left side of the screen.Pros/Cons Pros    + Active development+ Great amount of features + Every creature has a name+ Good managing system+ Great amount of free creativity with designCons    **Note as this is an early access title Cons are viable to change- Tutorial does not explain very much- Early access bugs and problemsSuggestionsHere are some suggestions I feel would improve the game- Naming of minions- Steam workshop integration- Eventual multiplayerFinal/Personal ThoughtsDwelvers is  good game with active development and I do like it when a developer is really involved with their game, when they have a passion for it. I am fairly new to the dungeon lord genre myself and really like the current state of the game and where it’s aiming. Overall yeah I would definitely say I enjoy to play Dwelvers. I'd also like to appologize that it has taken me so long to create this review for this great game.TL;DRA good dungeon lord game that is set on a good path. Dwelvers is an enjoyable experience overall with all of its features and such, but as any early access game has bugs and problems. Overall a game I can recommend to people who like having freedom with design, good management aspects, creativity within the game, and like this sort of game. If deciding to buy this game based on this review make sure to check the news for updates and see what has been added since the time of this review.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

Early Access Review
								This game is Early Access at the time of this review, but this game has become one of my favorite hobbies. I love being able to contribute in the development process, and I have been playing this game since before Dwelvers was the decided title and it was a 2D playing field. The developer has always kept a good level of communication with the forum, and now here at Steam, and even though this is still an Alpha, it has been rare that I've experienced any game-breaking patches. Those have ALWAYS been quickly addressed, which is what you would expect from a responsible developer.This game is inspired mostly of games like Dungeon Keeper & Settlers. The keys here are RTS and resource management. I would expect that like games such as Settlers that there will be a lot of resources to manage once the game has been completed, and balancing that with the elements of RTS makes this an interesting endeavor. I have and continue to enjoy this game as it grows, and I hope you will too. Remember this is NOT a completed game, it's an Alpha. I wouldn't expect things to always work the way I would a final release.			"

								I've been playing before Steam and have about 20 or so hours put into it.  Excellent re-envisioning of Dungeon Keeper.For being in alpha, there is already a solid base to work on.Their forums at Dwelvers.com is very well put together and has constant feedback from the developer(s).The graphics are unique, almost a Borderlands look.  It adds layers and an economy, so think Dwarf Fortress.Each minion has different requirements to be happy (Orcs need beer for example).They put in the best of DK while adding their own unique flavor to the dungeon builder genre.Cons: Still in alpha, so obviously there's a lot of material yet to be put in.  Don't know if this is a con or fact of life.			"

								Dwelvers is a fantastic approach at recreating the magical moments in Dungeon Keeper and other similar games. You will spend hours glued to the computer playing this game. Digging tunnels has never been so fun, especially when you are battling the occasional cave-in which reveals nice loot or enemies under the earth!Pros:Great dungeon builder and management gamePlenty of rooms to buildCrafting armor/weaponsRaid the surface for supplies and fight humansTrain your troops (awesome)Set up trade routes to other areasTraps FTW - moveable fake walls, cannons, and more!Combat is actually cool to watch. Wounded troops will try to run away before they are killed, covered in blood (haha)Surprises while digging, such as cave-ins leaving goblins stranded in the depths below, or revealing enemy monsters or humans digging themselves.Cell shaded graphics in my opinion look good in thisCons:Normal difficulty seems a little too easy, but hard difficulty is really hard! (Can't imagine what Nightmare is like)Lots of minions as you expand, might be a bit overwhelming for someMight be a little confusing as to what's going on sometimesNo hot key to rally troops, but you can do so from a wheel menu by right clicking (takes a little bit longer)			"

								This game has a very entertaining feel to it, and I do rather enjoy that the mother is voiced by a man... Its voiced by some random british guy (at least the accent sounds british to me), and I rather enjoy the concept of dungeon Keeper, and really applaud any attempt to keep games of this type alive. I have not yet had the ability to afford it more time, But, I can say the few minutes of the tutorial I have played so far were quite enjoyable, and I'll definately be coming back for another round, when I have more free time. I would reccomend it, and I do believe that this game has a lot of potential.			"

								As of v0.8d Alpha:Dwelvers is a dungeon manager sort of game. On one hand it has Dungeon Keeper-esq idea of being a dungeon lord who rules the underworld full of creatures that you cannot influence directly.On other hand it has needs of those creatures and the dungeon itself.While the building and fighting part is pretty solid at the moment, managing needs is still quite rough.A bit of minor mechanics bugs here and there, soma annoyances in AI behaviours and slightly buggy building included.But, heck, it's still alpha and all of those complaints are pretty minor.If you are willing to play with them and like Dungeon Keeper-like games - this one is pretty damn entertaining.If not - well, at very least, keep an eye on this one, it's a promising one!More detailed look in the video:

Early Access Review
								Just recently found this game and preordered it before it came to steam.  So even though its not showing I have a lot of play time I have been playing the game for about 2 weeks.  In my opinion this game is moving the direction that I would think that dungeon keeper would have gone if it was still being made.  War for the overworld is great when it works which is almost never for me but when it does work its got nothing on Dwelvers at all.  There is more fun and always something to do in Dwelvers.  You get most all the good things from Dungeon Keeper, though you cant slap your imps... However a bunch more resources to handle, and you have to keep your creatures happy.  I tried the other day to see what would happen if I didnt make beer for my orcs and well I thought nothing to bad would happen however my orcs got really mad and started killing off my other creatures.  And thats just one of the many things you have to take care of in this game.  You have actual production chains for farming and feeding your people.  You can setup your rooms however you like instead of just dragging an area and its all automatic from there.  I like the ability to customize my rooms and even add some decorations to them.  Being able to build a fireplace in my bedrooms or barrels in the walls in my cookery room.  These little touches gives the game something extra on top of the dig rooms and fight puny humans.  The cyclotaurs are a nice thing that when you defeat them for now its kinda the end of the game, but they are harder to defeat than it looks or sounds.  You also can trade with the overworld for resources, once you find a ladder up, and eventually we will be able to go above ground and do stuff up there.  For now the above ground stuff is just a preview button but you can at least get kinda an idea.  You also have to craft weapons and armor that unlock as you find them so you can equip your creatures with stuff to make them better in fights as well as training them up to do better.For such an early build of the game there is tons of content and for the moment it seems to be bug free.  However since I have had the game there were bugs but with help from the community they were found and squashed really really really fast.  When 0.8 came out originally I downloaded it noticed a bug and then 4 hours later it was fixed and the updated version was released to the public.  The Developer Rasmus is really on top of everything, I am seriously impressed.  He also is very friendly and you can tell that he really cares about this game and the players.Overall the game has been a great experience so far with everything and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an actual game that improves on dungeon keeper			"

								As a guy who's always been fond of games that allow the construction of, well, pretty much anything, Dwelvers turns out to be a very good play for me. It's challenging to set up a functional and stable resource production system, as well as set up a stable military and manage the numerous different areas of economy needed to have the optimal settlment.If I had to make one complaint, which all good reviews should do, it would be that the game is still in Dev, so things tend to change and there are a few unfinished features - but since it's still in Dev I know I can wait for them to be finished!In short, a great sandbox game, with the appearance of only getting better in the future!

								If you've been waiting for a true successor to Dungeon Keeper, as I have, then I think you've found it. Certainly shows the most promise out of all the games inspired by DK that I've tried over the years. The 3D dungeons are awesome, although some way of building over pits would be welcome.Resources come in more types than in DK2 (Which only had gold, iirc). Here you must actually manage production lines as well as mine the appropriate resources. You can also make resource trades with the surface world, which makes things a bit easier if you end with an overabundance of some resources -although the available trades are limited. Traps require a lot more planning than in DK - pressure plates and wires rather than self-activated when something appears in range.Can't wait to see how it develops, with more rooms, more creatures (Friendly and not) and several other things (there's a list on their forums)			"

It's excellent, getting even better as things progress and on the road to being my definitive choice as the DK successor.I don't know how far and to what depth the topside will become. I truly hope it gets some serious attention and depth to make doing stuff up there compelling and interesting. Right now that part is quite basic and essentially just combat.

								I don't know why the reviews for this game are so high. There are so many competing titles that are more complete, more polished, and ultimately more enjoyable to play.A few issues:1. Finite resources - It's extremely easy to run out of resources and get stuck2. Poor feedback - It's hard to know why your economy is about to get stuck (food, money, etc.)3. 3D world is confusing - You can dig down to lower levels but figuring out how to get out of a hole or build a ladder or whatever is very confusingOverall it seems like the developers had a promising start but got stuck. And when you play, you'll feel the same way.If you want to scratch you itch for this type of game try Dungeons 2 or War for the Overworld instead.			"

								It's a very fun game for early access.  You can create a sprawling dungeon, train, feed and house troops, etc.  All the standard trappings of a Dungeon Keeper like game.  However, this one doesn't really play like Dungeon Keeper or War for the Overworld -- it's more like a simplified Dwarf Fortress, which is totally fine.  This game also uses different resources, e.g. wood and iron, which is an addition to the usual Dungeon Keep formula, again, more like a simplified Dwarf Fortress.  Digging is unusually satisfying in this game, I think because it's in more than two dimensions.  It could use more unit types and enemy types, but I think the developer is workin on it --  still early acces.I like it.			"

								Charming little game in the ""dungeon keeper"" subgenre. At the time of this writing the game is still in Early Access but very much playable. The UI can be clunky and some googling is necessery to figure out how to do some things, but the core game mechanics are sound. The graphics are not technically fancy but the art style is fantastic and the performance is rock solid bar the odd crash that (at least for me) has become very rare by now. The developer is active, communicates with the fans and fixes problems very quickly. For example I had some problems with getting the game to work with a 21:9 monitor, reported it in the forum and the dev fixed it in the next patch. Dwelvers game is full of humour and charm. It doesn't take itself too seriously and does not over-reach. Highly recommended to any fan of the genre.			"

								Update 10-15-16Developer can no longer support the game, he continues to post potential future updates but can no longer focus on the game. This game is either going to be abandoned or already is with hopes of minor development. Update 3-12-2016This game has positive reviews, the gameplay is pretty good for the $20 USD yet its unfinished and a few walkthroughs will prove that unfortunately. I am pretty annoyed of the 15 DLCs that are being advertised on Kickstarter.... The kickstarter states he wants to finish the game yet we are already talking about 15 DLCs??!!! I hope the core gets most of the attention and the DLC is more cosmetic... I'll update back to positive if the core game is finished and fullfilling without DLCs. Old Review:Overall, the game is clean and has future potential. I would recommend on sale at this point due to limited playability though. PROS:- Its a very functional ALPHA- Clean graphics and game play- Easy to jump intoCONS:- Limited replayability - at this time- Game play feels narrow, no creativity, just expand and get new soldiers.- Feels like you have limited control over the game. Hopefully more functions and micromanaging will be present in the future releases.			"

								This Game Truely gets down to the heart and soul of the orignal DK-DK2 (Dungon Keeper 1-2) although this game lacks some Basic UI and HUD that the (in my opion) DK had it is overall a great game. The intergration of different resoruces rather than just outright gold is much more appealing. Although the game lacks a multiplayer ATM i sure hope it does get put into the game with better control and list of your creatures as well as more clairty to the general game and add a few more less confusing buttons.IN SHORT: Great game,inventive,bad but not terriable UI HUD controls overall 7.5/10			"

								Creators seem to be remixing the Bullfrog Dungeon Keeper Series. Dungeon Keeper Gold and II.  An inspired game very similar to a remake of the original Dungeon Keeper.There's also that one, ""War for the Overlord""?  ..sorry, Overworld.. Both can't quite beat the Dungeon Keeper in my opinion..Though this new game does have it's differences.  First things I noticed was how you can not only dig out other areas you can dig down further into the ground as well.  It seems tricky to do manuvering the camera angles.  There is a pretty wide range of angles to view with.It looks like theres more to this game with clicking on each individual minon with different inventory and leveling system and such.  Seems a little complex.			"

								This game is absolutely addicting. There are some mechanics in the game that take a bit of getting used to, such as the pathing for your minions after cave-ins, but there is nothing that is insurmountable in this game. For an alpha, my experience has been relatively bug free, and the experience has been delightful. I would certainly recommend this game to people who enjoy managing small ecosystems, and a challenge that won't frustrate you too to great of a degree.			"

								I've only got around 10h into this one, but as far as i can tell, i'm half way ""through"" my first sandbox, so that should be ok for a pre-review :)This game is a shameless copycat of Dungeon Keeper with some additions/changes. Borrowing or totally copying the great grandmaster is no shame though. Why reinvent the wheel when it already works perfect?So, the good things first:- It's a shameless copycat of Dungeon Keeper with some additions/changes :-)- The major addition is: 3D. You not only build a 2D-Maze, you build it up and down too.- Considering the early access: It works! No crashes/big bugs in my whole playtime yet (sadly this has become a ""good"" point. Should be default, but as Dylan said: The times, they are a changing...)- It's cute and cuddly, if you consider that a ""plus"" :)- Trading routes seem like a nice idea. Could need a little work in the details though.- The UI looks well thought out. You can acces most things with two clicks or two keys. As a keyboard-user that suits me wellAnd here're the downfalls:- The music is annoying. Just after some minutes i just wanted to punch it in the face. With a brick. Multiple times. Maybe just a matter of taste- The whole 3D-Maze could get a little frustrating. It get's bigger and bigger, deeper and deeper and if building on multiple places i always loose oversight. Maybe you're smarter :-)- Not that much rooms yet. After some minutes you're done with the basics, from there on you're ""just"" exploring, leveling, killing.So far it makes a solid impression for an early-access-title. If you're into Dungeon Keeper or similar games, go get it! It's fairly priced too! If there will be more rooms added, it will definately be a keeper (no pun intended).If you're not sure if you'd buy this one or War For The Overworld: This one is the ""cute"" sister with some things different than WFTO which tries to be Dungeon Keeper 3 (which is totally ok!).

								Every level seems to start with a bloated demon barfing out imps to do my bidding, and it is all uphill from there!Verdict: I would very much recommend this game to anyone that likes the dungeon (or whatever) building/management sim genre. The game is still early in its dev, but it seems like it will be a winner. It's a pretty solid buy (around $10) but if you're not into the whole early access thing, it might be best to wait.Pros:-The basic game seems pretty established. Dungeon building/management sim-The interface is useable if not all that pretty.-Graphically the game has a charmingly simple cartoonish look-The inventory system for individual units is a fresh element that I haven't seen in the genre previously.-this game has a huge amount of potentialCons:-as of 9/21/14 the game is still early in its dev-lots of content seems incomplete or missing-some of the unit ai seems to be flawed "

Key provided by developer/publisher. This does not effect my review.Dwelvers is a real time strategy game where The player takes the role of an evil Dungeon Lord who guides its minions through building their own dungeon, below and above the surface. Manage elaborate production chains, cater to the needs and quirks of each monster and lead them to battles against other monsters and pathetic humans. CommentsGameplay: Very addicting dungeon manager game with a detailed economy, crafting, traps, and much more. Friendly to players with less experience and those with lots of experience as well. Start off by recruiting evil minions to do your dirty work and develop the ultimate dungeon! You will be expanding your evil lair by utilizing free-roam building. Construct your evil lair however you want!Difficulty: It is no simple task managing several different resources at once and making sure our poor underlings do not die of starvation. The difficulty is there for more experienced and committed players, but the fun is also there for those who just want to mess around and have a good time. Graphics: top-down (camera that can be rotated) with a nice 3D style. Graphics are very easy to pick up and go well with the general aspects of the game. However, sometimes it is a little hard to see with the lighting. Camera angles are difficult to manage.Content: You can spend minutes or several hours on this game exploring, conquering, and expanding your dungeon. Very fun and addicting once you get started.Sound: for me this is a weak point; the sounds in this game are not the best.Micromanaging: If you enjoy managing things to the smallest detail, you will greatly enjoy playing this game. There is a lot of detail in everything, creatures have their own name, inventory, skills, ect. Controls: not that great, feels limited. They are very confusing and take some getting used to.Mechanics: Very solid and enjoyable. You have to manage food and other resources that you gather and need for your minions.Bugs/glitches: For the most part polished out, but some still exist. Nothing too extreme, just a few annoying bugs.Other features: A variety of different structures to build. Training camps for your troops, bars for when they need a drink, farms to harvest food, storage rooms to keep all your treasures, and many more. Maps are randomly generated, so your experience will be different each time you start a new game. Complex traps that can also be built (for those willing to spend time and thought).Final overviewDwelvers is a very exciting but complicated sandbox dungeon manager game. Has a few glitches and lighting issues. Addicting, stimulating, and fun! Verdict: 6/10Review done for Vantom Giveaways, key provided by developer.  "

								Dwelvers has a lot of potential.  The tutorial is a bit lacking in certain areas but makes up for it with its humor and light-hearted nature.  Being a fan of ""Dungeons"" and ""A Game of Dwarves"", I was able to dive into this without too much trouble.  For those of you not familiar with games of this genre, you'll have resources that you'll need to collect and resource chains that you'll have to construct in order to grow your base.  You can dig out blocks in order to make rooms and then seed these rooms with various objects.  I'm anxious to see what else the game will offer once it officially launches.

								Dwelvers is the spiritual successor to the Dungeon Keeper series, and keeps the feel very much alive even in its early state.  I'm in fact writing this review because of some negativity I've been reading regarding its pre-release quirks(the tutorials not quite catching, occasional unit bug, etc.), and I'd like to balance that out.  Yes, it's a little rough around the edges, but this is not a finished product.  The developers are very upfront with this little tidbit, so anyone that thinks the game is terrible based on its current state is very sad, as the game is quite fun.You start with a single room, where your units spawn, and must dig out areas for your soon-to-grow brood.  Each combat unit has different needs that require satisfying, giving the planning stage some variety.  Beds, a kitchen, a farm, a well, all these and more you'll place down to keep your minions satisfied, and ready to wreak havoc on those around them.  There are random monsters inhabiting the underground, lending variety to what could have been a boring excavation phase.  As you expand, you'll find pathways leading to the surface, where the game starts to get more interesting.Exploring outside of the subterranean world leads to new issues, namely, humans.  Once they're aware of your existence, they want nothing more than to put you down.  Then you can make all kinds of nasty traps in your maze of tunnels and caves that is your personal lair.  Whether using ambushes or the hydraulic mechanics(or both), it's fun taking down the invaders, monster or human.All in all, the game is a pre-release and that does shine through occasionally.  Does that detract from the fun? Absolutely not, as I've sunk a lot of offline hours into this game already.  The potential here is massive, and the game just oozes character.  If any of this sparked your imagination, just grab the game, and get digging.  You'll be glad you did.			"

Early Access Review
								Skip to the bottom for the TL:DR sectionWhen I first saw this, i thought it was a lame ripoff of the dungeon keeper games, or even their younger estranged step-sister, the Dungeons games.  Since the dungeon keeper sort of genera is incredibly difficult to nail correctly, i had absolutely no hope for this game.  So I picked up the free demo on their website ((which steam does not have yet,)) and gave it a shot to see how badly it failed.  45 minutes later, i was purchasing the full game.  Or rather, the pre-alpha.  Even as a pre-alpha game that is no where near complete, it is a LOT of fun with only one minor visual bug that i've found so far.  I just spent roughly...7 hours i believe playing the sandbox in a single play.   The game is a little difficult at the beginning.  There is a minotaur maze in the game that I had wandered into on accident intended as your end game challenge.  I was slaughtered, barely managing to block off the minotaurs before retreating.  But the next 5 hours of my game play was a satisfying mix of raiding smaller groups of weaker enemies and looking for new armor and weapons I could give to my fighters, and developing infrastructure to support my rapidly growing horde.  every complaint I have about this game is due purely to the fact that it is in alpha.  Resources are a bit imbalanced with wood being painfully difficult to get ((but a good incentive to leave your base and explore the underworld)) and stone far far too plentiful with massive piles of it stacking up in my store rooms.  ((this gave me incentive to construct more rooms and find more resources))  There was a single broken texture having to do with placing a skull candle in a prison cell breaking the texture of the wall below it.  However, this will not stop me from playing much much more of this game!  About 7 hours into the game and only on easy, so I cant wait to amp up the difficulty!  TL;DR This game is freakin sweet and an incredible reboot of the dungeon master genera of game.  I highly recommend playing it and beg you to forgive the slightly off balancing issue, as it is still in alpha and will be fixed soon, I am sure.  Play the demo to see if you like the genera and if you do, BUY IT!			"

								Built a pretty dungeon. Then all my workers decided to idle and starve to death, with piles of food sitting on the floor in front of them. Then I raided the surface, and 500 humans suddenly swarmed from the edges of the underground map and destroyed my settlement of 30 or so minions.My favorite part was the orcs who complained that there was no beer, because it wasn't in the bar, because the workers wouldn't bring the beer to the bar, nor make any more, nor even farm the basic ingrediants even though there were massive fields with workers standing idly in them, doing absolutely nothing but be filled with crops that will never be harvested forever.8/10 would Dwelve again.

								Dungeon Keeper fans rejoice!  This game, for being in Alpha mode, is actually very polished.  The graphics are fun, a cel-shaded sort along the vein of Jet set Radio (maybe a stretch, but its the 1st that comes to mind).  It takes the simple ideas of Dungeon Keeper and really expands on them.  We get to see a non-playable ""over-world"" that could really enhance the game play.  It gives you layers, literally.  At one point i was like 7 layers down.  It gives you an economy and trading.  If the developers can keep up with the direction their going and not cave to the so-called ""proper sequel"" that is also in early access they can easily rack up a huge fan base.Pros:it's dungeon keeper (should say it all)it's small, only around a 100MB of Hard drive spacethe area is fracking huge.  In one dungeon i was 7 layers down and still finding places to go on layer 1the developers released a perfectly playable alpha, well worth the 15 bucks.excellent developer interaction, often responding to ideas and comments.Cons:the tutorial still needs work.  this should happen as development continues, but at its current phase it is lackingno way to speed up time.  some gamers like it, some don't.The Mother needs, NEEDS, more dialog.  The same insult over and over....The micro-management of the various rooms needs work, play it and you'll seeCamera feels clunky, and the spots its anchored at is, well, weird.What it needs:Multiplayer!  How cool would it be to fight another clan for territory?  Or have humans and imps raiding each other?The sandbox thing is nice, but it needs objectives of some kind.Overall:Buy it.  you wont be disappointed, if you keep in mind it is still in alpha.  Yes it has bugs, but nothing game crashing yet.  You dont need an AlienWare PC to play it, and it doesn't feel like a mobile port.  Younger kids can certainly enjoy playing it as well.Who's it for:Dungeon keeper Fans, resource management fans, fantasy fans.5 and upthis is an alpha review, i can/will change the review as it develops "

								While the game seems unfinished, and shallow in its current state, this game has more potential then any other game I've ever seem. (except Terraria, sorry) You can currently beat the hardest ""thing"" in the game in less than 10 hours on the highest difficulty. This is probably worth the money in its current state, but future updates could turn this into one of the best values on steam.  In conclusion, its unfinished and in early access but this game might become the next game everybody plays, records on you tube, and raves about if the Dev keeps it up (and adds multi-player} I highly recommend.

								keep in mind that this review was written during 0.8e early accessDwelvers is a top-down Dungeonkeeper-style game with inspiration from the settlersthis games focus seems to be on creating an efficient production line in order to keep your minions happy and well armed, to do this, you must build a farm to create flour, then a cookery in order to create bread with the flour and water, as well as beer for your minions to drink, then you need a bar in order to give your minions somewhere to consume these productsone thing that is very different from Dungeonkeeper and this game is that, instead of having all furniture and such be automaticly created upon room construction, you have to build these yourself, which means that the rooms you create are going to be more expensive than you may first expectthe game also seems to be very stable to me, as i also played on the apparent untested ""multi-threading"" option and have yet to experiance a crashI really like the graphics too, as well as the music, the graphics has kind of a ""a game of dwarfs"" feel to them for me, and the music is fantastic.another thing is that you can individualy equip your minions with equipment that you can create, trade for or just find in a chest somewhere on the map, which i really likea gripe with the game though is that the AI needs to be worked on, as of now, it seems to be doing alot of idling when there is work to do, and may just stand on a tile where something is supposted to be build just waiting on the required resources to be deliverd to them, which is annoying to say the least, and hopefully they will go to fix this problem ASAPanother, although more minor, is the apparent lack of minion variery, as so i have only seen about 4 different types, though from the look of it it seems that they will include more as the head, leg and boots slots of the equipment screen are never usedall in all, i think this game has alot of potential to become a really great game, and i'm excited to see what is next			"

You control a dungeon of Imps, Orcs and other hellish creatures, who need resources and supplies. You have to build rooms for them to meet those needs and search for resources. The world is full of other dungeons which you have to battle and take over. It's just pure fun and very addictive. Unlike the recently failed attempt by EA to re-introduce this style of game, this title has NO micro transactions.... did you hear me ""NO MICROTRANSACTIONS!""  So do yourself a favour and give this genius gem a try!			"

								I got this game about a year and a half  before it came out on Steam and supported it long before it was ever on kickstarter. The game itself is great, it's got everything you could want, it IS rough around the edges right now and at times it shows and at other times you won't even notice it, but it's early access so that's perfectly fine. The best part of this game that I wanted to commend was the developer, he is as honest and down to earth as they come, and genuinly cares about his game. In todays age I think that something like that deserves more praise than I can give with just one thumbs up, so please get the game, and give it a try if it looks even remotely fun. With the steam refund system you literally have nothing to lose but a few minutes of your time and what you get out of it is the possibilty to help support a developer and a game that speaks to the best part of the gamer in all of us.

								It has potential. But at this time (alpha) it's not nearly ready yet. Pros: If it gets a campaign like dungeon keeper it'll have awesome gameplay.It's very stable. Hasn't crashed once for me.As said, has potential for greatness.Cons:It's single threaded (uses only 12.5% of a modern cpu).The priorities of the imps cannot be adjusted, and are not nearly optimal.Production chains break very easily if you aren't careful.Sometimes monsters can't figure out how to drink and eat despite sitting in the bar with food in the next room over.The room links are confusing and don't always seem to work.The mouse input is captured even when tapping out of the game, so you'll end up sitting in a dark corner when you return. Has the same problem similar games like gnomoria have - too much clutter to store and move slows down the system immensely.  "

								I've followed this game for some time, I played it in the beginning for a few hours... but regardless of updates and patches, it's still very rough. The graphics look compressed, cheap, tacky (missing some shaders tharr?), the options are very limited; AA? AF? Low/Med/High at least? Not really, there's no 'high' details, there's obviously a launcher option for it, but whether you can call it 'high' is another story. No windowed resizable, borderless, either play a pre-defined size or be forced on to the ever so unstable (for any game) 'Fullscreen'... but at least you get to set your FPS to 120 or something right?  .... nupe. Very lacking.The menu's still ugly, UI just got an update, it's still tacky and ugly and thats before you get to the gameplay, which is much like the old Dungeon Keeper classics, only... less polished and with more micro-management.Few bugs.. random crashes.. random stoppages mid-event screwing your game over, random pawn fails.Don't get me wrong, there is gameplay, but you'll pick it up, play it a few hours, put it down and barely ever touch it again.This is a game that is suppose to be 'released' May this year and is still in 'alpha', still Kickstarter'ing and still in 'Early Access' (which for this long, should be made illegal) - for what the game currently is, it's not worth £14.99, half maybe.The whole ""one man team, oh woe is he/she"" doesn't really fly anymore, better games have been made for far less.Wait until it's 'released', this ""Early Access"" rubbish really just isn't worth the waiting, if they ever 'release'.

Thanks to Mello Tonin for the correction - although at the time of this writing tthe game crashes all the time.  I'd wait until they add more content, such as the upper realm & fix all bugs before I'd recommend buying it.I'll add new updates to my review as updates are released.**UPDATE**  Looks like all the criticism I was receiving before (despite the game having been out for over a year already) was on point.  The lead developer just released a statement saying he couldn't raise enough money and is now on to other things.This game has never been anything more than a glorified dungeon construction manager.  There is no substance to it.  No wild and exciting adventures to be had alone or with your pals.♥♥♥♥ this game all to hell and ♥♥♥♥ the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who got on my case about the release date -- you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s know that whole thing is a ♥♥♥♥ing sham.I don't care if a game isn't even in beta yet, if you're selling it you owe it to your customers to deliver.MOTHA ♥♥♥♥ DWELVERS AND MOTHA ♥♥♥♥ MELLO TONIN FOR DEFENDING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER SEEN THE LIGHT OF DAY TO BEGIN WITH.

								Tried this game off the strength of the reviews and granted I know its alpha, but wow its terrible!! It is absolutely impossible to control how things are built, constantly having production facilities sitting idle (tried linking, no idea what that does, didn't work), tried unbuilding, rebuilding, still didn't work. I end up just creating a giant hole accidentally digging deeper instead of actually building what I'm trying to F'n build! Tried building extra paths to some of the faciltiies that might be blocked, tried taking manual control over creatures, nothing is working! Tried a couple games now, same result, everyone starves inside of 20 minutes. Tried the tutorial, built everything that was indicated and progressed through it, still the supply chain sat idle and everyone starved. After two frustrating hours, this game is a total waste!			"

								First off, this is nothing like Dungeon Keeper. Get that out of your mind. It is a 3D dungeon simulator.  The game is overly complex and very buggy.  Anytime I hear that a game has a ""steep learning curve"" I cringe, that basically means bad tutorials ... and this one has a VERY steep learning curve and VERY bad tutorials.  You will need to watch countless videos just to learn how to feed your troops and keep them from killing you.The challenge is not in the dungeon enemies or the environment, its in the poor interface and concept design.

								Muy buen juego, pero con falencias...No me malinterpreten, SI BIEN LA IDEA ES ""COPIADA"" DE UN JUEGO MUY CONOCIDO Y ESTÁ PARA CONSIDERARSE COMO PLAGIO, ES UN JUEGO MUY BUENO, AÚN EN SU ESTADO.Para estar donde está lejos de ser terminado, puedo asegurar que no funciona tan mal.Por otro lado es un juego que no vale lo que piden, lamentablemente lo compré y después de un rato ya no hay nada que hacer en esta instancia, tampoco prometen una solución como mas adelante lo detallo, pero si dicen que van agregar algunas cosas. Si está a mas de U$s7 no lo compres.Si bien los desarrolladores se encargan de responder y respaldar inmediatamente a los usuarios(compradores), presentan falencias con afirmaciones como esta: ""Access to additional content, that Steam users won’t get access to.*"" y CITO: *When I say additional content I don’t mean anything that will change the gameplay itself. Steam have achievements, while I can still have that in the DRM free version it will not be the same thing. The same goes for multiplayer, I can’t make it the same in both versions as Steam has a its own system for this. Steam buyers gets something extra because Steam has some advantages by default. We can call it extras, but perhaps it’s not, it’s just some things that will make the DRM free users be able to play on the same conditions as the Steam users.I can’t say exactly what these things will be yet because I haven’t come that stage in the development, and I don’t want to make promises I have to reject later on.""Originally posted by rasmus_ljunggren:The DRM free version will be updated, probably more often than the Steam version as I prefer to take some of the major updates through the website and get them properly tested before introducing them to Steam. I can't say exactly what extra content the DRM free version will have at the moment, but just as the Steam version will have some content that the DRM free version won't have, the DRM free version will have additional content that the Steam version won't have. También te piden que lo compres en su sitio web para que Steam no les saque una parte de las ganancias, prometiendote keys y futuros e inciertos(según lo hablado con ellos) objetos y mejoras que A LOS USUARIOS DE STEAM no le van a dar.CASI 1 AÑO DESPUÉS..

								Very nice. It isn't exactly what I expected - but not in a BAD way. Worth the price I paid for it so far in its current state. Everything beyond here is just added value for what I already feel is my moneys worth.			"

								The best in its category.I found this game excellent, and really impressive. The fantasy of editors it's amazing. You in the end have to manage different races of beasts, each one with his needs and wishes, mine looking for resources and commerce with other settlements.Despite of other management game as for example Settlers, you could even break the expansion and enjoy your citizens living and working.There are two areas, the underworld and the surface, and in the end you conquer both.

								NIce dungeon building game similar to an older game, but this has nice graphics and character animations. Obviously this is sill in alpha and there is a lot more content to be added, but the core concept is sound and I'm looking forward to the next added features.			"

								Was really searching for a good Dungeon Builder, and did a lot of them recently. Dwelvers is like a far dream getting closer after each patch. It's no't perfect, but I'm pretty sure this game will become a reference in his category.""Basically"" one of the true sons of  the good ol'Dungeon keeper style, Dwelvers allows the player to build his classical badass dungeon underground, in a unique mix of simulation/exploration of the under and the overworld.I recommend it so far.Cos it's Awsome.

								A bit of a surprise, this game.  I was expecting more of Dungeon Keeper and yes there are DK elements in the game as well as a whole lot more.  I am on mobile broadband and I play offline so my play time isn't registered by Steam, hence the 11 minutes played is actually over 5 hours.  I sat down to play for an hour last night and five hours later I finally dragged myself away only because I needed sleep so badly.  The game is fairly simple to get in and get started until you run out of a resource and then think that maybe you should have done that a bit differently.  I haven't done the tutorials so half the time I have no idea of what I am doing but then something happens and I figure that bit out so the learning curve is not steep, an enjoyable game to dive right into. In spite of the game being easy to get in to I am pretty sure there is a lot more to this game for me to discover and i plan to spend my Easter weekend doing just that.  Highly recommended.			"

								A good Game, the developers help make it better and it has many things to do so far, its good, but it will be better when its finished, also, it has some function other games dont have, very intense battles when your minions fight the humans on the surface, and when the humans attack you while underground, in overall its a good game. But the only downsides are that its sorta limited, like once you have the whole underground conquered and  no more enemies underground, the minions sometimes tend to stop and just idle instead, which really jacks up the game. A good game, people should try it, good job to the developers for making such a great game.			"

								I'll change this I'm sure when it's closer to finished. I've already seen all that it currently has. It has tons of potential. They released a new creature in the last update that riots all the time so now I don't see how the game could be fun even for the few hours to see what's happening so far. I hope they fix that asap, it's already been awhile though, and hopefully the work on it some more soon and I'll change this to positive.The game was working for me and something in one of the last patches has made it so it will not launch once again. Total disappointment.3/4/15 many updates and the game still isn't launching for me. At this point i guess I'll just uninstall it and forget it.6/15/15 this game still won't launch for me. no idea what the issue is since it worked in the past.8/20/15 I finally found the solution to my rare problem. I posted it in the comments of this review. I can now happily recommend this game. It's still early access but fun with tons of potential to be a great long term game.			"

								A very fun game in the same genre as Dungeon Keeper before they messed that up. Dwelvers makes an exellent spiritual successor to DK and other games of the genre, even in it's (As of March 2016) unfinished state			"

								[EDIT} Abandoned. Dont waste your money.[Old review]If you're ok with testing, you can put up with the bugs and you like the Dungeon Keeper genre then this is a great example.Its not a straight out DK clone either. It can stand on its own with a host of different features like production chains and resource management as well as three dimentional dungeon creation. This means you need to provide your minions with food and drink and weapons and armor. You can also be more creative and build things like a lava moat around your base. Oh and theres a lot of hydrualic options aswell, although i havnt played around with these yet so i cant comment on how they work.A mention also must be made for the developer Rasmus who despite being extremely busy working on the game still takes time out on the games own website and steam forums to answer posts and help out players.Overall a very enjoyable game even in early access as long as you accept the inevitable bugs.
