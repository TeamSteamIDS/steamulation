												Put a quarter into the arcade machine and play this one. Ignore the cheesy chip tune (or turn it off in the options), ignore the shooter game it starts with, because in a sudden twist you'll find yourself in a platformer with a teleport gun that handles arcade style: no blue and orange portals, just straight up teleports and precision jumps that let you reach where you want to reach, provided you can figure out and make the jumps.Don't pass this one by while it's on sale.

												Ok, let's be honest: I bought this game for 0,19€ and thought it would be 'okay' for a couple of minutes, I'd grab the cards and then it would disappear in the library, never to be looked at again. After the first 20 minutes I had to admit that the game is quite entertaining and after seeing the ending I didn't even notice that I've played it for over an hour. Sure the (retro-style) pixel graphics and the 16-bit sound seem to be standard for every second indie game, but in 'Out There Somewhere' they do their job quite good, they made me feel a bit nostalgic and are very charming (I really like this music in the main menu). The portal gun and the different puzzles are well done and I seriously had to think sometimes how to solve this room. Green, red and blue light beams, jumping, momentum - there are several things to consider when shooting that little bullet. Yeah it is a short game with a short 'story' (the bad guy shoots at me, my ship crashes and I have to explore the planet to finally kill the bad guy. All of this because of... reasons!) and a length of approximately one hour for the first playthrough. However during this short period I've been entertained well and it never felt repetitive. In addition there are many interesting achievements that bring in some replay value, so I'd say it's definitly worth this small price and I have to admit: Developers, you've done a really nice job!

												Let me start by saying that I bought this with 96% discount for 19c. The title grabbed my attention, and so I just had to try it. What else could I buy for 19 cents anyway? I can't think of many other things, and certainly not something that could keep me entertained for several hours like this little gem did.What is it about?Out there somewhere is a short 2D puzzle-platformer with a few simple but interesting mechanics. For me personally, it feels like a mash-up of Portal, The Swapper and You Have to Win the Game, which is a good thing because I like all of those games.You take a role of Yuri - the space cop, who tries to protect the mothership from a bad guy Grigori. Your ship was shot down and crashed on an unknown planet. Now you have to find missing parts, repair your shuttle and face Gregori once again…GameplayAlthough the very first segment of the game is a classic arcade-machine-style space shooter, don't be fooled. The whole gameplay is based on jumping around with teleportation gun, solving puzzles. How it works is, you fire ""teleshots"" and you are instantly teleported the moment they hit the surface. Your telegun also stores your momentum, which is another important little mechanic to keep in mind. There are obviously different surfaces, obstacles and problems throughout the levels, and it's all up to you to solve.Later in game, you'll get a pew pew gun to deal with enemies if you so desire, but you can very well just avoid most of them...SidenotesPuzzles are challenging but fun. There are plenty of checkpoints, so even if you die, it's not a major setback most of the time.Even though the visual style is simple, I really dig the concept art and the cutscenes, as well as chiptune soundtrack - it's surprisingly not as monotonous and annoying as I thought it would be. I think it all works well with the space theme, too. Not to forget, there are even some funny little easter eggs and references here and there, and I'm always a big fan of those.Like I mentioned before, this game is short. Even taking it reaaally slow and casual, it took me only 3 hours to beat. You could very possibly manage to do your first playthrough in 90 minutes. There's even achievement for finishing the game in under 20 minutes… There's some replayability thanks to Steam achievements, but even then, you shouldn't expect endless hours of fun. On the other hand - it's a very simple game in terms of game mechanics, and it could get boring and repetitive if it took too long. I guess it depends on how you look at it. I would say it's reasonable for what it is.ConclusionWhat can I say, it's a nice little game. It requires thinking and quick reactions, and thanks to that, it can be pretty challenging. It's a kind of one-trick-pony, but well executed IMHO. I know some people might feel it's too short for the full price, but I definitely do recommend it when it's in sale.			"

												Bought it for 17 cents during the summer sale, and out of all the games I bought (Garry's Mod,  etc.) this was still my favorite. Very platform-y, and not only has great music but also great visuals. Would higly reccomend to anyone. Best 17 cents of my life.			"

												Out There Somewhere is an aesthetically pleasing puzzle platformer that makes use of teleporting and various environmental obstacles. The art and gameplay are both well done, and it is a nice treat. The mechanics of the game are easy to pick up and there is an even balance between execution and solution in the puzzles (in other words, it takes some thinking as well as fast fingers). Not to be confused with a portal gun (where you make two doors and enter freely), when you fire your telegun you are teleported when your projectile hits a solid surface. There are obstacles (crumbling surfaces, mirrors, glass, some beams, and enemies) that are thrown into the mix to keep things interesting. The controls all feel solid, and, given the length, the game was fair in challenge and pacing.There is very little combat (most enemies can be avoided) and there are 3 boss fights (1 being a repeat). That being said, unless you get health upgrades, there can be some challenge in avoiding everything or killing everything. The main game is rather short if you are focused on just beating the game (my first run with very little exploration clocked in just over an hour), however I highly recommend you take the time to explore and find all the upgrades: these areas are some of the more challenging of the game. The story and dialogue feel underdeveloped, and overall I was left wanting more of the game in general, but I do not consider this a bad thing.Out There Somewhere is light on combat and easy on your backlog, but those looking for a clever puzzle platformer should check it out.

 About Out There Somewhere Game starts off as a shoot'em up side-scroller, which really took me by surprise. I mean, judging by the screens you'd rather expect a puzzle platformer and you get that not so long after the game starts, too. And then it just hit me, the brilliance of the idea: you fly, fighting your way to a new planet. Then you land, 'meet the locals' and proceed with the featured mission, which involves solving puzzles, fighting your way forward and doing some cool oldschool platformer type trickjumps. It's just all there. Again, really awesome mix. Gameplay	The puzzle part is rather fun, the puzzles are not terribly easy, but also not too complicated. Can't imagine spending 8 minutes trying to beat one though (one of the achievements). As the game progresses, different beams are implemented, which change the behaviour of your teleport gun. The variety of enemies is rather limited - 4 kinds, erasing them is a bit of a chore, spam your gun until they drop dead. The game could feature no enemies and no one would probably miss them. The NPCs remind me the ones in old NES games, like Duck Tales, sometimes you have to sweat a little to get to them, but they might have some useful information or will say some funny things.The shoot'em up part is just there I guess. It covers approx. 5% of a game that lasts for an hour, so you don't really spend too much time in it, shame.Graphic	It's mostly just your basic 'oldschool-nes-like-game-graphics'. Anyway, the art style is pleasant to watch. The only thing that somehow buggered me was that some maps looked a bit mundane and dull, with only same bricks of terrain laid over another same bricks of terrain. Adding more background details and decorations would probably make the game look a bit nicer, but then again, it's not really about the graphics this time, is it?All in All Out There Somewhere is a really good Indie Game!8/10 From MeSweep 	 "

Product received for free
Basic InformationTitle:  Out There SomewhereDeveloper:  MiniBossPublisher:  EQ-Games, MiniBossGenre:  Classic style platformerGeneral ImpressionOut There Somewhere is a 2D platformer that emulates the classic side-scrolling action of older titles while offering a breath of fresh air in the almost entire absence of platforming sections.  The story is all about a stranded astronaut trying to survive. Quite odd for a platformer is the lack of many enemies as well. You will mostly teleport here and there with ocassional text based dialogue pop-ups. This is definitely more an experience about exploration than combat and avoiding obstacles. Even if the game is rather short it felt a bit boring at times. It features simple graphics and sounds but for its price point and considering the inclusion of Cards and Achievements, the game is ultimately worth trying out.Strong Points+ Plenty of collectibles.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points-  Unbalanced difficulty.- Too short.Rating 6/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

												I've never seen this mechanic before, it's very fun and gives some interesting puzzle platforming. And it is well explored in the level design. I love the visuals too. Quality pixel art, very cute. The game is mostly on the easy side. I figured out the mechanics quickly and at worst I died 3 to 4 times on the hardest rooms. The bullet hell sections, however, are pretty hard! at least to me, I hate bullethell games. It is a very small part of the game, but it makes me wonder about mixing such completely different genres. Here it didn't take anything from the game but I remember feeling quite disappointed with Brutal Legends, for example, because I went in expecting to play an action fighting game in an open world and found myself playing an RTS. I don't like RTS so I couldn't enjoy the game, no matter how good it is. But I digress. This is not an issue with Out There Somewhere, the spaceship sessions are short and few.It's extremely short though. But without considering price, length is not a very useful information. What I mean by that is I think the game is worth what they are asking for it. It's a short adorable, original and fun little game and it's cheaper than a sandwich. I'm a very satisfied custommer.

												Out There Somewhere is a nice platformer where you initially drive a spaceship, then you explore a planet full of weird aliens, and finally you get into your spaceship again for the final confrontation.You can beat the game in well under two hours, and as far as I can tell there is not much replay value (unless you want to collect the several achievements that Steam lets you collect). I recommend this game as long as you buy it at a discount, since it's a very short game. However, it is well done, it sometimes requires some reasoning to travel through certain screens, there are several secret screens and collectables thrughout the game, and its aesthetics is overall nice.Plus: it's chocked full of sci-fi (mostly Star Trek, but not only that) references, which is always good!

Note: video review embedded below.There’s something untraditionally appealing about Out There Somewhere’s insubstantiality. It’s a very brief, straightforward experience, but rather than feeling shallow it uses its brevity to subvert the players expectations in interesting ways.That arcade shooting segment at the start? That’s just a prelude to the platformer that takes up most of the game. That gun you’re carrying? It’s actually for teleporting you around instead of killing enemies. The huge world the game seems to be hinting at? In reality it’s a more classical one direction platformer. Out There Somewhere is full of little touches that seemed designed to throw you off course and surprise you with how things play out. They may come at the cost of making a lasting impression, but I feel like that wasn’t ever its prerogative.Out There Somewhere also gets away with a lot more than most games could because of how strong its mechanics are, and how intrinsically they’re tied to level designs. The teleporter gun is largely your only tool throughout the game, and each screen is made to perfectly utilize it for platforming and puzzle solving (provided your reflexes are up for it). Eventually I was having to take into account bullet speed, character momentum, and environmental devices in order to navigate effectively. These additions are added quickly, but also scale the difficulty smoothly enough to where I almost didn’t realize how much more involved later levels were because the game had taught me how to play so well.One could argue that Out There Somewhere is too short or simple or loose, and they wouldn’t be entirely wrong. The game often feels as if it’s holding on by a thread and some frustrating moments can be a lot more unpleasant due to how much of the overall game they encompass. But its length and careful scope feel so intentional and considered that I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and enjoy how it played with my expectations. I might not remember it a year or even a month from now, but as a condensed experiment in teleportation and unconventional design I don’t regret the journey.

Short story, unusal game mechanics, pretty good soundtrack. But I don't know, there is something wrong with jumping... Sometimes you just can't jump again after using a teleporter and it's really annoying. Actually this game is about teleporting and reaching new grounds. "

												Out there somewhere is a nice platformer with a decent ""old-school"" feel -- it's not a strained and missed attempt to cash in on nostalgia for ""retro"" games; quite the opposite it feels and looks solid like all the parts belong where they are. The platforming can be pretty challenging at times due to the addition of a teleport gun gimmick that teleports the character to wherever the bullet lands. Add in conservation of momentum across teleports, ability to shoot multiple tele-bullets at a time, and special beams of light and you get some neat platforming! Akin to old platformers the game world has its share of secret rooms and hidden bonuses that await the daring explorer. Also monsters and other baddies, a big bad boss, and two space shmup sections! Overall a pretty short experience -- around 1 hour for a casual experience, or under 20 mins for a speed run -- but between the secrets and a speedrunning challenge there's enough to warrant an extra play or two.

												I have to say, this may verry well be the best $.49 I have ever spentPros-Amazing teleport mechanic-Good difficulty curve-Great Music-Treeman-Overall gameplay is greatCons-It's short-Bats-somewhat annoying combat systemBartle TaxonomyKillers: Not the best game for these guys. You only get one gun, and it's not that powerfull. Not the best game for this type of player.Achievers: Many achivements and ingame collectables to get. A great game for this type of player.Socialisers: There is some interaction with aliens, but not a whole lot. Most aliens only have one line. There won't be much of any replay value for this type of player, but for the first time through it will be decent.Explorers: Explorers should have a great time with this game. When playing through it, I often saw places I couldn't reach from my current position and thought ""How can I get over there?"" There are many hidden places to find. This type of player will have a great time with this game.Score:7/10Make the combat less annoying, have more interaction with aliens, and make the game a bit longer. These are the only complaints I have about this game. However, for it's price, I highly recomend this game.			"

												A nice little game, I got a copy early but never actually got around to playing it so I figured I'd do that now.What is it?Well it's basically a semi-portal metroidvania. You have a teleport gun that moves you to where it shoots, with it carrying over momentum so when you jump it keeps your speed. That being the core mechanic of the game it does it very well. You have to utilise you teleport gun along with various world objects to get around.Is it something I like? No, it's really not my style of game.Is it something I'd recommend? Definitely, it is a very solid platformer with an emphasis on timing. Don't let the chep price fool you, it's certainly worth a lot more than they are charging.			"

												A fun, charming and creative puzzle platformer. It pushes the creativity of its teleporting mechanic very far. Only lasted about an hour but it was really enjoyable.This game is a bit challenging and forces you to think about what you're doing. One thing I loved was that failing a level didn't have a lengthy game over screen, or a splash. It would throw you right back in which kept the action up. And even if was only 3 or 4 enemies I also liked that the game had some combat. I'd love to see the idea expanded. I think there's a lot of hidden depth in the teleporting mechanic that the developers didn't exploit this time around. This is a  great game that's worth a try.			"

												I bought this game in one of those infamous 19¢ sales at some point in the distant past, never actually thinking I would play it.  Then one day I fired it up, saw it was a terrible side-scrolling space shooter, and uninstalled it.Except...that is a fake-out, as anyone who has played for more than a few minutes knows, and once that is finished you get to play through a brisk but still roundly enjoyable (and adorable) kind of simple platformer-meets-Portal.  Well, teleporting, not portals, but it certainly calls that to mind.The pixel art is gorgeous, the soundtrack matches perfectly, and it will probably make you feel smart when you figure out some of the trickier puzzles.  Totally worth 19¢.  I daresay I would pay upwards of DOLLARS for it!			"

												After beating the game several times, I gotta say I feel bad I got this when it was on -96% sale.This was a surpisingly good indie game to me. I didn't know what to expect before installing it but since I saw from some other reviews that the game was short I decided to give it a chance. I'm glad I did.The game is a conventional 2D exploration platformer for the asthetics, but combines it with some Portal mechanics and specially with the Cave Story gameplay style. The game takes place into an uncharted dark world that together with the main character look-a-like give that final Limbo taste. So actually the devs' description about the game is accurate enough.You accidentally land into this planet so the goal is basically finding a way to repair it and get rid of the people who chased you. A very soft story but heh, aside from Ori and the Blind Forest, no one expects a deep storymode from a 2D platformer, do they?Graphics are cute and satisfying to my eyes. Even though the world is constantly dark, you feel pretty immersed in it soon enough. Also, the few places where the story take place are quite varied so you don't feel you're just stepping into the same thing over and over. Music is surprisingly catchy. I've always liked chiptune/8bit/16bit music and this game catches the point. Damn, this game is worthy just for that, guys!Gameplay is perfect as usual in 2D platformers. Tight and fair, every death will be at your own fault. The physics of the portal gun, the jumps, the movement and those devices that works with the gun respond as they should.As an exploration game, the game is rewarding. I didn't care to play this game 4 times, and between them I just discovered new things, which was charming considering how short the game is. The map is pretty well developed and I can only critisize the fact that to get full map exploration you need to avoid some checkpoints until you get the laser gun so you can die and restart from start point with it.Puzzles are fair and not frustrating. I'm usually super derp with these games since I usually think answers too much and never reach the end, uninstalling the game eventually. But this one felt the right way. Puzzles were easy enough for me, but still give you that feeling of ""Oh! Now I see it"". Overall, I'm happy I made priority with this game over many from my library. Even at full price, the game will give you entertainment and joy. Devs certainly deserved more than 19 cts!Final Mark: 7.5/10			"

												TL;DR - I know my play time looks insane. You will assuredly not get 190 hours of this game, but you will get 2 of the most fun hours you've had gaming in a while. Buy now!As my first foray into speedrunning, this game has given me several dozen hours of entertainment beyond what would be expected by reasonable gamers. But I am trying to be unbiased, and think of this game from a casual standpoint.I still recommend it glowingly.A quirky 2D platformer with a laser-sharp, utilitarian design approach, Out There Somewhere gives you a light dash of shooting combat, a gentle hint of exploration, and a core game built around puzzle-platforming with a 2D teleport gun. It is bookended by space shooter segments that some reviewers have taken issue with - I won't argue with them for finding these segments disjunct, but I still enjoy them anyway.It is worth noting that the pace at which new mechanics are introduced is absolutely stellar - far better than many A-list titles. You get a sense for what each button does, a scenario or two that changes your approach, and then a wholly new element just as you are getting comfortable.It seems like the biggest complaint from most reviewers is the game's short length. Most people should have an easy time earning the ""Swift Success"" achievement on their first play, it's true, but the collectibles should keep completionists occupied for another hour or so after - they even require a little meta-gaming! At a two dollar price point, this is plenty of game for your buck, and it's not often that this caliber of level design, soundtrack, and art style find their way into a two-dollar title.			"

												This is a competent retro 8-bit platformer. But wait! What makes this particular game interesting is the teleport gun: you fire the gun, and you teleport to the point of impact. The developer makes good use of this fact for a variety of puzzles, spiced up by the fact momentum is maintained through the teleport, plus vertical light beams that have different effects on your projectile. There's also a more traditional gun, although to be honest the combat never really felt necessary, apart from a couple of puzzles. It's not that difficult to figure out a way through each room, and in fact there are occasionally different ways of doing so; the difficulty lies in the execution, but thankfully it's not that frustrating.It doesn't last very long, 90 minutes at the most, but I paid $0.19 or something so I'm hardly likely to complain. Nice traditional chiptune music, appealing 8-bit graphics, some secrets to find, and even a space shooter minigame, overall it's worthwhile if you like a bit of puzzling in your 8-bit platforming.

												Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ When I initially saw this game on the store for 25 cents I wasn't sure if a game this cheap would be worth it. However upon downloading and booting up this game I was instantly met with waves of energy and joy. From when I hit ""new game"" I knew I was in for a ride, and what a ride that was. The music controlled the gameplay almost more than I did, forcing me in and out of situations that would seem impossible with the very sound of a note. The ""portal gun"", as one could call it, adds a new depth to the platforming which makes it fun, puzzling, and at some points infuriating. Out There Somewhere is like nothing I have played before, or as I should say, many things I have played before. The developers took Cave Story, Portal, Metroid, and VVVVVV and spat out one of the best indie games I have played in the past few years. I recommend this game to everyone who loves difficulty (while still beign fair), a simple yet entertaining narrative, and just some sweet bumpin' tunes. So what do you have to lose? With a full price of 4.99 and a sale orice of 0.25 (canadian), this game is a steal. I give it a solid 9.5/10			"

												Low-res puzzle platformers are almost literally a dime a dozen now but Out There Somewhere manages to stand apart by being polished and clever with its core mechanic. That mechanic is a teleport gun, which fires a bullet that teleports you to its point of impact. The teleport preserves your momentum as well, so if you start a jump right before you warp, you can essentially tele-walljump. Several puzzles make use of this and other neat physics tricks you can do with yourself, gradually nudging the difficulty up in a pleasant, inviting way that has you feeling clever and masterful by the end of the game. There's a little combat with enemies and a few secrets to hunt if you are so inclined, but it's a very short and sweet package... one playthrough will last you less than an hour. I certainly wish it was longer because it is very tight and fun for those 45 minutes, but what's there is more than worth playing. There's even some inklings of plot and some interaction with aliens as you traverse the odd little world, and neat opening and closing sequences that play like Gradius-style shooters. And if you really feel like sticking with it, there are a mess of oddly-grindy achievements to shoot for, though I wouldn't encourage it. Overall a great little experience for even the most jaded puzzle platformer player.			"

												Although the story is not something that will take hours to go through, this game is worth the price. It is a kind of game that you will replay—it has achievements that you likely cannot get in just a few playthroughs. There are hidden easter eggs to be found as well. The soundtrack is fun and the graphics are rather nice too. I've played through the story once and know I will several more times as well, for I still have things to find and achievements to get.

												SPOILERS AHEAD! In a sense this is actually 2 games, so I will talk about them separately. The shmup section was short but sweet, I am terrible at these kinds of games but I enjoyed it. My only issue is that your gun won't fire at full speed if you hold down the button, requiring you to mash for the most damage potential. I died as soon as the boss shot his laser, and though I'd need to restart until...The puzzle-platforming section, which is the meat of the game. Crashing on the planet and needing to find ship parts (conveniently the same model as the shmup upgrades) reminded me of Knytt (in a good way), and so did the slower pace and early lack of combat. Puzzle progress felt steady and fun, though the ""double shot"" puzzle I managed to solve without learning the proper trick, stunting my progress in the next few rooms. I really enjoyed having a ""teleport"" gun instead of a ""portal"" gun, which felt very fresh as a mechanic. Combat was passable, with notable frustration trying to hit the flying bats, and not knowing how long the boss would take to defeat. The biggest issue I had was with NPC conversations, ending the conversation would not close the text box right away and another press would start it again; extremely frustrating.Going back to shmup at the end was unexpected and exciting, and I didn't die to the laser! I was a bit sad that it ended, but that title call-out was a great wrap up to the story. The art and sound were excellent throughout, with a special mention to alien NPC designs.			"

												Short, but enjoyable.I beat ""Somewhere Out There"" in about an hours time, but by no means to completion. Despite this, I whole heartedly recommend this game. It's a clever little puzzle platformer that harkens back to some of the classics in the genre. The story, while short, is interesting and the music is memorable and entertaining to listen to.My only real beef is with the very plain graphics. The character sprites and the portraits are so nice, I wish that the backgrounds had some of the same attention given to them. The game just looks plain. Take a look at a game like Rex Rocket for an example of how beautiful a game like this can be. Fortunately, ""Out There Somewhere"" is saved by it's fantastic platforming, which is really all that matters anyway.			"

(jesus I love them but i hate them at the same time......)- Too short, way too short..- What makes the game take long are the puzzles and the time you get stuck in them but if you are quick to do them it's too short.- Space battle is just 1/5 of the game, it could have more space battle in order to make the game a bit longer as wellOverall:Fun game, good art, good music, good mechanics. All in all I recommend it's a fun game to pass some time tho it is a bit short it is still fun and still worth the money.Score:8/10			"

												Definitely feels like cave story so far - looks good,. worth 19 cents even without the trading cards. Possibly more. Worth getting while the special promotion is up and running,.Too early for me to tell if the whole game is worth 5$ or more, but it's looking good so far.edit1: A bit further into the game, it will get harder, but not by so much that you'll bash your head on the keyboard. Some of the puzzles can even be ""cheated"" by completing them with a bit of clever jumping to avoid the way they were ""intended to be solved"".Some reviews will claim it's about 90 minutes worth of gameplay,. and at the speed that these puzzles are getting solved I'd say that seems about right. Still 19 cents for an hour of something new is good,. but I wouldn't pay 5$ for it. So, get it while it's on discount, or in the next humble bundle.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a 2D platformer with simple puzzle elements. Your mission is take out Grigor, but in the battle your ship was damaged and you crash land on an unknown planet. You have to find him on the planet and take him out for good. This is mostly done by platforming. The main mechanic to get used to is the use of a portal gun. You shoot it and when the projectile hits a solid target you will be teleported to that spot. You'll learn the ins and outs of how that works, along with interacting with different beams and other obstacles that will change the way your teleportation works. There's also a gun you can use as a weapon to fight off the planet's hostile inhabitants. This gun doesn't shoot very rapidly and it's a small bullet, but this only makes it all the more useful as you need to aim carefully and plan your shots. It's simple to grasp but will test your smarts and skills as you try to get the hidden upgrades. The graphics are pixelated and dark. The visuals, along with some cool synth music, make for a nice atmosphere to travel through. There's not a whole lot more to say. Not much story, just some simple mechanics and areas to clear. It's a nice little game.There are some problems, though. All of them seem to stem from the game's legnth. It'll probably only take you 1-2 hours to beat it, and not much more for achievement hunters. That's fine story-wise, as there's not much there outside the premise. However, it seems like more could've been done with the mechanics that were set in place. More puzzles, more ideas with the mechanics, and just some more outside the box thinking. Having a longer game would also mean a larger world, with perhaps more items and powerups to collect. More bosses would've been good. There are two space shooting sections, but having more would've been nice as well. It's neat that those sections start and end the game to kind of tie it up in a nice little bow, but having more of them might make the playstyle feel a little more welcome. A map would've been nice too.Overall, this is a lighter recommendation. The game is nice with simple mechanics and intresting atmosphere, but it's rather short and could use some fleshing out. Perhaps there will be another game by the developers in a similar fashion, or maybe even a sequel to expand upon these ideas, which have a lot of potential. What's here is good, and only taking a while to beat isn't bad, but this game FEELS short. It feels like this style of game should have more to it. It's no Super Metroid, it's no Cave Story, but it's something neat that, if on sale, if worth checking out. Five dollars is a little steep for a Steam game like this, but if you can get it for a few bucks or less, consider it. Out There Somewhere gets a 6 out of 10 for being a neat little adventure that has lots of potential and a satisfying, even if short, experience.			"

Warning: May Contains SpoilersTwo words: wasted potential!I have just finished playing Out There Somewhere and it was a really pleasant experience. However, it was a very SHORT experience indeed.Anyway, let me break it down to details and grade every aspect on its own.ConceptGame starts off as a shoot'em up side-scroller, which really took me by surprise. I mean, judging by the screens you'd rather expect a puzzle platformer and you get that not so long after the game starts, too. And then it just hit me, the brilliance of the idea: you fly, fighting your way to a new planet. Then you land, 'meet the locals' and proceed with the featured mission, which involves solving puzzles, fighting your way forward and doing some cool oldschool platformer type trickjumps. It's just all there. Again, really awesome mix.StoryNot much to say really. No history, no explanations, no nothing. Just fix your ship and welp, you're done. I mean, I didn't really expect to have a Witcher 3 in space, but for the sake of having the player become involved in the game, it really needs something. Tell me a story of a war, rebellion maybe, invasion, whatever, but please share some details with us, not just generic 'Humanity almost extinct, Grigori attacks, protect planet' stuff. I wouldn't even need any cut scenes, just some text scrolling up with a nice background, skippable for those who don't care about such aspects of the game.GraphicsIt's mostly just your basic 'oldschool-nes-like-game-graphics'. Anyway, the art style is pleasant to watch. The only thing that somehow buggered me was that some maps looked a bit mundane and dull, with only same bricks of terrain laid over another same bricks of terrain. Adding more background details and decorations would probably make the game look a bit nicer, but then again, it's not really about the graphics this time, is it?MusicSimple, yet quite atmospheric. It reminds me of the soundtrack of Risk of Rain that is electronic sounds that just really fit the space exploration theme of the game. The musical themes change when you change a map/biome and pretty much all of them are really enjoyable.GameplayThe puzzle part is rather fun, the puzzles are not terribly easy, but also not too complicated. Can't imagine spending 8 minutes trying to beat one though (one of the achievements). As the game progresses, different beams are implemented, which change the behaviour of your teleport gun. The variety of enemies is rather limited - 4 kinds, erasing them is a bit of a chore, spam your gun until they drop dead. The game could feature no enemies and no one would probably miss them. The NPCs remind me the ones in old NES games, like Duck Tales, sometimes you have to sweat a little to get to them, but they might have some useful information or will say some funny things.The shoot'em up part is just there I guess. It covers approx. 5% of a game that lasts for an hour, so you don't really spend too much time in it, shame.ContentI've got only one thing to say about the content - More!. The game needs more planets, more story depth, more types of guns, more types of enemies, more collectibles, more puzzles, more bosses, more flying in space, more technical upgrades to your ship, more play time, more replayability, just literally, more of everything. Honestly, give this game a 10h playthrough time which implements new mechanisms, enemies and bosses gradually, add a decent story, raise the price accordingly and you have a really decent game!To compare, playing this game right now is like getting a new toy, figuring out how it works and suddenly, someone snaps it out of our hands. It just leaves hunger for moreOverallTo sum up, for the price you're going to get this, which is usually less than 1$, this game is totally worth it. But be warned, it literally has an hour of gameplay (exactly 53 minutes on my save file). I really hope that if the next part ever comes, it's going to have a significantly larger budget, which will allow creating a more in-depth experience with some solid (re)play value of at least 10+ hours.

												Very short little game that has a few nice ideas and an overall good quality (if you are not already fed up with pixel art and chiptunes). It could have been longer and more generous (the end is kind of abrupt) but I feel that it would have overstayed its welcome given that it has not the scope of a true metroidvania.Anyway, it offers a good couple of hours of puzzle/platforming with a sensible difficulty curve. Thus, with the original price tag, I truly recommend waiting for sales.			"

-Quick Review-Out There Somewhere is a 2d puzzle platformer with a hint of old arcade-space-shooting at the start and end, making the nice sandwich, which is ""Out There Somewhere"", developed by MiniBoss and released Mar 14, 2016.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: You play as the Protagonist: Small-pixel-man-with-goldfish-bowl-on-head. Goldfish bowl head starts out by flying a ship trying to shoot down space-captain-who's-his-face. (Can you tell none of the names stuck with me?) While the story and plot are pretty forgettable the game controls aren't in the slightest.

Gameplay: The basic controls are straight forward, you move right and left, jump and fire a portal gun, later you unlock a regular gun you can use to kill the various hostile NPC's. The controls work, I have been guilty of mixing up my two fire keybindings, which has resulted in death-by-NPC-face-hugging, or teleportation-into-pits-of-death (For clearification sake, your teleportation gun fires THROUGH NPC's hostile and friendly.), the controls weren't so bad for me, but the game really seems like it was designed more so with a controller in mind.But I'm getting ahead of myself, you start with just a Teleportation Gun, you fire a shot and when it connects with the wall, you teleport to the location of the laser/bullet. You actually have a few tricks you can pull off with the Teleportation gun early on, but don't learn about later in the game, so there is some skill that is developed with the Teleportation gun, rather then fire and teleport.

So once you finish playing the game, and if you start a new game you realize there are many hidden spots in the game that you originally had no idea where there. So that hints at the amount of time it takes to finish the game: it's a pretty short game, think an hour or two on average (Naturally the time to beat the game after your first, will rapidly decrease unless you're trying to find new locations and secrets).While I personally didn't find any of the puzzles too overwhelming, there's definitely plenty of difficulty to keep you mumbling obscenities under your breath as you get murdered again and again. While there's definitely more to the game, and plenty of content to keep you coming back, that's about all there is to say for the gameplay.Conclusion: As a whole, I enjoyed playing this game. This was one of the games I downloaded and played on my laptop while I was on a short little vacation away from my normal habitat. For using on lower powered computers I highly recommend this game, but when it comes to powered up computers that are normally playing MMORPG's or triple A titles... Out There Somewhere is still a pretty good diversion of a game. Pick it up on sale, play for a couple hours, go back to playing something else.

												This is a great little game! Very short (I beat it in under 1 hour), but it was very enjoyable, while it lasted.The visuals are nice, and so is the music. Nothing new in these 2 aspects, but they're faithful to the games that inspired this game and they're well done!The game has one main mechanic, and then some variations that support it. The mechanic is simply a teleport gun. You shoot a pellet that teleports you to it when it hits a wall. That's it. Despite its simplicity, though, it changes movement just enough to be ""surprising"", in some way, reaching escape velocity from ""generic platformer"".The level design is pretty good, always pushing you to use what you've learned about the teleport movement, instead of presenting normal platforms. There are also details spread throughout the game for speedrunners, which gives it another layer for those interested.The one complaint I have is that it is too easy, for the most part. There are hidden health-ups and armor for your ship, but these are mostly inconsequential to the game, so they're there for the extra challenge. Which is ok! The problem is that the game locks you out very often. You cross a certain section, and then you can't go back. This is a bit annoying, since the upgrades seen in one screen may require you to go around from another screen to get. So you may keep pushing forward, looking for the path, and then realize you can't go back... oops.Since the game is 1 hour long, this is not really a problem? But it's not optimal either, I would have prefered the other way.Anyway. Not much more to be said. It's not groundbreaking, but it's a very enjoyable title if you're looking for something quick, but still good!			"

												TL:DR, this game is great for its price. Granted, you'll only get ~5 hours of enjoyment from this but it is still pretty fun.The gameplay is very unique. I haven't seen anything like that in any other game I've played. It got me thinking really hard in the middle (though in the end, it got pretty easy to figure out.The story left quite a bit to be desired, with little to nothing explained about the characters. I leaned more about the main character from watching the trailer posted here than I did playing the game.The game itself felt... incomplete for lack of a better term. Right when I was having fun solving all the puzzles and finally getting the hang of it, the game cut to credits.While the game is short, you have to keep in mind that it is $2. It was a very fun and unique experience to me. I really hope the developers go farther with the gameplay ideas in future projects.			"

												For a game I paid about $0.20 USD for, I got 75 minutes or so of fairly straightforward puzzle-platformer-with-teleport-gun gameplay.  Nothing stood out as exceptional but nothing was lackluster either, which is a plus really considering the price and what someone might expect from the saturated indie platformed genre.  I didnt feel like my time was wasted and I had some fun with it.  I dont particularly like chiptune / bit-aesthetic music. but it was pretty catchy and pleasant to listen to.  The NPC character sprites were also pretty well animated which is a good touch as well.Some players I see complaining about the control scheme.  I could see it as a problem for some, but I'm used to a few similar games so I handled it pretty well.  I didn't test a controller but with the Steam Controller API I don't think it should be much of a problem if you want a custom mapping.All in all, it was good!			"

												Out there somewhere tries to make up for being incredibly short (<2 hours at best) and linear by being teeth grindingly hard. The entire game revolves around mastering trick jumps......and that's about it as far as game play. The only real indication  of it being ""inspired by"" metroid or cave story lays in the graphics and sound. The game looks and sounds great but there just isnt enough game to go with it.			"

												This short platformer's got soul, a cool 8 bit soundtrack and tight controls.I'll skip the story and let you figure that one out for yourselves. The core gameplay consists of platforming, shooting things and using your teleport gun to... well teleport around the place and get over obstacles. There are collectibles scattered all around the place which help you progress more easily and help with the final boss battle.The soundtrack compliments the mood that the artist has set here; marooned on a strange planet of slug creatures, now stop crying, take that teleport gun, fix your ship and get revenge! It's an incredibly fun experience although it is rather short. My first playthrough took me a little bit over an hour and 30 minutes to complete. Second was a bit over 40 minutes and the last speedrun was just under 20 minutes.I wouldn't hesitate getting this game even at full price though I must note that it was on sale with a hefty -96% discount when I bought it.

												This review is going to be a little bit unfair, but then I feel I was misled. At the time of this writing, the ""About"" section describes this game as ""Inspired by games such as Cave Story and Super Metroid"", and it's tagged as a ""Simulation"", ""Strategy"", and ""Metroidvania"" game.It is none of these things. This is a short, hard, linear puzzle platformer, with brief side-scrolling shooter bookends. The game as it is is pretty okay, and I got it on sale, but I spent my entire playtime wondering when the game map was going to open up and I was going to start getting interesting upgrades, which never happened.Bottom line, misleading store page, thumbs down.

												Well, some pixels here and there, few will love it instantly, few will hate, and the rest? Well, they will land on the planet and will die a lot, just because it is fun, challenging and rewarding once they'll master controls and tricks. Storyline isn't complex but it's not a bad thing for Out There Somewhere and yet you feel good once you make progress, and notice as sprites changes. When you found out the pattern of combined challenge and exploration you improve with controls and tricks and overall game experience gets better and better, because every part of the game is like a puzzle, once you start getting whole image game becomes great. Out There Somewhere is casual platformer with nice pixels and enjoyable chiptunes which can take up few hours to complete, depending on your teleporting performance. Play it in a spare moment and you won't regret time spent on Out There Somewhere. Sequel would be nice, tho. 9/10			"

												I've never seen this mechanic before, it's very fun and gives some interesting puzzle platforming. And it is very well explored in the level design. I love the visuals too. Quality pixel art, very cute. The game sits mostly on the easy side. I figured out the mechanics quickly and at worst I died 3 to 4 times on the hardest rooms and sailed through the game in about an hour. The bullet hell sections, however, are pretty hard! at least to me, I hate bullet hell games. It is a very small part of the game, but it makes me wonder about mixing such completely different genres. But I digress. This is not an issue with Out There Somewhere, the spaceship sessions are short and few. It's extremely short though. But without considering price, length is not a very useful piece of information. What I mean by that is I think the game is worth what they are asking for. It's a short, adorable, original and fun little game and it's cheaper than a sandwich. I'm a very satisfied customer.			"

												This is a fun but short platformer/shooter.I appreciate that the developers used multiple game modes.  This is tough to do, and normally one of the game modes feels tacked on.  In this case the platformer is the more developed of the modes, but the shooting sequences are not bad.The art is nothing to write home about, but the gameplay is fun and that is what matters.

												I purchased this game for $0.19 and I could say that it's worth at least this amount, but it is most certainly not worth the full price. Out There Somewhere has a very brief playtime of about an hour and, as it aesthetically calls back to older games with similar playtimes, this would normally be fine. I say normally because this is where the problem lies - while many games from the era Out There Somewhere seeks to mimic can technically be finished in an hour or less, they are usually challenging enough (though not necessarily always for good reasons) to occupy players for hours before they can scrape by with a victory. Out There Somewhere, on the other hand, simply poses so little challenge for the vast majority of its duration that I can count the number of rooms with any sense of difficulty from either the puzzles or the platforming on a single hand (4).This is a case of a game where the concept simply does not live up to its full potential. The teleport gun is a neat mechanic, but it is a largely wasted one as environmental obstacles and puzzles are repeatedly reused in the same handful of ways - you're going to be shooting at a whole lot of blue beams either halfway up a jump or on the way down from a jump in order to reach a platform a bit farther away. There are a few optional secrets, but as this is primarily a puzzle game it is not really worth the effort to go back through the whole game again if you miss one the first time around.While aesthetically appealing, Out There Somewhere is ultimately an unsatisfactory experience as it is lacking in narrative, challenge, and, other than the concept itself, any real sense of creativity.

												Out there somewhere is a really interesting 2D platfomer where you have to use a portal gun to move on to the next level. The game has a really great soundtrack and overall a pretty interesting idea. It has a pretty boring story but that's ok in my opinion.The big reason why I can't recommend this game is because of it's ""portal jumping"" mechanic, in the game you can't double jump so what you have to do is shoot your portal gun towards the wall and than jump in mid-air. It's very difficult to control and really hard to master. So a large part of this game is really just trying to get to a certain platform by portal jumping, with not much else going on.I got this game for about $0.51 when it was on sale so I can't really complain too much, but for me this game is definitely not worth the $2 price tag. Maybe if you're overflowing with money than this might not seem like that big of a deal to you, but for those of us who are on a budget and don't have too much cash than spend your money on something else "

This makes for an incredibly simple boss battle that felt more like just another platforming room rather than a boss.There is no real incentive to collect the optional ship parts.

 Out There Somewhere It's a small game, but bunch of Fun you'll have. :) GamePlay: The gameplay is as simple as the game is and yet sometimes challenging. At the beginning you'll have no weapon, which will change very soon till you get a teleport gun!Teleporter gun: You can shoot with this gun and the time it hits an object you'll teleport to this point. Anyway this is just the half impressive part of it, because you can jump and while you're moving upward you can teleport yourself, but the physic of moving upward keeps. This is the part where it becomes a bit tricky to time you shoots.Normal gun: Additional to the telegun you'll also receive a normal gun to shoot enemies. If you acquire the additional upgrade you'll shoot faster and deadlier which makes the run way easier.This is the Charakter Gameplay. There are also objects in the world which tries to build up riddles for you. ;)I love the idea. <3 (One point loss because it's really short 1h 20min. first run. :/ I wish I could be longer)★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ Graphics: The graphics is a pixelstyle and not very impressive.^^ It looks very nice, but I just cannot give all points!★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ Story: The Story is also well made. ""Brevity is the soul of wit!"" this is something fitting to its story. It's indeed not very long, probably because of the length of the game, but you don't forget storypart which confuse you in futher progress.I really liked it. With some nice Cutscenes and dialogue.★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Leveldesign: If you want all Achievements then you should know that you have to visit (nearly) every screen in this game. literally!There are screens with no name and you'll have to see them to get the 107% Achievement. (I think it's pretty obvious why it's called 107%. :p)The normal screens are well created to make puzzles, as I've said it befor. ↑ up there ↑I don't see any reason to give less than the max. points.^^★ ★ ★ ★ ★ Music: My favorite part of any game with good music recommendation. <3 Well, this game contains so many good soundtracks. I nearly love all of them and for a good reason. If you wanna take a look at the main Theme:  Menu Theme ★ ★ ★ ★ ★The summary is, I would buy it again and the most time it is in sale for less than 30c. xD Get it. It's worth to play!★ ★ ★ ★ ★			"

												This is a good puzzle game, with levels that make you think, and I picked this up for only 49 cents. I strongly recommend it if you feel like buying a cheap game that has great playability. I'm gonna go ahead and give it a 9/10 because of the cheap price, great story, and great puzzles that make you think.			"

												A short but very replayable game, especially for speedrunners and achievement hunters. The puzzles are devious but well designed and it's fun to use the teleport beam in clever ways. Some of the moves are pretty tricky to pull off with some very strict timing required and might be frustrating to inexperienced players. An experienced platformer player might get through this in about an hour- there's an achievement for speed-running it in less than 20 minutes and I managed to do it in 15 after some practice. At full price this is a good buy- at 19p in the sales, it's a no-brainer.			"

												Bought it for 50 cents, but I would have gladly paid full price and beyond for this game. It's a charming platformer that manages to be challenging without being impossibly so. It utilizes creative gameplay mechanics that revolve around a gun that teleports you, which adds a puzzle-like quality to getting through some of the screens. It also has a fantastic soundtrack.My only disappointment with the game is how short it is, because I want more.			"

												Puzzle games don't have to be difficult to be stimulating. Out There Somewhere keeps my brain stimulated with constantly changing and quality music, scenery, and puzzles. It doesn't revolutionize, but it's still a very polished and solid experience. I think full price is asking a bit much for the short length, but you know how Steam works. Add the game to your wishlist and grab it when it goes on sale for around $1.99. I for one, got it on sale for $0.19. Needless to say, totally worth it.			"

												I forgot what this game was about or how much I had paid for it. Decided to boot it to see what it was about and was welcomed with a shmup. Nothing all that exciting but it did look nice. Then you're introduced to the bigger part of the game, which is a puzzle platformer of sorts.I was immediately very impressed by the quality of the game, visually first then everything after. The puzzles were smart but not very complex; not that they were not enjoyable.I thought I was just starting and next thing I know, and hour or so later, I finished the game. I was a disappointed, especially considering how highly I regarded the game. It showed so much promise.Then I went to the store page and saw that the game is actually 1$. And I'm fairly certain I bought it on sales.I don't really feel like playing through it again right now but it was a lot of fun while it lasted and if you are up for it, you can complete more than one playthrough to get more hidden stuff. It's well, well worth the 1$, very short but very high quality.No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, no pointless fillers, this game doesn't try to make up for what it lacks in content by throwing tedious stuff in. Just the essential, just what you need to have fun.			"

												I stumbled upon this game as was searching through Steam for something to play - and I'm *so* glad I did. The art grabbed my attention, as did the very positive reviews, so I checked it out. Here's what I think:PROS--------------------------------------------- Excellent gameplay (it's so cool that people are *still* finding new things to do with platformers. I love it! ^_^ )- Tight controls. I never felt overwhelmed, and that's a good thing.- Great art! (though I'm not sure why the backgrounds were moving underground - maybe to keep things visually interesting >_< )- The tone, feel and setting are all really good.- The pacing is just incredible. I started playing it saying, 'I'll just play it for a little while', and the game moves at such a pace that I found myself playing for far longer than I thought. I beat the game in two sittings! I love games that can grab your attention and keep it like that.- The characters and puzzles kept me glued to my chair. I tell ya - there's something great about this game. Once you start - you don't want to put the game down!- Frequent checkpoints that enforce the fact that you're always making progress.- I also really like the fact that the last boss, while challenging is not SUPER-HARD-OH-MY-GOSH-YOU'LL NEVER-BEAT-THIS that so many platformers end with. While challenging, the game is more fun than hard - and I like that a lot.CONS----------------------------------------- The music, while good, never really connected with me. I still listen to the 'Shovel Knight' and 'Super Mario 3D World' soundtracks, for example. But here, nothing really jumped out. The music is not bad - it just didn't stand out to me.- While the controls felt fair, there were a few parts that I thought the difficulty curve was a bit steep. Reflecting back on it, I think it's because the devs wanted to put in as many different puzzles in as small a time frame as possible. I never got stuck or had to look solutions up online (which is great!), but smoothly transitioning from one puzzle to another sometimes felt a little weird. Maybe that's a nitpick. Just thought I'd mention it.- At a little over two hours, the game is *short*. What it lacks in length, it more than make up for in variety and fun, though.OVERALL----------------------------------------I was really pleasantly surprised with 'Out There Somewhere'. The pacing was excellent, the art was really fun and quirky and the platforming action kept me coming back for more (and kept showing me things I'd never seen before - so I loved that). I loved the fact that I went into this 'blind', so everything it showed me was a surprise. Love it! I had a great time and I look forward to seeing what else the devs have made. Bring on more great games! :)FINAL SCORE---------------------------------------8.5 out of 10			"

												I can only recommend this game at the price I got it at, $0.19. At that price, it's well worth it. At the price listed, it's really not. The game throws you onto an alien world in a story that tries to be more than it is. If this game is part of a series, something would be explained, but on its own it is unremarkable. The big hook to the game is that you have a teleporting gun that allows you to warp to wherever you hit with the gun. You retain your momentum, so much like Portal you encounter some interesting puzzles. The puzzles are seldom difficult, with the only real difficulty coming from the imprescision you deal with. Occasionally you'll encounter something where you have to think in order to proceed, but I got through these by just shooting and somehow ending up where I needed to be. There is a secondary weapon that damages enemies as well. It was a good choice to introduce this weapon, as it does introduce some variety in the gameplay. However, the weapon never quite ""feels"" right. It's hard to explain. Combat, for what there is of it, feels frustrating, especially when you fail later in the room and have to do it over again. Still, having the gun does add to the gameplay. When you die, you respawn quickly. This is good since you will want to try again quickly, but sometimes it can lead to you dying 2 or 3 times in a row because you're still moving when you spawn. This futher compounds the difficulty of a particularly tough puzzle.The game lasts about 45 minutes. I enjoyed most of my time with it, and there are some interesting obstacles introduced throughout, but I did find myself wishing things would get mixed up a little more towards the end, or just wanting the game to end. Overall, there's a lot of potential here. The teleporter gun brings some neat ideas, and the environments are well built around the mechanic. And it's worth the price at 96% off. It's a nice little game, that shows that the developer has a lot of upward potential for their next games.			"

												I can recommend this game, but not at the price they're charging. The game is extremely short - one or two hours long. It feels like it's over just as soon as you've figured out how to play. The controls are interesting, but they don't feel all that tight. (They're not bad, but not great either.) The graphics, sound, and music get the job done but aren't particularly compelling. The level design is pretty decent, but not great. There is some mildly humorous dialog. All-in-all, it's a decent game, but it's just so short.Get the game if it's on sale, maybe.			"

Product received for free
												A space metrovania game. I believe i got this game for free as a gift from a friend if i recall.Anyways this game is quite short. Notice my time above the review? That is how long it took me to beat the game. Be aware i probably did not find every secret or searched the levels extensively.One thing i found annoying about this game was the fact on some maps your forced to go only one way, even though the game is clearly meant to be like a metrovania game that should let you go back to older maps, but some maps it is incredibly hard, if not impossible to do.Because of the way the maps are, i cannot recommend this game. Playing it again got very repetitive very fast. If your into these type of games, this might be fun for you...but due to shortness, very difficult traversing maps, and also, the music was a bit bland to me.			"

												Very nice and short game. The core ideas behind it are nothing we haven't seen before, but the gameplay and the mechanics are really well implemented and they're fun to play with. The only thing I did not like so much is that it was a little too short and that it was really easy to beat. I never really needed to look for info online or anything like that, and each screen took me at most just a couple of deaths before achieving it. Expect to beat this game in about an hour. For the price it usually gets on steam, however, this is a no brainer.I got all the achievements but one which is impossible to get because of a bug (Please, fix it soon, devs!). The truth is that I wasn't expecting much from this game and what I found instead was a really neat little adventure that I enjoyed a lot. I really recommend trying this game out. It's cheap, it's great and t won't take you too long to beat. Definitely worth it :)			"

The puzzles are bothe simple and yet confusing for a first time through and yet when you figure it out you will be wondering how you couldn't see the solution earlier if i could nitpick one thing it's that there is no way to turn off the tutorials if you intend on a second playthrough.

												I picked this game up for about 20 whole cents, and boy, can I ever say it was worth it.My first playthrough lasted me about an hour, but at the end, I felt satisfied. Since then, I've played through the game several more times to explore, collect, and just speed through it. Out There Somewhere doesn't do much, I'll say that. However, what it does, it does VERY well. I'm still thirsting for more.The controls for the game felt tight and I had no issues with moving, shooting, or jumping (I use a controller). Not once did I feel like I could blame the game for falling or dying. It was just a matter of getting faster with the timing, or better at positioning.As far as sound goes, the music is incredibly well done. There are several tracks in the game that change as you progress through the different areas. A few of the tracks are just mindblowingly good for how small the game is. As for sound effects, there aren't an awful lot, but they aren't ear grating which is nice.Aesthetically, the game looks wonderful. If the audio wasn't enough to tell you that Cave Story was an inspiration, the visuals will help remind you. I find the graphics to be very pleasing and easy on the eyes, and it's very easy to tell the different mechanics apart so the puzzles don't feel as frustrating to figure out.Finally, the gameplay. The gameplay is very basic. You can run, you can shoot your portal, and you can shoot your gun. Not much else to it, but that isn't a bad thing. The puzzles aren't overly difficult, either, but there is definitely a learning curve to them. My first time playing, I'd take a few minutes to figure out some of the puzzles. In later playthroughs, it's fun to see just how fast you can get through the puzzles that had stumped you before. Just because the puzzles aren't overly difficult doesn't detract from how rewarding it is to solve them.Overall, the game is very well done. For just $0.20, I'd say it's absolutely worth it. Even for $5.00, I'd say it's worth it if you plan to play through the game multiple times, trying to complete it. Out There Somewhere was a surprising hit, and I'm absolutely glad that I purchased it.			"

Pros- A fun game overall- Not too hard, good for casual players- Trading cardsCons- Doesn't last very long (maybe 2 hours, 3 hours max)- Has very low replay valueOverall, do not miss this if it's on sale. If it's at its full price of 5 dollars, consider waiting for a sale. 5 dollars for maybe 5 hours (assuming you do 2 playthroughs, which is already doubtful) is kind of expensive. 19 cents for 5 hours is a great deal, especially when you can sell the cards if you really want to.

												This game is an incredibly fun 2D platformer that plays similar to Metroid, albeit with a much greater emphasis on platforming puzzles than shooting and exploration. I haven't played Portal, but from what I gather, this is what Portal would be like if it were a 2D game.The controls are perfect, and the game even detects and gives accurate input suggestions for my original Xbox controller that I am using via an unofficial USB adapter and the XBCD third party driver.For the great asking price, you almost can't afford not to give this game a try if you need something fun to play. It's worth getting simply to listen to the catchy music.The developer has really impressed me with this title. Bravo!			"

												Somewhat simple to solve plattformer. In my first attempt I needed under an hour, and there wasn't really a puzzle that made me ponder more than a few moments. (However, I do have a long history of plattformer experience, so it might be a decent difficulty for casual gamers and beginners)Its still a charming game though. I liked the bouncy retro graphics, the ""all your base are belong to us""esque-cutscenes with the very flat dialogues and even enjoyed the music in this short retro flashback.So: If you can get it really cheap on a sale like I did, and enjoy oldschool puzzle plattformers with a relaxing difficulty, I don't think you can go wrong with it. The full prize would've been too high for my taste though.			"

												Nice short platformer game that is very casual. You get ship wrecked and you find things so you can fly your ship again.The difference that this platformer brings to the table is that the main character uses a portal like gun, when the bullet hits certain surfaces you get teleported to that location. This added in some puzzles to the platforming and made it more unique. +Retro art if you are into it+Nice mechanics +Easy to pick up and play+Why walk when you can shoot a wall-Music gets repetitive-Dialog is not even worth mentioning-no replay value(at least I do not feel like its worth doing speed runs)All in all the price for this game is probably not worth it since you can get more fun games or more ""value"" games that take longer to beat. If you can get it for like a dollar, you might as well get it to support the dev and enjoy this nice short game. "

												The game is not too easy, but by no means is hard, the game can be picked up by just about anyone and be enjoyed.The only thing that I don't like about the game is I can't imagine paying the full $4.99 for it.Granted I bought the game at the extreme summer sale discount, the game is incredibly short, I finished the game in a little over an hour and by no means was trying to speed run in any way. This gave me a very unpleasant ""this is it?"" moment by the time I encountered the final boss, leaving me wanting more from a game that is by all accounts incredibly fun, the teleport mechanism is used extremely well, almost addicting, a shame it was over so soon.The hidden items are a bit tricky to get but worth it as they make the final boss extremely easy, and too easy at that if you want a real challenge, so I'd avoid them if thats what your looking for.Now my review may seem to lean on the negative side, but I would still recommend this to anyone as a fun time waster, but at the same time I'd recommend they get it while its on sale.

												Out There Somewhere is a great game. I got it for 19 cents.  It's really fun, but it doesn't take a lot of time. If it's on sale definitely buy it. If not, think about first. Pros- A fun game overall- Not too hard, good for casual players- Trading cardsCons- Doesn't last very long (maybe 2 hours, 3 hours max)- Has very low replay valueOverall, do not miss this if it's on sale. If it's at its full price of 5 dollars, consider waiting for a sale. 5 dollars for maybe 5 hours (assuming you do 2 playthroughs, which is already doubtful) is kind of expensive. 19 cents for 5 hours is a great deal, especially when you can sell the cards if you really want to.

Decent challenge, it will make you think but you won't be throwing your controller at a wall.

												NOTE: I have received this game for free by Free Games. I was asked to spread the joy of this game if I personally enjoyed the game. So that's where you, the reader, comes in....A very small, yet very awesome game! I'm sad this game is quite short (1 hour to complete it), but there are, of course, secrets, puzzles and secret puzzles on your way. There is also a small batch of achievements waiting for you to unlock. So you might be sticking longer on this game when you want to go 100%.The greatest thing I like of this game is the gameplay which reminds me of:- VVVVVV- Portal- Risk of RainIt's so lovely to wander through the game. Everything feels so smooth and fitting, even the OST. Favorite thing of this game: Player walking animation.As said, the game is short and the mechanics are simple, but for 1 euro you should definitely buy this game!Rating: 8/10			"

												Very nice and short game. The core ideas behind it are nothing we haven't seen before, but the gameplay and the mechanics are really well implemented and they're fun to play with. The only thing I did not like so much is that it was a little too short and that it was really easy to beat. I never really needed to look for info online or anything like that, and each screen took me at most just a couple of deaths before achieving it. Expect to beat this game in about an hour. For the price it usually gets on steam, however, this is a no brainer.I got all the achievements but one which is impossible to get because of a bug (Please, fix it soon, devs!). The truth is that I wasn't expecting much from this game and what I found instead was a really neat little adventure that I enjoyed a lot. I really recommend trying this game out. It's cheap, it's great and t won't take you too long to beat. Definitely worth it :)			"

												i picked this game up for 15 pence and didn't really expect too much from it however after starting it up i was pleasently surprised to realise that it is a wonderful game and i cannot reccomend it enough to anyone wo is a fan of platformers or puzzle games as this has elements of both in it. The puzzles are bothe simple and yet confusing for a first time through and yet when you figure it out you will be wondering how you couldn't see the solution earlier if i could nitpick one thing it's that there is no way to turn off the tutorials if you intend on a second playthrough. Also i sold the cards from it for 18 pence so i came out with a great game and financial profit.			"

												When Steams summer sale was going, I decided to buy lots of 19 cent games, because why not. Without saying, almost everyone of those games seemed to be... below avarage and usually end up idling cards for them, but this game was a nice exeption. When I opened the game what I found was really well polished indie puzzle platformer. It doesn't offer anything majorly groundbreaking nor flashy, but because everything feels, looks and sounds really nice, it kept me interested in it. Pacing seems great with new mechanics introduced slowly, once gotten hang of the momentum mechanic controls feel tight and music makes you want to keep going even after several deaths. Only negative may be that it's an hour experience, for some it may not feel like worthwhile to give money, but there's something great about beating game in single day and it's freaking cheap!Shout out to awesome soundtrack as well: https://miniboss.bandcamp.com/releases- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Kun Steamissa oli kesäalennukset, päätin muuten vain ostella paljon 19 sentin pelejä. Sanomattakin melkein kaikki niistä oli... keskivertoa huonompia ja suurimmasta osasta tyydyin saamaan kortit, mutta tämä peli oli mukava poikkeus tähän. Kun avasin pelin huomasin sen olevan hyvin viimeisen päälle kiillotettu indie tasohyppely pulmapeli. Se ei tarjoa mitään maata räjäyttävää tai kiiltävää, mutta koska kaikki tuntuu, näyttää ja kuulostaa erittäin hyvältä, se piti minut kiinnostuneena. Pelin tahti tuntuu hyvältä ja uusia mekaniikkoja tulee hitaalla tahdilla vastaan, kun vauhtimekaniikkaan pääsee sisälle kontrollit tuntuvat tiukoilta ja musiikki pitää pelissä vaikka olisi juuti kuollut muutamaan kertaan. Ainoa negatiivinen asia taitaa olla että se on todellakin vain tunnin mittainen, joka voi joillekin olla ehkä liian pieni kokemus josta pitäisi maksaa, mutta se tunne että pääsee pelin läpi yhdessä päivässä on erittäin mukava ja se on järkyttävän halpaa! Myös maininta mahtavalle pelin soundtrackille: https://miniboss.bandcamp.com/releases "

												Out There Somewhere is a 2014 platformer developed by unknown studio Miniboss. Another in a long line of Super Metroid lookalikes, it's enjoyed some success mainly due to being incredibly cheap. But rather then simply riding on the coattails of Super Metroid (or Knytt, as it were), Out There Somewhere proves to be an enjoyable linear puzzle platformer, with a teleportation mechanic that features conservation of momentum similar to Portal (though the two have no real similarity beyond that).  It's no metroidvania by any stretch of the imagination - most of the ""upgrades"" are for an endgame effect that doesn't amount to much, and outside of that venture there's a total of 5 collectibles. Instead of playing a retro pixel wannabe, I played a well-paced linear adventure, that nevertheless isn't perfect. Most of the pacing is due to just how short it is - a playthrough won't run you longer than an hour (15 minutes if you know what you're doing) and the sheer lack of enemy variety becomes apparent on subsequent playthroughs. Add to that, that while the sprites are well designed and look quite nice on inspection (thankfully, not using the retro clause of pixel art to turn out subpar product) the very poorly handed tiling and lack of visual noise make the game's art look much more amateur than it really is.This is most readily apparent during the intro and outro space battles. With a closer look, you can see the spaceships slowly rotating, the metal sheens and the sci fi aesthetic shining through, when taken as a whole it looks so empty and barren that you could mistake it for a first-year highschooler's Game Maker project. These aren't particularly pressing issues; Out There Somewhere suffers from a lack of talking points. This isn't a particularly interesting game, and for all the secrets thrown into its linear world or the cool design of the protagonist, if this game hadn't gone for 20 cents then I wouldn't be recommending it. I wouldn't have even bought it. I've played Newgrounds games with more lasting value. At $5, I wouldn't recommend it unless you're the type that goes for 100% completion. At the ridiculous sales price, I fully recommend Out There Somewhere as a snack-sized short romp to pace out the larger, more memorable videogames.			"

												One of the most adorable indie platformers I've played.Out There Somewhere gets all things right. You have to explore a weird planet in order to be able to launch your ship into space (again). The controls are very simple - you only get to use 3 buttons (teleport gun, jump and gauss gun), other than the directional ones, throughout the entire game - but that's more than enough in order to tackle the game's puzzles, enemies and areas.Most of the areas require a bit of thinking, and in some cases, reflexes, in order to reach the ""end"" of the screen and get to the next one. Every screen represents an entirely different area you need to pass.Out There Somewhere is challenging enough for gamers of all ages and levels, but at the same time, you will never feel frustrated, even if you fail to overcome a certan obstacle in several attempts. The game's atmosphere and (retro) music are just too adorable for that.The game can be completed in ~2 hours. And while it may not be a game that will keep you coming back for more, unless you're an achievement junkie, you can rest assured that it will provide you with few hours of pure, retro platforming fun!

												Simple and short but extremely fun and creative little platform/puzzle game. This game was made by a very small team, and it's a really impressive achivement! You've got an extremely limited move set - you can jump around, you can fire a teleport beam, and you eventually get a blaster - but you'll use that limited move set in a wide variety of funny, clever, unexpected ways. There were so many times where I thought, ""Oh, this trick move won't work"", and then it did! So then what if I jump off here and then shoot my beam there, but before I land, I jump and then...oh, that worked too! The game is just full of surprises like that and all these puzzles that test your creativity, logic, and ability to exploit the mechanics. I also really like the pixel graphics - the art style is charming and memorable. I don't actually have any real critiques here! It's a short game, but it never outstays its welcome. There are even a decent amount of secrets and it'll take you a while to really collect everything. On top of all of these strengths, Out There Somewhere is really cheap - it even often goes on sale for something like 25 cents. You can't beat that! You can wait for one of those super cheap sales if you like, but this is an awesome little game at any price. In fact, this is probably one of the best deals on Steam, bar none.			"

												Not bad at all. Seeing the retro style graphics, you might think that this is one of those trash indie games that people make to grab some quick cash (I don't hate retro or 8-bit graphics at all, its just that this is overused to make lots of trash games found across steam). Level 1 further fuels your doubt with the old space shooter thing.But the idea of the teleport gun introduced in level 2 makes it a rather unique platformer with an original concept. This together with the throwaway price makes this a recommendable buy.Also has trading cards and achievements.			"

												Game seems like fun.  Then the game starts putting save points three screens back, and if you make a tiny mistake on the current twitch finger puzzle you have to redo all your work again... repeat  this pattern a few times... and god I why I am playing something this annoying?			"

												If you like teleporting and crazy jumps then give this game a try! A few really frustrating parts to make it through the first time. If you have a high rage factor then prepare for a lot of that. But overall it was fun and has replayability to complete the achievements! Nice soundtrack also!			"

												It's alright. It's nice to see something that reminds me of an old school arcade machine game, so that's very refreshing. I don't really like the controls, even after remapping them multiple times, I wish we could use space bar to jump. Was worth the 19 cents :)			"

												Bought the game on sale for $0.19.  Took 51 minutes from start to finish, including the time spent looking at the controls, watching the little intro, etc.  For $0.19 it is worth it.  For $5 it just isn't.  There's little challenge, and while the graphics work and sounds and music are great throwbacks to old school gaming, the game play gets boring fast.  I may go back and play another hour someday to try to get all the achievements or something, but story and game play wise there is zero replay value.  Worth it at $0.19, not worth it for much more.

												This was a fun game. This was also a shockingly short game. When I reached the end, I fully expected it to really just be the end of the intro, and to actually open up a larger world with many more hours of gameplay. But no, it turned out really was the end, and Steam says I only played 56 minutes.Also, don't be fooled by anyone who says this draws inspiration from Super Metroid. It absolutely doesn't. There is no backtracking in this game (unless you're trying to hunt down all 11 hidden objects, which isn't really worth it), or really anything else that Super Metroid is famous for.			"

												Man, what a neat little game. It's unfortunately rather short, which is about the only bad thing I could say about it. The game's mostly based around the teleportation gun mechanic, which lends itself well to a lot of neat puzzles and platforming. Momentum is conserved through jumping so you can use it to gain extra height on a jump and get places you otherwise wouldn't be able to. Even in the small game world there's a ton of secrets tucked away and collecting them all does give you a health boost (and ship boost at the end of the game). It's really quite fun and the game does a lot even with its short length to keep things varied and interesting. The final boss is a bit weak/simplistic, I suppose, but the level design is great throughout to make up for it. Considering that it's currently $.19 USD on steam right now, there's no real excuse not to pick this one up and give it a shot.			"

The puzzles can be frustrating if you don't know what to do, but some can feel rewarding to figure out. Nothing is super difficult or super easy, but can feel helpless for a few moments until you realize what kinda teleport shananigan to do with your teleport gun.			"

												(8/10)Cute little game thats a fusion of the various games it mentions in its blurb.  The music/graphics are very reminiscent of cave story, as are the very tight controls.  The main game is an exploratory metroidvania style, with a few secrets and some definite portalish puzzle solving.The various elements gel very well together and the overall play was fun and engaging, while it lasted.  I'm not normally a 'time snob' but it definitely felt like the game was over all too soon.  Aiding that was the notion that there was never really a chance to go back and grab all those secrets you saw glimpses of earlier.  If you miss it, odds are, you missed it, and thats that.I may actually do a second walkthrough enhanced run just to see what effects some of the last things i didn't do would have, but as it stands if you mostly just do forward progress you can probably beat it in just an hour or two.  (some kinda plus mode, or just some oportunity to 'turn back' at the end so you could finish collecting would have been appreciated).As it stands though I did like it, and did have fun, and would reccomend it specifically to cave story fans who also like puzzle games because more than anything else this is a great fusion of those two styles.

												Ignore anyone saying this is not a good game, For they are F4GG0T5.Great little platformer harkening back to the days of commander keen, cave story and other similar otherwordly 2d jump and fight festivals.Really nice mechanics, smooth and fair gameplay and some puzzles that (while not being particularly challenging) are interesting and fun enough to keep you interested until the end. It is NOT a long game but I think this almost works in its favour. I think something like this would get irksome/annoying if they focused much more on timed jumping and awkward, multi-stage puzzles which I suppose they'd have to do to ramp up the difficulty any further.As it is the challenge is pleasant, it's fun to look for the extra secrets and (I thought) the game had a nice atmosphere. Perhaps it's not everyones cup of tea and if you're a resolutely modern (F4G1T) gamer then this might not please you but if you like to do more with your gaming time than endless games of CS:GO whilst pulling at your pants and screaming obscenities down the mic then this might well be something you'll enjoy.I was gifted the game but I believe it was really cheap lately and would definitely have been worth that price but I'd say, also, that at full price it's still a worthwhile investment. There's a fair chunk of replayability and I think it's sensible to support people making games like this as it's the textbook definition (to me) of ""A fun game"". There are just under 1000 games in my steam library, 90% of which I have NEVER played. I played this solidly until completion.Then I completed it again.10/10 kept my mind busy and gave me no desire to pull at my pants or scream down a microphone. It doesn't even HAVE mic support.			"

												Looking around so see what was on sale and saw this. It looked like a cool metroidvainia with puzzles, then I bought this game yesterday for only 21 cents, and was amazed. For starters the presntation is well executed, the puzzles,platforming and atmosphere felt as though it took a really long time to design. Secondly the puzzle although challenging where at a good level and required well paced shoots and fast reflexes. finally the controls, they are very responsive and tight. However the Z,X,C keys are going to take some time to get use to.Here are my opinions in a pro and cons fationPros:                                                  good atmosphere                             tight controls                                   nice design for enemies                   nice puzzles nice learning curvefew secrets that help in the long runCons:respawning enemeis(depends on person)soundtrack althought beutiful gets repetative after 30 minsAll in all I give this game a solid 8 out of 10			"

												The puzzle is quite good. The music is pretty addicting. The story is that casual but short one. All in all, the game is worth every penny. Too bad is only 1h and something long. But for a Brazilian game (first time playing and liking one), is so cool. I can't say how cool this game is. The music is stuck in my head. It would be good it they add a continuation. Like different planets. Some areas I got stuck thinking what to do in order to pass, but I made it without cheating (looking online). This game needs more players.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a VERY good game, one of the best in my library. First the price to gameplay ratio is amazing. I have eight hours in this game, thats 10p an hour, and then there's the gameplay. The puzzles vary in hardness, but a lot of this requires high reaction time. Thus being said, I feel that the rage adds to the gameplay, but not in the way that puts you off the game and you leave to take up space space in your steam library for the rest of your life. I feel as if this game is extremely underrated and I would buy it for ten times the price. 10/10			"

												Well, ""Out There Somewhere"" is indeed a fun little game with nice mechanics, music and visual style. So far so good. It'll probably be one those games that could get you hoocked for hours, and you wont feel like you wasted your precious life. That is of course, if it actually lasted that much.As fun and pretty as it is, this game is too darn short; free flash-game short. You might find longer (and probably better) games on the Portal Archives in Newgrounds. Too bad nobody cares about those sites anymore.However, i'm recomending this game because i just happened to stumble across it when it was on sale. For less than a buck. And it has Steam Cards. Also remember, i said that i liked the game itself, it's just too short. But if you can get it dirt cheap, go for it. It's totally worth it; you might even get your money back by selling the cards. Otherwise, wait. Put it on your wishlist if you really want it and grab it on the next sale. It's a nice game. "

												This is a great little game! I am a huge fan of 2D side scrollers and this one is quite good. While the gameplay is tight and the puzzles are, well puzzling at times, the only complaint I have is that it's not that long. It took me about an hour and a half to play through on the first go. However, the smart achievements and great gameplay had me coming back for more. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good 2D side scrolling game. I was able to grab it on sale but if I had known how good the game was, I would have bought it at full price. Well worth it. Oh, and there are some great 8 bit scores that go perfectly with the tone of the game (lol see what I did there). Do yourself a favor and pick this one up, you won't be disappointed that you did.

												I bought this game for 0,19€ during sales and I feel like I stole the game.The game's quality is well worth it's price (4,99€)^^. Review (SPOILERS!!)Graphics-The graphics are pixelated and are really nice to look at.They kinda remind me of Cave Story ^^. Gameplay-The gameplay is really interesting.You have a ship during the opening section and it's kinda like those arcade space shooters where you go up and down and shoot things that are coming infront of you.After the first short ship section is over you are able to walk on the ground, you have a portal gun but it's nothing like the one from ,,Portal series"" more like a Teleport gun. The teleport gun teleports you when the projectile hit's a wall or something else and it makes for some pretty clever ways to pass trough an obstacle. You can find a gun at some point an you can kill enemies with it. There are hidden ship parts an heart containers, the ship parts can be used to upgrade your ship for the final boss battle and the heart containers to make you capable of taking more hits before kicking the bucket. There are only 2 ship sections in the game and they are : Introduction section and final boss ^^. Story-The story is very simple, your space ship is under attack by a notorious villain called Grigori and at the first ship part of the game your ship gets damaged and you crash on an unknown planet. You (the captain of the ship) need to repair your ship and catch Grigori.Grigori is finally defeated by the end of the game or is he?Maybe he is still ,, Out There Somewhere"" Pros +Stage Design.                                        +Music suits                                   the game                                    perfectly.+Good cutscene Art.+Responsive controls.+Fluid sprite animation.+More than one wayto complete the game.+Cards are easy to get.Cons-Kinda Short.-Some music tracksare forgettable.-,,But How?"" Achievment is buggy and sometims you won't get it.(try window mode to get it)Verdict     9,2/10I would honestly pay to see a sequel ^^ "

												Great Soundtrack, Inovative game mechanics and an alright story, if your looking for a good game for cheap this is deffinatly worth it, i wouldnt get this game if it was expensive not because it wasn't a good game but that it only has two hours gametime, your also left with a cliffhanger at the very end meaning potential sequel? If their is i would buy it, I think dev should think about making either multiple planets in either an update, DLC or sequel as i was hoping their would be more then one planet but still worth your time and money!

												Really great little game! I was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed it. (Especially the *second* playthrough!)The game starts with the basics of the teleport gun, and introduces more advanced nuances as you go, requiring you to think how to use the environment and your new techniques to overcome platforming ""puzzles"".  Many of them require quick timing, especially the later ones.  By the end of the game, it leaves you feeling very clever, and with a great feeling of accomplishment.And this is what got me super excited when after beating the game I went back and played through a second time, and suddenly realized there were a ton of new areas/secrets that I could now reach. Areas I could have reached all along, if I had only known the techniques before.There is actually still a secret I have yet to be able to reach, as I am playing without looking at any guides. I think I have figured out how to do it, but it requires amazing split-second timed jumps and shots. I'm enjoying the attempt though!Sure, you could blow throw the game in an hour or so, but finding all the secrets and/or trying to get all the achievements adds a lot more value, and replayability.  If you like clever platformers, give it a go! "

												Definitely recommended (whether at full price or at the insane deal I got it - $0.19), especially for fans of modern 8 or 16 bit style platformers like ""Cave Story+"" and ""VVVVVV.""At its core, ""Out There Somewhere"" is a retro platformer (with a brief bullet hell beginning and ending) that hinges on mastering teleportation and your reaction time to it. While it doesn't approach the sadistic difficulty of ""Super Meat Boy,"" for example, you will need to become increasingly agile and plan ahead in each room as the game progresses. While the core game length is shorter than I had hoped, there are a lot of hidden items to try to collect or you can try to best your speedrun time on another run-through.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a 2D platformer game which would have fit right in back on the NES. While the graphics are probably a bit better than what would have been around back then in some places, on the whole this is a pixel graphics game whose gameplay harkens back to a much simpler time.You play Yuri, a space cop in hot pursuit of Grigori, some sort of bad guy. You start out trying to shoot down his ship, fail, and then have to travel across the planet to confront him and collect a light orb to repower your ship and beat him down in the end-game.The game is very simple. It claims to be inspired by Cave Story, Super Metroid, and Portal, but honestly it is its own thing, and not very much like any of those games. It is very linear, there isn’t much of a plot, and it is very centered around its central game mechanic – a teleportation gun.When Yuri fires his gun, he gets teleported to wherever it hits, with whatever momentum he presently has being preserved. He cannot teleport if he is already right next to the surface he would be teleporting to.He can also jump.These two mechanics make up pretty much all of the gameplay in the game. You do eventually get a gun you can kill monsters and destroy certain blocks with partway through the game, which opens up a few more puzzles, but most of the game is centered around platforming with the teleportation gun – including one room towards the end of the game with no platforms in it at all, which the player scales by shooting shots across the room, landing, then jumping just as the shot hits the far wall.The game cost 50 cents on sale, and is extremely short – this is the sort of thing you can beat in a single sit down. I was pretty heavily achievement and secret hunting and beat the game in 89 minutes my first time through. All that’s left at that point is trying to figure out how to acquire the last few secrets, many of which are pretty devious (such as requiring you to go through about a third of the game without saving once so you can die and respawn at the very start with the block-destroying gun, in order to acquire one of the secrets).Was it worth 50 cents and an hour and a half of my time? I can’t say I wasn’t entertained by it, but it wasn’t high-quality entertainment – the game is decent enough as what it is, but it is not exactly aiming for the stars. If you like 2D platformers with simple, straightforward mechanics, this is probably a decent choice for you; if you like nice graphics, complex gameplay, a sophisticated story, or anything else like that, you’ll probably be disappointed by this game.

I'd say definitely get it, the price is tiny, and you will definitely feel that it is worth the meagre price you paid.  Also, a great bonus are the trading cards, and an 'easy' perfect game.

												""Inspired by Cave Story, Metroid, and Portal""I think a better mashup is Cave Story, R-type, and Portal (with a much smaller scope). I didn't personally get the Metroid vibes.Out There Somewhere is a fun short game (I beat it in about 45 minutes) with good aesthetics and decent level of difficulty. It may only leave you wanting more, as the whole game feels more like a ""first stage"" than a complete game. It definitely has the potential to be something much greater, but overall, I still recommend it. I'd make sure to grab it on sale though, as in my mind, the game is too short for the full price.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a exploration platformer with a mechanic of teleportation. You control Yuri on his quest to repair his ship and escape the planet he crashed on. Armed with a teleportation gun which allows you to fire a shot and then teleport where it lands, you must use this mechanic to your advantage to progress.This game makes excellent use of its core mechanic. The platforming feels solid and incorporates the telegun very well. The difficulty curve feels right, gradually increasing so the player has to use what they have learned in prior levels in new and different ways. Progressing requires quick reflexes and some thinking, and death isn't a hindrance due to instant-respawn. The aesthetic of the game is great, with pixel visuals, and the chiptune soundtrack adds to the feel. The game is a bit short, however. It took me about an hour of gametime to beat the game on my first run, and it left me wanting more. What the game provides is excellent and leaves me wanting more, which could have easily been added. The final boss felt a little underwhelming and could probably have used the game's mechanics better. Overall, I rate Out There Somewhere a 8/10, on the basis that the game is a bit short.			"

												Looking around so see what was on sale and saw this. It looked like a cool metroidvainia with puzzles, then I bought this game yesterday for only 21 cents, and was amazed. For starters the presntation is well executed, the puzzles,platforming and atmosphere felt as though it took a really long time to design. Secondly the puzzle although challenging where at a good level and required well paced shoots and fast reflexes. finally the controls, they are very responsive and tight. However the Z,X,C keys are going to take some time to get use to.Here are my opinions in a pro and cons fationPros:                                                  good atmosphere                             tight controls                                   nice design for enemies                   nice puzzles nice learning curvefew secrets that help in the long runCons:respawning enemeis(depends on person)soundtrack althought beutiful gets repetative after 30 minsAll in all I give this game a solid 8 out of 10			"

												A cute little game by a developer who obviously loves the style and genre.  The puzzles weren't terribly difficult, though a couple required very exact precision and thus might take you one try or a hundred to get right.  Don't expect combat to be any more difficult than the puzzles.Definitely worth more than the nineteen cents they're charging during the Summer Sale.  Not sure if it's worth five dollars, though; it feels like the first chapter or so of a Metroidvania rather than an entire game.Keeping an eye on this developer!			"

PresentationOut There Somewhere is possibly one of the most challenging, unique and intriguing platformers you'll ever play, as it puts you in control of a little alien, stranded on an unknown planet after his ship has crashed as a result of a space battle between him and his nemesis, Grigori, who ended up on the same planet as you, changing the lives of the planet's inhabitants. With that being said, you'll soon be on your way to recover the core needed for your ship to function again and finish what you've started, but to do so you'll have to traverse a long way, filled with danger, friendly and foe aliens and plenty of secrets. While the intelligent life on the planet will mostly only complain about how Grigori has influenced their lives since his arrival, and occasionally open a door for you or give you a hint to where you should head next, the more barbaric enemies simply known as monsters will often stand between you and your next objective, forcing you to think up different strategy on the move. While the plot isn't the most unique one and it certainly doesn't have any twists along the way, it is pleasing to see how many different areas and secrets you can find along the way, some which will often lead to items that will make your journey easier, such as abandoned cores or ancient alien artifacts. There is a certain lack of character development when it comes to the intelligent aliens, which will only interact with you with the same line of dialogue, which in most cases doesn't make any sense.Rating: 7GameplayAs any platformer you'll want to play, gameplay is the key element for an unforgettable experience, and in this aspect, Out There Somewhere brings some interesting concepts to the table, such as the teleport gun which allows you to send a beam to any wall that will teleport you there once it reaches its destination. As that mechanic alone would soon run out of challenging situations, blue, red and green beams will make puzzles more difficult, as red beams will block your teleportation beam, blue beams will stop the gun's beam at their location, and green beams will send it upwards. Combing those simple mechanics with the machine gun that will allow you to shoot enemies in your path in addition to using the teleport gun creates situations that are challenging, yet fun to solve and think your way out of. Secrets are also an important part of the experience, as exploration is rewarded with items such as health upgrades or the machine gun upgrade that allows you to shoot faster, and looking for different alternatives out of a certain screen will often take you to a completely new one with a new challenge ahead. The most important thing is that the game allows you to play however you want to, as you can avoid shooting enemies completely, making your way forward using the teleport gun alone, or take your time, explore the world around you and make sure you collect everything along the way.Rating: 8GraphicsOut There Somewhere goes for an old school look, with simple, low resolution textures formed out of squares, and while that art style fits the concept of the game fairly well, the problem comes in the form of repetition using those textures, as each screen will look similar to the previous one, and even when you do reach an area that's meant to feel and look different such as Grigori's Tower, it still feels like the same square with a different color shade on top.Rating: 6.5AudioThe audio quality is pretty cheap, which isn't necessarily a problem since there isn't much to hear aside from the effects that will only show up when you command them to. The soundtrack is okay for this time of game, but it does get boring pretty quickly, but since there isn't much else to hear aside from the background song, you could just mute it and play your own tunes.Rating: 5.5ExtrasIt will probably take you around one hour to complete Out There Somewhere for the first time, but just as a note the game can be completed in less than 15 minutes, and the game even encourages you to do that as it has a specific achievement. You could play it a second time to earn all the achievements and see the secret areas you might have missed, but afterwards that's it.Rating: 6VerdictOut There Somewhere is a cute, challenging adventure to spend your afternoon with, as long as you don't mind the fact that it will be over fairly soon, but for its low price and a possible secondary replay, it's worth a try.Rating Overall: 6.6Check out the full review and a lot more about Out There Somewhere at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=357 "

												The game feels a lot like a student project more than a completed video game.The story is almost non-existant, all you know is that you crash land on a planet and need to defeat some Russian named fellow. The gameplay, while decent, feels very unoriginal. Sure the idea of a gun that teleports you to where it hits seems novel at first, but the game doesn't really do much to challenge the player with the ideas presented by the gun. Also, the only real areas that feel like you would benefit from understanding the game's mechanics are, oddly enough, the first few screens. You can shave off, roughly, 15 seconds there by using teleport and jumps and just knowing how the jumping as a whole works. The absolute worst part of the game is the beginning and ending SHUMP sections though. The devs must not have known how to make a very good SHUMP because what they put forth was one of the worst I've ever experienced. The ship has can take several hits, which is nice because the hit detection can be a little wonky, but there's a lot of things that are just plain wrong. There's no invulnerablity at all after being hit in the ship, which means if you move incorrectly and get hit once you aren't given any time to regroup, you need to go into full panic mode. This also leads to another interesting glitch, which is also present in the normal sections of the game, if you get hit by something that explodes you take three hearts of damage. Be it a plane or missile in the SHUMP sections or the big monster's explosive shots. On the brightside, this allows you to finish the opening SHUMP section in 3 seconds as you only need to crash onto the planet and not beat the Russian guy.The game is a good pickup if it's really cheap, because you won't be able to squeeze much more than 4 hours out of it, assuming you're attempting to 100% it, and those 4 hours will definitely not involve you being fully engrossed by the game. If you want a Metroidvania game with more depth I recommend the Shantae games or Guacamelee.			"

												I don't know what to say about this game, its concept is pretty unique and its soo entertainingIt's like:+You have a teleport gun, wich allows u to teleport ofcourse, u can use it to reach and some paces u did not know actually existed in the game +There are quite a lot of secrets:-The mysterious cores, more=upgrade to ship for the final boss (5 cores=small upgrade, 8-9 cores=medium upgrade, all 11 cores=big upgrade)                                                       -The extra lifes (wich come in handy a lot)                                                       -The weapon upgrade (wich is OP as crap, trust me)+Quite a cool little story+Strategy, u need a bit just a bit of thinking before teleporting to random places, considering the momentum ( u will know what i mean when u play it)+Pretty easy to do achivments, i said PRETTY EASY, not that easy (at least not all of em) but still, easy, i need 1 more achivments to have all of em, and I'm not an achivment hunter, soooo.....+Great replay valueNow the little - of the game:-Its pretty short, if u are like u don't know anythink about the game, it takes around 1 hour and 30 minutes to finish it, if u know what u are doing, know the game, and all of that, u can finish it in less then 20 or 30 minutes (there is even an achivment to finish the game in 20 minutes, finished it in 19:43 seconds, omfg thats was hard)-Exept for the story witch i alerdy said it's short, theres no other modesNow the thinks that would make this game 200% cooler, and witch i ask the developers to do:=A level editor, so we can make our little story=PVP cause there are guns and teleporters, what else do u need? A shotgun? (would not hurt :D)=CO-OP, cause when u have your little story u dont want to play it alone. do u?I love this game, i just do, u need to take itTake it..TAKE ITI SAID TAKE IT FOR GOD SAKE!JK do what u want, if u don't take it, its your big mistake, not mine, alerdy got it, why do i speak so much, IDK maybe u can answer that question, but u don't know me and.....WTF i talk soo much? maybe u can...STOP ITJust buy it, worth every penny			"

												This game is extremely fun. I've replayed it numerous times trying to get all the achievements and trying to beat my fastest time.  It's quite a short game but you can spend ages on it.  The puzzles are challenging and require some skill although they can be done with some practice.  I'd say definitely get it, the price is tiny, and you will definitely feel that it is worth the meagre price you paid.  Also, a great bonus are the trading cards, and an 'easy' perfect game.  Oh, and the soundtrack is amazing.			"

												TL;DR This game is gold. Cheap gold, at that.It’s a delightfully simple platformer that is much more of a “puzzle platformer,” if such a thing exists. The game mechanics are very simple and the controls are nicely tight.The game mechanics involve avoiding various obstacles (the usual, lava, monsters, projectiles, although there are very little and it’s more trying to get around the level than dodge), and using your Teleport Gun which may or may not have been stolen directly out of Portal or something – I don’t know, as I haven’t played Portal. Whatever its origins, it’s quite an interesting mechanic as it conserves speed, meaning that if you have enough space (and are required to do this twice) you can climb up an entire screen.The game has nicely low quantities of threats, focusing far more on actually getting to the next stage – especially as you only get something that can actually kill mobs mid-game (and if you head back to that screen, they respawn) You can afford to misjudge a jump or a teleport and nothing bad will happen, really – there’s checkpoints on most levels, and when there isn’t it’s usually because there was a checkpoint at the end of the previous one (“level” is an odd word to use, “screens” is much better).Surprisingly, the game does not through absurdly large quantities of obscure once-use-only bricks at you that you see in two levels and then never again. The only example is the “Mirror” block, which reflects your teleport bullet horizontally; this appears in three levels and then is completely forgotten about; rather amusingly it’s possible to complete those three levels without using the mirrors anyway.There’s two other unwritten rules of platformers this game breaks:- The final boss has only two, not three phases (three is a magical number in video games)- There is no screen whereby “Jump over the lava pits” / “Jump repeatedly onto platforms”Speaking of bonus sections, despite being a rather memorable platformer whereby the main challenge is routing, meaning it’s much easier the second time, the game has surprisingly large replay value (for a simple platformer). It took me an hour and a bit to beat the game the first time, but I continued to complete it about five more times (and a good deal of that was in Offline Mode, so that’s why the playtime is so low). The game has this high replay value thanks to a large quantity of bonus sections (on your first playthrough you probably won’t go through about 1/3 of all the screens), which are accessible from the get-go but you haven’t learned the ins and outs of the teleport gun yet. And because the game knows that it’s going to be easy and a bit of a slog, it makes the game easier for you – these bonus sections contain three types of useful stuff. It’s also got interesting, not grinding, achievements which is always something worth noting – and also ones that you probably won’t unlock by accident whilst merely idling through. Most achievements are either “Grind grind grind” (e.g. AOE2’s “Win as Civ X 1000 times for EVERY SINGLE CIVILIZATION (about twenty of them) or “Play the game” (e.g. Terraria’s “Chop a tree! Make an anvil! Find a chest!), and it’s nice to see some achievements that you not so much have to actively think about getting – it’s more they don’t happen by accident. If you explore lots you’re bound to get a good deal of them.This is also the only game whereby I have been able to stunlock the boss thanks to some exploits in the boss AI, as well as fire more bullets than the final boss does – however, this requires intensive exploration. When you fight the first phase of the boss, despite only having one life his attacks are easy to dodge when you know how (although I spent a solid seven minutes dying repeatedly until learning how to dodge) – when you have four and a machine gun it does become a bit of a joke. Still, it is a lighthearted final boss in line with the light difficulty of the rest of the platformer. It’s more puzzle than run ‘n’ gun, although not much “running” happens anyway.The difficulty curve is very nice, probably slightly too slow – but the game is very lighthearted and not meant to be insanely difficult. The game gives you a decently large quantity of hints in the game on tips of your teleport gun, but not enough to be an insta-win and also low enough to keep me occupied on a single screen for about ten minutes before finally working out what to do.Progression is extremely linear with the exception of about three cases, which is a bit odd as this game would have lent itself to a multi-route system extremely well. The soundtrack is merely “good.” What stops it from being “excellent” is the fact that the composer had so many nice melodies, nicely hummable in their own right, and just lumped them all on top of one another in certain sections. To call those parts of the music “busy” is an understatement, but one track – Surface – doesn’t do that nearly as much and is much nicer to listen to. If the soundtrack was a little more… heh, a little more ‘empty’ in places (only in places) it would be “excellent.”Oh, and the game has precious little plot, enough to give you information on what’s going on but nothing particularly huge – but unlike some platformers, it doesn’t throw you into wacko things that should never have existed (why are there so many homing rockets and landmines in some icy mountains? Who put these all there and why is there a convenient route through them instead of an impassable barrier – that’s Airscape for you). So that’s nice.And to top it all off, I checked the Store Page’s price.$1.09 NZD – and that wasn’t on sale. It wasn’t on sale. Amazing.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a simple as well as simply priced game on Steam with a lots of detail added in such a short little space adventure.  While it is short in stature, it makes up for it with the quality put into the the low price, sprite-work, and the gameplay.  The game itself costs two dollars on Steam, so it is very unlikely you will regret your purchase with all of the fibers of your wallet if you dislike it, unless of course those two dollars were needed to save you from dying of hunger. Of course, there is a chance one might receive a coupon for it upon crafting a badge or something, further decreasing the affordable price.  The sprites give off a very solid Metroid reminiscence, which is fair because the game was reportedly inspired by Super Metroid.  Each of the environments are tailored almost exclusively with each screen that your character passes through.  They may have an underlying theme to it all, be it uncharted wasteland to menacing metal, but they all have something unique in level design incorporated within the game.  The game is built around a teleportation mechanic.   A specially designed gun fires a blue bullet that, upon impact with any solid platform, teleports you to that specific location.  The gameplay revolves around you, and how you determine when to fire, not to mention time how long the bullet takes to reach your designated location.  Of course, with all of those pluses, the game itself is rather short.  If you do not go out of your way to find any collectables, (and even if you do) the game boils down to a solid hour or two of total playtime.  Which is a shame, because the teleport gun mechanic is rather fun to play around with.  Another issue I have with the game is the way the levels are organized.  I feel as though game is very linear, each level designed to be a simple obstacle that prevents you from proceeding, so any unique level concepts are used once and left behind.  If one wanted to find the collectables aforementioned, they would have to backtrack through each of the levels that appeared to be designed in mind for separate challenges meant simply for providing something to hop through once and be done with, compared to games like the original Metroid or its remake, Zero Mission where there are several tunnels connected in a sense where you can be familiar with the layout and return without it feeling like you have to return through a single linear stretch.  However, the game is a solid buy through and through.  If you feel like adventuring on an alien planet with a trusty teleportation machine, feel free to buy for a short yet sweet playthrough.			"

												This is a truly innovative retro puzzle-platformer. It mechanics I have never seen used in another game. It has a really good difficulty curve and you gradually learn more and more complicated moves that use the same basic mechanic. The world is interesting and the soundtrack is top notch. The only downside is that a normal playthrough will only take about an hour. It does have some replay value as there are plenty of hidden items to collect that require some pretty advanced puzzle-solving. I recommend it highly, even though it is a short game.			"

												First off, this game is NOT like Cave Story, Super Metroid, and Portal,  but it is one of my favorite 2D games that I have played recently. A lot of reviews complain about how short it is, but I found it to be good motivation to go through the game again since it is really hard to backtrack to find everything and eventually I ended up beating it in 19 minutes. This is one of the few games I accually TRY to get all the achivements in. Completely worth it for the low price.			"

												Fun little puzzle (sort of, I guess?) / platforming game. It's a good game for the price (and a steal at 19c as of this review). I mean, come on, you get to use a teleport gun. My only complaint is that you can't change the keybinds of the 3 buttons this game has to any of the non-letter keys (at least, that's my experience). I wanted to map jump to space, but unfortunately, the game has a list of pre-set keybinds which the player can set.			"

												(8/10)Cute little game thats a fusion of the various games it mentions in its blurb.  The music/graphics are very reminiscent of cave story, as are the very tight controls.  The main game is an exploratory metroidvania style, with a few secrets and some definite portalish puzzle solving.The various elements gel very well together and the overall play was fun and engaging, while it lasted.  I'm not normally a 'time snob' but it definitely felt like the game was over all too soon.  Aiding that was the notion that there was never really a chance to go back and grab all those secrets you saw glimpses of earlier.  If you miss it, odds are, you missed it, and thats that.I may actually do a second walkthrough enhanced run just to see what effects some of the last things i didn't do would have, but as it stands if you mostly just do forward progress you can probably beat it in just an hour or two.  (some kinda plus mode, or just some oportunity to 'turn back' at the end so you could finish collecting would have been appreciated).As it stands though I did like it, and did have fun, and would reccomend it specifically to cave story fans who also like puzzle games because more than anything else this is a great fusion of those two styles.

												I bought this by impulse when I saw the price is around 20 cents. Decided to try it a bit and I instantly fell in love to the art style and music; it felt so nostalgic, like something from the NES era.Out There Somewhere is a puzzle platformer game. The puzzle is on how you get to that side of the screen. To do it, you'll need to think, plan, and execute it with perfect timing which most of the time will require several tries to get it right. There are diverse mechanics in the game and it is combined in later areas to make challenging puzzles. What I really like is how the game made you understand the mechanic without long or complex tutorial. The game will just say ""If you do X then Y."" After that, the game will throw you a simple puzzle that revolve around that one mechanic. Some other time the game won't even tell anything; you just found yourself in a new area with some element you never see before. The area's goal is to make you familiar with a new gameplay mechanic without even telling you it's there. That is what other game needs to copy.The game is rather short. I beat the story (not 100%) in under 1 hour (58 minutes to be exact). I was surprised when the credit rolls because I really really really want to play more. Yes, this game is that good. The story itself is really underdeveloped. It's like the developer just need an excuse for player to go to the end game. Yet, that somehow reminds me of most Old School games with lackluster story (The princess is in another castle GFF!F@%@R#&!!!!)Overall, the game is really enjoyable, easy to learn, but challenging.

												Ignore anyone saying this is not a good game, For they are F4GG0T5.Great little platformer harkening back to the days of commander keen, cave story and other similar otherwordly 2d jump and fight festivals.Really nice mechanics, smooth and fair gameplay and some puzzles that (while not being particularly challenging) are interesting and fun enough to keep you interested until the end. It is NOT a long game but I think this almost works in its favour. I think something like this would get irksome/annoying if they focused much more on timed jumping and awkward, multi-stage puzzles which I suppose they'd have to do to ramp up the difficulty any further.As it is the challenge is pleasant, it's fun to look for the extra secrets and (I thought) the game had a nice atmosphere. Perhaps it's not everyones cup of tea and if you're a resolutely modern (F4G1T) gamer then this might not please you but if you like to do more with your gaming time than endless games of CS:GO whilst pulling at your pants and screaming obscenities down the mic then this might well be something you'll enjoy.I was gifted the game but I believe it was really cheap lately and would definitely have been worth that price but I'd say, also, that at full price it's still a worthwhile investment. There's a fair chunk of replayability and I think it's sensible to support people making games like this as it's the textbook definition (to me) of ""A fun game"". There are just under 1000 games in my steam library, 90% of which I have NEVER played. I played this solidly until completion.Then I completed it again.10/10 kept my mind busy and gave me no desire to pull at my pants or scream down a microphone. It doesn't even HAVE mic support.			"

And because the game knows that it’s going to be easy and a bit of a slog, it makes the game easier for you – these bonus sections contain three types of useful stuff. It’s also got interesting, not grinding, achievements which is always something worth noting – and also ones that you probably won’t unlock by accident whilst merely idling through. Most achievements are either “Grind grind grind” (e.g. AOE2’s “Win as Civ X 1000 times for EVERY SINGLE CIVILIZATION (about twenty of them) or “Play the game” (e.g. Terraria’s “Chop a tree! Make an anvil! Find a chest!), and it’s nice to see some achievements that you not so much have to actively think about getting – it’s more they don’t happen by accident. If you explore lots you’re bound to get a good deal of them.This is also the only game whereby I have been able to stunlock the boss thanks to some exploits in the boss AI, as well as fire more bullets than the final boss does – however, this requires intensive exploration. When you fight the first phase of the boss, despite only having one life his attacks are easy to dodge when you know how (although I spent a solid seven minutes dying repeatedly until learning how to dodge) – when you have four and a machine gun it does become a bit of a joke. Still, it is a lighthearted final boss in line with the light difficulty of the rest of the platformer. It’s more puzzle than run ‘n’ gun, although not much “running” happens anyway.The difficulty curve is very nice, probably slightly too slow – but the game is very lighthearted and not meant to be insanely difficult. The game gives you a decently large quantity of hints in the game on tips of your teleport gun, but not enough to be an insta-win and also low enough to keep me occupied on a single screen for about ten minutes before finally working out what to do.Progression is extremely linear with the exception of about three cases, which is a bit odd as this game would have lent itself to a multi-route system extremely well. The soundtrack is merely “good.” What stops it from being “excellent” is the fact that the composer had so many nice melodies, nicely hummable in their own right, and just lumped them all on top of one another in certain sections. To call those parts of the music “busy” is an understatement, but one track – Surface – doesn’t do that nearly as much and is much nicer to listen to. If the soundtrack was a little more… heh, a little more ‘empty’ in places (only in places) it would be “excellent.”Oh, and the game has precious little plot, enough to give you information on what’s going on but nothing particularly huge – but unlike some platformers, it doesn’t throw you into wacko things that should never have existed (why are there so many homing rockets and landmines in some icy mountains? Who put these all there and why is there a convenient route through them instead of an impassable barrier – that’s Airscape for you). So that’s nice.And to top it all off, I checked the Store Page’s price.$1.09 NZD – and that wasn’t on sale. It wasn’t on sale. Amazing.			"

												Definitely recommended (whether at full price or at the insane deal I got it - $0.19), especially for fans of modern 8 or 16 bit style platformers like ""Cave Story+"" and ""VVVVVV.""At its core, ""Out There Somewhere"" is a retro platformer (with a brief bullet hell beginning and ending) that hinges on mastering teleportation and your reaction time to it. While it doesn't approach the sadistic difficulty of ""Super Meat Boy,"" for example, you will need to become increasingly agile and plan ahead in each room as the game progresses. While the core game length is shorter than I had hoped, there are a lot of hidden items to try to collect or you can try to best your speedrun time on another run-through.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a 2D platformer game which would have fit right in back on the NES. While the graphics are probably a bit better than what would have been around back then in some places, on the whole this is a pixel graphics game whose gameplay harkens back to a much simpler time.You play Yuri, a space cop in hot pursuit of Grigori, some sort of bad guy. You start out trying to shoot down his ship, fail, and then have to travel across the planet to confront him and collect a light orb to repower your ship and beat him down in the end-game.The game is very simple. It claims to be inspired by Cave Story, Super Metroid, and Portal, but honestly it is its own thing, and not very much like any of those games. It is very linear, there isn’t much of a plot, and it is very centered around its central game mechanic – a teleportation gun.When Yuri fires his gun, he gets teleported to wherever it hits, with whatever momentum he presently has being preserved. He cannot teleport if he is already right next to the surface he would be teleporting to.He can also jump.These two mechanics make up pretty much all of the gameplay in the game. You do eventually get a gun you can kill monsters and destroy certain blocks with partway through the game, which opens up a few more puzzles, but most of the game is centered around platforming with the teleportation gun – including one room towards the end of the game with no platforms in it at all, which the player scales by shooting shots across the room, landing, then jumping just as the shot hits the far wall.The game cost 50 cents on sale, and is extremely short – this is the sort of thing you can beat in a single sit down. I was pretty heavily achievement and secret hunting and beat the game in 89 minutes my first time through. All that’s left at that point is trying to figure out how to acquire the last few secrets, many of which are pretty devious (such as requiring you to go through about a third of the game without saving once so you can die and respawn at the very start with the block-destroying gun, in order to acquire one of the secrets).Was it worth 50 cents and an hour and a half of my time? I can’t say I wasn’t entertained by it, but it wasn’t high-quality entertainment – the game is decent enough as what it is, but it is not exactly aiming for the stars. If you like 2D platformers with simple, straightforward mechanics, this is probably a decent choice for you; if you like nice graphics, complex gameplay, a sophisticated story, or anything else like that, you’ll probably be disappointed by this game.

												Out There Somewhere is a platformer/shooter game in which you find yourself crash landed on a distant planet far from your home world. At first it may seem to be more along the lines of an ""R-Type""-esque scrolling shooter, but that only lasts for a moment. Stranded, you need to find a new power core for your space ship so you may return from being ""Out There Somewhere"".The gameplay is simple to grasp but it has several nuances that require a great deal of practice in order to master. Using the WASD keys you move your character back and forth, and you use the x and c button to shoot your portal gun and use something else found later in the game ( no need to spoil that ). While the controls at first may seem a bit wonky (nor is there an option to remap the keys), with a little time it is not hard to get used to them. Your teleporter gun will be your main mode of transportation and movement. While the game is inspired by Portal, instead of using the one end spits out another end, your teleporter gun changes your location to match where the bullet hits a wall. One of the cool mechanics surrounding this is that your momentum before you teleport is maintained after the teleport, allowing you to jump just before impact to scale walls you normally would not be able to get over.The music in the game is a pleasent albeit repetitive set of chiptunes, each unique area having its own sound. There is an option to turn off the music present in the main settings (along with various in-game sounds). Story is minimal at best, and history is presented through both the visuals and interactions you will have the inhabitants of this planet.Gameplay: 9Music: 8Story: N/AMechanics/Controls: 9Overall: 8.75/10The game itself is very solid although it is very short, at $5 it is definitely worth the look. It also often goes on sale for as low as $0.19, and at that price the game is a must buy for anybody that enjoys platformers (while the trading cards will also cover the price as well).			"

But i can already tell it is a great one! Hell just running around and shooting your teleport gun for no reason is the greatest thing ever! Especially when you get to the reflecting cubes....I made my game crash. anyways if you are looking for an enjoyable game/experience then get this. 10/10 :DUpdate: Beat the game and started over.

												Fantastic, but short, puzzle-platforming game. The primary mechanic is your telegun, whose bullets don't hurt enemies but do instantly teleport you to whatever surface they hit. The devs manage to stretch this mechanic quite a bit and create a few very tricky rooms. Art is just pixel art, but it's very good pixel art, and the music is stellar; overall, the alien atmosphere feels very well-fleshed-out. My main complaint is that this is not a Metroidvania game, as the inspirations it lists on the store page would imply; there are a couple heart containers and ship upgrades, but the latter are pretty useless and the game itself is basically linear. Rather than drawing in fans of Super Metroid or Cave Story, I think people who enjoyed VVVVVV would be the most likely to have fun with Out There Somewhere. Again, it's short: my first run through the game took about 50 minutes. Though, it's a good bit longer if you're a completionist, since getting all the achievements was about 3 hours total without a guide. Plus, if you're of the speedrunning type, then the telejump mechanic offers a lot of potential there. The game's only $2 at full price and gets even cheaper in sales and with various bundles, so if you happen to see it it's definitely worth picking up.			"

												Really great little game! I was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed it. (Especially the *second* playthrough!)The game starts with the basics of the teleport gun, and introduces more advanced nuances as you go, requiring you to think how to use the environment and your new techniques to overcome platforming ""puzzles"".  Many of them require quick timing, especially the later ones.  By the end of the game, it leaves you feeling very clever, and with a great feeling of accomplishment.And this is what got me super excited when after beating the game I went back and played through a second time, and suddenly realized there were a ton of new areas/secrets that I could now reach. Areas I could have reached all along, if I had only known the techniques before.There is actually still a secret I have yet to be able to reach, as I am playing without looking at any guides. I think I have figured out how to do it, but it requires amazing split-second timed jumps and shots. I'm enjoying the attempt though!Sure, you could blow throw the game in an hour or so, but finding all the secrets and/or trying to get all the achievements adds a lot more value, and replayability.  If you like clever platformers, give it a go! "

However, the smart achievements and great gameplay had me coming back for more. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good 2D side scrolling game. I was able to grab it on sale but if I had known how good the game was, I would have bought it at full price. Well worth it.

If you want to spend a fun hour or so, but dont want to spend too much money, this game is for you; And even then, if you really like it (like me), you can try to complete achievements or speedrun (or both) which is what I do. The game itsleft lasts for 1-2 hours, (which is completely worth your money taking in account how cheap it is btw) and if you are a completionist or a speedrunner like me, this game can easily give you up to 10 hours of fun or even more. And its not just the play time; its the play value... Every single minute of this game is just pure fun. Its cheerfull, clever, it has perfect pacing and makes and its puzzles never get too easy or too hard. TL,DR: Amazing game, incredibly fun and unbelievably cheap. Give it a try, Im sure you can spare the money, I promise you wont regret it.			"

												This is a 2D-puzzle platformer. And a bloody good one at that. It contains a sort of portal gun. The puzzles are not very easy but not to hard either. There are also quite the amount of secrets to find in this game. It is a lovely little game. You can however beat the campaign in about an hour and a half. The game gets a lot longer once you try to get 100% on the achievements. I got the full 100% now in about 9 hours and trust me that's not an amazing achievement, it is just that short. And the time added to the game is mostly just artificially added to the game. Not actual gameplay, just a lot of things you have to do a certain way that a lot of time to the game. So, lovely little puzzle game but short.Final conclusion: If you get this game for the full price off 5 euro you might be paying a bit too much. But if you're one of the people like me who bout it for 0,19 euro you have paid way to little for this fun game :D			"

PresentationOut There Somewhere is possibly one of the most challenging, unique and intriguing platformers you'll ever play, as it puts you in control of a little alien, stranded on an unknown planet after his ship has crashed as a result of a space battle between him and his nemesis, Grigori, who ended up on the same planet as you, changing the lives of the planet's inhabitants. With that being said, you'll soon be on your way to recover the core needed for your ship to function again and finish what you've started, but to do so you'll have to traverse a long way, filled with danger, friendly and foe aliens and plenty of secrets. While the intelligent life on the planet will mostly only complain about how Grigori has influenced their lives since his arrival, and occasionally open a door for you or give you a hint to where you should head next, the more barbaric enemies simply known as monsters will often stand between you and your next objective, forcing you to think up different strategy on the move. While the plot isn't the most unique one and it certainly doesn't have any twists along the way, it is pleasing to see how many different areas and secrets you can find along the way, some which will often lead to items that will make your journey easier, such as abandoned cores or ancient alien artifacts. There is a certain lack of character development when it comes to the intelligent aliens, which will only interact with you with the same line of dialogue, which in most cases doesn't make any sense.Rating: 7GameplayAs any platformer you'll want to play, gameplay is the key element for an unforgettable experience, and in this aspect, Out There Somewhere brings some interesting concepts to the table, such as the teleport gun which allows you to send a beam to any wall that will teleport you there once it reaches its destination. As that mechanic alone would soon run out of challenging situations, blue, red and green beams will make puzzles more difficult, as red beams will block your teleportation beam, blue beams will stop the gun's beam at their location, and green beams will send it upwards. Combing those simple mechanics with the machine gun that will allow you to shoot enemies in your path in addition to using the teleport gun creates situations that are challenging, yet fun to solve and think your way out of. Secrets are also an important part of the experience, as exploration is rewarded with items such as health upgrades or the machine gun upgrade that allows you to shoot faster, and looking for different alternatives out of a certain screen will often take you to a completely new one with a new challenge ahead. The most important thing is that the game allows you to play however you want to, as you can avoid shooting enemies completely, making your way forward using the teleport gun alone, or take your time, explore the world around you and make sure you collect everything along the way.Rating: 8GraphicsOut There Somewhere goes for an old school look, with simple, low resolution textures formed out of squares, and while that art style fits the concept of the game fairly well, the problem comes in the form of repetition using those textures, as each screen will look similar to the previous one, and even when you do reach an area that's meant to feel and look different such as Grigori's Tower, it still feels like the same square with a different color shade on top.Rating: 6.5AudioThe audio quality is pretty cheap, which isn't necessarily a problem since there isn't much to hear aside from the effects that will only show up when you command them to. The soundtrack is okay for this time of game, but it does get boring pretty quickly, but since there isn't much else to hear aside from the background song, you could just mute it and play your own tunes.Rating: 5.5ExtrasIt will probably take you around one hour to complete Out There Somewhere for the first time, but just as a note the game can be completed in less than 15 minutes, and the game even encourages you to do that as it has a specific achievement. You could play it a second time to earn all the achievements and see the secret areas you might have missed, but afterwards that's it.Rating: 6VerdictOut There Somewhere is a cute, challenging adventure to spend your afternoon with, as long as you don't mind the fact that it will be over fairly soon, but for its low price and a possible secondary replay, it's worth a try.Rating Overall: 6.6Check out the full review and a lot more about Out There Somewhere at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=357 "

												A 16-bit puzzle platformer that may be short but it packs quite a punch. It takes queues from many puzzle/platformers, such as: Portal, Half-Life, Braid, and VVVVVV, just to name a few. You play as a spaceship captain who, aided by helpful aliens must repair your ship to return out there somewhere. While the premise and the controls of the game are straight forward, this game is more challenging than meets the eye. If you enjoy bit graphics and are also a fan of platformers you should be playing it right now.			"

												Fun little puzzle (sort of, I guess?) / platforming game. It's a good game for the price (and a steal at 19c as of this review). I mean, come on, you get to use a teleport gun. My only complaint is that you can't change the keybinds of the 3 buttons this game has to any of the non-letter keys (at least, that's my experience). I wanted to map jump to space, but unfortunately, the game has a list of pre-set keybinds which the player can set.			"

												Well, ""Out There Somewhere"" is indeed a fun little game with nice mechanics, music and visual style. So far so good. It'll probably be one those games that could get you hoocked for hours, and you wont feel like you wasted your precious life. That is of course, if it actually lasted that much.As fun and pretty as it is, this game is too darn short; free flash-game short. You might find longer (and probably better) games on the Portal Archives in Newgrounds. Too bad nobody cares about those sites anymore.However, i'm recomending this game because i just happened to stumble across it when it was on sale. For less than a buck. And it has Steam Cards. Also remember, i said that i liked the game itself, it's just too short. But if you can get it dirt cheap, go for it. It's totally worth it; you might even get your money back by selling the cards. Otherwise, wait. Put it on your wishlist if you really want it and grab it on the next sale. It's a nice game. "

												This is a great little game! I am a huge fan of 2D side scrollers and this one is quite good. While the gameplay is tight and the puzzles are, well puzzling at times, the only complaint I have is that it's not that long. It took me about an hour and a half to play through on the first go. However, the smart achievements and great gameplay had me coming back for more. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good 2D side scrolling game. I was able to grab it on sale but if I had known how good the game was, I would have bought it at full price. Well worth it. Oh, and there are some great 8 bit scores that go perfectly with the tone of the game (lol see what I did there). Do yourself a favor and pick this one up, you won't be disappointed that you did.

												Dunno what it is about the game, but i liked it instantly.Must be something about the way the game was designed and presented. It doesn't waste any time with overlong exposure and gets right down to the good stuff, mainly controls, animations and characters. The tiles aren't the prettiest though i wouldn't call the game ugly by any means. Animations and music give it a very good athmosphere.It focuses less on action, combat or powerups, and more on puzzles with a healthy serving of platforming. Climb everything and explore everywhere! It somewhat resembles Cave Story, but with fewer monsters (at least initialy) and less fighting. It has it's share of cutesy aliens and quirky characters, though the stories cannot be compared.The only downside is that there's no difficulty options and that it's not a very long game. I finished it in about an hour, but i enjoyed it. It's not brutaly easy but it's quite forgiving, which could be a good thing if you rage easily.I don't know why you're not playing this game. It's mix of puzzles and platforming requires some skill and feels rewarding. I'll admit that it doesn't look like a winner just by looking at the trailer & screenshots, but it's solid.Yes, recommended.			"

												Great little game. It'll take you about 2 hours to beat the first time but it was so good I played it until I got all the achievements.I feel like everything this game does is good. The teleporting mechanics are on point, the graphics are very good if a bit too dark for my liking, the level design is very competent, the game provides a decent challenge and it's very rewarding to try and speedrun it.If I had to complain about something, the side-scrolling bits at the beginning and the end, while justified story-wise, feel a bit out of place. Although they are competent and don't feel rushed.I've seen some people say it's too short but I didn't find that a problem. I often get quite disappointed with games that overstay their welcome by adding more and more mechanics that end up not feeling coherent with the main mechanics of the game. That's the problem I had with Portal 2 over the original Portal and I would say Out There Somewhere falls on the side of Portal: it has few mechanics that work very well and that are exploited as much as possible through the course of the game. All the mechanics that get added through the course of the game complement the main teleporting mechanic and get used from that point onwards.Overall, for its price, it's a must to have in your library. Also, it seems like it's always discounted so more reason to own it.			"

												A very fun, if not very short, game. I picked it up during the Halloween Sale and it was mere cents, but I certainly got more than what I paid for.While it may not have the length or lasting power of other indie games, what Out There Somewhere does have is a fun teleporting mechanic similar to Portal. Unlike Portal, however, you can teleport basically anywhere you can think of, leading to a bunch of fun exploration and discovery. The game never slows down, either, leading to puzzles always being a matter of reflexes and wit rather than bland repetition like some...other indie games.Overall, Id love to see more of this kind of gameplay from the developers, and give Out There Somewhere a solid 7.5/10			"

No need for a huge graphics card with the best i7 core you can possibly get, it will run on about anything. So yes, very reccomended.			"

												Great little game. It'll take you about 2 hours to beat the first time but it was so good I played it until I got all the achievements.I feel like everything this game does is good. The teleporting mechanics are on point, the graphics are very good if a bit too dark for my liking, the level design is very competent, the game provides a decent challenge and it's very rewarding to try and speedrun it.If I had to complain about something, the side-scrolling bits at the beginning and the end, while justified story-wise, feel a bit out of place. Although they are competent and don't feel rushed.I've seen some people say it's too short but I didn't find that a problem. I often get quite disappointed with games that overstay their welcome by adding more and more mechanics that end up not feeling coherent with the main mechanics of the game. That's the problem I had with Portal 2 over the original Portal and I would say Out There Somewhere falls on the side of Portal: it has few mechanics that work very well and that are exploited as much as possible through the course of the game. All the mechanics that get added through the course of the game complement the main teleporting mechanic and get used from that point onwards.Overall, for its price, it's a must to have in your library. Also, it seems like it's always discounted so more reason to own it.			"

												Dunno what it is about the game, but i liked it instantly.Must be something about the way the game was designed and presented. It doesn't waste any time with overlong exposure and gets right down to the good stuff, mainly controls, animations and characters. The tiles aren't the prettiest though i wouldn't call the game ugly by any means. Animations and music give it a very good athmosphere.It focuses less on action, combat or powerups, and more on puzzles with a healthy serving of platforming. Climb everything and explore everywhere! It somewhat resembles Cave Story, but with fewer monsters (at least initialy) and less fighting. It has it's share of cutesy aliens and quirky characters, though the stories cannot be compared.The only downside is that there's no difficulty options and that it's not a very long game. I finished it in about an hour, but i enjoyed it. It's not brutaly easy but it's quite forgiving, which could be a good thing if you rage easily.I don't know why you're not playing this game. It's mix of puzzles and platforming requires some skill and feels rewarding. I'll admit that it doesn't look like a winner just by looking at the trailer & screenshots, but it's solid.Yes, recommended.			"

 SPOILER ALERT	I feel like that game is really worth the price... best spent 19 cents on a game. The Story	Humanity is in peril, Allies receives a signal that the notorious villain Grigori is attacking again and decide to call Yuri - our hero for help.As he sets out to fight Grigori, his ship gets destroyed and he sees Grigori landing on an unknown planet and he decides to follow him without any other choice since he crashes on the planet.As soon as our hero lands he sees that Grigori has imprisoned the intelligent life on this planet.          He must free the planet's citizens, find a power source to get his ship to work again and defeat Grigori for good. Gameplay	The game revolves mostly around teleporting which is done via your teleporting gun (It's nothing like portal's portal gun).You get teleported the moment your bullet hits a wall and you depending on your timing you can jump after teleporting which can help you reach otherwise unreachable locations and it makes up for really clever platforming.The movement and shooting once you obtain your Gauss gun really remind me of Cave Story which is a good thing.You can also collect 3 Alien artifacts with each one making you more durable to damage. Pros.	+Great pixelated art                 +Great music                                +Alot of replay value+Memorable protagonist+Fluid Gameplay.+Alot of secret collectibles. Cons.	-Really short Final Verdict   9.6/10	 "

												Graphics - 9/10, fit this game 100% perfectly. It is pleasing to look at but it can be too dark even with your brightness all the way up. If they just did a lighting overhaul it would go a long way.Story - 6/10, there isn't really a whole lot of story to this game. Basically you are on a space ship when aliens attack it, so naturally you go and fight them. You are overwhelmed and crash into an alien planet. You need to find a power core to get of the planet. During the game you hear from a few different NPC's that Grigori is a monster and they wish he wasn’t around, you also hear also hear he has that power core you need. So you take off on a mission to kill Grigori and get the power core.Gameplay - 9/10, while I want to say that this game has perfect gameplay, I can't. I personally feel that the beginning and ending space battles are unnecessary; I feel these two scenes are completely different from the rest of the game. Every other part of the game is plat-forming genius but then you have these button mashing sequences basically.Soundtrack - 8/10, I like the soundtrack this game has but I prefer to listen to my own music while I play because I'm personally not a huge fan of the ""Classic Pixel Style"" this game uses. But I do recognize that this a very well done soundtrack and I consider it worth having in my iTunes library.Overall - 32/40, even though I only have a short amount of time on this game as I am writing this (Currently 8 hours or so) I plan to add a lot more because I love this game. It is really addictive and I really recommend you buy it. I think it's worth full price but I imagine quite a few people would want to buy it when its on sale because it is so short. "

												Not bad, but not memorable. The teleporting mechanic itself is unique, but the overall game feels all too familiar for those who played many puzzle-platformers. If you haven't played a lot of games from this genre, it may seem all new and exciting to you, but there are gems out there, somewhere, that deserve more your attention; if you are a veteran, I recommand it if you can never get enough of this kind of game. I had a fun ride, but I will probably forget this game in a few weeks, especially since it's so short. I gave a positive review because I had a nice experience, but I would give a neutral review if possible since you have to consider everything above to determine whether or not it's worth it.			"

												TL;DR: This game is great arcade game but really short one , Mostly it is a momentum game where you have to do the thing in the right time and the mechanics of this game are good but i saw some other reviews and some says that they had the same problem as me which is jumping after teleporting i didn't care much about the soundtrack and the story wasn't the best story but a good one ,Don't want to spoil it for you ;PPos:+Good story+Good mechanics+Great arcade gameNeg:- really short but this game has gone into alot of low sales so i think it deserves $0.14			"

												Oh, this game. Let's think this game first. This game is really hard, really annoying and really frustrating.  Teleport laser is very hard to handle, because later on the game, you need to do double jump with teleport gun and take like 5 minutes to pass one double jump sections. Also this game have so many dead traps. I ragequit several times during this game, because that stupid teleport laser. But I still recommend this game? Why?  Music is kinda good, maybe sometimes annoying, but good. Levels are well done, expect double jumping. Story is also pretty good (I haven't finish game before this review). Pros:+ Good music+ Nice level design+ Very low cost (19 cents)+ Story+ Aliens look hilariousCons:- Rage game elements- Teleport Gun- Double Jumping- Hard platformingI bought this game from sale. This game is annoying and still pretty good, but if it wasn't in the sale, it's not worth it. Also game is very quick, you can see credits after 2 hours.6/10			"

												I recommend it for people who like a good platformer game with an awesome soundtrack.Completed it in my first playthrough, wish it was longer, got ~50% of the acheivements, plan on getting them all.Recommend playing it with a controller, you don't need an expensive and fancy one, a D-pad and 4 buttons is all you need.Pros:+ Nice and inovating platforming mechanics;+ Killer music;+ Delightful pixel graphics;+ Cheap;+ You can replay it and it doesn't get boring because there's a lot of acheivements;+ A good challenge. (some people like their games hard-ish)Cons:- A good challenge; (some people like their games easy)- Too short;- Spaceship segments feel kinda out-of-place.- Way too short.I'd like to congratulate the developers for making such a nice game, and I hope they come out with a sequel for this, cause Grigori is still ""Out There Somewhere"".

												I got this game in a bundle of bundles of games I have yet to play. Looked like some dumb arcade shooter when I first started playing (mind you, I didn't view the store page.). Nothing special. When I lost all my hearts for the first time in my ship, i was almost relieved to have a reason to stop playing. Looked boring. But then.Dialogue appeared after I got shot down. The game wasn't over. It was actually only beginning. I was mesmerized by the fact that it went from an arcade space shooter to a 2d puzzle game. And it fit into storyline. Absolutely amazing. So much fun. Would recommend.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a great puzzle platformer that kept me entertained for hours . The teleport gun adds a unique element to the gameplay especially once you learn how to use your momentum effectively. It has a great soundtrack and is well worth the $4.99 I recommend it to anyone who enjoys platformers or puzzle games.			"

												This game is very interesting.The story is about a space cop who is hunting a villain named Grigori. But after a fight with him, his space ship gets badly damaged and both land on a same planet. Main gameplay begins here and you have to find a light orb to fix your ship and defeat Grigori for good.Gameplay is really nice. you have a teleport gun which is frequently used in the game and nearly all of the puzzles must be solved with it and a gauss gun to kill enemies. After progressing further in the game, you will encounter new enemies, three types of lightbeams, mirrors, breakable objects and moving platforms which add to the challenge.PROS:- Nice gameplay- Great soundtrack- Collectables affect how much hard the last fight will be- Can 100% the game easily with a little skill and patienceCONS:- Short (Can be completed in 14 mins to 75 mins on first playthrough)- You HAVE to lose in the first encounter with Grigori and you can even lose at the beginning; but it's not clear. So you do your best to take him down and after a lot of minutes you find out it was a complete waste of time.- Some rare achivement problems: One of the achievement did not unlock until I did it's required action for the third time.VERDICT:This game is really nice and definitely worths trying but it's short and after you unlock every achievement, you may not want to play it anymore.

												The game is quite interesting i have to say! - it really reminds me from a different game - i can't come up with the name for now - maybe later.However it still plays differently. you start with a ship - and it is some sort of ""asteroids game""  - eventually you will lose and u will crash - - you have to find the missing parts of the ship. You have a teleport gun - if u shoot - there will be a projectile flying - which will let you teleport if hit to a wall. the game could be quite difficult too and with there puzzles. You also need intelligence and quick thinking in order to pass some area's.There are save stations/checkpoints throughout the level.It is also a little bit of ""metroidvania"" that u have to go back point to point to do somethimg. but so far i know - you do not have a map which COULD be dissappointingthe music is quite ok - it is 2D side scrolling 8 bit graphic style.monsters will respawn if u left the screen - the sound affects ""from guns, exploding, deaths, etc"" are a little bit cheap - i mean, its a very very old sound effect.You can play with an xbox controller. Which actually plays better then on keyboardDefault keyboard controls are weird. Z to teleport. X to jump. C to shoot. I think C should be jumping, Z to teleport and X to shoot.You can heal at checkpoints.THE GAME IS OK BUT SHORT! to make teleport useful - i do recommend using small hops, so that u can jump again once the projectile hit and u fly higher.I give this a 6/10			"

												Out There Somewhere is a platformer/puzzle game with bullet hell stages, with mechanics that resemble Portal.It's a very fun little game that, despite being very short (~2-3h of gameplay, maybe 4 if you want all achievements) is very entertaining and will keep you stuck to the computer until you beat it.PROS: Beautiful pixel graphics Funny and simple storyline Very rewarding to figure out how to pass certain levelsCONS: Short Game Storyline is not too deep, you won't get very attached to the characters Those who do not enjoy Bullet Hell (or are bad at it) will suffer at a couple points I died so many times at the final boss it gives me nightmares til todayFinal Score: 4/5Very fun little game, extremely worth its price tag. Highly recommend anyone who enjoys platformers/puzzle games to grab this. Sell some items or cards on the Market and grab it. It's totally worth it.			"

												This is a short but excellent puzzle platforming adventure. It takes about the length of time a ""chapter"" might take in a longer game, so somewhere in the ballpark of an hour if you're going at a relaxed, casual pace. (There is an achievement for 20-minute completion for speedrunners.)Figuring out how to use the teleportation gun to solve each room---as well as discover secrets for the more observant---is very satisfying both to solve and to execute.There isn't much of a story here, but I don't think you'll care about that too much. What the game lacks in story, it makes up for in charm and style. It definitely has that nice Cave Story / Metroid kinda vibe that SNES era kids will love.I also got it on sale for NINETEEN CENTS?! That is a f***ing steal.			"

												I found Out There Somewhere to be very boring. Beyond the puzzle solving this game does almost nothing to pull you in. The puzzles are decent, requiring quick reactions. The teleportation gun is an interesting mechanic, and has a lot of potential, but I just don't care enough to go slogging through the rest of the game to get to this theoretical point of interest.The story may as well not be there, as it does nothing to intrigue the player beyond giving a background to the puzzles to come.I don't recommend this game unless you have a keen interest in 2d puzzle platformers, as well as a lack of interest in compelling story telling.

Out there somewhere is a very cheap platformer game, and in this case you get nothing more than what you paid for. A bland, uninspired jumpfest. The game consists of you having to perform tricky jump after tricky jump until the end credits roll. Out there somewhere claims to be ""Inspired by Cave Story, Super Metroid, and Portal,"" I don't see it - at all. I'd call it a lie in an attempt to boost sales, but there's nothing wrong with saying what inspired you, I guess. A satanic death metal band could claim the inspiration for their latest album was the Beatles' white album, even though you'd never actually hear that influence in any of their music.Apparently, if you're good at this sort of game, you'll finish Out there somewhere in less than an hour and are entitled to some bragging, for example in the form of the Steam Achievement for finishing the game. If you're not particularly good at this sort of game, you'll notice they managed to make 'Out there somewhere' very challenging (difficult) but forgot to add any fun or wonder to the gameplay, which would motivate to try and finish it anyway.All in all, Out there somewhere  is a below average platformer that's only for the die-hard platformer gamer who's looking for a quick but extremely difficult fix.

												Fun, quick puzle side scroller game. Smooth gameplay, with the teleport gun puzzles being fast paced and intricate keeping it enjoyable. Sometimes a little confusing where you need to be, but generally just moving right occasionally deviating to go down side paths gets you to where you need to be. The Sound track is nice and enemys are simple yet provide a decent obstacle. Design overall is very nice. 10/10 wish it was longer :)			"

												Out There Somewhere is a clever game that's just all around quite humble and enjoyable to play. The platforming handles well, there's little secret areas throughout that still feel rewarding to find yet aren't too impossibly hidden, and it's got a short and sweet story. Game runs a little short (only took a few hours to 100% all the achievements), but the satisfaction from finishing the game justifies the price.			"

												Very nice platformer with an interesting game mechanic.You play as a captain of a space ship who ends up in a fight with a villain named Grigori (who is still out there somewhere btw)It result in your ship crashing on some alien planet. Now you have to find your way through the planet to get a light orb to fix your spaceship (Every spaceship needs light orbs cause you know... reasons...) and optionally collecting ""abandoned cores"". You have a teleport gun which teleports you to where the shot lands... a cool game mechanic that is very well implemented.Pros:-Figuring out how to get to the end of every screen is a lot of fun.-Timing and thought required make it enjoyable.-Short but not too short.-Tight controls.-Good soundtrack.-Good-looking pixel graphics.Cons:-Almost no story. (doesn't really matter for this kind of game ... use your Imagination)Highly Recommended!			"

												This game was very good, however there a few things to note if you wnat to get it, i spent about 5 1/2 doing puzzles to beat this game, then a faught a boss using some of the skills i learned before, then i faught a space ship using absoultly no prior skills after spending 5 1/2 hours i had to fight in an new way that was way to difficulthowever if your stuck on the last boss, the best way to win is use a controller,also mash the fire button so you shoot faster, i failed my first 30+ tries and won my first try with a controlleroverall this is a fantastic puzzle game however there is no point to collecting cores, once you get them all you need to backtrack to some dude to upgrade them? waste of time			"

												MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOWThis game isn't long, but that doesn't matter, because it is a well-constructed game.  Initially, you begin with a side-scrolling space-shooter sequence that takes you through an army of rival space ships.  After the initial boss fight (which you are supposed to lose), you begin exploring a planet armed initially with only a portal gun.  You'll find an actual weapon later on to fight enemies with and to help with solving puzzles.The game is basically an action-platformer in the vein of games like Metroid with its exploration for various items, including extenders to your life meter and components which can power-up your repaired ship at the end of the game.  There aren't a whole lot of mechanics to the game, which is fitting for its short length.  This also makes the game easy to pick up and play.  There is a good challenge to the later sections, but there is nothing that truly feels overwhelming or unfair, which is a testament to the overall game design.  The price is fair as there is replayability to earn achievements.  For such a short title, there is a fairly large number to attain, and I can see people earning all of them with lots of practice.I can find very little to criticize about this game.  You do have to be careful of scene switches because you can walk and/or jump into a hazard without fully realizing it, similar to Castle in the Darkness, though not nearly as unfair as in the latter title.  Also, in some of the vertical sections, I had to stop and search for my character, who was just about as far down the screen as possible, usually in a corner!  A brief, flashing arrow pointing to your character would help here, but this is not a big criticism.  It's possible to solve every room on the first try if you're observant and careful; I can even see a few people maybe having a deathless run on the first playthrough.Out There Somewhere has just the right length for casual gamers while being robust enough for those looking for a challenge, especially those seeking to 100% the game through both winning and through completing the achievements.  I highly recommend this game.  It is both well-crafted and extremely well balanced.  Buy it!9.0 / 10			"

												Makes you think to solve puzzles. Gets a thumbs up because that part is done well. It was worth about the 19 cents I paid for the 20-30 minutes of playtime I put into it. I won't be playing it anymore because I was just too bored. Probably the horrible atari colors they used for the graphics that make me want to go on a shooting rampage in a bong shop full of hipsters.			"

												Even though the mechanics in this game are completely different from VVVVVV, I would recommend this to fans of VVVVVV in a heartbeat. Static screens, tricky but not impossible jumping puzzles, and kickass chiptune music.Don't be fooled by the absolutely horrid SHMUP opening - this is one of the better indie platformers of 2016, and at a VERY reasonable price, to boot. It harkens back to an era of Steam where indie games weren't all overpriced Early Access games or tedious RPGMaker clones.			"

My only real objection is that said trinkets only serve to make the final boss even more of a cakewalk if you collect enough of them. Good deal!			"

												Basically, it's a demo.  The game has unique gameplay elements and all; but it's extremely short and linear, running you through a token tutorial for about 20 minutes to show off the engine.  Think like the Final Fantasy 8 demo being released as a full game, or if Super Metroid ended when you beat the Bomb Torizo.Really not a lot of thought put into it.  Glaringly little thought put into world and scenario.			"

												This game was so promising, and I sat down expecting a sweet metroidvania style platform puzzler. I played it for 30 minutes, and took a break to get some food. Then I sat down again and realized I was just outside the chamber of the first boss. ""Great"", I thought, a boss battle is always nice. So I went ahead and defeated the boss in about five minutes. Then the game ended... WHAT!? 35 minutes of gameplay, and ONE boss? Really?I realize this game is only 5€, and you can't expect much from a game that cheap, but still, 35 minutes of content just isn't enough for me to recommend this game.If you still need to kill half an hour and like platform puzzlers with a wee bit of skill needed, then by all means, this game is for you.

												*Extremely minor spoiler alert.*I really wanted to like this game.  However, 2 minutes into the game you'll face an unbeatable boss.  I learned this after another 5 minutes of mashing the fire button and dodging attacks.  I didn't even get to the real game, and now I don't even want to.Devs, if you want to blow up my ship, that's fine.  Make it a scripted event, or give the enemy an unavoidable attack.  Don't waste my time, and don't make me do something that feels stupid.  Having to intentionally destroy my ship completely breaks immersion and removes all my motivation for continuing.			"

												Inititally, upon starting Out There Somewhere, I was skeptical. Another pixel art puzzle platformer. But the game started to grow on me, the art style was pleasant, and the music is surprisngly well done. The mechanics of the game are simple, but fun and intuitive. The gameplay revolves around a gun which, when fired, fires a bolt which you teleport to when it collides with something. The puzzles designed around this are quite clever, and the game introduces more puzzle mechanics that spice up an already interesting style. It was getting interesting. And just as I felt as though the game was going to advance into something better, it ended. Now, I purchased this game for twenty cents, but it runs for five dollars normally. And because of this, I ultimately cannot recommend Out There Somewhere, as the game time is abyssmally short for the asking price, and honestly left me dissatisfied. I was able to beat the game in under an hour and a half. That sucks. The gameplay itself is enjoyable, but it feels more like a Flash game in the end.			"

												I can't beat the level ""strange formations"" because the jump is not possible. Now you might say, well I am just bad. Sure I'd say the same if I wouldn't have tried to do this jump for over 2 hours now with every possible guide. They all do a 2 high jump, portal shot on wall and than JUMP AGAIN!! which doesn't work. No matter how I time it. It simply doesn't. I have a gaming PC with gaming keyboard and also an xbox 360 controller. I tested everything including rebinding keys on keyboard and/or controller. It's not working to make the wall jump. I play a lot of hard games and jump games and I simply know when I'm just to bad. This jump doesn't work for some reason. Only reason could be a bug.			"

												Even at the cost of 0.21 ( I bought it on a 96 % sale) this game is hardly worth it.  Poor game design overall.  The first phase of the final boss has no challenge and is just plain simple while the second half is more fun but lasted only 15 seconds....When you start the game, you're in a ship and you fight an ennemy boss ship that looks like it's taking damage from your shots BUT NO, you actually have to commit suicide for the game to begin.  So, I lasted 5 minutes shooting an invincible boss while dodging his bullets, laser and missiles until my friend told me I HAD TO DIE for the game to begin.  This is wrong on so many levels...  Also, during the entire game, never once have I been puzzled by a certain room and I finished the game in 42 minutes (playtime).  This is not worth more than 21 centsThe only thing redeeming this game  is the soundtrack and the pixel art...			"

												It really hurts me to not recommend this game...Because when you look at it, it is very pretty, the gameplay is smooth, and all the art design (atmosphere, sounds, story...) is very nice and thought.But... it is much too short, and quite unsatisfying in terms of experience. It is definitely a flaw in games these years, although some others would argue it is a plus. Yet for me, such a small contribution in terms of entertainment and gaming is exactly like with toys and games... a diminished version, a raw skeleton without any flesh or organs.In other words? The type of gamer I am can not feel fully satisfied with what feels like a demo, like a ""short story"" of a gameplay mechanic. Please realize I am not asking for a 100hours long rpg, but this ""little gamish piece of art"" would have been great if there was more substance to it, more body. As is, I feel sorry to say that I can not recommend it...			"

												Out There Somewhere is the game that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ts me. It took me 2 minutes to just navigate the main menu. Probably because this game was meant to be played with a controller. I can't move down, mainly because my down arrow key is up. I  honestly find this to be tons of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and I'm quite the fan of platformers.			"

												I was surprised to see this game on sale for less than $0.50... but given the playtime, I'd say that's about right. The game is fun and has some creative puzzles, but you can easily beat it in less than one hour on your first try. I guess if it goes under a dollar again it's worth an hour of your time.			"

												I’m still on the fence with this game, but I can not bring myself to play it anymore. It teases with the start being a classic arcade space scroller, but instantly turns into a puzzle platformer. Non of that is bad, it just threw me right from the start and made me crave a style of game that I wasn’t going to receive for a long time. The sorry excuse for puzzles and the interesting weapon/ game mechanics are the only thing that almost save this game, but in the end the tediousness of the controls and gameplay force it into the bad game category. It is an interesting concept, but one that was poorly executed. If you like slow games that are solely based on timing, this is for you.			"

												Playing on a Mac here, if that makes any difference.I'm sure it would be fun if my controls worked half of the time I played the game. The first time I launched it, the escape button didnt work, so i coulnt bring up the menu, but i troopered through. Once I completed the Galaga section, I landed on the planet. No story text popped up, no hints, nothing. ""Okay, maybe there's not supposed to be anything here."" I play around with the controls and learn them, since my escape button doesnt work. Controls learned, time to move on. I go to the right, since nothing is blocking my way, and nothing happens. Screen doesnt change to the next area or anything. ""This is really, really weird. Let me restart the game."" Alright, restarted the game and it puts me on the planet, just after Galaga. I get story text and hints this time, and my escape button works! Awesome. I move right, and then the screen changes. Fantastic! Game is going good...until I have to shoot my teleport gun. ""What the heck?"" I press X multiple times and no response. ""Dangit. Gotta restart again."" Restart game, game works in all aspects. Gameplay was alright, I guess. I think it tried to be too much like Risk of Rain, a game I highly reccomend, in both the controls and the overall feel of the game.  But for the technical problems I had, I cant reccomend Out There Somewhere.			"

												Let me start out by saying this: There's no way I can do this game justice by a simple review.Good retro visuals, a good, catchy and well made soundtrack, perfectly responsive controls, a good and simple story, and high replayability are only a few of this game's qualities. Drawing clear inspiration from Pixel's work (Cave Story and its successors), Out There Somewhere manages to dish out the right amount of nostalgia, while being unique enough to earn its own place in Indie game history.The first playthrough will take about one hour, but with so many hidden secrets and alternate ways to complete the puzzles, I can almost guarantee you'll start a new game at least two more times.Truth be told, I've written and deleted at least three paragraphs trying to describe this game, and I still can't do it. My recomendation is simple: buy it and see for yourself.			"

												Platformer= Anger, sure I get it. :(  Warning: You'll need to watch a walkthrough or find a forum post  I've gotten stuck twice. Which isn't bad in itsef. The first time I was given a hint I didn't read, my bad. The second time on ""mirror wall"" there's no real hint on how to get past the puzzle. Finding the forum post get's harder with a title like ""mirror wall"", and finding a youtube video is even worse, as you have to watch like minutes to an hour to find the part you are stuck on.  :(    ControlsOn my Xbox controller there's a little lagg. This doesn't help with the precision the game requires. I have to wait .25 to jump. When preforming a teleport jump, I have to time this, I died a lot until I got the timing right. :) Basic gameplay Smooth, when working. The teleport gun works. Shooting and teleporting are very amazing. :) Level DesignIt's an amazing world. :) ArtThe reasson I bought this game. It's amazing.

												A cute little platformer that reminds me of a 2D Portal. There's a lot going on here for the price. The game has a nice ramping difficulty, but none of the puzzles get so insane you won't be able to solve them. The soundtrack is awesome, and the artstyle is new-age retro, which is definitely up my alley. The combat (while not a major focus of the game) feels a little clunky, and there are some sections that seem like filler (not intutive level design) but a solid game overall.			"

												Disappointing. Being on-boarded to a game with a spammy splash-screen is NOT a good indication of things to come. The actual mechanic was interesting and accessable, though I--a not-great player of games--finished in about an hour. I was narrating while playing, too, and demonstrating, so actual gameplay is probably closer to 45 minutes for a good player. I probably won't go back and 100% the achievements. It's just not worth it to me, so that is telling.Is this game worth it on sale? Yes. Is this game worth it full price? Not for me, but probably for most people. Just bear in mind that you're paying for around an hour's worth of entertainment, and this is a one-shot deal as there is no procedural generation at work here.			"

												To begin with I thought this game would be fun, because the look from the screenshots. But actually the game is just terrible, The only positive thing about the game is the artwork. Everything else in my eyes is just horrible , The levels are too complicated. Nothing makes any sense espcially the controlls of the storyline.			"

												A really neat little platformer that takes about 100 mins to complete the story of on my first go. As far as i can tell to 100% it you would also have to play a number of the levels in reverse as well to get all the collectable which i havent done. The main mechanic of this game is the teleportation system which is really cool, it allows for some really interesting puzzles that may require you to think about for a bit before you can complete them. In the same way Portal requires you to think with portals, this game requires you to think with perfectly timed teleportation. Would reccomend it at the normal price. So if its at 15p it totally worth it.			"

												I've tried several gamepads that do not work with the game, as in if they are plugged in, you won't be able to play the game at all. Down is up, and right is always being held. 3 different gamepads, Logitech, Xbox360, and EX3 which is a generic controller similar to a PS controller. All experience the same issue.You would think basic controller support would be something a game would have, and out of the 60 games in my Steam library, this is the first one that I've had this issue. I can't recommend a platformer that doesn't have regular controller input support.You can read more about this issue here, any while I tried the suggestions, there is no resolve, and it should be something the devs fix:https://steamcommunity.com/app/263980/discussions/0/611704531884414739/ "

												A short, but entertaining retro puzzle platformer.Actually it has retro graphic, which I dislike, but the fun gameplay mechanic - jumping, shooting, teleporting to solve puzzles make up for it. The gameplay basically is a platformer where you have to go through multiple rooms containing threats like aliens and lavas by utilizing your teleport gun and pistol. Some thinking and some fasthand are required, though it's not frustrating or hard like Super Meat Boy.Chiptune music is cheesy, but it's alright.It's in-arguably a bit short, though. Some people even have beaten the game in ten minutes or so, I did it in one hour. Well, forgive me. Game runs fine in my toaster laptop, 60 FPS straight.Controller support sucks, but at least I can remap my Dinput based controller F310 Logitech. It also has Steam Achievements (incentives for people who want to replay the game) and Trading Cards, good value overall.96% off at the moment - 0.20 USD equivalent, well worth every penny.Definitely recommended.

												For $1, this game is definetly worth it, especially on sale. I got it for 17 cents. As the game is platform and a lot like portal, it's in a way strategic and sometimes complicated. In my opinion a great game for a small price, as well as downloads in like 30 seconds. 8/10			"

												A really neat little platformer that takes about 100 mins to complete the story of on my first go. As far as i can tell to 100% it you would also have to play a number of the levels in reverse as well to get all the collectable which i havent done. The main mechanic of this game is the teleportation system which is really cool, it allows for some really interesting puzzles that may require you to think about for a bit before you can complete them. In the same way Portal requires you to think with portals, this game requires you to think with perfectly timed teleportation. Would reccomend it at the normal price. So if its at 15p it totally worth it.			"

												It's a neat little game with some exploration. I finished it in a little bit less than an hour and had lots of fun with it. I'm sure I'll do another playthrough just to talk to some other aliens since the encounters can get funny from time to time. The puzzles are fun, they're not too hard but you will have to think out of the box from time to time. You should definitely give this game a try since it offers a good amount of fun for a rather cheap price.			"

												Very short but amazing game, my first playthrough took me 40 min, then I replayed it twice to get achievements and collect all the items and card drops. A little bit demanding, but for experienced players shouldn't be too difficult. Controls feel very smooth. The only disadvantage is that it is short, but what would you expect from 1$ game.Conclusion: If you're low on cash, sell some cards and get it for 0,20$ on sale, if not just buy it, definitely recommended!

												One of the best ""Cheapest games"" I've ever played. Out There Somewhere is an underrated game that's not heard of often and people will look at games such as Out There Somewhere and say something along the lines of: ""This game looks cheap and the price is cheap so it will be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game"" But thats not the case with this game and I was proved wrong. I bought this game under 20p (So that will be something like 30-40 bucks worth) and the game was pretty decent! They did a good job with handling the platformer, retro and puzzles, in a way it made me feel nostalgic.Pros:It has a good amount of content for a game thats under a pound/dollar.The puzzles are a bit thought-provoking but are fairly alright once you know what to doHas good level designs Has a nice soundtrack to it (Love some 8-bit or 16-bit feel or whatever bit it is)Nice artwork Some good enjoyment out of the game (Especially for those who like retro feel, puzzle and sci-fi setting types)Boss fights have a Mega Man type of feel to themNice sound effectsSteam Trading Cards Cons: The ending of the game is predictableThe story is alright at best but it's a basic sort of story Wanted more but again it's a cheap made game that prices itself for under a pound/dollar so I understand thatIf I had to rate this game on a scale out of 1/10 it would be 6/10 I recommend it despite the score I gave it but that's understandable.

Inventive unpretentious 2D platformer6/10 ★★★★★★☆☆☆☆Let's make 2 things clear - I do not fancy platform games (I am not a six-year-old) and I do not long for pixel art graphics (an insult to my GPU). Having said so, Out There Somewhere is both and I can't stop enjoying this game.Gameplay seemlessly joins skills and wits, thanks to one simple, but innovative machanics.This blends nicely to the world and the story, and turns the game into an unpretentious and surprisingly coherent adventure.Graphics is simple but ejoyable pixel art, fitting the the game idea. Audio is ok. This is a bugdet product and does not bring visual fireworks. And thanks to the great mechanics does not need any.Out There Somewhere came to me as a surprise. I did not expect much and, boy, how wasn't I prepared for so much fun!.Summing upWell-executed platformer with inventive gameplaypositive good idea for gameplay, well developed into mechanics good, upretentious execution good, pixel-art graphicsnegative just a 2D platformer  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯A little, budget gem. Highly recommended. "

												Speedrunner with a teleport jumping difficulty curve.(i'm not a big fan of this genre of gaming, so go easy on me. don't take this review to heart)This game goes from simple to annoyingly jumbled with little to no help along the way. Expect to be confused and a little frustrated from the beginning. I think that a more helpful tutorial should of been in place, especially for newer players and people who aren't familiar with speedrunners.Most of the levels are really easy, but a few in between are just plain hard, from jumping and teleporting with miliseconds of error to jumping and dodging enemies while firing teleport shots across the map, it ramps up really fast. You also have to repeat a lot of content if you mess up, which is often due to the quick timing required.Easy game to play, difficult to master.The game is really short, only lasting around 2-3 hours. The game is only 1$. Anyway, this is my short review on this game, I didn't like it but I had to give it a try. I hope this review does not upset you, it is simply my opinion.Personal Rating: 1/5			"

												Do yourself a favor and just get Cave Story.This game is too short and relies on a teleportation projectile for all the puzzles. Which is fine, if it were of any decent length. It can't take itself very seriously. There are mixed pixel ratio issues in some areas. There's only 3 minor enemies if you count the thwomp clones. It ramps up the challenge, but not enough to warrant someone's time or money.			"

												I gave up on final boss as the difficulty spike proved too much for me and I haven't found the game engaging enough to try and overcome it. To the contrary of what it says on the Steam page, this game has nothing to do with Cave Story or Super Metroid. It's just a short puzzle platformer with an interesting mechanic. The teleport gun is fun and there were a couple of interesting puzzles, but overall the experience was unsatisfying.			"

												Uh, are you kidding me? 1 hour of gameplay? Really?! I'm glad I didn't spend a whole lot on this one. To the designer's credit, the game was incredibly fun, despite being incredibly short and linear. The teleportation and platforming puzzles were excellent. The retro cut scenes were hilarious. However, I was hoping that when they said ""inspired by Metroid"" they'd actually have some Metroid-esque RPG elements. No such luck I'm afraid. If you can get this title for less than a dollar, I'd say go for it. At least you get steam cards and an hour of fun. Otherwise, this is a hard pass.			"

												I got this for free through a giveaway please note. The game overall is pretty fun once you get a hang of the mechanics and such. The maps and graphics are designed well and the soundtrack is very nice. Before you get the physics down the game can be very boring and frusterating but once you get the hang of it, the gameplay is very rewarding. The game is pretty short, about 2-3 hours depending on how good you are at thhe game and how fast you get used to the game mechanics. Although if you are an achievement hunter there is a lot of bonus stuff to do and a lot of secret areas. The game sometimes lags which usually doesn't botch you up but beware and the response time is pretty mediocre. I think the one thing that got me the most was the final boss battle. Note that the first level is a bullet hell shoot em' up but is very short and very easy. The rest of the game is a platformer, with portal esque mechanics. The boss battle is split into two sections, the first being a platformer in which you jump around bullet and teleport past lasers while shooting with your pistol. The second stage puts you into a scenario very much like the first stage but 10 times harder. I really do not like it when games boss battle are completely different to the core gameplay and all your experiance and skills gained throughought the game is completely thrown out the window. Although scattered throughout the core game there is little secret bonus items you can pick up to boost your damage during this level, this does little to improve the anti-climatic boss battle in the end. Overall the game is pretty fun, can be kind of frusterating but is a steal for the price (especially if you get the game and soundtrack for free), I give it a 7/10.			"

												I don't think I can recommend this, I have to google almost every screen and there's nothing in between screens to make me WANT to progress other than to say I beat another game on my Steam list and now I never have to play it again. Well I realised that's not fun, and I stopped having fun with this game after about five minutes, no walkthrough anywhere is good, and I should just stop playing and uninstall a game that I'm not enjoying. I might have enjoyed watching an LP more, but I'm pretty sure I'll just be sour if I tried it nowIf there were decent walkthroughs, like youtube ones that covered what to do in every area, then put a table of contents with timestamps in the description, I would play this again. But if I have to keep googling areas [never before have I had to google to beat a tutorial] only to find literally nobody else googled this, I'm going to stop playing your game			"

												The game is OK, but the lack of custom controls in unbearable. You use left and right arrow keys to move, and then Z & X to jump and shoot. For me it creates a akward flow of movement. You can change the jump and shoot key binds to a very limited number of keys, which still feel awkard. If the added more options, would be a good game.			"

												I'd love to be able to recommend this game as it looks really fun but can't from my own personal experience. My experience is it's not possible to actually play it. I emailed the developers a couple months ago asking for help but haven't heard a thing from them.The problem is that the controls don't work using gamepad or keyboard & mouse. Once the start screen has loaded up, it's like there is a stuck key for pressing left and also up and down are reversed. So after eventually getting the game to load, your character immediately goes left and thats it ! the level is supposed to progress to the right so that screws that up, 2-3 seconds of seeing a sprite move to the left of a level isn't a good game in my books.I have googled the problem and searched forums but found nothing to help. So I'd avoid this game as it will be a gamble paying anything for it.			"

												and i thought that kirby's nightmare in dream land was short, this is even shorter and easier. its soo easy in fact that its like a tutorial throughout the whole game, i thought i would do space travel as if in a hubworld to go to other places, getting a crew of space people and play with cool weapons, but there's only one world, one boss and you have only one life...i also don't understand the praise the soundtrack gets. actually it feels like a bbt level playlist that isn't rage inducing.its cleverly designed but damn its soo short. is this going to be a demo for something or this is it, just look at my playtime andyou can tell this is short, or maybe i missed something?please tell me.4/10just play an actual nes game, they're even longer than this.

												If you go into this game thinking that it will be a Metroidvania game based off its description you will be dissappointed. It is extremely linear and can be beaten in under an hour on your first playthrough with no prior knowledge of the game. I was only stuck on one of the puzzles for a long time. Art style is alright but nothing to be shocked by, basic chibi pixel. The soundtrack only had a few songs in it and some of them were pretty good. If I had to tell you my favorite part of the game I would say it is the bullet-hell shooters. Unfornately these are short segements at the begining and end of the game. For 2 bucks it is a resonable price, however I could get better games for 2 bucks on a smart phone.			"

												The game lacks any form of tutorial about the teleport mechanic besides vague level names and brief dialogue leaving you to button mash to see what happens.  Very frustrating, especially when looking at guides and reviews that point out that the telejump mechanic works 75% when you do it right and I'm having difficulties trying to replicate what I did in the last room.  Thankfully for me I bought it for 19 cents so I don't feel so bad about ragequiting to go nurse my sore thumb.			"

												If you want a way to blow a few bucks on a game that's less than 2 hours long this is pretty good. The game ends way too quickly and the concepts introduced are barely compounded upon in the late game. There is little story and just when it feels like the game is going to take off and start getting serious... it' over. It feels like an hour long tutorial to a more complicated game. The music isn't that great at all and it isn't really an ""artistic"" game either. It's a neat idea but there isn't any meat to this game at all. It feels like this game was thrown together real quick to make a quick buck.			"

												Pros:-Metroidvania with matching art style-Interesting teleporting mechanics with different beams that do different things-Starts difficult, which makes it reminiscent of older games and their difficulty-60FPS?-Good soundtrackCons:-Pits of death. EVERYWHERE. And they're so open that it's hard not to fall in them during a puzzle.-Vertical Platforming that, if you fail one part, you will fall down a screen back to nearly the beginning every time.-Actually, all the puzzles make you restart them in one way or another when you fail one part.-Soundtrack doesn't really match up with the mood of some situations-NPCs are borderline useless to talk to, despite you being consistently encouraged to talk to them-WAY too many tutorials. Every time you see a new beam, the game wants you to know what it is. Every time a pixel on a graphic is shaded differently, the game has to bring up a slow-moving dialogue box to tell you. LET ME FIGURE IT OUT.-Puzzle mechanics are interesting, but they get bland very quickly, so to remedy that something new appears every screen or so in the beginning. This, however, will make the game even more bland in the end because there's way too much involved into the game that it's too complicated and ends up being uninteresting anyways.-Every once in a while I get lag spikes for some reason. I'm running on an Intel i7-4500U with 8GB RAM on Windows 10 (Home Edition) 64-bit. There is absolutely no reason this game should have any lag spikes. Also why does it claim it requires 512MB VRAM on the store page? Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst and Revolution require the same specs and is more graphically demanding in every way I can think of than this game. Also 1GB of RAM does seem like a lot to ask for with this sort of game Possibly unoptimized engine or code? I mean, I'm sure it can run on most machines decently, but if the developers here were working for a publisher for a larger-scale game, it would be unacceptable if they were to make the game require way more resources from the computer than it really should.Conclusion:Not really worth $1.99, you'd be better off paying around half of that for the game, or less.

												Out There Somewhere claims to have been inspired by Cave Story and Super Metroid, but those games raise expectations in my mind that I feel the game did not meet. The game is far shorter than expected, my first playthrough lasting little more than an hour. It is also not nearly as varied as Cave Story and other Metroidvania-style games; you will spend the majority of the game with just your teleport gun and a normal gun. And while the puzzles involving the aforementioned teleport gun are definitely interesting, the claimed inspiritations led me to believe I would have a bigger arsenal at my disposal.Another issue I have with the game is the use of bullet hell-like portions of the game. These sections feel very out of place in a game that is otherwise essentially a 2D version of Portal.Out There Somewhere is a decent game, considering the price, but the tauted inspirations to me implied a set of standards that the game did not deliver. Like I said above, this is 2D Portal. If that is what you want, then this game will do. But if you're looking for something Metroidvania-esque, look elsewhere.			"

												This review is based on the first few levels, but already I'm impressed by the music and the 2D portal mechanics, which utilizes your teleport gun.The story consists of Captain Yuri, a generic anime space cop chasing a generic fugitive alien warlord (named Grigori for whatever odd reason) onto the surface of the planet that they have botch crash landed on. Noticed the typo did you? Yeah there are a few in the game as well. I'm going to get to why I changed my review from a positive to a negative by the end of the game, but first we have to look at the positives:Pros:Silly fun and cool acheivementsOutstanding music, seriously it's never annoyingClever easter eggs and referencesFun ""2D Portal"" platforming, yes there are a lot of portal copycats, but this one is done wellSounds great, right? How could I not like this game after saying all these nice things about it? Well here we go:Cons:The plot is recycled barf, not that I expected much from this type of game, however this particular execution of ""You're the hero, he's the villian, go duke it out somewhere... IN SPACE"" was tired at best, which doesn't lend itself to the story like a Metroid game, or hell, even Portal's story was better. ""We're here to do research on portals, oh just kidding, I'm a sociopathic computer that has been trying to kill you this entire time!""This ultimately results in the one and only boss battle in the entire game. Did I mention this game was short? Yeah so with such a great game so far, guess what they went with for the boss battle, the one and only boss battle? How did JonTron put it again?Oh yes.Simon ♥♥♥♥ING says.Grigori goes from the left wall to the right every three times you hit him, and the only gun you have in the game you get in the second act (this game is not long enough to even have a third, mind you) and it's not a bazooka, it's a tiny little pea shooter that kills normal enemies in 4 hits, and Gregori needs half a bazillion to go down.Then Grigori decides it's time for round two in some spaceships that you've both miraculously had time to repair, and get this - during the game you were supposed to have picked up power ups you can only use in this one battle, but they are barely explained to you, and I don't think I picked up more than one. Oh what to do... Can't go back for them, so onwards you go for some more....SIMON ♥♥♥♥ING SAYS... BULLET HELL MODE.Yes, I ragequit that boss, yes, speedrunners have beaten this game in a clean 17 minutes...Maybe I'll go back and kill the dumb boss later...No, don't get it unless it's on sale, if for nothing else but the music, or just buy the soundtrack if it's available.Final verdict:3/10 - Cool (OK borrowed) concept and music with nice pixel visuals, but it all goes down the drain due to a tedious and unforgiving boss fight, and the lack of content or emotional investment/story development overall.

												While it is solid in what it does, and it is very much fun to solve how to progress some of the levels (or maps if you want so), The game lenght is so short, it's unreal. 4,99€ doesn't seem much at first, but I just beat it the first time I booted it up in 70 minutes. Sure I did not get all 11 thingys to upgrade the ships power, but that's also not necessary because the final boss is too easy. Get it while on sale, let's say about 1,50€			"

												I literally beat this game in 54 minutes. When I beat the first boss (the only boss) the credits rolled and I thought the developers were making a joke. This is probably the shortest game I have ever played, and I was greatly disappointed by that. This game describes itself as taking the pages out of Super Metroid and Cave Story, both very long games with enormous worlds to explore, but this game is nothing like them at all. It's a shame, because what is in the game is awesome. Everything is built just right and it's something new I've never encountered before. But, this game is virtually a tech demo of what should have been a much more expansive game. If the developers made a sequel to this I'd buy it in a heartbeat, but this game by itself just isn't long enough to merit a purchase at its listed retail price.			"

												This game is ok, but I have a few problems-1. The keys are so dumb. jump is z. Like what even. You can rebind them, but not to something sensible like up or space.2. The levels are repetetive. I'm already bored with the art style and level design3. The game brings nothing new. If you're looking for a retro platformer, look elsewhere. The classics are far better than this. Shovel knight did it right, but this has a lame story, dull characters, and nonexistanct plot.4. Did I mention that the levels are repetative?5. I beat the game in under an hour. I'm no speedrunner either. It's certainly not worth $5. You'd be better off playing some flash games.The soundtrack is pretty good though, but I mean, isn't that expected of modern retro games by now?tl;dr- Repetetive, frustrating, and terrible keybinding that you can't use up or space in. Brings nothing new to the genre.(I got this for 20 cents though so if its on sale get it then farm the cards :D			"

												This will sound like a very strange criticism, but the game is too dark. My IPS monitor is calibrated for accurate colors and brightness and this is the only game where I can't make out what's what. Many tiles are dark violet and are almost indistuingishable from the black background.I could make the monitor brighter, but then I would have to calibrate it back again after I finish the game.Other than that it's a simple metroidvania where each room is a puzzle (or a series of puzzles). But without ruining my screen calibration it's unplayable for me.			"

												About 5minutes into the game, you end up in a dead room. The game fails to explain its own mechanics. Apparently the trick is to jump right before your shot hits the wall (so you end up teleporting and then going into the air). This is a hugely ""trial and error"" mechanic with very little point in mastering it. PROS: -? CONS:-Bad controls-Trial and error ""portal jump"" mechanic that is essential to finishing the game-Low budget-Crap graphics			"

												Out There Somewhere is a waste of time.  Everything about it is uninteresting.  The puzzles are never challenging and the teleportation mechanic is berely explored.  Most enemies can be ignored and killing them is a chore because the gun fires too slowly.  Instead of being engaging, each obstacle only serves to inconvenience you.  The colors are so same-y, all the envoronments blend together, and so dark it's sometimes unclear where enemies and platforms are.  The music is generic and the writing is boring and entirely unneccessary.  Things were only put in the game because games usually have them, not because they add anything to the experience.  All they add are a few seconds to the game's paltry length.Everything in this game has been done better in a thousand internet flash games.  Instead of spending money on this, go online and play one for free.			"

There's only 2 small part with space shooting which are quite boring (no ship upgrades, etc...).This is more like a demo than a full game.

												The game is ridiculously difficult, even with a gamepad.Update:It turns out all i had to do was git gud. Once i figured out how to double jump, the game was a breeze. I even did a second, much quicker run of the game where i was able to get nearly all cores and artifacts, upgrade the ship, and defeat the bad guy, in 40 minutes or less.So... the game is actually pretty decent after all: cute graphics and music, and fairly interesting puzzles and secrets.By the way, the secret to double jumping is that the character must touch the floor and jump right before the teleportation. So, just time the jump to land before the pellet hits the wall, keep your eyes on it, and jump right before it hits.			"

												I was going through my games and I saw this one, which I had completely forgotten about. This game is really cool, idea wise and graphics wise and all that jazz.My playtime isn't particularly high because you know when you buy a lot of games on sale at once, and you give each of them a whirl and one or two stick out and you just kind of grind them while forgetting about the others? And then afterwards you kind of just never feel like playing the games you skipped out on again for no real reason? Even though you know they're fun and you'd enjoy it? Yeah, that is what happened here, sadly. Don't let the story make it sound like this game is boring or something, because it is really fun. I have no idea why I can't get back into it, but I think it's just that situation, since it seems to be pretty common (at least for me).Anyway, yes I recommend this game and yes it is pretty unique and a good puzzle experience.

It is a good one go game if you have 1 hour to play video games. It was fun and the ending was very repeatative and easily won once you his moves. The space battles were easy however the setup for playing on the planet could ahve been done better in my opinion. The story for the game was very good. The friendly aliens threw me off but aside from that they played a good part and also made you feel like a badass hero.All in all for the price I payed and also the brain teazers for certain levels I recommend this game for anyone wanting a fun and casual game that they want to draw out or just try to speed run.

Great game!I bought this game through the 'Developer Alliance Bundle' which was on sale for around $1, this game looked like the worst of the bundle. In the end I decided I'd give it a try and BAM - GREAT GAME - AMAZING GAME. I have played through it many times, trying to get all of the achievements.Note: The trailer is misleading because the space ship shooter minigame is only at the start and end for only like 1 minute.What is good about it: GREAT game mechanics, catchy music, funny (and slightly cheesy) characters, secrets that are fun to find, controller support and steam trading cards.What is bad about it: The controls took a while for me to get used to and the trailor.If you see this game on sale, don't hesitate to buy it.

												It's a really nice, little game. The pixel art is interesting through adding little effects here and there, like how the background is always moving, yet it's not distracting. It makes a cool visual. The game's setting has an oddly not-so-desolate, metroid-like, planet as a setting, which I'm also a big fan of. Another thing I enjoyed was that all the NPC's were nice little guys, and came some interesting lines, if you went the distance to talk to them. The soundtrack is also really nice, it fits the space theme without being boring. The puzzles (stages that have you use a portal gun to advance) were difficult, but never so hard that I gave up. That was a big one for me, and it probably had to do with how well you could see the puzzle in whole, and the simple mechanics. I really love the puzzles. The story is... not very exisistent. There is some bad guy, Grigori (ugly fellow), who is a total jerk, he blew up your ship, you wreck, so now you have to find him on this planet you wrecked on (I don't know why the bad guy is there, I think we were trying to go to the planet to attack him, buy it's not well explained). It does provide an objective, but it isn't very complicated. In whole, I bought the game for $0.16 (an awesome price), and was surprised. However, the game is really short. My 3 hours were all I needed to beat the game. But, if you're okay with short games, it's a lovely experience. I was only upset at the length to be honest. It feels incomplete,  like a greenlight game. I really want more cool puzzles and funny creatures, but then the games over. I also beleive that with more time it could have a neat little plot to help tie the story together. I just want more. An update with a story that goes somewhere (maybe to other planets) would solve all my issues with this game. There are collectables and an achievement for completing the game under an hour, which make the game more replayable in its defense, but it just won't fill the void.			"

												Very begrudgingly, I recommend this game. Very begrudgingly! I did enjoy this game. It had fun mechanics, a nice look. Some good little humor thrown in here and there, but it didn't really have too much of a drive towards it. Near the end of the game I forgot I still had a nemesis to beat... and that his name was Grigorio. I was just concentrating on getting that orb... thing. And the main bulk of the gameplay is Portal-esque 2D puzzle platforming, and it's puzzling that doesn't just require know-how, it also requires good timing and patience. This game has a big difficulty curve, and you really need to think outside the box in order to beat it. My biggest complaint would have to be... the last boss. The game only has you do the 2D sideshooter for the first minute of the game, then expects you to hop back in knowing exactly what you're doing, right when you have to kill the final bloody boss. Thank you game, I have a brain, but not as fast of an adaptable one as you may think I do. With the main push towards patience, timing, and creative thinking- Out There Somewhere pushes it right out the door with the fast-paced, shoot-em-up with the final boss, and I did not like it. At all. But for what it's worth, the main bulk of the game and its gameplay is very nice. A fine throwback to old-school Nintendo games... but with a much nicer look.			"

												Short but sweet, I wrapped up my first playthrough in one hour and really only see myself giving it one more go-around for a 100% completion attempt. Its brevity commands a low price point but what you get is a solid adventure-platformer with an appealing asthetic and an enjoyable soundtrack. My only real complaint is that backtracking is impossible at points meaning doing a full completion run requires starting anew and planning deliberately; but it's short enough that doing so isn't a frustrating time expenditure.

												This game is truely a gem.  I have played through it about 7 times.  The teleport gun is the basis of the game and I thought it was a cool mechanic.  My only complaint is that it was too short and I kinda wish there was a sequal.  The music was pretty good too but the ending was a bit unclear.  There are secrets scattered across the games levels to aid you in beating the game; such as health increases, a sub machine gun, and ship upgrades.  Sadly though, when a game has an acievement for completing it in under 20 minutes, you know it wont keep its exciting edge the third time around.			"

I would highly reccomend if you are into puzzles and platforming. Try to get it in one of the bundles which are qutie common ffor this game it seems. Thisd game would become so much better if there was more content or if the community could make their own levels. Still the game gave me a lot of entertainment for its price.			"

You have to think quick and be ready for what's next. When said this, let's see the bad sides of the game. It is extremely short. I was finished after ca. 2 hours. But then you have to think what to do next, what achievements to get, and what secrets yo can solve next time. At times it is not challenging enough. The story is a bit confusing, too. If you like these kind of games, this is very great for you. If not... Well, give it a shot.			"

The controls are a liitle hard to master but they are responsive so you wont feel cheated in any way. It starts off with basic puzzles before moving on to more complex ones.

												An excellent game, although the short game length might disappoint some people.The platforming and teleporting feels great, never had a frustrating moment with the controls. Also, the soundtrack for this is really good, everyone who likes retro tunes should check it out.There's also a lot of achievements for those interested in them. Even if you want to 100% the game you'll be done with it quickly but the achievements do motivate to play through it 2 or 3 times just to see if you can find all the collectibles or beat it in under 20 minutes (it can actually be beat quite a lot faster actually).I bought it for 19 cents on a ridiculous discount and had a real fun evening with it, I definitely recommend this. The short game length didn't really bother me, everything about it felt well designed and I'd rather have a short but fun experience than a long tedious one.			"

												*NOTE: This review was written by an individual who purchased the item at the time when it was  obscenely discounted (96%)!*Portal + Metroid (NES) = Out There Somewhere.  This was a great little game, and I would have loved to have seen it last longer.  It took me about 2 hours to beat the game, but there is a marginal amount of replayability if you push for acquiring all of the Steam achievements.The game is 2D Metroid (NES) style and is very linear, with a few optional detours for special items if you feel up to it.  Each side-scrolling screen you pass into plays out as increasingly difficult Portal-type, platforming puzzles.  Near the 2/3 mark of the game, there were perhaps 2 screens that were difficult enough that I had to cave in and check a walkthrough for and when I found the answer, it was a slap-upside-the-head DERP answer I felt like I should have obviously known, but some spots do require some brain-power, which were refreshing.*DISCLAIMER: Everyone and their dead dog needs to buy this game while it is only 19 cents to purchase!  That being said, although it is a ton of fun, I personally would not recommend it for the full $4.99 price tag due to the overall lack of bang for your buck.*			"

												This is a good example of a game that does a lot with a little. The tile art is simple, but pretty enough. Tiles don't always tile, but that's nothing worth griping about. It would've been cool to see some more artsy elements, but overall nothing detracts from play, and that's the important part.  It speaks for itself and there is never any visual confusion save for the occaisional cliff that you're certain must be surmountable.The gameplay is good. Controls do exactly what you expect them to once you get comfortable with them. The puzzles do a lot with just two tools. Because of the ease of use and the length of the game (1-2 hours if you REALLY take your time) this is one of the few titles where I'm compelled to beat it 100% with all achievements.Grab it while it's cheap and have some good, classic fun.

												Quite short, really wish there was more of it. The teleport mechanics are very fun. Definitely succeeds at the retro feel, with some inventive level design. The multiple save files seems like it's more for the retro-sense, since I beat the entire game in one sitting. With a little backtracking you could probably hit 100% completion on your first try, and the only reason I didn't is because of overzealous charging ahead past a point of no return.			"

												*NOTE: This review was written by an individual who purchased the item at the time when it was  obscenely discounted (96%)!*Portal + Metroid (NES) = Out There Somewhere.  This was a great little game, and I would have loved to have seen it last longer.  It took me about 2 hours to beat the game, but there is a marginal amount of replayability if you push for acquiring all of the Steam achievements.The game is 2D Metroid (NES) style and is very linear, with a few optional detours for special items if you feel up to it.  Each side-scrolling screen you pass into plays out as increasingly difficult Portal-type, platforming puzzles.  Near the 2/3 mark of the game, there were perhaps 2 screens that were difficult enough that I had to cave in and check a walkthrough for and when I found the answer, it was a slap-upside-the-head DERP answer I felt like I should have obviously known, but some spots do require some brain-power, which were refreshing.*DISCLAIMER: Everyone and their dead dog needs to buy this game while it is only 19 cents to purchase!  That being said, although it is a ton of fun, I personally would not recommend it for the full $4.99 price tag due to the overall lack of bang for your buck.*			"

												A charming and fun (if highly derivative and overdone) stylized platformer with a retro art style and a snappy chiptune soundtrack. You may see this and think ""ugh this style of game has been played literally to death"" and you'd be right, but this deserves its due diligence for being a really clever little game.I feel it's very much like an alternate-universe take on VVVVVV's gameplay mechanics; instead of a gravity flip you have a simple teleportation gun, kind of like an ultra-simplified Portal; you shoot a beam that sends you in a straight line to wherever it hits, which in theory sounds pretty lame, but the level design makes for some very tricky and mind-bending puzzle situations. You'd be a fool to pass this up for 19 cents. Hell, even its full asking price of $4.99. A fun little romp for fans of the aforementioned VVVVVV and similar games.			"

												Out there somewhere was a great game, it was a fun and challengeing experience. And it felt great when you got those ""Aha!"" moments. I especially liked the fact that it was a sort of blend of Megaman and Portal with a hint of Lifeforce or Jamestown at the begining and end. However I was expecting more out of the boss fight at the end. With the overall difficulty of the game up to that point I thought it would be much harder than it was. In fact it was probably the easiest part of the game. Overall this game is great, great retro style graphics, great mechanics, great gameplay, great music, meh final boss. 9/10			"

												Very begrudgingly, I recommend this game. Very begrudgingly! I did enjoy this game. It had fun mechanics, a nice look. Some good little humor thrown in here and there, but it didn't really have too much of a drive towards it. Near the end of the game I forgot I still had a nemesis to beat... and that his name was Grigorio. I was just concentrating on getting that orb... thing. And the main bulk of the gameplay is Portal-esque 2D puzzle platforming, and it's puzzling that doesn't just require know-how, it also requires good timing and patience. This game has a big difficulty curve, and you really need to think outside the box in order to beat it. My biggest complaint would have to be... the last boss. The game only has you do the 2D sideshooter for the first minute of the game, then expects you to hop back in knowing exactly what you're doing, right when you have to kill the final bloody boss. Thank you game, I have a brain, but not as fast of an adaptable one as you may think I do. With the main push towards patience, timing, and creative thinking- Out There Somewhere pushes it right out the door with the fast-paced, shoot-em-up with the final boss, and I did not like it. At all. But for what it's worth, the main bulk of the game and its gameplay is very nice. A fine throwback to old-school Nintendo games... but with a much nicer look.			"

												The is kind of deceptive!  It starts as a classic arcade shooter style game, but once you lose that bullet hell, you start the platformer part of the game to make an attempt to repair your ship and get back into the space battle.  Armed with your trusty teleport gun, you have to find ship parts and character upgrades.  It's a fun time, but it's also fairly confusing at times.  It can be frustrating, and you may find it too difficult to navigate some of the platformer screens.  Overall, I like it, and I think you'll like it, too.			"

Wish there was more to it, as well as more space combat.At $5, I think the asking price is a little high for barely an hour's worth of content. If you can pick this one up on sale, it's a good buy.

												This game is wonderfull. It's the game i've been looking for.Out There Somewhere is a puzzle platformer, with a cool mechanic: You can teleport, which makes for some fun and challenging puzzles, along with the tons of secrets scatterd throughout the game. Its simple, its fun, the music is great and i really like the artwork.The only complaint I have is that its quite short, but hopefully we will some day see a Out There Somewhere 2. (Please?)This game is worth it. 1 dollar? ♥♥♥♥ yes!			"

												Out There somewhere is a realy cool game.I love pixel art and challenges. This game have both!Pretty basic story but interesting gameplay.The game design is overall very good but the levels design does not make sense as it feels like ""blocks arts"" are placed at random. The platform serves the design while it should be the design who serves the platform (Does it make sense ? Guess you know what I mean ;) )A little too dark. Sometime you don't see correctly the edges which can be annoying...Some achievements can be tricky but not that impossible. Good point.The musics are cool, too !Count 2h gameplay on a first run. For a 1$ game : totally worth it !			"

Other people will likely define the gameplay or style in more depth, I am just trying to give a thumbs up here.			"

												I found this to be a very insteresting game. I didn't pay any attention to it at first, and got it as a part of bundle when it was on sale, and it took my brother to launch it and play a bit for me to realise that it's the exact game I'd like to play.tl;dr: I fell in love with it from the first actual sight :DGameplay here is like an old arcade, you have 5 buttons to satisfy all you needs, left/right+jump, teleport bullet and damaging bullet,It's easy to learn and pretty easy to go through, especially since game is pretty short (you can see that it can be finished under 20 minutes, took me ~15 on my first and last speed run). But if you want to uncover all the secrets that this game has you'll need to put your mind and reflexes into it. Most, if not all, secret places are spottable if you know where to look, but getting there might become the real problem there.I quite enjoyed the ride, even though it lasted only 4 hours for me to get all the achievements and find all the secrets. I still recommend it, especially if it's on sale.Overall: 10 secret gun upgrades out of 10			"

												I'd recommend this game on sale, as it's horribly short.If you rush through it you can complete it in under 20 minutes, even without good knowledge of the levels.There is a fair amount of secrets, but save for ""no checpoint"" bonuses, you should be able to find them all in few hours even without a guide.Puzzles are extremely easy to figure out, making the ""stuck"" achievements look like a reward for having a dinner mid game [One I unlocked was obtained accidently this way].But it is really a fun thing to play, it doesn't feel like a half-a*sed flash game ripped from newgrounds with a price tag smashed on it. Even though it's a short fun time, it is a really quality fun time. On a bigger discount [or not if you're less of a cheapstake than me :P] it is definitely worth a buy. Chiptune soundtrack sounds really cool too, enough that I'd listen to it outside of the game.			"

												The thinking man's platformer game.Yes this game is short, but it has everything you want out of the mechanics. It makes you think, and lets you have fun. When you solve a certain room/puzzle the game lets you know you did well with an achievement, which is both corny and delightful.While this game is not open like VVVVVV, it has many of the same basic charms. Every screen is like a small puzzle, and you can not get stuck where the game experience has not taught you the skills required to succeed in the later parts of the game.It looked like there could be more from this game, and I would be happy to see it. Many of the puzzles were good and never repeated quite the same way twice. The two (three?) boss fights were interesting enough.I'll probably replay the game to try for 100%, even though there was not a progress label, but I did notice I missed a few things on my first run.

												Amazing game, worth way more than 20 cents. I think the 5 dollars is a reasonable price. It's fun albeit short, and plays smoothly. You should beat it in approximately 1 and a half hours on your first playthrough, but if you try to get all the achievements you'll be playing for a lot longer. Developers: make a sequel. I really enjoy this style, especially since the actual Metroid series isn't doing so great at the moment, this made me feel a bit of that feeling again, of exploration, adventure and space.The platforming is certainly different, but reminds me a bit of shinesparking, especially the really difficult sections.I personally haven't played cave story so I can't compare it to that, and I feel like the only thing really taken from portal was the teleport gun, so as far as I'm concerned, if you like metroid then certainly get this game. This games only downfall was its length, and I would happily play more like this. One of the best aspects they used from Metroid was sequence breaking. This is when you speed run and find ways to skip certain sections of the game (kinda neat how one of the achievements is exactly this, Shortcut) or have an item earlier in the game than you are supposed to (Daredevil). Finding out these things on your own, is what makes this game like metroid.One let down I felt was the text. Now I understand how complicated the portal gun is, and that the text is mostly necessary, but I felt that I didn't connect to the maini character as well. Super Metroid is a classic example of a game that needs almost no text, in fact the only text is at the beginning to explain what happened in the previous two games. But this is only a minor complaint, and a tip for the Devs if you are planning to make a sequel.Nonetheless, this game is very enjoyable, and I'd just like to say thank you for helping me connect with Metroid again. To everyone else, I highly recommend this game, especially for the price it is right now.			"

												I have never written a game review before. That being said, this game is so good that I felt compelled to. This game is somehow so simple while simultaneously being intricate, engaging, innovative, and all while invoking a certain sense of nostalgia. The controls are seemless. The graphics are clear and nothing is visually confusing (which I feel should be enough for any game). The soundtrack is appropriate for the theme of the game. The only issue I had with this game is how short it is.It only took my about 90 minutes to beat the whole game, but I loved every second of it and wanted so much more. Buy this game now while it's on sale for a measly 19 cents, because it's well worth the full price.			"

												I played through the whole game thinking I explored every possible nook and cranny, only to find I had only gotten as far as 50/87 of the possible screens in the game :P This game is in a typical arcade style which is pretty fun. What I like is that if you're only in it to beat the game, you can do so in under 20 minutes (it's actually one of the achievements) and it won't affect your gameplay. However, if like me you feel like you need to complete the whole game and collect every possible object there is you can do that too, plus it gives you some more puzzles to solve. I bought this game on sale for €0.19 and after having played it I would have probably payed up to about €0.50 for it. Don't buy it for the full price, but it's well worth a go on sale :) Very entertaining			"

												Awesome game, simple and easy to play. I used and Xbox controller as I am more confortable playing with it for platformers. I had no problems with the game. It is what it is and very cheap you can't really overpay for it. Check out the video of me Trying It Out ------>

			Trying out Out There Somewhere, weird, a tittle, but it works. All in all I actually recommend this game, it's pretty good and hopefully the soundtrack is not copyrighted lol.

												This is a mix between Portal and Super Metroid.  The controls are tight and the gameplay is original.  Using the portal gun in this game really makes you rethink standard platforming conventions, and when you get the hang of the controls the game is a lot of fun.  I got this game on sale for 19 cents and it was certainly worth more than that.  However, I beat the campaign with many secrets in under an hour, so I'm not sure it is worth the full 5 dollar asking price.  Replayability is in trying to unlock all the secrets, although even unlocking them all during a second playthrough only adds another 30-60 min of gameplay.  In all, this is a really interesting game and I'd certainly recommend it during a sale.			"

												THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!Not a hardcore platformer, more like a puzzle portal-inspired platformer, i love the game it's amazing, the puzzles are well made, easy to solve but tricky to execute, the story is simple but the whole map and the platforming are just outstanding, This reminds me of VVVVVV because all screens have a name, reminds me of portal because of the teleport gun that conservates momentum and cave story for the ligh-hearted story with hardcore challenges that are just there (like speedrun the game in 20min D:It's a gem, i hope it's not a hidden one because it's just amazing, only down side could be that it's short, but i think it doesn't overstays it's welcome, it's a really good game and i didn't feel ripped off for a 1.5h experience because it was a really fun 1.5h unlike other games were you spend that time farming, this has none of that.EDIT: second playthrough, got more achievements, this is awesome!<3			"

												Just another puzzle platformer, if a well-executed one. This is only a metroidvania if you consider finding a single upgrade and collecting hidden things that have no immediate benefit (and no meaningful benefit in the long run either) to be enough to call it one of those (and I don't).Basically, this is a game that belongs on Kongregate or Armor Games but decided to ask people to pay money for it on Steam instead of tolerating ads to play it at one of those places. I got the achievement for beating the game in under an hour without actually trying to do so, which should tell you just how little content it has.All the same, it's fun for what it is. If it looks like you'll like it and its current price looks super cheap to you, go on and get it.			"

												SPOILERS BELOWThis is a pretty good game.  It's solid most of the way through.  There is one downside though: The final battle.  While most of the game focuses on puzzle platforming, the very final battle (at least I think it's the final battle) takes all the concepts of your adventure, and it...  Throws them in the trash.  While the first Grigori battle actually focused on your abilities with the teleport gun, the final battle doesn't.  It puts you in a little space battle of Grigori's ship vs. your ship.  No teleport gun, just blasters.  What makes the final battle even more terrible is that the boss seems to have every cheap attack available: Spread shot, homing missiles, and a beam that takes up a large portion of the screen.  It's even more frustrating when they are all used at once.  This battle is the only reason I haven't finished the game.  Is this a cheap review?  Yes.  Do I reccomend the game?  Overall, yes.  Do I recommend completing/beating the game?  No, I don't.			"

												Im not to big on platformer puzzle games. But I really love this game. The concept of a teleport gun gave the level design alot of potential, and the developers definitely took advantage of most of this potential. Although some puzzles in the game could be completely by passed by either time a jump just right or soaring across a good chunck of the map by leaping off of a giant beacon tower thing, most of them were really engaging. Some of them really made me stop and think and plan things out. And most of the levels not only required you to think about the puzzle, but also made you react while performing this level. This concept isnt new, but it is in the game and really complements the gameplay. Being such a short game as well, the ending boss battle comes very quickly. The entire game took me 50 minutes for me to complete on my first attempt, but the boss battle was insane. A good kind of insane. And although very difficult in my opinion, it was definitely one of the most enjoyable boss battles I have encountered.     I got the game on sale for 19 cents, but the game is definitley worth its full $5. I would have loved to pay the full $5 dollars to support the developers and get some more content! But it is for sure worth your money. "

												This game is such a fun game and a challenging one. With this game you will try what you think fail then try again fail then rage quit and then try again but this time think ahead what to do and do it and react quickly then fail try around 5 more times fail and then get it and feel amazing. I loved this game just because of how challengin it was. The last level is the worst it is so damn hard I had to try maybe 50 times (no joke) to beat it. I was playing around my mom and she was worried because I was just hitting my computer and smashing random buttons. Now when you read this (if you even bother) you will think this sounds like the crappiest game ever but you are wrong. Every time you exit the room and enter the next one you feel so happy especially when you beat the final level. 10/10 such a fun game. NEVER GIVE UP IT IS WORTH IT.P.S. BEST 25 CENTS EVER!!!!!!!!

												Fun, straight forward game, worth the 21 cents for sure. Saves are frequent and dying just transports you to your last save instantly, so the game is pretty fast paced. The later rooms get pretty tricky and might take several attempts. It only last a couple of hours, but I can see myself replaying it in the future if I'm looking for a fun side scroller to whip through Game Boy style. Its the kind of game where it is just cool to see what kind of puzzle they will have in the next room using the same basic, well concieved parts.Nice nods to old school (Metroid) and new (Portal) action platformers. Great game!			"

												Would definitely recommend, but once again with many games on Steam it's only worth buying when it is at 20 cents. About 1.5 hours on first playthrough and thus the only thought going through my head was that it was equivalent to a really well made flash game online. Now that we're past that...Pros:Great opening, captured the retro feel in both the cutscene and sidescroll space shooter part, especially the forced death trope was done nicely. Gameplay is smooth, fun, and rewarding. It definitely takes inspiration from VVVVV though, but no problem there. Sound is amazing, the soundtrack is great for a 20 cent game. Also a nice bit of collectibles that are well hidden, so it is good for speedruns too.Cons:A bit short so once again buy it on the cheap. The idea of the teleport gun is somewhat cliche and some parts (such as the first part of the final boss fight) felt like a lame flash game made by some 12 year old, in which the boss has only 2 moves and both are really easy to avoid. Overall this game is mostly fun aside from a few ""eh"" moments, so buy it on sale.			"

												A nice little platformer game that combines a Portal-like idea with 2D platforming genre. It took me 2 and a half hours to beat it, though there are achievements to beat it under an hour and to beat it under 20 minutes. That may sound short, and I have no idea how one is supposed to beat this game under 20 minutes, but for what this game is, it could have been bad if it lasted longer. Overall, this game is good and quite fun.Side note: There are two 2D space shooting segments, one at the beginning of the game and one as a second (last) phase of the final boss fight. Keep in mind that this game *is* a 2D platforming game, so don't get confused, angry, discouraged or something else like that when you find yourself in space. It's okay.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a laid back puzzle platformer. The main mechanic is a teleportation gun which allows you to teleport where you shoot. The gun is similar to the one in The Swapper but time doesn't slow down when you fire it and you can't make multiple copies. The difference is that this teleportation gun preserves momentum. So if you fire it at a wall and jump right before the projectile hits you'll be jumping when you teleport.This leads to some interesting gameplay the first time through and some very interesting exploring on the second playthrough. The game clocks in at about 2-3 hours for the first playthough but it's almost better the second time through when you're better with the mechanics. It has a couple shmup sections but they are brief, which is bad if you're a shmup fan but good if you suck at them like I do.Overall I really enjoyed this game. If you like puzzle platformers with interesting mechanics I'd definitely recommend this to you.			"

												This game was very fun for the few hours I have played.  Although the game is primarily built around platforming elements, it is more focused on puzzling the player to get stuck, instead of attacking the player with hoards of enemies.  Unfortunately, at least for me the puzzles were all pretty simplistic and easy to work through.  On the other hand, I do have much experience with similar puzzle platfroming games such as Braid and Portal.  Despite the little content and non-challenging puzzles, I highly recommend this game for its uniqueness and individuality for the cheap cost that it is.			"

												There is absolutely no reason not to play this game. Its REALLY fun!Pros :-Clever switch between space shooter and platformer. Not many indies do this.-Mindbending teleportation platforming. Reminiscent of Portal, esp. in that you keep your momentum.-Really cute an colorful pixel art, esp. the character portraits. Reminiscent of Cave Story.-Fun platforming in general-Some secrets add some more game time, like in Metroid.-Really reasonable price (21c on summer sale)-Difficulty is just right... could of gone further and more challenging though.Cons :-Space shooter is very primitive and short. A short portion at the beginning and after the final boss.-Game is pretty short (I beat it in literally an hour)-Some music, while cute, has very short loops that get annoying when you die a lot.-Combat is non-existant at first, and even after a gun is acquired enemies can easily be avoided in most cases.-Only one boss fight, which is rather simple-Unsatisfying ending-Practically non-existant story. There is some dialogue and pixel-art cutscenes, but that's it. Don't expect to meet interesting characters like in Cave Story.In conclusion : really fun, short and sweet little pixel-art platformer that will appeal to anyone that likes platformers. Its short but its cheap, so its worth it.8/10 "

												I purchased this game during a recent sale and paid about 49 cents for it. The game is most definitely worth that price, but I cannot say it is worth the full 2 dollars.  The Good:1. I always have a soft spot for the pixelated, nostaligic graphics and sounds. 2. The sound track is amazing and does tend to be stuck in ones head after you sit down the controller. 3. The physics and animations were well done, basically perfect. 4. I did like the merger of the side scrollinger shooter and the planetary exploration/platforming. I found them to be very   complimentary to one another in this game.5.  Personally, I liked having to avoid the enemies, relying heavily on the telportation gun. I liked the puzzle aspect oft his game, though it was a bit easy. The bad:1. The game was too short. My first play through, and not in any particular rush to beat the game, took 40 minutes.  this is taking into consideration the time I spent trying to get some of the extra items. 2. The developers said this game was directly inspired by Cave Story and Super Metroid, but I fail to see much of those characteristics in this game. It is possible that I am not looking or thinking hard enough. I expected more weopons, different abilities that would allow you to progress, etc.  This game did not feel as atmospheric or epic as metroid and was not long enough to qualify for any kind of story, like Cave Story. 3. The puzzle aspect of this game, while I love it, is wayyyyy too simple. Once you get the hang of the fact that the teleporation gun conserves momentum, you have beaten the game.  4. Not a whole lot of variety. I disagree with the main character when he says that 3 types of beam obstacles are too many. They are not enough. 5. One could argue that this is trying to turn the game into something its not, but: I wanted to see more than one planet. I wanted more intermmediate shooter levels and more planets to explore. I'm not suggesting a re-write, but the simple addition of more content that is already within the bounds of the game engine.  ""I'm sorry, but Grigori is on another planet"" would have been an accpetable transition between levels. Overall:The game felt less than half completed, like a teaser trailer of itself. Imagine the first mario brothers game, on the NES, if the princess was really in the first castle. That is this game. I think this game could be great if it just expanded on the content a bit. I am not suggesting anything revolutionary. A few more obstacles and perhaps some variety to the planet (or add more than one planet).  Achievements do not do it for me and did not add to the game.  For < 1 dollar, this game can be recommended. Not for the full price.			"

I originally thought it was just some sort of Touhou clone and almost gave up on it immediately, but decided to play it through.I'm glad I did, however, as it was a genuinely good puzzle platformer.I hated the character design and to 100% the game is incredibly unforgiving, but all in all, the puzzles were well designed and while the game did not have a concrete ending, it was still an incredibly entertaining game.I give this ♥♥♥♥in' game a 7.4/10			"

												I've never played a game that put such a huge smile on my face in a long time. The Levels are cleverly made, the music is cool and catchy, and I just overall had a really good time with this one. Short game, But it makes up for it by going back and getting those pesky hidden artifacts and look for the secret screens.I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this game. Definitely pick this up.			"

												I liked this game, but it's incredibly short as lenght, which is a negative trait in a metroidvania (which this game hardly qualify as, though).On my first playrun, I managed to finish it in 30 minutes, even if I didn't go to do the 100% completion rate.Considering that so far I know there are no alternative endings or bonuses for collecting everything at 100%, I do not believe it's worth the hassle to do so. (especially as you may have to go around the planet 2/3 times to get all the things)So, let's get to rating...Music: 8Good music, good sound effects, but nothing to write home about. Enjoyable.Gameplay: 7This game has been dealing well with the whole teleporting gun jig. Sometimes confusing, but in the end it was fun.Graphics: 8Good pixel art in there, though not the best one I have ever seen. Still, executed greatly.Replay value: 4There is no big reasons to keep going much further if not to get the 100% (for completionists). This one has been lacking in both duration -and- replay value. Good for players that are completionists, but nothing else.Total: 6,75A good title with interesting mechanics, but way too short. "

												This game can be pretty enjoyable for a few hours, and it's somewhat memorable. I'll go over its notable aspects here.StoryThe story is pretty much as basic as it can get, cliché even. However, I was satisfied with how they handled it in implementation. Whoever designed the story segments was well aware that nobody would care. Instead of shoving some bland exposition down your throat while you slump lifelessly over your keyboard and wonder if playing through this game is a commitment you're willing to make, it provides the story in short, quickly skippable (or quickly readable) lines of text. You can get through it in a few seconds, and you're not missing much if you ignore it entirely. The gist is that you're a spaceman on a foreign planet and need to kill some guy. Narrative gold.GraphicsThe pixel art isn't bad. It's not anything special. It's not too repetitive. Sprites gel pretty well with each other, but tile sprites stick strictly to their square shape and corners aren't adorned in any way to reduce the jaggedness of such defined tiles. All of the main character's animations are so beautifully fluid, though, and the walking animation is adorable.AudioThe music is pretty average. Sometimes it gets better, but it gets redundant and loses its charm as it loops. In the game's store page description, it throws around names such as Cave Story. If they're going to tote around a reference to a game like that, I think it's only fair to interpret that as a standard to hold their game to. It falls abysmically below this standard.ControlsControls feel fine and function as intended. Some precision is required, but it's not unforgiving.MechanicsThis is the good bit. The game is based on traversing through puzzles using a simple mechanic: You can fire projectiles horizontally. When these projectiles impact something, you are teleported to the point of impact. Combine this with precision platforming and quick thinking, and you can pull off some neat stunts. New objects are introduced that add more depth to the puzzles. For example, there are colored beams that can destroy, obstruct, or even redirect your shots. These can be toggled by switches or obstructed by objects. I think the store page description's comparison of this game to Portal is actually pretty fair. While the mechanics and dimensionality are different, they require the same kind of problem solving and reflex. The teleportation gun is ineffective as a weapon, however, which brings us to...CombatAt first, you have to avoid enemies entirely because you lack a means of removing them. At some point, your character aquires a new tool: a firearm. Now, the first thing you'd want to do is go out and start packing heat at anything that looks like it could accommodate a few bullets, but you'd soon find out that your shiny new baby isn't very empowering. There are only a few types of enemies. Some exist to serve as barriers in the puzzles, and your weapon is only a tool for removing them. The rest exist just so that there are enemies. They're usually not challenging or unique, but I suppose they do add some variance. You can collect hidden items to increase the number of hits you can take, but health isn't really something that needs to be managed. Other than the boss battle, the combat isn't explored past this.I'd like to point out that the store page description also points to Super Metroid, and again interpret such a reference as justification to compare these games both ways. Again, it's not even a close comparison.At the end, you have to utilize both your teleport gun and firearm to battle the main antagonist by moving around the room to dodge attacks and position yourself to have a clear shot. This part is actually quite well done, but I was not at all prepared for what came next. That's covered in...Level Design and ProgressionPuzzles can be pretty creative. They're typically not too difficult, and checkpoints are generous enough to ensure that you're not getting frustrated about replaying the same sections. Puzzles frequently introduce new ways to utilize the tools that you already have, rarely feeling repetitive. If you're observant and think a little more to get to alternate paths, you can get rewarded with items, even if they're not always useful. The puzzles are overall satisfying and engaging.The largest and ugliest flaw of this game is its length. When I reached the end, I was unsure if I was just misinterpreting what was going on. It was just so absurdly short. It was a decent ride, though.Now, I'd like to explain how it pulls off this ending. In the last section, I mentioned a boss battle in which you use what you've gained to take out the main antagonist. After he's defeated, you get out of there, walk a screen or two, and then it slams into you so unnervingly hard. Suddenly, the quite enjoyable puzzle platformer I was playing now has me careening through space in my ship, toe to toe with another.I am now suddenly playing a side-scrolling shoot 'em up sequence. There is no similar puzzle mechanic or anything. There's just dodging and mashing to spam bullets. I personally do not enjoy shmups. I barely play them, and when I do, they do not entertain me. I didn't know that I was in for this when I played through a puzzle-oriented ""action platformer,"" as the store page describes it.Anyway, maybe I just suck at these things, but I didn't have the motivation to power through that final boss battle. I got someone else to help me out with the mashing part, just for the sake of completion.RatingI've decided to rate this game positively for two reasons: I picked it up on sale for a nice price, and the majority of the game's mechanics and level design were pleasant and impressive.TL;DRI originally intended for this to be brief, but yet again, I rambled far too long. Basically, the only good selling point is the great puzzle-based gameplay. The game is incredibly short (a few hours at best), so it's best to pick it up on sale. I wouldn't advise paying for it at full price unless you're an afficionado for this stuff.			"

												K, I finished it. Its a great little game. Because Im a cheapskate, I like games to pay only for games that are replayable but I got it at a major sale of 96% off, (19 cents). Because the game is only 1.5 to 2 hours long, I would not reccomend it for full price of 5.00$. As a game itself though, it was great! Its a mixture of the old style look of games like metroid and a little of a Portal like idea.  A great strategy game, kept me on the edge of my seat. Not extremely frustrating, but at times not easy at all. I Loved It! I would only reccomend it though at a most pricepoint of 3.00$ in my opinion, but if your bored and you got an extra five bucks, dive in! I love how it switches from strategy to (for a very short time) a galactica type of game. I actually wish they would expand it so that say you would need to go onto different planets, gather parts and then launch back up where you would again engage mid space. AMAZING SOUNTRACK, SO CATCHY!!! I LOVE IT!!! WHERE CAN I BUY IT?! Great Little Game! (-1 due to full price evaluation) 9/10			"

												It's a really nice, little game. The pixel art is interesting through adding little effects here and there, like how the background is always moving, yet it's not distracting. It makes a cool visual. The game's setting has an oddly not-so-desolate, metroid-like, planet as a setting, which I'm also a big fan of. Another thing I enjoyed was that all the NPC's were nice little guys, and came some interesting lines, if you went the distance to talk to them. The soundtrack is also really nice, it fits the space theme without being boring. The puzzles (stages that have you use a portal gun to advance) were difficult, but never so hard that I gave up. That was a big one for me, and it probably had to do with how well you could see the puzzle in whole, and the simple mechanics. I really love the puzzles. The story is... not very exisistent. There is some bad guy, Grigori (ugly fellow), who is a total jerk, he blew up your ship, you wreck, so now you have to find him on this planet you wrecked on (I don't know why the bad guy is there, I think we were trying to go to the planet to attack him, buy it's not well explained). It does provide an objective, but it isn't very complicated. In whole, I bought the game for $0.16 (an awesome price), and was surprised. However, the game is really short. My 3 hours were all I needed to beat the game. But, if you're okay with short games, it's a lovely experience. I was only upset at the length to be honest. It feels incomplete,  like a greenlight game. I really want more cool puzzles and funny creatures, but then the games over. I also beleive that with more time it could have a neat little plot to help tie the story together. I just want more. An update with a story that goes somewhere (maybe to other planets) would solve all my issues with this game. There are collectables and an achievement for completing the game under an hour, which make the game more replayable in its defense, but it just won't fill the void.			"

												A nice little platformer game that combines a Portal-like idea with 2D platforming genre. It took me 2 and a half hours to beat it, though there are achievements to beat it under an hour and to beat it under 20 minutes. That may sound short, and I have no idea how one is supposed to beat this game under 20 minutes, but for what this game is, it could have been bad if it lasted longer. Overall, this game is good and quite fun.Side note: There are two 2D space shooting segments, one at the beginning of the game and one as a second (last) phase of the final boss fight. Keep in mind that this game *is* a 2D platforming game, so don't get confused, angry, discouraged or something else like that when you find yourself in space. It's okay.			"

												It only took me about 73 minutes to beat so it isn’t terribly long. It's also not really that difficult either. Lastly I have no idea of where Super Metroid comes on to this I was expecting a Metroidvania with lots of weapons and hidden stuff and the like. However even though the game was completely different from what I thought it was, I was pleasantly surprised with how much fun I’m having with it, and my only complaint is that I’d like it to be longer.

												I bought this game without reading the description or reading reviews, because it was a 19 cent game that i could sell the cards of to get my money back. I like free things. As a result, i expected a trashy rouge-like or something, but i was pleasantly surprised by how it was actually a puzzle platformer.After reading the description, i have to agree that the game is like a 2d platformer version of portal in the way it uses the simple mechanic of teleporting with conserved momentum to complete interesting puzzles. The secrets were well hidden, and i got almost all of them until i exited the area to turn in the secrets accidentally, and couldnt get back because i activated a check point.The game took around 2 hours of gameplay to complete, and it was definitely worth 19 cents. To be honest, i would probably say its worth the 5 dollars too, since it was a hell of a good 2 hours.			"

												Readers, please keep in mind my reviews are a hundred percent subjective. I got this game gifted. I found the mechanics original but felt like seeing glitched textures very early when I tried it. It doesn't really seem to be normal white square in some places. I'm not a big fan of space adventures neither so much of shoot them all games but there are always chances for original exeptions to occur. Super metroid is an exeption in my tastes that I enjoy playing but I am not a fan at all of megaman or Metal Slug (from which I do enjoy at least the work on animation) though they are references for a certain amount of players. I wouldn't say it's a bad game but I'm not sure to find much entertainement in it to my concern unfortunately. It's important for this kind of game to show flawless design nowadays to be enjoyable. Although I give it a positive vote I do not enjoy it much yet. I'm not fan of minimalism or drab graphics (unless it would correspond to a choice that would help immersion like horror or a bit psychological or mental insanity) such as Risk of rain either unless there would be various worlds and that's why I will prefer games like Wings of Vi (very nice mix of difficulty a bit of gore and attractive design that is unsurprisely very successfully working on me) or Shantae or Fidding Teddy 2 where I appreciate the gameplay feeling and the atmosphere as well as the games it is inspired from. Any games that refer too much to realistic gun crafting and certain kinds of propaganda will highly increase chances to earn my dislike. Actually it's hard to define what makes old school like games attractive. But there are some ingredients that will most often help to make them enjoyable to replay more than once. It still remains very subjective as we are not always in the mood for the same things as well as we don't want to eat the same things everyday.			"

												SPOILERS BELOWThis is a pretty good game.  It's solid most of the way through.  There is one downside though: The final battle.  While most of the game focuses on puzzle platforming, the very final battle (at least I think it's the final battle) takes all the concepts of your adventure, and it...  Throws them in the trash.  While the first Grigori battle actually focused on your abilities with the teleport gun, the final battle doesn't.  It puts you in a little space battle of Grigori's ship vs. your ship.  No teleport gun, just blasters.  What makes the final battle even more terrible is that the boss seems to have every cheap attack available: Spread shot, homing missiles, and a beam that takes up a large portion of the screen.  It's even more frustrating when they are all used at once.  This battle is the only reason I haven't finished the game.  Is this a cheap review?  Yes.  Do I reccomend the game?  Overall, yes.  Do I recommend completing/beating the game?  No, I don't.			"

												THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!Not a hardcore platformer, more like a puzzle portal-inspired platformer, i love the game it's amazing, the puzzles are well made, easy to solve but tricky to execute, the story is simple but the whole map and the platforming are just outstanding, This reminds me of VVVVVV because all screens have a name, reminds me of portal because of the teleport gun that conservates momentum and cave story for the ligh-hearted story with hardcore challenges that are just there (like speedrun the game in 20min D:It's a gem, i hope it's not a hidden one because it's just amazing, only down side could be that it's short, but i think it doesn't overstays it's welcome, it's a really good game and i didn't feel ripped off for a 1.5h experience because it was a really fun 1.5h unlike other games were you spend that time farming, this has none of that.EDIT: second playthrough, got more achievements, this is awesome!<3			"

												I played through the whole game thinking I explored every possible nook and cranny, only to find I had only gotten as far as 50/87 of the possible screens in the game :P This game is in a typical arcade style which is pretty fun. What I like is that if you're only in it to beat the game, you can do so in under 20 minutes (it's actually one of the achievements) and it won't affect your gameplay. However, if like me you feel like you need to complete the whole game and collect every possible object there is you can do that too, plus it gives you some more puzzles to solve. I bought this game on sale for €0.19 and after having played it I would have probably payed up to about €0.50 for it. Don't buy it for the full price, but it's well worth a go on sale :) Very entertaining			"

												Very short cute game. You can finish it in two hours. Graphics is not bad, but not incredible. Mechanics with jumping and teleporting make the game enjoyable. Story very shalow. Villain attacks your side, you have to go after him all alone. We don't know who your side is. Could be evil intergalactic empire populated by good ordinary people doing their jobs and the villain a freedom fighter who dares to defy the ruling empire. Of course he is used to being on the other side of the law so he looks like a pirate and its given him a bad rep. While you the hero are  a overzealous enforser of the said empire and you don't see how in the long run the empire is trampling on the lowest developed worlds while the prosperous worlds keep getting prosperous. Like I said shalow story, lost potential. Get the game at a discount and it doesn't matter its short. TL;DR Fun platformer game. Very short. Find it on a discount and buy it.			"

												In addition to all the other helpful reviews, I just want to add that Out There Somewhere is a well balanced game, not too hardcore, and the achievements are not painful but with a nice difficulty, if you're inclined to find all the powerups and stuff and go for 100% completion. Steam tells me it took me 9 hours, that was with several runs focusing on different achievements over the course of a few months and I enjoyed it. Going through the game to see the ending takes about 1 to 1,5 hours on an average person's first playthrough, maybe more if you get stuck, but there are guides on Steam and on youtube just in case. The quick run achievement has a 20 minutes time limit, and that leaves quite some room for errors. Still it feels like an achievement when you did it. :)The game never crashed and ran absolutely without performance problems on both my desktop (Win7 64bit) and an older singlecore laptop (Win7 32bit).

												     This game, wow. I have never played a platformer as innovative like this. Takes the idea of Portal, but on a 2D scale. In my short time of playing it, I was already stumped on some puzzles. Never frustrated, well, maybe a small bit, as I am terrible with platformers.     Gameplay is original, fun, relaxing, and has a cool side-scrolling fighting bit at the beginning until you completley fail and crashland on an alien planet, filled with danger around every corner.        Would I reccomend this game? Hell. Yes. It's a super fun side-scrolling platformer. If you're looking for nothing more than that, I cannot reccomend this game enough. "

												Love it. It`s like Portal meets Metroid. You are a lone astronaut that crashed on an unknown planet where you have to survive by thinking you way through many platforming puzzles, armed only with your trusty teleport gun. The 2D perspective is key here and thanks to the clear 16 bit graphics these 2 create an excellent contrast and dimension for navigation puzzles. The soundtrack is amazing and keeps your blood flowing and your brain working. And your brain should keep working cause puzzles start easy and tend to get harder with each new screen passing. A must play for any fans of Portal or platformer puzzle games.			"

												It was pretty short (will probably take you about 45 min to 1 1/2 hours) which is why I would recommend putting it on your wishlist and waiting for it to go on sale (I got it for like $0.19).  Besides the overall length of the game the gameplay was actually way fun and the puzzles were very well thought out and difficult due to time and effort put into them, rather than just being annoyingly hard like many games.  Great game, and if it had maybe 1 or 2 more hours of playtime I would say it was worth that full $5.00 price.  Honestly for $0.19 I was super surprised and loved it because honestly I was expecting a giant pile of horse♥♥♥♥♥♥for that price!			"

												I liked this game, but it's incredibly short as lenght, which is a negative trait in a metroidvania (which this game hardly qualify as, though).On my first playrun, I managed to finish it in 30 minutes, even if I didn't go to do the 100% completion rate.Considering that so far I know there are no alternative endings or bonuses for collecting everything at 100%, I do not believe it's worth the hassle to do so. (especially as you may have to go around the planet 2/3 times to get all the things)So, let's get to rating...Music: 8Good music, good sound effects, but nothing to write home about. Enjoyable.Gameplay: 7This game has been dealing well with the whole teleporting gun jig. Sometimes confusing, but in the end it was fun.Graphics: 8Good pixel art in there, though not the best one I have ever seen. Still, executed greatly.Replay value: 4There is no big reasons to keep going much further if not to get the 100% (for completionists). This one has been lacking in both duration -and- replay value. Good for players that are completionists, but nothing else.Total: 6,75A good title with interesting mechanics, but way too short. "

Once you've figured out how momentum works with the teleporter, you can breeze through the game.There's a couple of side-scrolling bullet-hell shooting sections, which feel a little out of place, but it's a good time regardless. Grab it in a sale like I did (I think I paid about 15p!).			"

Wow! What a game! I picked up the game on sale whilst drunk one night thinking that myself and a mate of mine would have a grand ole time with this cheeky, pixel art, puzzle-platformer game. And I was absolutely correct. We started playing with the idea of recording a lets play of the first 15 minutes and ended up shirking off our other recordings to keep playing for another hour and a half. Out There Somewhere is a perfect blend of challenging puzzles, a simple yet intriguing game mechanic, and a wonderful amount of tongue-in-cheek humor that all together keeps your mind actively engaged and your funny bone throughly tickled. MiniBoss did a wonderful job with Out There Somewhere, and we definitely hope they look to expand the game or create more games like it! Definitely pick up the game, it is absolutely worth the ridiculously low price tag. If you are interested in watching some gameplay here is the playthrough series we uploaded:

												Got this game for 21 cents. Best deal ever!This game is like metriod meets a portal gun. Except a little diffrent. When you shoot your gun when the ""teleshot"" as the game calls it, hits a wall, you instantley teleport there. Sounds simple, huh? Well just like portal, it gets crazy. Your teleshot preserves movement, so if you fire and then jump at the last second, you will jump at that other place you just teleported to. This can be used to jump, fire, then as soon as you hit the ground jump again to do basically a double jump. Theres also a bunch more mechanics as well, such as 3 diffrent beams, enemies, glass and wood, mirrors, and a bunch of other stuff. Also the achievments are pretty challanging (all but one) to get and can add hours of gameplay if you're into that. Overall, great mechanic, great soundtrack, love the metriod style, and challanging achievments. 9/10.Edit: theres a HUGE difficulty spike at the final boss, one misclick and you're screwed. Thought i'd mention that.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a game that feels like an homage to action platformer games like Cave Story and Metroid. It is on the short side of gameplay (about an hour or two), but I had fun the entire time and wanted more when it was over. It also has plenty of hard-to-reach areas with secrets that require some prior planning and well-timed actions once you have a feel for it on your first playthrough. It is a great game that brings back memories of early platformers with some new, creative elements of its own.I'd highly recommend this game to anyone with a couple of hours to spare and a desire to play something that's just plain fun.

While this game is indeed short [my first run through was about 1 hour and 50 minutes or so], it is extremely well-made. This game heavily reminds me of Cave Story, and my only regret is not buying it at full price to further support the developers. The main gameplay mechanic, a teleportation gun, is unique and implemented very well! Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys platformers, puzzle games, catchy chiptunes, or any combination of the three.			"

												Best forty-nine cents I've ever spent on a game. I didn't realize it would be so short, but what do you expect for half a dollar?It's the perfect mix between semi-punishing and forgiving with the constant saves and easy of reloading. Great graphics, engaging music, easy to learn mechanics, I just wish there was more game. Here's to hoping for a sequel or more episodes.			"

												It's a nice example of that style of room based puzzle platformer where there's a save point in each room and a hint about how to approach the puzzle.Despite the fact that it has a continous world and may require some backtracking and ability gates, it's basically nothing at all like Cave Story or Metroid in terms of overall gameplay, so don't buy it expecting a Metroidvania.It's cheap though, so why not give it a go?

												This game is wonderfull. It's the game i've been looking for.Out There Somewhere is a puzzle platformer, with a cool mechanic: You can teleport, which makes for some fun and challenging puzzles, along with the tons of secrets scatterd throughout the game. Its simple, its fun, the music is great and i really like the artwork.The only complaint I have is that its quite short, but hopefully we will some day see a Out There Somewhere 2. (Please?)This game is worth it. 1 dollar? ♥♥♥♥ yes!			"

												Great retro game. The music is great. The levels are well designed and all feel different. It has some two pretty hard puzzles but the rest are more about thinking it through. The only problem is how short it is; its super shorts you can easily beat in under an hour and get that achievement.. i only missed it by a few minutes and i left it on to get the 8 mins afk achievement... kind of wish i read them all before doing it... i really wish it was long as its such a great game.

												As far as retro, pixel-art platformers go this one is well made. It's a bit easier than genre average, but last screens are definetely not too easy. It has great chiptune music score and that is its strongest point, as it seems to overuse single gameplay mechanic and generally doesn't feature so much content. Thankfully it does not recycle rooms or puzzles and the game ends before it gets boring.			"

												A pleasant surprise of a game that I bought on super sale. Not really a Metroidvania, more a puzzle-platformer with a bit of exploration thrown in. The main mechanic - a teleport gun - is mined for all its worth. When I finished my first playthrough I was eager to take on the challenge achievements.Don't be thrown off by the R-Type opening sequence. It's easily the game's weakest feature and not representative of the quality spritework in the main game. Overall a solid game well worth its low price.			"

The achievements certainly gave replayability as quite a few forced you to be skilled with the warp/jump mechanic and explore the map!  I would certainly enjoy more content or a sequel in the future. Bottom-line: It is worth purchasing! "

												Out There somewhere is a realy cool game.I love pixel art and challenges. This game have both!Pretty basic story but interesting gameplay.The game design is overall very good but the levels design does not make sense as it feels like ""blocks arts"" are placed at random. The platform serves the design while it should be the design who serves the platform (Does it make sense ? Guess you know what I mean ;) )A little too dark. Sometime you don't see correctly the edges which can be annoying...Some achievements can be tricky but not that impossible. Good point.The musics are cool, too !Count 2h gameplay on a first run. For a 1$ game : totally worth it !			"

And for the same price as a bottle of Tesco Value Cola, you've got yourslelf a keeper of a game.Pros:- Soundtrack kicks da butts- puzzles are just the right difficulty- nice amount of little extras in there too for replayabilityCons:- Game isn't long enough!Don't get me wrong, this game is a nice length, I managed to complete it in under an hour, but the game gets so fun you WISH there was more to it. The story is simple - you crash, find your ship parts, stop the bad guy, you win. The really nice 16-bit graphics and music give this game such a nice retro touch! I LOVE this game, and I think I'll be replaying this at least a few times more. On a side note: There needs to be a release of the soundtrack for this game, It's incredibly addicting.P.S. This game is so good, I bought copies for all my Steam friends.			"

												Out there somewhere is a simple yet interesting 2d retro platformer. It has some cool mechanics that are easy to understand but hard to master. The level design is good, the levels are moderately difficult while remaining mostly good looking. The music and sounds are reminiscent of the sounds of old 8-bit and 16-bit titles, allmost to an anoying extent. The main selling point of this game however, for me, was the incredibly low price. Get this on sale if you have 20 cents to spend.			"

Even though it's a short game, for the price you can get it for right now, which is 19 cents, it's more than worth it. Plus you get trading cards that you can sell on the market.By the way, for all the achievement hunters out there, once you master the game's mechanics I think you'll find that if you replay it, you'll know how to get to areas you hadn't been to before, so that's totally worth checking out. I love secrets. Don't you?			"

Lastly I have no idea of where Super Metroid comes on to this I was expecting a Metroidvania with lots of weapons and hidden stuff and the like. However even though the game was completely different from what I thought it was, I was pleasantly surprised with how much fun I’m having with it, and my only complaint is that I’d like it to be longer.

												Simple gameplay leading to a much deeper gaming experience than you may think.There are a few challenging mechanics to master if you're going to make it to the end, but they're not too tricky, and it's well worth it.There are also plenty of secrets that most players won't find on their first playthrough. Exploration is very strongly rewarded. There's also achievements for beating things extremely quickly, giving goals and motives for multiple playthroughs. This game was purchased for 19 cents. I easily got $5 worth of fun and entertainment out of it.			"

												Let's go back to Mario!No, it's not a game about jumping in turtles heads or eating mushroons. Games today lack something that boomed the industry in the late 80's and 90's: guts to deliver what the developer thinks its good, not what the developer thinks that the buyers like. It have creativity.The same creativity to go throught the levels, to ajust the mechanics and the many ways you can use the georgeos teleport gun takes us back to the time where it did not matter how life-like the graphycs are, or how many NPCs you can kill. It's about the journy inside the 0's and 1's and how you, as a player will adapt and master the game.10/10Out There Somewhere it's one of the best plataform games i have ever played.			"

												Fun, but extremely short. Its tag line of games that inspired it is quite apt. Puzzles are challenging and make you think about the portal gun (which works differently enough from Portal's to feel like it isn't a pixelated ripoff) in different ways. Combat is minimal, and the boss battle (singular) is kinda annoying, so it's really just the puzzles and the collectibles. But it's still fun for the less than 2hours it took me to beat it.			"

												I got this amazing game for $0.18.This is the cheapest game I've ever bought, yet it's fun as hell!You earn trading cards too, so you practically earn your money back with cards you can sell if you buy this game on sale.96% off of a game that's amazing! I love it.Pros:• Hours of fun!• Amazingly cheap on Steam Summer Sale! $0.18 (or $0.19 depending where you live)!• You get trading cards which you can craft badges from, or sell them and earn more money than what you paid for the game.• Levels don't seem repetitive as there are new items and mechanics that appear every so often.Cons:• Awkward controls and you can't change them.• No settings in pause menu. You can only change settings on the main menu.• The game just shows a black screen infinitely when you launch it after you've bought it. You have to reboot/restart your computer in order to play the game for the first time.• The friendly aliens that you can talk to have no purpose except sometimes revealing information while most of the times they say something utterly useless.• Too difficult at some points. I just rage quit because I can't complete a level, lol.The cons aren't that bad. I bloody love this game!It's a crime for a game so good to be so cheap, even on Steam Summer Sale.			"

												Out There Somewhere is a nice puzzle platformer that genuinely feels like a mix of Cave Story and Portal. The game is pretty short - and it's fully possible to beat it within 20 minutes, which is one of the game's hardest challengest - but there's a bunch of things to collect that provides replay value. I got it for 17 cents when it was on sale, but it's honestly worth the money whatever the price.The music works with the setting and the graphics are done well and the gameplay is fair, but challenging. My only complaint is the shooting segments. While it's not hard to pick up on, it really clashes with the rest of the game's gameplay, and the fact that it's the final fight bizarre since your only experience with such segments is at the very beginning. But overall though, it's a great cheap game.			"

As a result, i expected a trashy rouge-like or something, but i was pleasantly surprised by how it was actually a puzzle platformer.After reading the description, i have to agree that the game is like a 2d platformer version of portal in the way it uses the simple mechanic of teleporting with conserved momentum to complete interesting puzzles. The secrets were well hidden, and i got almost all of them until i exited the area to turn in the secrets accidentally, and couldnt get back because i activated a check point.The game took around 2 hours of gameplay to complete, and it was definitely worth 19 cents. To be honest, i would probably say its worth the 5 dollars too, since it was a hell of a good 2 hours.			"

												Readers, please keep in mind my reviews are a hundred percent subjective. I got this game gifted. I found the mechanics original but felt like seeing glitched textures very early when I tried it. It doesn't really seem to be normal white square in some places. I'm not a big fan of space adventures neither so much of shoot them all games but there are always chances for original exeptions to occur. Super metroid is an exeption in my tastes that I enjoy playing but I am not a fan at all of megaman or Metal Slug (from which I do enjoy at least the work on animation) though they are references for a certain amount of players. I wouldn't say it's a bad game but I'm not sure to find much entertainement in it to my concern unfortunately. It's important for this kind of game to show flawless design nowadays to be enjoyable. Although I give it a positive vote I do not enjoy it much yet. I'm not fan of minimalism or drab graphics (unless it would correspond to a choice that would help immersion like horror or a bit psychological or mental insanity) such as Risk of rain either unless there would be various worlds and that's why I will prefer games like Wings of Vi (very nice mix of difficulty a bit of gore and attractive design that is unsurprisely very successfully working on me) or Shantae or Fidding Teddy 2 where I appreciate the gameplay feeling and the atmosphere as well as the games it is inspired from. Any games that refer too much to realistic gun crafting and certain kinds of propaganda will highly increase chances to earn my dislike. Actually it's hard to define what makes old school like games attractive. But there are some ingredients that will most often help to make them enjoyable to replay more than once. It still remains very subjective as we are not always in the mood for the same things as well as we don't want to eat the same things everyday.			"

												I was going through my games and I saw this one, which I had completely forgotten about. This game is really cool, idea wise and graphics wise and all that jazz.My playtime isn't particularly high because you know when you buy a lot of games on sale at once, and you give each of them a whirl and one or two stick out and you just kind of grind them while forgetting about the others? And then afterwards you kind of just never feel like playing the games you skipped out on again for no real reason? Even though you know they're fun and you'd enjoy it? Yeah, that is what happened here, sadly. Don't let the story make it sound like this game is boring or something, because it is really fun. I have no idea why I can't get back into it, but I think it's just that situation, since it seems to be pretty common (at least for me).Anyway, yes I recommend this game and yes it is pretty unique and a good puzzle experience.

While this game is indeed short [my first run through was about 1 hour and 50 minutes or so], it is extremely well-made. This game heavily reminds me of Cave Story, and my only regret is not buying it at full price to further support the developers. The main gameplay mechanic, a teleportation gun, is unique and implemented very well! Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys platformers, puzzle games, catchy chiptunes, or any combination of the three.			"

												The reason I got this game was because the cards from it sold for more than the game itself cost when it was on sale... I expected absolute garbage from the game, yet found myself pleasantly surprised. There's actually a pretty good little game in here, worthy of attention even if it's not on sale oddly enough.The basic concept is you start out in a rather limited 2D space shooter. You get shot down, fall to the planet, and then have to collect parts to repair your ship and escape. The writing's mediocre at best, and the plot's hardly anything to write home about, but the gameplay really does shine surprisingly well.You have three buttons, other than left/right. These are jump, fire a gun when you find it eventually, and fire a teleporter gun. This sounds simple. It's not. They actually put pretty good effort into coming up with some creative puzzles that take a bit of thought to overcome with these few tools.Momentum's carried over, so if you fire a teleport shot, and it has enough time to travel, you can jump upward as it hits and keep going up from where you portal to. This is put to surprisingly good use with some really rather clever yet deceptively simple looking puzzles.Toss in a bit of exploration and some hidden goodies, advanced stuff and bonuses scattered around, and it's actually not a bad game at all.Yeah, the story sucks. Yeah, the dialgue is awful. Yeah, it's only about an hour long from start to finish. But you know what? It's CHEAP. And to be blunt, the gameplay itself is good enough to ignore all that and just sit down to a fun little puzzle game that vaguely has some ever so slight similarities to metroid.I can actually recommend this game at full price. It's actually worth it. Just don't expect it to have good writing is all. =P			"

												If you're tight on cash and looking for a relatively quick fix that's worth your time, look no further, this is the game to buy. The difficulty level is high enough that it'll take a good few runs before you're able to truly complete the game at 100% but it isn't so hard that you'll wanna uninstall immediately after not getting how to double jump (it takes a little practice). The cutscenes, as few as there may be, are fun to read and that might be primarily because the art is gorgeous in all of its pixel format glory and the story is executed well enough. Admittedly, I was a little reluctant to play the game given the price (I'm sure we've all made that lousy, cheap purchase and regretted it before) but this is not the case. The low price tag is a bonus. So, if you purchase this game and didn't enjoy it quite like you thought you would, I would like to know what spoilt it for you seeing as my experience with the game so far have exceeded my expectations but a long run. TL;DRThis is a great game and for its price, it's a steal.			"

												It took 7 minutes for me to be absolutely bored and not wanting to play this ever again. It's not a bad game, just not something I'm going to spend time playing. Maybe just not my genre anymore. If you like this genre your miles may vary.Curiousity at 19 cents. Did I get my moneys worth? YES. It was totally worth under a quarter.			"

												Let me open by saying this game is cheap, but is it worth the price tag?Yup.I recently played(and reviewed) a similar puzzle platformer, VVVVV or some nonsense, which I didn't find was to my liking.  As such I had some apprehension about Out There Somewhere.  I'll tell you that was some misplaced anxiety.  This game has a teleport mechnic that allows it to progress beyond simple muscle reflex puzzles and actually assess all the factors on a screen before proceeding with a solution.  After I completed the game, I felt satisfied.  I felt like I had accomplished some pretty interesting puzzle platforming, and I felt like I kind of wanted to play it through again.All that being said, this game isn't very long.  I don't know how much time I spent playing it, currently, but I think it was about an hour(Edit: 54 mins...)  which was actually perfect since I was on a flight and after I finished we were close to landing.  I see myself playing this again on my return trip and probably enjoying it just as much.One interesting thing I noticed in the options was the feature to turn on a timer, which seems an interesting little contraption to let you time your runs.  There's also a few areas I can think of where I may have been able to explore but they were early in the game before I really learned the capabilities of the teleporter gun.That's another bit that's interesting.  They don't throw new items at you through the game to make places accessible, with the exception of a gun near the beginning.  Anything you are able to accomplish late game with the teleporter you can do at the start... provided you grasp the concept fast enough.  The gun you obtain later is really only to destroy blocks and enemies, but it seemed to me (nearly) every screen could potentially be accomplished without killing a single enemy.The last bit I'll mention is that I played this game entirely on the Steam Controller, I've yet to find a platformer that doesn't work well with it, but I'll say playing a game on the plane was MUCH more comfortable with a controller in hand, rather than playing the part of a contortionist to access the keyboard wedged in front of me, though this is just commentary and doesn't affect my review of the game. Addition: OK, so since I was in an airplane and didn't pay for wifi, steam didn't register the time I'd played the game and wouldn't let me post a review with 0 minutes logged.  I started up a new game and can confirm in the 12 minutes of extra play time I found 3 screens I didn't even register existed on my first play through within the 'tutorial' section of the game.  So if you happen to be an achievement collector, or just like the game you can easily double that hour play time going through with a replay. Its worth the standard price(which is cheap as it is,) but if you find this game on sale, don't hesitate to nab it if you enjoy puzzle games or plaformers.  It's got some interesting mechanics.			"

												This is the BEST game in it's genre, it reminded me of old games where gameplay was hardcore and tricky. The storyline perfectly fits into the world design and that awesome soundtrack. It was pity that i didn't play this game for 5 months since bying, but now i like those hours i spent thinking on the puzzles, that were creatively made to make player think about his timing, actions, threats to avoid and possibilities to accomplish. I'd buy a sequel. 11/10.			"

												This game is exactly what it promisis to be. A perfect little indie puzzle platformer.8bit look and sound is ok. Puzzles are always challenging but never unfair. Thats exacly what makes this game that good. Aswell it needs skill and brain in the same measure to clear the stages.Game plays perfect with the xbox gamepad and couldnt find any bugs at all.Its very short though, only a few hours on first playthrough. But on a sale this is a steal.89%			"

Portal+Meat Boy in Space!!!SummaryWithout giving too much away, you play as an astronaut and your ship crashes. Then you must find parts to repair your ship. You have a teleport gun with teleports you where the bullet hits. Some parts are super difficult(hence the Meat Boy reference).OpinionI haven't beaten this yet but it's awesome. My only complaint is the controller support for my PS4 controller is messed up. The jump button fires the pistol thing(I forgot the name) at the same time.Verdict8/10Awesome game with tons of achievements and mechanics, with some controller support issues. If they were to fix this, it would be a perfect 10.			"

												Absolutely amazing platformer. got it on sale for 19p but in essence, it's a really short, immensely fun game. The controls are a bit tricky, especially how to use the teleport gun at first, but once you get the hang of it you'll be jumping around in no time. All in all, I'd give it a solid 9/10, would get 10 but it is a bit short.			"

												Really great, if short, puzzle platformer which unfortunately has an extreemely hard bullet hell tacked on the end, and technically the beginning. Gets pretty challenging without being unfair (aside from the bullet hell part).For the bullet hell part, if you're looking to beat it I suggest using an controller with analog sticks, as that extra precision makes it just a tad more possible.

												This game is so much fun. Puzzles, a bit of jumping technique, achievements one can actually get to 100%, and a speed running community. Yes, after you have played the game and thoroughly beaten it, the game still has replay value (hence why this game has 14 hrs in it, and not 6 ish). They need to make a sequel, this game has the potential to have much more content. If not, make a level editor avaliable, that is a great way to build the community. 9/10, because the npcs look like snakes with noses.			"

												Definitely a good value for its price, especially if you get it on sale (which seems to happen frequently). Though definitely a short game, it ought to entertain for The few hours that you spend with it. The puzzles are nowhere near rage-inducingly difficult but very satisfying to solve, as they should be. The controls are responsive and reliable, so you'll suffer few to no cheap deaths. As a puzzle platformer, Out There Somewhere provides a strong enough gameplay framework that I would gladly play a much longer game in its style.But, as previously stated, it is a very short game. Playing at a natural pace, I attained my first completion in just over 40 minutes. Fortunately, there are several hidden screens and items, but even so, full completion shouldn't take more than a handful of hours.Oh, and just to put it out there, the boss in the intro cannot be beaten, as awesome as it would have been to beat the game without even starting it.

												Overall, this game is a fun experience! It's short, but at the price you can't really knock it for that. It's got a decent amount of replayability, especially if you want to find all the secrets and get all the achievments. It took me around 5 hours to get all the achivements, but anyone playing this just to play it will probably find themselves done in around an hour. The biggest thing I have against the game is that at one point it just switches from a platformer to a shmup, which wasn't a fun time for me, especially since it was a rather hard area. It's only one area, but in a game this small, that can be a huge downturn for me.If you're looking for a good hour or two of exploring around and platforming and puzzle solving, this game will get that itch from ya.

												Out There Somewhere is a 2D Adventure, Puzzle platformer developed and published by MiniBoss.The beginning starts like a retro space game and after that your plane crashes on planet Unknown and take on the journey to repair your plane. In every stage of the game there are puzzles to be solved.I bought it an year ago for about 0.15€ & since then you needed about 40-50 minutes to get the trading cards, I played, got them and uninstalled. But lately I've been struggling to find a good game that I haven't played (a lot) & this was one of the cheap games that was actually very good, so I gave it a try. After I completed the game, I can say that I am impressed from it.Pros:Retro graphicsPuzzles (every puzzle is different from the other)Teleport gun mechanicGood soundtrackCheapCons:Very short (about an hour average time)Combat (It's quite meh imo)TL; DRFan of retro, 2D, puzzle games? Then this game is for you and even in full price, the game is worth it!			"
